	<P>I have notice from Senator Eugene Regan that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Finance to provide in the Finance Bill 2009 for phased payment arrangements for overdue stamp duty in the case of individual taxpayers who face financial difficulties in the current economic climate.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Fidelma Healy Eames of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to outline the educational thinking and approach he recommends so that two teachers can effectively teach English to 154 foreign national children in Scoil Mhuire, Oranmore, County Galway, and if he will reverse his decision to withdraw two EAL teachers.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Cecilia Keaveney of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Health and Children to clarify the strategy in place to pre-empt the expected explosion in the numbers presenting with diabetes and to minimise that potential.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>The Order of Business is No. 1(<i>a</i>), Adoption Bill 2009 &mdash; Report Stage, to be taken at the conclusion of the Order of Business and to adjourn not later than 5.30 p.m., if not previously concluded; and No. 29, Private Members&rsquo; motion No. 32 regarding the lack of business confidence, to be taken at 5.30 p.m. and to conclude not later than 7.30 p.m.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I take the business of the Seanad, namely, our discussions, debates and the work we do, very seriously.  I am outraged at the idea that this House did not meet yesterday to facilitate a game of golf.  That is simply not acceptable.  The public is so disillusioned that we had pensioners throwing eggs at the AIB board at its EGM in Dublin today.  People are unemployed.  It is simply not acceptable that there is a story out there that this House did not meet yesterday to facilitate a game of golf.</P>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to put that on record.  The first I heard of this is when a journalist called me last night to ask if we had agreed to the House not meeting to facilitate a game of golf.  Of course, that is not true.  Last week in this House I called for debates on the protection of children.  I called for debates on the amendment to the Constitution on children.  My colleagues called for debates on a range of topics.  I have a list of discussions, debates and legislation we wish to bring to the floor of this House.  That could have been done yesterday.  There are 84 amendments to the Adoption Bill.  They could have been discussed yesterday.  The first I heard of the Seanad not meeting on Tuesday was also yesterday.  Who made a decision that this House was not going to meet on Tuesdays for the month of May?  That is the first I have heard of it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Last Thursday evening on a motion for the Adjournment, the House agreed that the next sitting of the Seanad would be today at 2.30 p.m.  Any objections to the proposed date should have been made at that time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to make it absolutely clear there was no discussion with the Opposition on the sitting date.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>The House decided.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>As far as I am aware, there have been no discussions with me or anyone else on this side of House.</P>

	<P>I want to make clear that there were no discussions&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;about the changes to the Tuesday sittings.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>That is the problem, they were not.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>There were no discussions about the changes to Tuesday sittings.  The Leader stated to the media that the Seanad will not sit on Tuesdays in the month of May.  Is there no legislation coming from the Government?  Is there no business coming from the Government?  Are there no debates on the list, in spite of the many debates that we have called for here, including debates on the economy, that could have taken place yesterday or on other Tuesdays in this month.  I will put an amendment to the Order of Business to discuss the scheduling of work of the Seanad for the remainder of this term.</P>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>Small business representatives stated today that 48% of them could not get credit last year, and that this has risen to 58% this year.  Jobs are being lost all around us and we need to be debating these important issues, highlighting solutions and talking about the Fine Gael jobs plan in this House on a daily basis while we are sitting.  There is no need to cut the sittings of this House to two days.  If this is the way Fianna F&aacute;il is to run the <Col N="335"/>House, it is unacceptable.  It is little wonder people are fed up with the way it is running the country if this is the way this House is being run.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I support completely the points made by Senator Fitzgerald.  I was outside those gates at 7.25 a.m. yesterday waiting for them to open and I got home last night at 10 p.m.  That is no different from many other people in this House.  I worked a full day and took no notice of it, no more than do all the other people here.  To read in this morning&rsquo;s newspaper complimentary remarks on my game of golf yesterday is absolutely outrageous.</P>
        <P>I confirm what Senator Fitzgerald said.  As far as I am aware, there was no discussion with anybody on this side of the House about this decision.  The Cathaoirleach may well be correct about what was said at the end of business last week.  Leaders&rsquo; meetings, which take place once a week, have become irrelevant.  Private Members&rsquo; time was changed last week without consultation with us, even though it was our slot.  We had arranged for people to come in at that time and that created an embarrassment.  One of our people who was on the radio this morning was embarrassed by not knowing why we were not sitting yesterday.</P>
        <P>If we have reached a stage where the business of the House takes less precedence than a game of golf, we have lost it.  At a time when this House is under closer scrutiny than ever before, this brings it into disrepute.  If people want to take a couple of hours off to play golf, I have no problem with that as they work long hours, but my problem is with closing down the business of the House.  The statement that we do not sit on Tuesdays in May was apparently attributed to the Leader, but, from my diary, last year I spoke in this House on Tuesday, 13 May, Tuesday, 20 May and Tuesday, 27 May.  I am not sure about 6 May, but the idea that we do not sit on Tuesdays in May is another red herring and I do not accept it.  It indicates a certain arrogance, disrespect and disregard for the way we do our business.  I am embarrassed by it and the Leader should acknowledge that the House has been brought into disrepute in this regard.</P>
        <P>If there was some urgent reason from the Government not to sit yesterday, then we would have been prepared, as we always are, to co-operate.  There is a list of issues that needs to be discussed.  The Leader gave us a commitment that we would discuss the economic situation on a regular basis.  We could talk about other issues that have not been dealt with.  I am utterly disappointed at the way this House is being treated.  I will not seek to justify it to an audience outside.  We owe an apology to the people who elected us whom we represent and I would like a commitment that it will not happen again.</P>
        <P>There may be times when it is not reasonable or necessary to meet on a Tuesday, but that is not the issue.  The issue is about how this was done and the reasons for which it was done.  It is an embarrassment and it brings us into disrepute.  I am disappointed, Leader.  It makes a comedy of the idea of meetings of representatives of the groups each week because they mean nothing and they get us nowhere.  The Leader asked us for co-operation in the past few weeks and it takes a brass neck to ask one week for our co-operation, while the next week to change business and the following week to close the House for one day without discussion or agreement.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilPrendergast"><NameTxt>Senator Phil Prendergast</NameTxt>
	<P>I join with what previous speakers said in regard to yesterday&rsquo;s embarrassing incident.  I feel privileged to be a Member of this House and I am proud to be here representing viewpoints and doing what I need to do.  What happened yesterday is bad press that we do not need given the calls for reform of the Seanad.  This type of behaviour sends out the impression that we do not take our job seriously, which is wrong.</P>
        <P>The Health Service Executive published a report a few weeks ago on St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital and St. Michael&rsquo;s unit, St. Joseph&rsquo;s Hospital, Clonmel.  We must provide every resource neces<Col N="336"/>sary for our mental health service.  Members will be aware of the tragic events in respect of a family in Wexford, as published in a report this week.  Last week, I spoke about the befriending service in south Tipperary Hospital, the services of which are to be withdrawn as the &euro;20,000 funding it requires is unavailable.  By my reckoning, the cost to the State of supporting people unemployed as a result of this decision will be &euro;20,000.  I would like if serious consideration were given to mental health services and to the provision of necessary funding to allow people to avail of services that have proven cost effective.  The provision of this service ensures people do not have to seek more expensive treatments when a befriending service is not available to them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinBrady"><NameTxt>Senator Martin Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>Estate management fees is an issue raised regularly with me on the doorsteps.  I raised it in the D&aacute;il when a Member of that House.  Young people in the Dublin area who are struggling to pay mortgages are also being hit with exorbitant estate management fees of &euro;1,100-&euro;1,200 per annum, which is a rip-off.  This is nothing short of extortion.  There is very little management of estates taking place with some people having only a bin provided in respect of the fee paid.  I ask that the Leader invite the relevant Minister to the House to debate this issue.  Our young people are suffering enough without having this money extorted from them under false pretences.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>I am appalled and outraged at the media comment attributed to this House yesterday and in today&rsquo;s newspapers.  The approach is symptomatic of the manner in which the Government is running the country, namely, arrogant, out of touch and it does not care.  What message does this send out to, for instance, the woman I met yesterday who, despite having sent out 150 curriculum vitae&rsquo;s since the first Friday in January, has received no replies or interviews; the two people paying a mortgage of &euro;1,600 per month, both of whom have lost their jobs and are graduates of University College Cork; to the parents of a special need child whose home help hours have been cut or to the small and medium enterprises struggling to get credit?</P>
        <P>This House should sit on Tuesdays and should hold Ministers to account.  If the Leader cannot do his job, he should resign and let others do the job.  Go Leader, resign and let us debate issues of interest to the people.  I am appalled to have been contacted yesterday and today by journalists asking me how my game of golf went.  We are working on behalf of the people.  All of us are here to represent the people.  It is about time we put people first.  I do not know the reason the House did not sit yesterday.  I accept there may be days on which we have no legislation.  Is there a lack of legislation coming from Government?  We are here to represent the people.  This is the Upper House of Parliament and we are the people&rsquo;s representatives and must be their voice.  We need answers.  Also, we must hold Ministers to account.  The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment has not once since taking up that position come to this House to debate the issues of job creation or unemployment.  The Minister was in the House last week, although on a different matter.  We need answers on behalf of the people who are suffering, not pious platitudes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I take this opportunity to wish Michael Phelan, senior usher, every success on his retirement tomorrow.  He worked with distinction for 27 years in his House.  I wish him well and thank him for his service to the State.</P>
        <P>I ask the Leader to invite to the House the Minister of State with responsibility for housing for a debate on the rights and obligations of landlords and tenants in the context of repossession orders.  The Landlord and Tenant Act and the Residential Tenancies Act together with regulations assist parties in the case of disputes.  However, the legislation when enacted did not <Col N="337"/>anticipate a scenario of foreclosures by the banks and third parties, and interference with tenants&rsquo; rights.  This issue was brought to my attention by a young couple who are being evicted.  They pay rent to the landlord.  The landlord is being evicted from the property and he got no word whatsoever.  I cannot understand why the Private Residential Tenancy Board cannot be involved.  This person rented his property through Lowe &amp; Associates.  He received no notification and has been told to get out of the property.</P>
        <P>The sheriff has served notice that anyone in the property should get their personal belongings out of the building as quickly as possible.  In order for the sheriff to execute an ejectment order, the matter must have passed under the examination of the courts.  Judges should be aware that tenants have rights in their own regard.  They are not the people who have defaulted on the loans.  This man has paid approximately &euro;1,600 in advance payments.  He has no protection under the law.  We need to arrange a debate on the matter in the House.  In the present climate judges should bear in mind the tenants before signing an order for ejectment.</P>
        <P>In 30 years in the House, I never spoke to the city sheriff, but I spoke to him today.  I am asking him that in future he should check out the building before serving notice on the people involved.  There are 128,696 individual tenants all of whom feel unprotected in this regard.  In the circumstances we should have a discussion on the matter.  This young couple are practically being thrown out on the side of the road, not through their fault &mdash; they paid the rent to the landlord.  They do not even know the address of the landlord nor does the sheriff.  The judge obviously did not know the landlord&rsquo;s address.  The tenant does not know the address of the landlord and was not informed of the ejectment proceedings.  A note came in through the door to all concerned advising that they should take their possessions out or find themselves on the side of the road within two weeks.  In these circumstances&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a matter that would be suitable for discussion on the Adjournment </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;it would be worthy of debate in the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>If the Senator asks for it to be discussed on the Adjournment, he might well get what he wants.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator should have some respect for the Chair.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>This House would be well utilised in having such debates.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>On a number of occasions I have raised the topic of the waste of paper.  On a regular basis we all seem to receive an enormous amount of paper through the mail, which is no longer needed.  I was very impressed to receive today on DVD the report of the Irish Film Classification Office, which used to be called the Irish Film Censor&rsquo;s office.  It seems very sensible to avoid paper.  I ask the Leader to draw to the attention of the Minister responsible &mdash; I presume the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley &mdash; the need to reduce the amount of paper we all get, which would help the environment.</P>
        <P>While I am discussing the environment, I mention the horrific spate of deaths by poison of birds of prey that have been reintroduced to Ireland &mdash; the red kite in Wicklow, the white-tailed eagle in Kerry and the golden eagle in Donegal.  A number of them have been poisoned deliberately, which is a shame.  I am not sure what we should do about it.  We have lost face with those countries that gave us back these birds, including Norway, Scotland and Wales.  We have had that opportunity and we find that people are deliberately poisoning these birds, which is unacceptable.</P><Col N="338"/>
        <P>I played golf yesterday and I am sure the Leader will provide an answer in this regard.  However, I do not believe it is linked to the fact that Members did not work in this House yesterday.  While I will be accused of being biased, and perhaps I am, I believe the decision not to work yesterday also has been made a number of times in the past.  Therefore, when criticising the fact that Members did not work yesterday &mdash; I do not defend it &mdash; I am sure there was no particular work to be done on that day.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a bit thick.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I simply wish to state&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Why is there not such work?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Quinn, without interruption.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;I have heard the same views being expressed on occasions in the past, to the effect that Members have not been given more legislation by the Government and have spent time on statements instead of having legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>However, many debates have been called for.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>That is the Government&rsquo;s fault.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I believe that on that basis, there have been occasions when it has been wasteful of Members&rsquo; time to come into the Chamber and then disappear within a short time because legislation has not been presented to them by the Government.  I urge the Leader to ensure the Seanad has legislation with which to deal as there is not too long to go before the conclusion of this session.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Senator John Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I share the concerns expressed by my colleague, Senator Brady, regarding the excessive fees being charged by management companies.  This area undoubtedly requires regulation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Senator John Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>That at this difficult time young people could find themselves facing additional and increased charges when they can least afford is a matter the House could consider and debate with good merit.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the proposed amendment to the Order of Business to discuss the Seanad&rsquo;s programme of work because Members&rsquo; first duty is to the House to which they were elected.  Sadly, what happened yesterday was disrespectful and, given the manner in which it has come across, it could be taken to be disgraceful.  An apology should be issued because the Leader must work through consultation.  It is clear from what has been stated that as Leader of the House, he has let Members down.  There was no consultation, this House should have sat yesterday and there was no reason for it not do so do.</P>
        <P>With respect &mdash; I say this because I have respect for the Leader and the office he holds &mdash; he cannot run this House as though it was his own personal fiefdom.  He cannot run it to suit his own agenda.  Everyone should be consulted and at a minimum, there should be consultation among the leaders of the groups, who I thought all got on well together.  Sadly, arising from what has been drawn to my attention today, unless the Leader gets this right he will lose the confidence of this House and of his own colleagues in particular.  That is not something for <Col N="339"/>which any Member wishes because it demeans us all and lessens the House.  There was no agreement of which I am aware that this House should not sit on Tuesdays in May.  Like Senator O&rsquo;Toole, I was present both last May and in previous Mays on Tuesdays.  Consequently, there is no reason of which I am aware that the House should not have sat.  I await the Leader&rsquo;s response in this regard.</P>
        <P>I support the points made by colleagues about excessive and exorbitant management fees and the comments regarding the rare species of birds that sadly are being destroyed, but more of that anon.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Leader whether it would be possible to have a debate on the Irish Credit Bureau.  In these more difficult times, in which people struggle to meet mortgage and other loan repayments, this matter must be addressed.  I refer to the scenario whereby for legitimate reasons, someone misses a single payment but can be blacklisted by the Irish Credit Bureau.  This would not reflect those individuals&rsquo; true standing but could affect legitimate loan applications in these times in which it already is difficult to secure financing and funding.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>This matter requires a debate.</P>
        <P>Previously, I raised the issue of an open debate on the Committee on Procedure and Privileges for all Members.  Other issues could be dealt with in this regard, not simply the listing of people&rsquo;s names I mentioned last week, including the perceived wastage of paper to which Senator Quinn referred, as well as Members&rsquo; standing in the media.</P>
        <P>On that issue, I welcome the media&rsquo;s keen interest in the affairs of Seanad &Eacute;ireann this morning.</P>
      </Speaker>

      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>I hope that in respect of other valuable debates and innovations that are conceptualised in this House, the media will cover them in the appropriate fashion&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and not just in a demeaning way, such as how it was suggested we did not sit yesterday because of golf.  I am not a golfer and I am available to sit in this House 24 hours a day, seven days a week.  I speak for 99% of colleagues on both sides of the House when I say that.</P>

      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>The Leader will clarify the situation in his response.  It is disingenuous in the extreme for a news media organisation such as INM to perpetrate such a criminal suggestion upon instruments of the State, which Members on both sides are.  I am more than prepared to sit any day of the week, particularly Fridays, Saturdays and during the night, but it was far from the front page I saw on those occasions.  From Fine Gael, Independents and this side, I have heard suggestions and innovations from all disciplines considered by the Houses of the Oireachtas but I have never seen this on the front page.  If the media want to be the true representatives of the people, it is time they represented the views of the entire Houses of the Oireachtas and not just selectively when they want to represent disrespectfully and in a gimmicky way what is going on.</P>

On my behalf and on behalf of colleagues in Seanad &Eacute;ireann I extend a warm welcome and a sincere good wish for a successful visit.</P>

    <Title>Order of Business (Resumed). </Title>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I take a more temperate view.  We made fools of ourselves and did not manage this matter very skilfully.  We cannot blame the press for the interest it took in this.  I certainly will not work seven days, or 24 hours.  I often leave this place at 11 p.m. and I do a damn hard day&rsquo;s work, but if anyone thinks I will work on Sunday, they can forget it.  I go to St. Patrick&rsquo;s Cathedral and I propose to continue doing so.  By making exaggerated and intemperate claims, we make fools of ourselves.  We were a laughing stock and I laughed like a drain when I heard it.  It was very funny but it was not demeaning the place.  I considered writing to Senator Cassidy to ask, since we were following the British Tory lead, if I could have my wisteria clipped, my moat drained and the chandeliers cleaned.  It makes the whole thing look asinine.</P>
        <P>There is a practical side to it in that we do not know whether we are meeting at 10 a.m., 2 p.m., 2.30 p.m. or 3 p.m., Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday.  One cannot arrange a diary.  I had to go to an important meeting of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs.  I have chastised that committee for organising its meetings to coincide with the opening of the Order of Business but I cannot blame its members if they never know when the Order of Business will be.  A second committee wanted me to attend for it to be quorate but I refused because I thought it would be insulting to the Seanad.  If we insult it ourselves, we cannot blame anyone else for insulting it.</P>
        <P>I refer to the case of Mr. Willie Corduff and Shell to Sea.  Disgraceful attacks were made on Shell to Sea in an attempt to smear the campaign by attainder.  I was called a fool.  I am not afraid to be a fool in the interests of virtue.  If I am a fool, so is Archbishop Tutu of South Africa, who said that a peaceful protester, Goldman international award winner, Willie Corduff, was physically attacked under cover of darkness by the agents of a multinational corporation resulting in him being hospitalised and left severely hurt and traumatised.  That is a matter we should raise and I ask the Leader to raise it.  I ask for a proper inquiry.  This is a man beaten by thugs in the employ of Shell Oil.  What is the response from this Parliament?  The victim gets attacked.  It is not good enough.  I was told that some of the supporters have links with the dissident IRA groups but one cannot impugn an idea by attacking the motivation of some of the fringe elements of the support.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>I rise with the same passion and fervour as other speakers but concerning the fishing industry.  I have sought a debate on it.  There is an old saying in my area of west Cork that one never kicks a man when he is down.  The fishing industry from Donegal down the western seaboard to west Cork and Kerry is on its knees, unfortunately.</P><Col N="341"/>
        <P>I am greatly concerned that not for the first time in Baltimore, west Cork, there was a dawn raid like one would see in war, where officials from the Criminal Assets Bureau or the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority raided a small fishing factory that is closed more often than it is open.  When I looked for an explanation for this from the Minister, he said it was beyond his control.  Where will we end up on this?</P>
        <P>The fishing industry is in crisis and those owning 70% of the boats in Castletownbere cannot even meet their mortgage payments.  We have a very hard-line enforcement section that is more appropriate to the Second World War than today, and we should not condone it.  Perhaps this is a matter for the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform rather than the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.  It is quite serious when one sees this going on.  If the bodies were dealing with drugs, drug lords or criminal gangs, this same type of attention would not be given.  Similar incidents have occurred in Donegal and in west Cork two or three years ago.  We were told we would see fruit from this investigation but I have yet to see any results or court cases emanating which prove that this type of action is justifiable.</P>
        <P>It is a serious matter because the coastal communities have gone totally against Europe.  The fishermen were let down by the EU in 1973 and in some places along the coast, 90% of the electorate was against the Lisbon treaty because of how the people have suffered.  The type of action today in west Cork &mdash; it does not matter if it is in west Cork, Kerry, Galway or Donegal &mdash; cannot be condoned.</P>
        <P>I spoke publicly against the draconian powers of the Sea-Fisheries Protection Agency and in my view it is the sea fisheries persecution agency.  It is draconian and unfair in its ways and it is certainly not lending a hand to a fishing industry which is ailing and on its knees.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>I was shocked by the heading in the newspaper today that the Seanad was to be suspended on Tuesdays for the month of May.  I did not know about that and I am a Member of the House.  I resent the Leader deciding on the schedule without consulting Members, going on a solo run and bringing this House into disrepute.  The Leader is bringing me and my work into disrepute too.  I was elected to this House in good faith, I am a hard worker and that is the way I would like to be known rather than being attached to this type of image, which is really appalling.</P>
        <P>For some time I have not been happy with the quality of the Leader&rsquo;s responses in this House.  The Leader tells us what we want to hear, and either these comments are hypocritical or else the parliamentary party is not listening to a thing he says.  This is the Upper House and we must regard it as such.  We are elected by the people for the people so it is time we addressed the programme of work and the quality of both the work and the leadership.</P>
        <P>I also wish to address the spot closure of libraries throughout the country, which comes under the remit of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>It is far more important for him to ensure there will be no more spot closures of libraries.  This is a hit on reading, as it were, and reading is power.  Oranmore library is closed some afternoons, which is unfortunate for kids coming in after <Col N="342"/>school, and also on Saturday mornings.  The Westside library in Galway city is the same way, as I am sure are libraries throughout the country, for the sake of &euro;13.50 per hour.</P>

	<P>Yesterday I attended the launch of the report into the tragic deaths in April 2007 of Adrian and Ciara Dunne and their two children at Monageer.  The report to which I refer is a complete waste of time because 27 pages of it have been blacked out.  Why is that the case?  What is the point in publishing a report when it is not possible to read 27 pages of it?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thought the Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews, explained why parts of the report have been blacked out.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>The report attempts to state that perhaps this tragedy may not have happened or could not have been prevented.  I do not accept that.  Unfortunately, Ciara and <Col N="343"/>Adrian Dunne both had physical and emotional problems.  As children &mdash; as a result of the fact that they each had disabilities &mdash; they were provided with special education services.  They met, fell in love and, to all intents and purposes and according to the evidence in the report, had a happy and loving relationship.  Their children were always well dressed and properly nourished.  However, as a married couple, Ciara and Adrian still had emotional and physical problems.  I am of the view that the HSE took its eye off the ball and that the system let this family down.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In my document, What can we do about Suicide in the New Ireland, I called for a social work service to be available on a 24-hours-a-day, seven-days-a-week basis.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I salute the mayor of Limerick and the large numbers of people who live in that city who came out to express their revulsion at recent killings and criminal activities which have occurred there and which were carried out by a small number of criminal thugs.  For a number of months, Fine Gael Senators have been calling for strong measures to be taken in respect of gangland crime.  The perpetrators of this form crime are running amok at present.  On Sunday last, the Minister for Defence stated that the Cabinet was to meet this week to discuss the introduction of strong measures to combat this type of crime.  Those of us on this side of the House would fully support any initiatives in this regard.  When will legislation to deal with this matter be introduced?  We need measures of the type to which the Minister referred to remove these criminal thugs from our society.</P>
        <P>If a Member on one side of the House makes a threat against a Member on the other side, he or she should be obliged to explain his or her comments.  I will not name names in this regard because everyone is aware of what was said earlier.  When comments are made to the effect that a particular Senator was castigated by another Member of the House, the person bringing the charge should be asked to explain his or her comments.  I do not believe those types of comments should be allowed to be made in the House without being backed up.</P>

	<P>I support the calls of my colleague, Senator Mary White, for a debate on the Monageer report.  I agree with her that it would have been better to leave blank pages rather than blackening out 29 pages.</P>
        <P>Will the Leader write to the Simon Community, which is 40 years old today, to congratulate and commend it on the wonderful work it does in large towns and cities?</P><Col N="344"/>
        <P>In the past month, many Members have called for a debate on the relationships which the recipients of mortgages and hire purchase agreements have with the banks.  We have called several times for a debate on the impasse being experienced by small and medium-sized businesses with the banks.  Small businesses&rsquo; access to credit is being blocked by the banks.  It sickens me to see a large van on Baggot Street advertising Bank of Ireland as a bank looking for business people and entrepreneurs when its doors are closed to them.  I would like the Leader to take this matter seriously and schedule a debate on it.</P>
        <P>When I heard &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; this morning, I was as surprised as everyone else about the golf arrangements and the sitting days for May.  Like Senator MacSharry, I agree RTE picks up on negative spin.  I am sorry it is a negative spin but we are bringing it on ourselves.  I, for one, will come in here any day I am asked to do so.

      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>We must recognise there is a crisis of perception in so far as politics is concerned.  While I am the first to criticise the media for sensationalism, we should not make that opportunity available to it.  Yesterday, I was in these precincts working and I would have liked the Seanad to sit.  People may well go on an outing from time to time, but that is not a reason to suspend the business of the House.  If we had more bipartisanship in the House, with the Opposition and Independent benches being allowed in on the legislative process, it might be possible to keep the business going.</P>
        <P>Among the matters I believe would be useful and important subjects for debate in the Seanad, regardless of whether there are golf outings, is the Spirit of Ireland initiative.  Would it not be wonderful if, at this time of crisis when we are in the dock of international opinion for the way we allowed our banks to operate, the Irish people were seen to come up with a solution to make us energy independent, perhaps saving us &euro;30 billion over ten years by not having to purchase energy abroad and become a source of clean energy for domestic use and export?  I would like the Seanad to debate the specific, optimistic and morale boosting proposals that have come from Spirit of Ireland and to hear the Government&rsquo;s response to them.</P>
        <P>I also call for a debate on overseas development and where precisely the swingeing cuts of &euro;100 million will affect our overseas aid budget.  The Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Peter Power, has stated that bilateral aid would be ring-fenced.  One wonders why bilateral aid is to be preferred in light of the commitments made on the hunger taskforce.  We should focus our efforts on hunger alleviation and, given our agricultural traditions, we should help people in developing countries improve their agricultural economies.  I argue we should ring-fence this area rather than bilateral aid.  Perhaps such a debate would do something to address the public&rsquo;s perception of politicians.  When politicians are held in contempt, politics will also suffer and that is bad for our democracy.</P>

	<P>I join Senator Cummins in saluting the people of Limerick on the example they set for decent society.  Despite knowing the risks involved, they took to the streets with dignity and courage with the aim of winning back the city for their community.  I hope some way will be found for officialdom to identify with these people.  Perhaps Uachtar&aacute;in na h&Eacute;ireann could host them at the &Aacute;ras or this House could invite in their leaders, including the courageous mayor of Limerick.  They are seeking precisely these types of support and if we do not demonstrate our solidarity, the people against whom their protest was directed will believe we lack the courage or will to stand against the brutal gangs operating in this country.  There was another innocent victim yesterday.  When might our own turn come?</P>
        <P>I learned a long time ago not to believe everything one reads in the newspapers.  The debate this morning about not sitting yesterday pertained to a news story.  We have not yet heard the facts of the matter.  I have not seen some of these organs of the media protect or defend democratic structures in the past.  If anything, they deliberately set out to undermine the confidence of the people in the democratic structures of this country.  We should not give them any oxygen.  I do not intend offence against the Members opposite when I make this point.  Extreme views were expressed regarding the Leader without hearing his side of the story.  In my time in this Chamber, I have never heard anybody accuse him of being unfair, of not doing a good job or of failing to represent this House with dignity.  He has always been well received, so what has happened?  We take a single story and we believe it despite the background of misrepresentation in order to take a cheap shot against the Leader.</P>

No one is available out of hours or on weekends to protect them if anything happens.</P>

A sum of &euro;3.5 billion is being given to Allied Irish Banks while wards are being closed and children will not be treated in Crumlin children&rsquo;s hospital for the sake of &euro;10 million.  I would like answers to my questions rather than interruptions.</P>

      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Senator Ivor Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>As we find ourselves in the most severe and difficult economic bunker, will the Leader outline progress to address issues associated with Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness?  Measures need to be &ldquo;teed up&rdquo;, parked or amended such as the regulations that are in place, the EU directives imposed on us and legislation we have imposed on ourselves to introduce a minimum wage and so on.  Could the Leader arrange a briefing on the issues, the measures which are, hopefully, under consideration, and on the progress made to improve our competitiveness?</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Paddy Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to be associated with the good wishes to Mick Phelan on his retirement.  He has provided a great service in this House for a long number of years.</P>
        <P>I support Senator Twomey&rsquo;s comments on the children&rsquo;s hospital in Crumlin.  We should have a debate on what is happening there and in the National Rehabilitation Hospital in D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  One must join a waiting list to get into the NRH.</P>
        <P>The waiting lists for the driving test are absolutely scandalous, as is the inability of applicants to get through to a test centre.  Will the Leader contact the Minister for Transport to establish what is the problem at test centres?  Many applicants would have jobs if they passed their test but they cannot get a job because they cannot get an appointment for a driving test.  The impossible task of trying to get through to a test centre is a scandal.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Monageer report.  Some of the comments made by previous speakers were inaccurate.  In our locality, people who know the undertaker regard her as a person of the highest calibre who runs a tremendously professional service.  By contacting the Garda, she did the responsible and correct thing and I would not like anybody to imply criticism of failure to go elsewhere.</P>
        <P>With regard to the recommendation in the report alluded to by others, this unfortunate tragedy had no relationship whatsoever to out-of-hours services.  Contact was made during the normal working day.  The undertaker reported it to the Garda during the working day and the report states a social worker would not have been the correct intervention for the situation that, unfortunately, unfolded.  It would have required a psychiatrist.  There is every possibility that even with that intervention the unfortunate tragedy would have not have been averted.</P>
        <P>With regard to the redacted portions, we should accept that for legal reasons parts of the report had to be redacted but it is important that the redacted portions are available to the Department and to the Minister to interpret and act upon.  That should be done, and we should refrain from trying to make political points about these issues.  I extend my sympathy to both families on what was a most unfortunate tragedy.</P>
        <P>I join Senator Leyden in wishing our usher, Mick Phelan, well.  Everybody will testify that Mick is a gentleman.  He has given tremendous service in these Houses for 27 years.  He served in the Army for 21 years.  In many ways he epitomises the courtesy and helpfulness all Members <Col N="348"/>receive from the ushers.  I am sure everybody will join with me in wishing him well in his retirement.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to be associated with those remarks.  Mick Phelan has been a dote to me since I came into this House, and I very much appreciate him.</P>
        <P>I want to comment briefly on the extraordinary general meeting of AIB this morning and the idea that a shareholder had to throw eggs to voice his concern.  He could only afford two eggs; he was unable to afford the half dozen.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>He has lost all &euro;20,000 of his savings and was relying on the dividend.  Commissioner McCreevy, in the great town of Athlone with which the Leader will be very familiar, said that we should look not for heads to roll but for consensus and that we should not engage in Punch and Judy politics.  I do not agree with the Commissioner.  Who will represent the people who believe they have to throw eggs to get answers?  The shareholders in attendance at that meeting this morning are the people affected.  It is we, the taxpayers, who have recapitalised and guaranteed the banks.  How will these people be punished?  I ask the Leader to ask the Minister for Finance to come into the House and explain that to the Seanad so that we can tell the people who are canvassing how these people will be punished.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>A number of Senators are offering but the time has concluded.  Before I call the Leader I would like to comment on the retirement of our usher, Mick Phelan.  He is one of our senior ushers and is a familiar face to all of us in the Seanad.  This is Mick&rsquo;s last day with us and on behalf of all Senators and staff I wish him good luck in his retirement.  May he enjoy many years of health and happiness.  I know he will continue to make a huge contribution to his family and the community, especially his local GAA club, Parnell&rsquo;s.  All Members thank Mick sincerely for his outstanding contribution to this House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>I second that vote of congratulations and join other colleagues, Senators Leyden, Walsh, Cummins and Burke, in their comments about our team leader with the ushers, Mick Phelan who, as the Cathaoirleach said, is carrying out his final day of duty in Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  Tomorrow, 14 May, will be Mick&rsquo;s last day of service in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  He has given long and dedicated service within Government Buildings and especially in the Parliament.  He served under many Governments, going back to the mid-1970s when Liam Cosgrave was Taoiseach.  His time was spent between his military period as a member of the military police and in the Superintendent&rsquo;s section of the Houses.  His friendly disposition and ever helpful and courteous manner, which we have all experienced, makes him one of the most popular ushers that has ever served any Parliament since the foundation of the State.</P>
        <P>As the Cathaoirleach said, his great interest in the Gaelic Athletic Association, especially his native county, the Lilywhites, is well known in the House.  We wish Mick, his wife, Patricia, and his family a very happy early retirement and look forward to his friendship for many years to come.</P>

	<P>Senators Fitzgerald, O&rsquo;Toole, Prendergast, Buttimer, Quinn, Coghlan, MacSharry, Norris, Healy Eames, Mary White, Cummins, Feeney, Mullen and &Oacute; Murch&uacute; commented on the reports in the media today about the House not sitting yesterday. <Col N="349"/> Never was it further from the truth that this House would have anything to do with a golf event.  It had nothing to do with a golf event.  As everyone knows, I have done everything I possibly could to facilitate the requests often made of me, which I have always listened to, by the leaders of the groups, the Whips, and all Members for debates on whatever issue in this House.</P>
        <P>Regarding the position on the Tuesdays in May, since I first became Leader of this House in 1997, I have offered the hand of friendship to the leaders of the various groups, a courtesy which to my knowledge was not offered before my time, by facilitating a weekly meeting with the leaders of the groups in the House, which I found useful and helpful.  I have often thanked the leaders of the groups for their assistance to me.  However, last week no leader turned up for the meeting.  Today, Labour and Fine Gael turned up for the meeting.  Last Tuesday, the business proceeded and the Cathaoirleach correctly pointed out to the House last Thursday, when the Government Whip proposed that we would sit today at 2.30 p.m., that there was no objection to that.</P>

I now extend an invitation to the party leaders to meet me tomorrow morning at 10 o&rsquo;clock before the Order of Business when I will listen to their views on the proceedings that took place here on the past three Tuesdays.</P>
        <P>I met the Government Chief Whip prior to the sitting of the Seanad today to discuss forthcoming legislation.  I am pleased to inform the House that the Government will have in the region of 12 to 14 Bills for our consideration before the end of this term.</P>

If there is business to be discussed and legislation to be debated, approved or amended, we will do it.  I point out that a Bill has never been guillotined in this House.</P>

	<P>I want the message to go out loud and clear to the responsible media in particular that under no circumstances was it ever contemplated that this House would not sit because of a game of golf.  To my knowledge, the event that took place yesterday was arranged last January.  One Member on this side of the House played, namely, myself, as well as three colleagues on the opposite side to honour former Members.  Some colleagues played at 7.30 a.m.  That event was to honour former colleagues.  One day a year we get together to <Col N="350"/>appreciate what former colleagues did as former Members of both D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  I hope I have made myself clear in this regard.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Prendergast called for a debate on the HSE with regard to St. Luke&rsquo;s and funding for mental health.  I have given a commitment to hold such a debate.  The Minister of State, Deputy John Moloney, is very supportive and is willing to come to the House when invited to debate any matter related to his portfolio.</P>
        <P>Senator Martin Brady and Senator John Hanafin brought to the attention of the House the cost of estate management fees, which are certainly exorbitant.  I will convey the Senators&rsquo; strong views to the Minister after the Order of Business.  They also asked that the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Coughlan, be invited to the House to discuss the many challenges facing business enterprises.  I have put that request to the Minister and am awaiting a date for it to take place.</P>
        <P>Senator Terry Leyden asked for a debate on landlords and tenants, particularly the 128,000 persons who have tenancies.  It is timely to have such a debate and I will allocate time for it.</P>
        <P>Senator Feargal Quinn and Senator Marc MacSharry spoke about the waste of paper and the report of the Irish film organisation which was produced on DVD.  This is very welcome.  Many organisations are moving to do something on this issue.  I thank the Senators for drawing it to the attention of the House and I will convey their strong views to the Minister.  Senator Quinn also raised the poisoning of birds and the damage being caused to the environment.  There is a wonderful radio programme each afternoon, &ldquo;Mooney Goes Wild&rdquo;, which has been particularly good in the past few weeks.  It brings a huge amount of attention to wildlife and everything associated with it.  It is timely for Senator Quinn to bring the issue to our attention. <Col N="351"/> Senator MacSharry called for a debate on Standing Orders and matters pertaining to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  I have no problem with ensuring this takes place.</P>
        <P>Senator David Norris expressed his strong views on the Shell to Sea campaign and the many challenges and difficulties being experienced in Mayo.  I will allocate time for that debate.  He also raised prison sentencing for people in Tibet.  That issue could probably be dealt with by way of Private Members&rsquo; business.  If not, I will facilitate the Senator by organising a debate when legislation is not available.  With so much legislation being produced, it will be difficult to find time to discuss many matters but I will try to prioritise them in the best way possible with the assistance of the other leaders.</P>
        <P>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan outlined the serious plight of the fishing industry.  It appears there are regulations for the Irish fishing industry that do not seem to be in place for neighbouring states that fish in Irish waters.  If that is the case, it is unfair and I have no problem with bringing it to the attention of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and having it debated in the House before the end of the session.</P>
        <P>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames outlined her serious concerns about local authority libraries and the situation in Galway.  She called for a debate on the matter and I will give the request serious consideration.</P>
        <P>Senator Mary White, Senator Geraldine Feeney, Senator Jim Walsh and Senator Liam Twomey expressed their strong concerns about the Monageer report and the tragedy that took place.  As Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute; and many others said, it was a tragedy.  Our hearts go out to the families concerned.  I will try to have the matter debated in the House in the presence of the Minister at a future date.</P>
        <P>Senator Maurice Cummins and Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; congratulated the people and the mayor of Limerick and the family who called on the people of Limerick to march in large numbers last Sunday to let the rest of the country know that they seek respect and protection of the law.  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is due to bring very strong legislation before the House to deal with this issue.  I, too, congratulate the people who participated last Sunday in such large numbers to let the country know their strong views.  As Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; said, they must be congratulated on their courage.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Geraldine Feeney sought a debate on the Simon Community.  I congratulate the organisation on its 40th anniversary.  I will allocate time for that debate.  The Senator also called for a debate on mortgages and small and medium-sized businesses.  I would add the issue of fixed mortgages.  A substantial percentage of couples is caught in the trap of fixed mortgages.  It is time the banks confronted the difficulty in which young people find themselves, particularly young couples where the breadwinner has been made unemployed.  Something must be done in this area.  I have no difficulty with allocating time for that debate.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen called for a debate on the Spirit of Ireland, energy independence and how we can take advantage of our geographical location in Europe in terms of being a supplier of energy to Europe in years to come.  This is a very worthwhile request and I will allocate time for it.  The Senator also sought a debate on overseas development and where funding will be made available in the coming years of scarce resources.  Ireland has been one of the top six or seven nations in the world in its contributions <i>per capita </i>to overseas development.  I will allocate time for this debate.</P>
        <P>Senator Liam Twomey asked me to convey his strong views about the children&rsquo;s hospital in Crumlin and funding for that hospital.  It is a serious concern.  Senator Frances Fitzgerald also raised this issue previously.  I will convey my colleagues&rsquo; strong views to the Minister.  If a debate is required, it can be arranged.</P><Col N="352"/>
        <P>Senator Ivor Callely sought a debate on Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness.  As I have said frequently on the Order of Business, our biggest challenge is our competitiveness.  We can organise a debate on the matter with the Minister for Finance in the next two or three weeks.</P>

	<P>Senator Paddy Burke asked me to bring to the Minister&rsquo;s attention the problem being experienced by many people in communicating with driving test centres.  This is a serious issue and I will convey the Senator&rsquo;s strong views to the Minister.</P>
        <P>Senator Nicky McFadden raised the AIB shareholder meeting that was held today.  Many people have lost their savings and, perhaps, even the savings they inherited from their parents.  They participated in the share scheme but the value of shares can go down as well as up.  It is dreadful for people, particularly those in the autumn of their careers or in retirement.  It took them 40 or 50 years to accumulate their savings.  It is a matter we will discuss with the Minister in the House in the near future.  As I said previously, we will discuss the economy every week, and we have been doing that.  I hope there will be another meeting with the Minister or the Minister of State in this regard in the next week or two.</P>

	<P>The proposed amendment suggests inserting the words &ldquo;in the English language&rdquo; into the definition of the Hague Convention in section 3 of the Bill.  This is considered unnecessary because if it was in any other language it would be so stated.

	<P>The legal point is that under the Constitution of Ireland, the Irish language takes precedence.

	<P>Will the Minister of State clarify the current status of the bilateral agreement with Vietnam?  What is the situation on the post-placement reports that are apparently being requested by Russia and that have led to problems?  Every Member of both Houses is receiving heart-breaking e-mails from families who feel that they are in limbo.  They are waiting to see if the Government can conclude an agreement with Vietnam.  The date of 1 May has passed and some parents have gone so far as to contact officials in Vietnam and ask the reason for the delay.  They have been told by senior officials there that it is because of delays on this side.</P>
        <P>There are clearly barriers to getting an agreement in place.  It would be helpful at this stage if the Minister of State would explain or give us some information on what precisely is happening.  I know he has had private meetings with some of the adoption agencies working in this area.  There is huge concern, as I am sure the Minister of State is aware, in regard to whether agreement can be reached, what will happen to these families in the future and what will happen to people whose names have been accepted and who at this point do not know what will be the next step.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State will note from the amendment that we are allowing for the possibility that we will continue to have in place bilateral agreements and the Hague Convention but that where adoption takes place from a third country in a manner compatible with this legislation, it will be legal and acceptable in this country.  Obviously, it is not ideal.  The Minister of State responded on this amendment on Committee Stage.  Were he to provide the House with whatever information is available in respect of this situation this might allay some of the worries and concerns expressed.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the comments of Senators Prendergast and Fitzgerald on this amendment.  It is important that the dreadful state of uncertainty in which so many prospective adopters find themselves is resolved.  I, too, am interested to hear what the Minister of State has to say in regard to the agreement with Vietnam and the situation with Russia.  This issue was raised on Committee Stage when the Minister of State assured us every effort was being made to ensure the agreements would be concluded with Vietnam and Russia.  We now find the process has fallen apart.</P>
        <P>We have been told by prospective adopters, many of whom contacted us by e-mail and telephone, that even adoptions which are at an advanced stage, with many prospective adopters ready to fly to Vietnam or Russia to finalise an adoption that often had been years in planning, have been stalled.</P>
        <P>Amendments Nos. 24 and 65 are important in that they also anticipate a situation whereby a person who has already adopted from a country with which we have a bilateral agreement but which is currently not in force, might be permitted to adopt a second or subsequent child from that country.  That is the situation in which many of the people who have contacted us find themselves.</P>
        <P>I am sure the Minister of State is aware of the intense frustration and anger felt by so many people who are at an advanced staged in the adoption process and who find themselves sud<Col N="356"/>denly stymied by an apparent bureaucratic failure.  It is important the Minister of State clarifies the position and provides some reassurance to those prospective adopters.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the amendment.  The Minister of State must explain to this House what exactly he is trying to do.  Is he, through his inaction, having not personally visited Vietnam to sort out this problem, trying to close forever Vietnam to Irish adoptive families?</P>
        <P>My understanding, having been in contact with a couple who spent last Friday in Vietnam with the deputy director, is that the Minister of State was fully aware of the need to put in place a draft bilateral agreement with the Vietnamese Government prior to last November in order that it could be put through Parliament.  The Minister of State was warned of what would happen if this was not done.  Currently, 24 families involved in prospective adoptions are held up in Vietnam.  Another 251 with eligibility to adopt status are registered with Helping Hands in Cork.</P>
        <P>Perhaps the Minister of State will answer the following questions in the context of the amendment.  Why has he not shown his commitment to this issue by travelling to Vietnam, sitting down and breaking bread with the Vietnamese, to renegotiate this bilateral agreement for the sake of Irish families and the babies in the orphanages?  Can the Minister of State, if he is genuinely sincere about addressing this issue, give us a concrete indication, in terms of time, of when the new agreement will be in place?  Is it possible to negotiate an extension of the original agreement pending the putting in place of the new agreement?  If we enact this legislation, will it negatively impact on the bilateral agreement if not concluded?</P>
        <P>The following was said to me by a family:</P>
        <P LI="1">We have endured so much in terms of setbacks and infertility and HSE waiting lists.  We are five years on this adoption road and are registered with the agency Helping Hands for 51 weeks.  We should have received our referral two weeks ago but due to the Minister&rsquo;s inaction we are now in limbo.  We need answers in terms of timeframe and contingency for those with the dossiers already in Vietnam and those, like ourselves, held up in Cork.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This is a human crisis for these families.  It is an appalling way to leave them.  I plead with the Minister of State to provide reassurance for these people and to respond to the questions I have asked.  As I told all the families concerned last week by e-mail, the matter is in the hands of the Minister of State.  All we can do is make proposals in regard to what can be done and highlight the misery families are suffering.  I appeal to the Minster of State to answer my questions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the amendment.  I do so having spoken on the matter on Second Stage and based on comments on the issue here.</P>
        <P>I wish also to refer to the e-mail campaign.  Senator Healy Eames has done us a service by placing on the record some of the main elements of the brief provided through this campaign, thus rendering it unnecessary for me to do so.  I received well over 100 e-mails, most of them formal and repetitious.  As I live a busy life and often do not leave this place until 11 p.m. I sent a form letter in response explaining that while I had great sympathy for them I could not respond to each individual.  This provoked a variety of responses, some of which were understanding and included the same type of heart-rending personal tales placed on the record by Senator Healy Eames.  Others were pretty shrill, threatening and bullying and demanded action &ldquo;NOW&rdquo; &mdash; in capitals letters.  I do not respond well to that type of demand nor do I propose to.</P><Col N="357"/>
        <P>I say to anybody embarking on this type of campaign &mdash; there are a number of them around including one in support of my distinguished colleague, Senator Bacik, who has proposed legislation on climate change, which I fully support &mdash; I do not need to be hectored.  Many have told me they are voters in my constituency.  I am not the slightest bit interested in the D&aacute;il.  I chose to be in Seanad &Eacute;ireann and I have no intention of trying to make a jump into the D&aacute;il.  I find it very insulting that people tried to blackmail me by suggesting they will take their puny little vote away from me.  The very same people bellyache about the calibre of politicians they get.  They get the calibre of politicians the system encourages.  It is pointless to engage in this type of campaign.  The level of intensity merely frustrates the admirable motive of the people who embark on such campaigns.  The central organising body involved should be aware that rather than advancing the cause of adoption they may very well alienate people who spend much of their time supporting them.</P>
        <P>As in all legislation in this area, I place the rights of the child as the primary element.  It is heart-rending that people endure long processes and I understand and sympathise with them, particularly if they have been through infertility treatment and so on.  However, they are adults.  At the end of the day, what this Government is required to do is to safeguard the interests of children, those who are Irish and those who may become Irish.  We must seek to avoid situations such as that which arose in respect of the Dowse family who adopted a child from the Far East and who then, because the child did not fit in with them, wanted to swap that child for another.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>They sent the child back.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>It is appropriate to be prudent and careful in these matters.  There are issues which the Minister of State needs to answer.  A number of us, including Senators Fitzgerald, Bacik, Prendergast and me, asked about the 1 May deadline in advance of the deadline.  We made it clear there was some urgency about it.  The House is entitled to an explanation as to why that deadline passed.  There may be an explanation and I hope the Minister of State will give it.</P>
        <P>I understand difficulties are experienced by other countries.  Recently somebody who was in an adoptive situation told me that the United States Administration also has difficulty with Vietnamese adoptions for one reason or another.  This is just hearsay and I would like the Minister of State to clarify the matter.  There has also been a charge that the Minister of State was in some way irresponsible by not visiting Vietnam.  He indicated to me that he had been to Vietnam on several occasions and it would be helpful for him to place that on the record of the House.</P>
        <P>My response to this campaign is not just on this issue &mdash; it is a question of the political technique involved.  There are many other similar campaigns and I think they are actually a hindrance.  I will give another example of why it is a hindrance.  Today I got an additional volume of these kinds of e-mails.  They were very mixed.  Some of them were very kind, understanding and heart-rending, and gave really personal details.  My secretary has the entire file and is typing up replies.  That is why I do not have them all.  I would not be able to quote them in any case.  I support the matter despite my reservations about the way in which the campaign was mounted.  I am trying to serve notice on many well motivated and decent people who get involved in these campaigns.  They each see their own individual letter.  They need to be careful because if they overuse this instrument it becomes blunt and will alienate their supporters.  One letter is fine.  However, if they get back in response to their circular letter a circular letter from the politician, they should not try to crucify a politician who is already on their side.  They should never try on with somebody like me the threat to take a vote away, because I do not want the vote of people who treat their vote in this cavalier way with very little respect for the democratic ideals in which the State was founded.</P><Col N="358"/>
        <P>I support the amendment despite the campaign as it may provide a method of breaking the logjam and resolve a very painful human situation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>May I have the permission of the House to make a statement on the issues raised by the Senators?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>At a human level I share the Senators&rsquo; sense of the deep hurt and frustration expressed by all the people who have been sending e-mails to me and the other Members of these Houses.  At a human level one cannot avoid empathising with the situation Senator Healy Eames mentioned.  Many parents have come through a very long process involving attempted family formation followed by, in my view, prolonged and protracted HSE processes regarding suitability and eligibility.  I have met many prospective adoptive parents in my clinics in recent weeks.  The HSE encourages parents to try to bond with the child before even having a referral in order to create a link with the child.  That link is perceived to be broken by the fact the agreement with Vietnam has expired.</P>
        <P>I will make a short statement to the House.  I would like to reiterate again my personal commitment and the Government&rsquo;s commitment to putting in place new bilateral international adoption agreements with Vietnam and Russia.  I am very aware of the anxiety being experienced by applicants and their wider families.  The pain so clearly articulated leaves me in no doubt about the sensitivity of the issue.  The steps we are taking are not intended to cause unnecessary angst and frustration.  We are engaged in a process that seeks to strengthen the protection of children in inter-country adoption.  At every opportunity I have communicated updates to prospective adoptive parents and their representative groups on these matters and I have committed to continuing with this process.</P>
        <P>Against this background my office is continuing to work to create the appropriate legislative, policy and administrative frameworks to ensure a well regulated regime of adoption.  Our aim is to support and protect prospective parents and even more importantly the children for whom adoption services are devised and provided.</P>
        <P>The Adoption Bill, which includes the regime of the Hague Convention, provides an assurance for individual children, their families and the State that appropriate procedures have been followed and that the adoption was effected in the best interests of the child.  As such, it is our intention that all inter-country adoptions will meet the standards of the Hague Convention.  This is the principle underpinning the negotiations with Vietnam and indeed negotiations with other countries in the context of inter-country adoptions.  Simply put, I am striving to achieve, for all adoptions, the same standard we expect to apply to the adoption of an Irish child.</P>
        <P>A core principle of the Adoption Bill and the Hague Convention is that inter-country adoption should be child centred, that is, in all stages of the process the child&rsquo;s interests must be paramount.  The Hague Convention, which is given the force of law in this Bill, puts in place the equivalent of a contract between states to regulate the standards that will apply in each jurisdiction.  Its purpose is to safeguard that acceptable standards are being applied in other countries, over which we have no jurisdiction.  When countries have not ratified the Hague Convention, a bilateral agreement is required to be entered into to enable adoptions to be recognised in this country.  The standards required under any such agreement should mirror the standards required by the Hague Convention.</P>
        <P>As Senators know, the Government is working towards securing a strengthened agreement with Vietnam.  In light of concerns raised by other countries which emerged during 2008, the <Col N="359"/>Government decided it was necessary to seek a strengthening of the existing agreement with Vietnam.  I emphasise that when we visited in November 2008 we were able to confirm and establish that our arrangements with Vietnam were very favourable because we were adopting through a unique Irish mediation agency, Helping Hands.  We were also able to establish that we were generally adopting relinquished rather than abandoned children, which gave that extra reassurance in terms of consents.  It was on this basis that the Government decided to pursue a new agreement with Vietnam.  With the publication of the Adoption Bill 2009, it was also considered necessary to ensure that both the content of a new agreement and its implementation would meet the minimum standards set out in that Bill and under the Hague Convention on the Protection of Children and Co-operation in respect of Inter-Country Adoption.</P>
        <P>There has been ongoing dialogue with the Vietnamese authorities with the focus on achieving the requisite strengthening of procedures for the protection of children.  The Socialist Republic of Vietnam is a sovereign state and the progress that can be made relies on the co-operation and goodwill of that state.  This is a sensitive issue and the Government, despite its aspirations, must be, of course, respectful of the views and decisions made by the Government of Vietnam.  It is my intention to continue with these discussions with a view to bringing them to a conclusion at the earliest possible date.  It is anticipated that further proposals to advance the discussions will be made to the Socialist Republic of Vietnam in the coming week.  I am also hopeful the Vietnamese side will be in a position to revert with its proposals shortly.  I do not wish to speculate on the timeframe or the outcome for these negotiations.  There has been a high level of engagement on both sides and it is clear from progress so far that there is a willingness on both sides to bring the negotiations to a successful conclusion.</P>
        <P>As regards the Russian Federation, my officials and their colleagues in the Department of Foreign Affairs have since April 2008, been in consultation with regard to inter-country adoption in that jurisdiction.  This has included contacts with the Irish Embassy in Moscow and legal and other preparatory work on the possibility of a draft agreement between the two countries.  A meeting between officials of my Department and the Russian Embassy in Dublin took place last week.  I will continue to advance this matter with the assistance of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Martin, and his officials both here and in Moscow as quickly as possible.  A number of steps are now in train to advance to formal discussions on a bilateral agreement between the two countries.</P>
        <P>Officials have also specifically raised the issue of the so-called &ldquo;black listing&rdquo; because of alleged outstanding post-adoption reports.  The Russian side has provided a list of outstanding reports.  The list produced by the Russian Ministry of Education is currently being validated by the embassy.  In the meantime, I have asked the relevant authorities to assist me in pursuing resolution of this issue as a matter of urgency.  Officials have also assured the Russian side of the importance we attach to resolving the matter.  Overall, it must be acknowledged that another sovereign government is party to all negotiations on inter-country adoptions and consequently it would be unwise and inappropriate to attempt to air the issues or negotiate these very sensitive matters in the public domain as it might jeopardise the prospects of concluding any new agreements.  For that reason, further details on negotiations are not being made available at this time.  Furthermore, it also is the case that speculation on either the nature of the issues or the degree of progress being made is unhelpful and may prove misleading and distressing to those applicants who currently are waiting to adopt.  In this regard, I would greatly appreciate Members&rsquo; forbearance in respect of these negotiations and ask them to accept I am doing my utmost to bring both of these processes to a successful conclusion in the best interest of children.</P>
        <P>I wish to state unequivocally that the Government is also firmly committed to ensuring that arrangements between Ireland and Vietnam, Russia and any other country where Irish people <Col N="360"/>are adopting children protect and promote the best interests of the children, their families and prospective adoptive parents.</P>
        <P>I am of course aware that I have been criticised regarding the handling of the situation in Vietnam.  The easy option would be to accede to the pressure being generated from all sides.  However, in conscience, I cannot contemplate advising the Government to enter into any bilateral agreement that does not provide for the minimum standards to protect children who are to be adopted by Irish families.  I must reiterate the child&rsquo;s best interests are the fundamental principle that supports the development of a national child care and protection system as well as an ethical, child-centred approach to inter-country adoption.  Inter-country adoption does not occur in a vacuum but across jurisdictions and spans complex areas of family law, child protection and welfare.  It must be legislated for, managed and understood in that context.  It requires a shared responsibility and respect between states to ensure the best ethical practices to support the child&rsquo;s best interests and to safeguard against abduction, sale or trafficking of children.</P>
        <P>Ireland has a strong tradition of inter-country adoption and was once a so-called &ldquo;sending country&rdquo;.  My aim is to support the continuance of that tradition by assuring prospective adopters, the countries of origin of prospective adoptees, the birth families of the children and, looking into the future, the children themselves, that inter-country adoption was undertaken in the best interests of the child to the required standard with adequate safeguards and protections for all concerned.  My role, as Minister of State with responsibility for children, is to provide for the legislative, policy and system frameworks to achieve that aim.</P>
        <P>In conclusion, some colleagues from the Government side of the House have impressed on me a principle that I accept, namely, that at the earliest possible opportunity, I will travel to Vietnam to assist in whatever way I can.  In hindsight, people have stated that I should have gone with one of the earlier delegations and perhaps that is the case.  However, having discussed this matter with my colleagues and in the hope it will be of some consolation or satisfaction to some of the associations concerned, I undertake to travel to Vietnam as soon as would be useful to the process that is being undertaken at present.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, the Minister of State is yet to address the amendments.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>I refer to amendments Nos. 3, 24 and 65, which have been discussed.  This is about trying to create a system whereby another type of adoption would be permitted outside of the Hague Convention or a bilateral agreement.  The Hague Convention is a minimum standard and as I noted previously, it is clear there never will be a situation in which one is 100% guaranteed that each adoption will be safe.  Consequently, one must apply the standards contained in the Hague Convention or, if one cannot do so because the other country has not signed it, one must reach a bilateral agreement that is based on the Hague Convention&rsquo;s principles.  Such principles guarantee automatic certification of such adoptions and specify that matters such as the consent of parents, the adoptability of a child, the eligibility of a child to be adopted and the principle that there be no improper financial gain, can be guaranteed in such an adoption.  It is important to try to bring countries up to this level and it is an incentive to countries to declare that Ireland will have adoptions with countries that have signed the Hague Convention or with which we have bilateral agreements.</P>
        <P>As for the so-called grandfather clause, this again suggests there should be a parallel process of adoption with countries that are unable to ratify the Hague Convention for some reason or with which Ireland does not have a bilateral agreement for some reason.  Whatever that reason might be, it clearly is a matter of which one must take cognisance.  If such states are unable to come up to the minimum standards, to which, incidentally, we signed up many years ago&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, many years ago.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>We must take cognisance of the inability of such states to come up to the minimum standards for which we negotiate or if they cannot sign or ratify the Hague Convention.  I am not prepared to accept a parallel system of adoption in the Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilPrendergast"><NameTxt>Senator Phil Prendergast</NameTxt>
	<P>Having worked for many years as a midwife, I approach this issue from a slightly different angle because I have seen at first hand in my professional capacity incidences of people enduring long and tortuous attempts either to become pregnant or to go through all the investigations and the upset they felt in this regard or equally in cases where babies were lost.  My concern was that Russia, Vietnam and Ethiopia could fall outside this requirement unless bilateral agreements were established with them.  Vietnam has become the most popular country for Irish applicants and it follows the model practice that has been promoted by the Minister of State&rsquo;s Department, the Adoption Board and the Health Service Executive.</P>
        <P>I tabled this amendment because of the nature of the contacts I have had with people in this regard.  Moreover, I took no issue with any aspect of their e-mails because I discern the reason they would feel sufficiently strongly to do whatever they considered was necessary.  I believe such actions were born out of frustration, as opposed to being deliberately provocative.  It is simply that it causes great upset when people care deeply about something and believe it has been interfered with.  Other countries have established bilateral arrangements with Russia and there is precedent and intent from the Russian side.  There are hundreds of thousands of children in Russian orphanages and Ireland should not close its homes to such children either.  As for Ethiopia, in recent analysis of adoption in Ethiopia, it has been deemed to be compatible with Irish law and consequently there should be no hold-up in establishing a bilateral agreement.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="362"/>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Prendergast.  This legislation is standard-setting and with respect to Russia, it is clear the Government will have learned a great deal from the Vietnamese experience.  If the Government is successful, this will have been the first time a bilateral agreement will have been concluded under the terms of the new Adoption Bill and the new standards it has set for itself.  At the outset of this standard-setting regime, I do not propose to dilute those standards by permitting a parallel system of adoption outside of that process.  I again undertake to pursue a bilateral agreement with Russia as soon as the other process is completed.</P>
        <P>I hope people understand the Government is committed to adoption.  While there are those who theorise that international adoption is not a proper child protection measure and that there should be concentration solely on supports for families in countries of origin, the Government is committed to the concept that international adoption will take place because there is such a strong tradition in this regard in Ireland.  Moreover, we have assurances about our relationships and have minimum standards.  The Government was able to assure itself in this regard as recently as November 2008, which grounded its decision in December to pursue a bilateral agreement with Vietnam, despite issues that had arisen that had caused other countries to withdraw from that country.  Ireland has a unique set of circumstances that allows it to move forward.  However, issues remain between the countries that unfortunately have not been resolved to date.</P>

      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 4:</P><Col N="363"/>
        <P LI="1">In page 17, between lines 25 and 26, to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="1">&ldquo;(4) In this Act, &ldquo;married couple&ldquo; means an opposite-sex or same-sex married couple or a couple who have entered a registered civil partnership with each other.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">We debated this amendment at some length on Committee Stage so I do not propose to go back over that ground in detail.  It is an important amendment which would insert into the Adoption Bill the right of a same-sex couple who are married or who have entered a civil partnership to adopt on the same terms as a married opposite-sex couple.</P>
        <P>On Committee Stage the Minister indicated some sympathy for the principle that same-sex couples should have adoption rights but expressed the view that this Bill was not the appropriate place.  My concern and that of my colleague, Senator Norris, is that the civil partnership legislation as we have currently seen it in draft form does not provide for adoption rights for same-sex couples.</P>
        <P>As the Minister indicated, same-sex couples are currently very engaged in the fostering of children and there is a great deal of support for that.  There should be no objection in principle in same-sex couples having adoption rights.  Whether that occurs with this Bill or the civil partnership Bill is not important for me but I hope the Minister will express support for inserting this principle into legislation of some form.  I would like to hear the Minister of State&rsquo;s response on that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment.  I had put down an amendment in the first instance on Committee Stage.  My position is perhaps more radical as I am disquieted by the fact that the apparent proposals of the Government do not include any such provision in the civil partnership Bill.  It is clear the Government has shied away from it, although it is a very important aspect and a principal defect of the proposed civil partnership Bill.</P>
        <P>There is no sign of the civil partnership legislation, even though we have had repeated promises on it.  It is nearly five years since I put a civil partnership Bill on the Order Paper of this House and it was kicked by the former Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, into every committee, sub-committee and think tank etc. in an act of prevarication and nonsense.</P>
        <P>As these problems continuously recur in social welfare and other legislation, we continue to get fobbed off with promises.  Will the Minister of State try to impress on his colleagues that we need legislation in this area?  I believe it is appropriate here but if the Minister of State indicates it is not and that it will be dealt with elsewhere, we should ensure we get the opportunity to hammer the matter out even if what the Government ultimately produces is a defective Bill.</P>
        <P>There will be defects and the children will be let down once again.  I am not just talking about the rights of parents because that can be a selfish matter.  Gay people can be just as selfish as anybody else and there is no automatic right to have children.  The child should be the centre of the matter, which is why in the amendment I put down it was clear that the rights and welfare of the child were primary.  I made other points regarding couples recognised in other states; I cannot remember the exact formulation but I was clearly speaking about gay couples so we will use that shorthand.  Such couples could be vetted to gauge suitability as there is no automatic right for gay people to adopt.</P>
        <P>This is an important amendment, which I decided to leave with Senator Bacik because her amendment came at an earlier stage in the Bill.  What is the point in putting down a number of amendments, as one will be called and others added to it, and I can make my argument?  This should not be the principal focus of this Bill but it presents an opportunity for us to remind the Government of its lamentable failure in this area.  We do not even have the civil partnership <Col N="364"/>Bill but it will be defective in this area when it is introduced.  That is a battle which needs to be fought.  It would not need to be fought if this was a Government with vision but unfortunately it is not.</P>
        <P>Neither Senator Bacik nor I will want to call a vote on this but we wish to signal to the Minister that this is an area of human concern.  If the Government was caring and interested in a socially constructive circumstance, it would pay attention to it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I totally oppose the amendment.  In my opinion and that of many specialists in the field, the best interest of the child is served by having the influence of a mother and father in its upbringing.  Any deviation from that would take away from the focus of the child.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>Both the proposer and the seconder of the amendment spoke strongly about civil partnership, which is a concept I do not oppose, although I am against it mirroring all the rights and entitlements of heterosexual marriage.  That is distinct and different and should be treated accordingly.  Other minority interests in society should have their rights recognised in a way appropriate to their circumstances rather than on the basis of replicating the rights of other such bodies.  Where possible and unless natural justice intervenes, we should ensure every child in the State has the benefit of having a mother and a father because the latter is in their absolute interest in the context of their development and upbringing.  There are many studies which underline and prove that point of view.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Norris&rsquo;s call for the civil partnership Bill.  Issues arise in respect of a number of areas, whether it be in the context of the amendment under discussion or in respect of social welfare, which cannot be dealt with in isolation from that Bill.  I urge the Minister of State to ensure that legislation is introduced in the House before the end of this session.</P>
        <P>If the Minister of State is in negotiations in respect of the matters we discussed in the context of this amendment on Committee Stage, will he indicate if he plans to have an input into the civil partnership Bill in respect of the issues that have been raised by quite a number of Members?  I refer to the various anomalies contained in the legislation with regard to this matter at present.  It would be important that as many as possible of these issues be dealt with when we debate the civil partnership Bill.  As stated on previous occasions, Fine Gael&rsquo;s view is that in the absence of the civil partnership Bill the amendment before the House is premature.</P>
        <P>This matter is of concern to many couples, who are wondering what will be the nature of the law of the land in respect of it.  As the Minister of State indicated earlier, the key consideration ought to be what is in the best interests of the child and how a child&rsquo;s welfare is best served by our adoption laws.  We must also consider how best we might protect children irrespective of the status of their parent or parents.  We must inquire how the greatest level of protection can be provided, what prevents discrimination against children and, regardless of the formation of their family, what will provide them with the most security as they grow up.</P>
        <P>I would like the civil partnership Bill to be introduced as soon as possible.  In addition, it would be good to hear from the Government the priority it intends to afford that legislation.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>

	<P>Good.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>I will try to discover, as quickly as possible, when the Bill is due be introduced.</P>
        <P>There is no doubt that cultural and social changes are giving rise to legislative change.  Society is leading the way and prompting such legislative change.  I am of the view that, in time, society will decide whether it is acceptable for gay couples to adopt children and legislators will then make their move.</P>
        <P>I am amazed by people who refer to children needing mothers and fathers.  Are these individuals inferring that children who, for example, only have mothers are living in a dysfunctional environment?  Those who state that children should be raised by both a mother and father must be extremely careful with regard to the language they use.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>I echo Senator Mary White&rsquo;s comments to the effect the Government is committed to the civil partnership Bill.  Everyone recognises the country has taken great steps forward in recent years.  A number of surveys show the concept of same-sex marriage does not offend the majority of people.  While it is fine for people to advocate the family model which includes a mother and father, there should not be discrimination against other family formations.  The quasi-religious social theory which underpins some of the constitutional provisions relating to marriage is open to challenge in the modern era.  If we place children at the centre of this debate, it will present us with a challenge.  It will be difficult for society to engage in the debate to which Senator Bacik refers because there are serious divisions on this issue.</P>
        <P>In the context of the Bill, adoption is only available to married couples.  The Supreme Court is clear that a married couple is comprised of a man and a woman.  Any change to this model would require a constitutional amendment.  In my view, however, there are many loving families and what children want more than anything else is a loving family.  There is no reason a loving environment cannot be provided by a single person, a cohabiting heterosexual couple or by any of the other family formations that are becoming more common.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>The sooner we come to grips with that fact the better.  As already stated, however, it would not be appropriate to accept the amendment at this point.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad the Minister of State supports the principle that children are entitled to a loving family of whatever form.  I should have declared an interest in that I am serving as junior counsel in the Zappone-Gilligan case, which has not yet been heard by the Supreme Court.  This will be the first occasion on which this issue, namely the definition of marriage and whether marriage is confined to a man and a woman, will be put before the Supreme Court.  The latter has not yet resolved the issue in a case in which it has been directly in point.</P><Col N="366"/>
        <P>It should be remembered there are already many gay couples with children in Ireland.  In the interests of those children, we should be introducing some form of legislation to regularise their position <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> their own parents.</P>

        <P LI="1">In page 17, between lines 25 and 26, to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="1">&ldquo;(4) In this Act, &ldquo;special guardianship order&rdquo; means an order appointing one or more individuals to be a child&rsquo;s &ldquo;special guardian&rdquo; (or special guardians).

It is based on a provision in section 115 of the UK&rsquo;s Adoption and Children Act 2002, which creates a special guardianship order by inserting a new provision, section 14A, into the UK&rsquo;s 1989 Act.  On Committee Stage I outlined the effect special guardianship orders would have in Ireland.  The introduction of such orders has been recommended by two expert groups, one of which was chaired by the late Dr. Joe Robbins.  There are, therefore, already expert recommendations in existence in this country which advocate the introduction of special guardianship.</P>
        <P>A special guardianship order provides permanence for children for whom adoption is not appropriate.  It is, therefore, a halfway house which goes further than foster care but which is not as permanent or final as adoption.  In jurisdictions where provision is made for such orders, courts may make them in respect of a child on the application, in particular, of a foster parent with whom the child has lived for at least one year prior to the application.  The idea is to provide for situations where children have been living with foster parents for some time where the latter are, in all but name, acting as their parents but where these children do not, for particular reasons, want to break all ties with their birth parents or where it is not appropriate that they should break those ties but where they wish to be in a more permanent relationship with their foster parents.  Such foster parents may be a relative of some form.</P>
        <P>A special guardian takes on parental responsibility for the child, including all responsibility for day-to-day decisions relating to his or her care and upbringing in law.  Under the special guardianship model, the natural or birth parent retains some limited rights, including whether to consent to the child&rsquo;s placement for adoption.  A special guardianship order gives certain rights to the child and his or her guardian, for example that they may leave the country on holiday together.  It also provides for retaining a link with the birth parents.  Special guardianship is appropriate in cases where fostering does not provide adequate permanence for a child but where an adoption order would also not be appropriate.  The Minister of State indicated some interest in this idea on Committee Stage.  I am putting forward this model, very much based on the UK&rsquo;s, as one he may wish to adopt.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment.  It is a useful one that follows the principle of placing the interests of the child as paramount.  It provides for a special relationship with a special guardian in circumstances where the birth mother may find it difficult or there may be some obstruction but a link with the birth parents is still retained.  At the same time, it prevents the child having a new surname imposed upon him or her, thereby distancing him or her from his or her roots, or the child being removed from the jurisdiction.  This is a carefully considered amendment.  A court procedure is involved so it cannot be lightly entered into but carefully progressed with due regard given to legal restraints given that a special guardianship would be a serious undertaking by anyone.</P>
        <P>There may be circumstances where it could also be used for the protection of a child.  The provision appears to me to be a sort of guardian <i>ad litem</i> clause where a child may be in danger in his or her original circumstances and can be removed and placed into the custody of a special guardian.  The guardian <i>ad litem</i> clause, introduced after an amendment tabled by the former Senator, Brendan Ryan, and me, only goes so far.  It only represents the child in court; it is only a legal position.  This amendment goes further because it opens the possibility of someone taking a human interest in the child.  It is all very well for the child to have the right to a guardian <i>ad litem</i> to defend him or her in court.  That is a very abstract notion.  To have someone warm, loving and caring in the background to take on, when necessary, the function of a parent is a good and humane action and enshrines the principle of the primacy of the rights of the child.  I recommend this amendment to the Minister of State and hope some move will be made in this area.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>On Committee Stage, the Minister of State expressed some interest in this amendment and said he would seek legal advice on it.  Did he and what is he considering to do with the clause on this Stage?  If he will not include it in this Bill, will it be included in the civil partnership legislation?</P>
        <P>This thoughtful amendment suggests a system to provide guardianship rights to the non-biological parent of a child of a same-sex partnership.  It would be supportive and protective of children.  For example, it proposes: &ldquo;While a special guardianship order is in force with respect to a child, no person may cause the child to be known by a new surname or remove him from the jurisdiction, without either the written consent of every person who has parental responsibility for the child or the leave of the court.&rdquo;  It is important to have these sorts of protections in such cases.</P>
        <P>The provision is similar to the guardian <i>ad litem</i> provision which we have been very slow to develop in this jurisdiction.  It has been in place in England for a long time.  I have experience of how it works in adoption assessments and consider it helpful as a system and way of working.</P>
        <P>While it would seem the Minister of State will not be accepting this amendment, I would like to hear his views on its proposals.  Does he believe there is a gap in the existing legislation?  If he is not considering accepting the amendment in this legislation, will he consider it for the civil partnership legislation?</P>

      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Bacik&rsquo;s amendment.  I was unaware of this issue but the main objective of this legislation is the welfare and benefit of the child.  The amendment identifies many of the issues in the field such as the category of person allowed to apply for special guardianship being a local authority foster parent with whom the child has lived for at least one year immediately preceding the application.  The amendment tackles the various challenges we are not yet handling.  If the Minister of State has a problem with the general theme of this, it may well be that he has to make some changes to some detail of which we are unaware.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>This amendment has much merit.  Families do get into difficulties and there are times when they need a helping hand.  Occasions arise when a special guardian may be needed temporarily.  There are occasions when a child may be out of control and the parent, parenting on her own, cannot manage.  It is also important a child in such a guardianship is not given a different surname or removed from the jurisdiction.</P>
        <P>I support this amendment because it maintains the critical link with the birth parent.  Its provisions would also give the courts greater flexibility when searching for a suitable person to care for a child.  The amendment recognises everything in parenting is not mainstream.  We have to legislate for when life is not perfect and this is a good example of that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>On Committee Stage, I said this proposal was an intriguing solution to this issue.  I also referred to the Adoption Act 1988, whereby an adoption order can be sought in respect of someone in long-term foster care provided tight criteria are met.  That is transposed into this Bill.  There is a constitutional requirement due to an Article 26 reference in the Bill.</P>
        <P>The position of foster children has improved dramatically over recent years.  In cases where a foster child is with parents for five years or more, the parents can apply for passports in their name and consent to medical treatment for them while they are entitled to the same benefits under gift tax as natural children.</P>
        <P>The amendment does not refer to what type of child would be eligible for special guardianship.  Senator Bacik spoke of the type of children for whom one may seek a special care order.  Is this the type she had in mind or is it more than one category?</P>
        <P>The amendment proposes the effect of a special guardianship order is that while the order remains in force, a special guardian appointed by the order has parental responsibility for the child in respect of whom it is made and, subject to any other order in force with respect to the child under this or any other Act, a special guardian is entitled to exercise parental responsibility to the exclusion of any other person with parental responsibility for the child, apart from another special guardian.</P>
        <P>The clause, &ldquo;exclusion of any other person&rdquo;, may give rise to constitutional problems.</P>
        <P>I have sought legal advice on the best vehicle for this matter and whether it can be provided for without constitutional amendment.  The options include the Civil Partnership Bill or amendments to the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964 or the Child Care Act 1991.  I will consult the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on these options in due course.</P>

	<P>In light of the Minister of State&rsquo;s comments, I will not press the amendment.  I am glad the issue will be revisited.  As I noted earlier, two expert reports have recommended the introduction of a special guardianship measure.  I have only transposed some of the relevant provisions from English law as an example of what can be done.  Clearly, much more detail would be required in respect of any legislation providing for this.  For example, detailed special guardianship regulations are in place in England to prescribe the procedures and the children who are eligible.  I have raised the matter simply to seek the Minister of State&rsquo;s support in principle.  I accept the matter could be easily addressed through other legislation and thank him for his attention to it.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 17, between lines 39 and 40, to insert the following:</P><Col N="370"/>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;(<i>e</i>) providing information, advice and counselling to a birth parent wishing to consider placing a child for adoption;&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Section 4 of the Bill makes arrangements for the adoption of a child, whether on a domestic or inter-country basis, and sets out the various issues which need to be taken into account when making an adoption order.  This amendment would ensure the provision of information, advice and counselling to birth parents forms an integral part of the adoption process.  It is a straightforward amendment which provides the woman in such a situation an opportunity to consider carefully the implications of her decision.  There is no doubt that standards have improved dramatically both in Ireland and internationally in the way birth mothers are looked after but problems continue to arise in some areas.  The reason we spend so much time discussing standards is because this area is vulnerable to abuse.  In certain circumstances, women could be put under pressure to make inappropriate decisions.  That certainly happened in the past.  I move this amendment because it is important to provide support and counselling to birth parents considering whether to place their children for adoption.  It is a safeguard amendment to ensure appropriate counselling is made available.</P>
        <P>Given the focus of the Hague Convention, I presume the Minister of State is raising the issue of standards in his negotiations with Vietnam.  This causes anxiety among people, however, because more than 600 families have already adopted children from that country.  If an issue arises regarding standards, one must ask why we allowed these apparently successful adoptions.  What are the new barriers to the agreement?  The Minister of State is unable to clarify the issues that have arisen in terms of standards and has asked us to take him at his word when he states he will make every effort to conclude an agreement.  I accept his good intentions in that regard and am sure he wants to reach an agreement but standards are important.  We must ensure birth parents receive the highest possible level of support when making what is often a difficult decision.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment.  I regard this amendment as providing for the minimum standard.  It is generally the practice that information, advice and counselling is provided to a birth parent who is considering whether to place a child for adoption but there is merit in arguing for requiring this in the legislation.  Correct me if I am wrong in assuming that the only instance in which adequate counselling is not provided is where another member of the family or a new partner adopts the child.</P>
        <P>We have to uphold adoption standards and I recognise the Minister of State is concerned about this issue.  I ask him to clarify for the House the issues that remain outstanding between Ireland and Vietnam in regard to the bilateral agreement.  Some 600 Irish families have adopted Vietnamese children and this country&rsquo;s adoptive parents have a great record.  France and Italy have renewed their bilateral agreements with Vietnam.  What is it we want that the Vietnamese cannot provide?  I would be grateful if the Minister of State could go a little further in giving us information on the human context.  As we all know from the hundreds of e-mails we receive, this is a human issue.  Families are in torment because of the uncertainty.  They have been waiting for years and, just when they thought it was over, this hurdle is put in their path.  It appears the Government is stopping them.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I am happy to support this amendment, which provides that any reference made to issues of principle on the practicality of adoption shall be taken to include the provision of information, advice and counselling to a birth parent wishing to consider placing a child for adoption, because adoption is a serious step.  I presume the amendment only covers the Irish State and has no extraterritorial pretension, even in respect of the other side of the Border.  Vietnam does not figure in this amendment as far as I am concerned but we will have a further opportunity to raise the concerns of parents when we deal with the section.</P>
        <P>The number of children made available for adoption in this State is quite small.  Perhaps the Minister of State can provide the figures in this regard.  Adoption has changed from the traditional context whereby women who became pregnant outside marriage were subject to social pressures.  In some instances, they were forced to give up their children for adoption.  This no longer happens, thank God. Even so, it is a traumatic decision and birth parents who make the decision for whatever reason should be supported by the State through, at the very least, the provision of information so that they can make an informed decision and have professional advice and counselling at what may be a difficult time.</P>

        <P LI="1"><Miles com="bull82" />to restore the original provisions of the Freedom of Information Act 1997.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  The Labour Party is using Private Member&rsquo;s time to make a constructive contribution to the debate about standards in public life, standards in corporate life and citizens&rsquo; rights, which we have led.  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle, Deputy Brendan Howlin, has introduced a Bill to regulate lobbying, our leader, Deputy Eamon Gilmore, has introduced a Bill on corporate governance and it is ten years since we introduced our Bill on whistleblowers protection.  While Fianna F&aacute;il publicly supported the latter Bill, it consistently dodged dealing with it, but these issues can no longer be dodged.</P>
        <P>It is of crucial national importance that these matters are addressed quickly because the Labour Party&rsquo;s proposals are all about restoring the nation&rsquo;s confidence to the level we need &mdash; confidence among citizens, confidence among investors and, ultimately, confidence in our economy.  We are all in agreement that confidence is key to getting ourselves out of recession <Col N="372"/>and putting people back to work.  We need to understand why we have such poor regulation in public and corporate life to address the current lack of confidence in Ireland plc.</P>
        <P>Many of the problems we are experiencing have their roots in the corruption of the past, which resulted in councillors, Ministers and Members from some parties, though not the Labour Party, taking bribes in exchange for favours.  These bribes were primarily connected to planning matters, but serious questions also hang over the connection between corporate political donations and the actions of Ministers.  When the scandals broke around former Deputies Haughey, Burke and Lawlor and a slew of county councillors, the Government, led by Deputy Bertie Ahern, resisted putting in place the required measures to root out questionable payments to politicians.</P>
        <P>Builders and other business interests did not want anything to change nor did a number of political parties.  The reason for this reluctance was twofold.  Some public representatives were just plain greedy and they wanted to pocket the largesse of benefactors but others did it for electoral advantage.  Many educational institutions have gathered ample evidence that the more money a candidate has to spend on a campaign, the better his or her chances of being elected.  Not only did members of some parties accept money for personal gain, they also did it for electoral gain.  This distorted our democracy and the hangover remains.  It continues to affect public confidence in the political system.  The current scandals relating to banks, which also go back to the Haughey era, have undermined confidence in the financial system.  Today people want to know how we can stop the scandal of bad loans and exorbitant executive pay in banks.</P>
        <P>With regard to politics and lobbying, a rather shaky system of checks and balances was eventually put in place.  It remains weak however, reflecting the reluctance to deal with this matter.  The chair of the Standards in Public Office Commission, SIPO, Mr. Justice Matthew Smith, has indicated his dissatisfaction with the regulation of lobbying and political contributions and there have been unforeseen consequences for non-political organisations.  The country is reaping the whirlwind of inaction now more than ever.</P>
        <P>The Labour Party is consistent with its tradition in tabling the motion.  We introduced the first Freedom of Information Act in 1997 and the first Ethics in Public Office Act in 1995.  When Fianna F&aacute;il took office without a Labour Party watchdog, it undermined the Freedom of Information Act by breaching the confidentiality of applicants and applying charges to FOI requests.  However, this still allowed too much transparency for Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s liking and the party eventually filleted the Act to recreate the cloak of secrecy around its clientelist ways.  The Information Commissioner, Emily O&rsquo;Reilly, has repeatedly called for the Act&rsquo;s scope to be widened.  In her annual report published last month she commented on the increase in requests regarding financial institutions, stating:</P>
        <P LI="1">This new thirst for information should cue a re-evaluation of the role of FOI in holding such institutions to account.  I have noted before how many of the state institutions are outside the scope of FOI including the Central Bank and Financial Services Regulatory Authority of Ireland, the National Treasury Management Agency, the National Pensions Reserve Fund Commission and the State Claims Agency.  I have also commented before on the secrecy provisions which are contained in the legislation establishing a number of public bodies and which, by virtue of the provision not being included in the Third Schedule to the FOI Act, are outside the scope of the FOI Act.</P>
        <P FLI="0">She is referring fundamentally to a citizen&rsquo;s right by calling for the creation of structures that create public confidence.  It is not good enough to demand sacrifice from the public while doing nothing to break up the &ldquo;golden circle&rdquo; at the top that got us into this mess and to prevent it from forming again.</P><Col N="373"/>
        <P>To that end, our party leader, Deputy Eamon Gilmore, brought forward the Corporate Governance (Codes of Practice) Bill 2009.  We hear constantly about the need to position ourselves for the upswing in the global economy, but the solution to our problems is not only about financial restraint, it is also about financial controls.  We must engender trust to engender confidence.  We need to ensure money flows into Irish companies and by creating a regulatory regime in which investors can feel they trust a company&rsquo;s board, we can restore that confidence.  The first step towards that is a legally enforceable code of good corporate governance.  My party&rsquo;s Bill recognises that a one-size-fits-all approach will not work.  That is why it suggests that codes of practice vary depending on the size of the company.</P>
        <P>Our Bill empowers the Central Bank to draw up codes of practice, which this legislation would make legally binding, but there must be public oversight in the drafting of such codes.  We, therefore, propose that the Central Bank submits a draft code to the Minister for Finance and the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service, which could make recommendations to the Minister.  In this way, the code would be developed in an open and transparent manner and the views of companies and their stakeholders could be heard in the open so the public could make a judgment on whether the regulations serve their purpose.  As part of that principle, this legislation also covers financial reporting.  It makes the ISEQ&rsquo;s corporate disclosure provisions legally enforceable.  Currently, corporate interests can simply explain the reason they do not intend to comply with the disclosure provisions.  In other words, board directors can declare to shareholders that they will not be transparent about the way the company is being run.  That is not good enough.</P>
        <P>People&rsquo;s pensions, savings and sometimes their incomes are reliant on a functioning and healthy market.  Market dysfunction affects many people and those worst affected are small investors.  We have seen how the secrecy of company directors has contributed to the financial meltdown we are experiencing both here in Ireland and globally.  That is the reason there is a number of specific provisions regarding company directors in this legislation.</P>
        <P>If chairs and chief executives are to have such vast salaries and bonuses, the buck must stop with them.  They must have direct responsibility for ensuring good corporate governance.  If boards are to provide a proper oversight function for shareholders, the practice of a chief executive also being chair of the company must come to an end.  This Bill provides for that.</P>
        <P>The Bill also prohibits a former chief executive officer becoming chair of the same company and bars non-executive directors serving on a board for more than seven consecutive years.  It also stops the cosy practice of cross-directorships.  The potential for conflicts of interest is far too great.  To put it in language Members on the opposite side of the House will understand, we cannot have public and international confidence in Irish corporate governance if the boards of companies resemble golf courses that everyone gets to play eventually.  That is the reason the Labour Party is proposing such a comprehensive set of measures.</P>
        <P>This country has been run not just by a golden circle but by a golden chain, from wealthy interests seeking favourable tax treatment and secret meetings with bankers, to political favouritism in public appointments all the way down to local level.  In counties such as Wexford and Kerry rezonings continue to be promoted for private gain and political donations.  All the while, the Government has been holding back the tide of demands for transparent governance.  Green Party Members once agreed with us on this but they now drag their heels as they continue with their &ldquo;my Government right or wrong&rdquo; approach.  Either they support crony capitalism or they oppose it.  In politics, one cannot afford to be ambivalent.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh.  I second the motion proposed by Senator Hannigan.  My colleague outlined the reason the Labour Party is moving this motion and spoke in detail about our corporate governance proposals.  We must <Col N="374"/>have an accountable economic system but we also need an accountable social system.  One of the ways of doing that is to remove any suspicion that influence can be bought.  The public is right to be suspicious because, as Senator Hannigan outlined, influence has been bought in Irish politics in the past and the abuse of the political system for personal gain has arisen again this year in Kerry.</P>
        <P>A strict code limiting political donations to &euro;2,500 for parties and &euro;1,000 for individuals would send a clear signal to our citizens, and the outside world, that influence in Ireland is not for sale.  We cannot allow our democracy to be blown away, so to speak, by money either.  The Lisbon treaty campaign might not have been lost had our proposals on political funding been in place, but we must learn a lesson from the success of Libertas and the controversy that surrounds that party&rsquo;s funding.</P>
        <P>Under our proposals, no one would be able to use their personal wealth to have such a profound influence on our democracy again.  The Labour Party wants to go further.  For ten years we have been calling for the registration of lobbyists to ensure the lobbying process can be regulated from both sides.  Currently, lobbying can only be detected by Oireachtas Members declaring their interests and larger political donations.  That undermines public and sometimes commercial confidence in the system.</P>
        <P>The public is entitled to know who wants to influence public policy, especially when legislation with significant financial implications is passed.  It would at least make it more difficult for a hidden hand to have an influence on policy, and politicians will be more accountable for their public statements and their voting record.</P>
        <P>We propose barring people such as ministerial advisers and members of State boards becoming paid lobbyists for two years after they leave their brief.  The aim is to stamp out cronyism and undue influence in the running of government.</P>
        <P>Restoring the powers of the Freedom of Information Act to its position when Labour introduced it would add to our reputation internationally as an open and transparent democracy.  That is particularly important in light of the Government&rsquo;s national assets management agency plan.  It is essential also from a public confidence point of view because it would be unthinkable for a country which has been screwed by an alliance of builders, banks and Government to allow NAMA to act in secret.  Public probity in business and Government is not a political football.  It is an economic and social imperative.</P>

        <P FLI="0">I join with other speakers in welcoming the Minister.  I welcome the opportunity of making some points on the motion before the House, which I will not support.  I will support the Government amendment.</P><Col N="376"/>
        <P>I wish to state on my behalf and on behalf of my colleagues on the Government side that we do not condone any political wrongdoing or bribe taking, which has been perpetrated in the past.  We would not condone any such behaviour.  Recent Administrations have presided over the introduction of more legislation in this area than any previous Administration and have done more to try to root out the instances that have occurred in the past.</P>
        <P>As Members will be aware, lobbying plays a significant role in our democracy.  We all come into contact every day with some form of lobbying from individuals and organisations.  I am aware that representatives of the Irish Cancer Society are in the House today making representations on how they would like their views practised.  Groups from a variety of interests, whether it be economic, professional or, as with the Irish Cancer Society, civil society, engage in lobbying.  Lobbying is conducted through varying forms of communication to influence our political decisions, Government and legislation that is brought forward.</P>
        <P>Ireland may be unique in that individuals and groups can easily access their local representatives be they TDs, councillors or Senators, and that is to be welcomed.  In the United Kingdom the process is much more distant.  Before I was elected to this House I appreciated that people enjoyed unprecedented access to their public representatives.  That is not a process from which we should move away.</P>
        <P>In recent years the Government has introduced several pieces of legislation and codes of conduct on the work we, as elected representatives, carry out and how that work should be done.  In the past ten to 15 years this and previous Governments have introduced more legislation in that regard than at any other time in the history of the State.  We have had the Local Elections (Disclosure of Donations and Expenditure) Act, amended in 2001 to include expenditure and donations disclosure regimes at local elections and annual donation disclosure for all councillors.  We had the Electoral Act 1997, amended in 2004, on the expenditure and donations disclosure regime at D&aacute;il, European, presidential and Seanad elections, although limits must be introduced in the context of Seanad elections.  We have had the Standards in Public Office Act 2001, which established the Standards in Public Office Commission.  We have had the Prevention of Corruption (Amendment) Act 2001 to provide for a presumption of corruption in certain cases.  We have had the Local Government Act 2001 which modernised local government law which provided for an updated ethics infrastructure, a requirement for annual declaration and disclosure of interest for the local government.  The Proceeds of Crime (Amendment) Act 2005 gives additional powers to bolster the operation of the Criminal Assets Bureau in the fight against all forms of crime, including white collar crime and corruption.  We also had the Ethics in Public Office (Amendment) Act 2007.</P>
        <P>Various codes of conduct have been established for parliamentary Members and county councillors.  We have had a number of tribunals and while much good work has been done by the tribunals, it is time they began to wrap up their work.  We have seen some political wrongdoing in the past but as a public representative I would much prefer to see the garda&iacute; investigate such matters to ensure that when wrongdoing is found, people receive the full rigours of the law in terms of punishment if they are found to be in receipt of bribes or abusing their positions.</P>
        <P>In addition to this legislation by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, the Minister commissioned reports in 2001 by the Institute of Public Administration and again in 2006 by Dr. Raj Chari of Trinity College and Dr. Murphy of DCU on assessing the best international practices in the regulation of lobbying.  Many of these proposals are currently being reviewed by the Department with a view to bringing forward legislation to regulate lobbying.  I look forward to that.  The Minister, Deputy John Gormley, is actively considering it.</P><Col N="377"/>
        <P>I thank the Labour Party for tabling this motion.  There is always a way to make good existing legislation better and there will always be a need for the Houses of the Oireachtas to monitor and adjust legislation continually according to the ever-changing needs of our economy and civil society.</P>
        <P>A study is currently being carried out by Trinity College, Dublin.  It has reviewed the Labour Party&rsquo;s corporate governance Bill on the regulation of lobbyists.  It found that if implemented as it stands, Ireland would be lowly to medium regulated.  According to the review, we would be above Poland but below Lithuania and Hungary.  While there might be good aspects to the Labour Party&rsquo;s proposals, we should aspire to introduce improvements that would allow the country to score a little better than that.  One of the main proposals in the Bill is a cooling-off period but only for political advisers, not politicians.  The report is of the view that this weakens the Bill considerably.</P>
        <P>With regard to developing a system for whistleblowers&rsquo; protection, in March 2009 a Government sponsored report by Transparency International, entitled National Integrity Systems &mdash; Country Study, was produced following a study carried out over two and a half years.  One of the primary recommendations of this report was that protection for whistleblowers should be introduced through anti-corruption safeguards across the public and private sectors.  The Government in recent years has been implementing protection for whistleblowers on a sectoral basis.  There is still no formal word from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform on implementing an overall national safeguard framework but work is continuing in that regard.  The report found that Ireland, by international standards, has the lowest level of petty corruption, which is encouraging.  That is not to suggest we do not have continuing challenges to meet and continuing changes to make.</P>
        <P>There have been changes to the Freedom of Information Act.  Before I became a Member of the House I was a regular user of that Act when I worked in the chambers of commerce movement.  I used it to facilitate the movement&rsquo;s work.  There were frustrations about information that was not available and I certainly felt them as chief executive officer of Sligo Chamber of Commerce on certain issues.  However, one can appreciate the need for confidentiality at certain times and the need for Cabinet confidentiality.  At the same time, I understand the frustrations.  It is something we should monitor.  I was interested in the views expressed by the Information Commissioner, Ms Emily O&rsquo;Reilly.  The Department should continue to monitor the issue and be flexible in making changes as may be appropriate when issues are raised in debates such as this and by our Labour Party and Fine Gael colleagues and Members of the Houses generally.  The introduction of fees was a necessary evil.  When one considers the current economic situation, it is certainly appropriate, as it was with the fees applying to objections to planning permissions.  For a credible objection or a credible application under the Freedom of Information Act, it is appropriate that there should be a fee.</P>
        <P>I welcome the opportunity to discuss these issues.  The Labour Party tabled the motion in good faith but I support the Government amendment.  I am sure the Minister and the Government are willing to listen to innovative and constructive suggestions that could make improvements to what I believe is already good legislative change over recent years in the areas of corporate governance, freedom of information and lobbying.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>The motion is non-contentious and I do not understand why the Government could not agree to it.  The motion invites the Government to act on certain legislation, political lobbying, whistleblowers&rsquo; protection, good corporate governance and restoring the original provisions of the Freedom of Information Act 1997.  It does not condemn the Government but invites it to act in these areas.  I do not see a problem with that and do not <Col N="378"/>understand why the Government insists on proposing an amendment which bears little relation to the motion.</P>
        <P>The main proposal in the amendment is that the Seanad should commend the Government on a number of measures which concern more general economic matters and the management of the economy and public finances.  That is rather ironic.  The amendment states that the Government has done a good job in the management and control of the public finances by reducing the level of public debt.  We know the public debt doubled in the last two years under the Government and Taoiseach, Deputy Brian Cowen.  The amendment commends the Government on restoring the credibility and sustainability of the public finances &mdash; whatever that means given that the public finances are in disarray &mdash; and suggests this provides the basis for Ireland to benefit from the global upswing, whenever that comes.  However, everybody knows that restoring competitiveness in the Irish economy is what will lay the basis for Ireland to benefit from the upswing.</P>
        <P>The amendment also mentions the supplementary budget and the Government&rsquo;s work on restoring the financial stability of the banking system.  However, it has clearly failed to do that.  By the day, the proposals relating to the national asset management agency, NAMA, are coming unstuck.  To set up a new organisation and structure to deal with the bad debts and toxic assets of the banks would take ten years at the pace at which the Government has attempted to introduce this.  The confrontational nature of the Government&rsquo;s amendment is needless, beside the point and does not address the Labour Party motion, which I consider to be well grounded.</P>
        <P>The lack of confidence in crony capitalism, the Government and corporate governance all starts with the political process and culture in this country.  It is the political culture that has existed under successive Fianna F&aacute;il Governments.  An article in today&rsquo;s <i>Financial Times</i> states:</P>
        <P LI="1">Ireland has come through more than 10 years of judicial tribunals that exposed a culture of corruption in planning and property development.  Bertie Ahern, Brian Cowen&rsquo;s predecessor as Irish prime minister, was forced to step down last year amid questioning by the tribunal into his business affairs.  Recent banking scandals have merely added to Ireland&rsquo;s image problems.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This Government has created the problem and the political culture.  Its appointments to State bodies and key economic organisations within the economy has added to the problem of securing good governance, good control, proper scrutiny and proper standards.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>As has been mentioned, there is a series of legislative measures to ensure standards in public life, including the Standards in Public Office Act, the Ethics in Public Office Act and so forth.  However, these are just words if they are not adhered to.  We know about the obligations of politicians and public representatives, for example, to have tax clearance certificates, but when the Taoiseach of the day does not have a tax clearance certificate, there is cynicism about the political process.  The entire Government criticised the work of the Mahon tribunal, which was established to restore confidence in the political process, and Judge Mahon for the manner in which he was conducting the tribunal with regard to the Taoiseach of the day.  There must be a change in the political culture that has inculcated and promoted this type of governance, lack of responsibility and lack of transparency in our public affairs.  It has permeated the business and banking communities.</P>
      
        <P>Let us start with appointments to State bodies.  When questioned about the appointment of a particular gentleman as a director of a State body, the former Taoiseach said he was a friend of his.  They are the standards that have traditionally been applied by this Government to State <Col N="379"/>appointments.  Qualifications and background checks are not taken into account.  In general, significant checks are made on the competence and eligibility of persons to be appointed as directors of companies in the private sector, but those standards have not been applied by the Government.</P>
        <P>Fine Gael&rsquo;s spokesperson on enterprise, Deputy Varadkar, introduced the Public Appointments Transparency Bill 2008 to legislate for the appointment of persons to State bodies.  He proposes that appointees would be subject to scrutiny by the relevant committees of the Oireachtas and that they would also be subject to being called before those committees to account for the performance of their functions.  The Bill also proposes that the qualifications of all ministerial appointees to State boards and other State bodies would be laid before the D&aacute;il and that they would be subject to scrutiny by the relevant committees.  That is where it starts, namely, with our respect for the standards with which we, as public representatives, are obliged to comply and where we have an influence on corporate governance in terms of appointments to State bodies.  We should start there.  In putting forward the Bill, Fine Gael has attempted to do that.</P>
        <P>We have much legislation.  The Government&rsquo;s amendment points to other legislation that has been introduced.  We have the Office of Corporate Enforcement, the fraud squad, the Financial Regulator, the Companies Acts, the possibility of having court appointed inspectors to examine the affairs of companies and, ultimately, the Criminal Assets Bureau.  However, when an issue arises, unless there is a public outcry, those provisions and mechanisms do not seem to function very well.  When we heard of the disclosure about the Anglo Irish Bank-Se&aacute;n FitzPatrick loans in December, all the Minister for Finance said about the matter was that it was disappointing, instead of ensuring that the matter was fully investigated and that the law was applied.  It was only belatedly, following the public outcry, that the wheels began to move on this matter.</P>
        <P>On the same subject, an article that appeared in a newspaper today suggested that auditors warned the Irish Nationwide about loans to Se&aacute;n FitzPatrick.  That all misses the point, namely, whether the standards that were applied in concealing those loans complied with the Companies Acts and directives and regulations on market abuse and sensitive information about public companies.  Those are the issues.  The problem is that there is no leadership on standards because there is no credibility in the Government and its leadership on these matters.  That is where the problem lies.  I support the Labour Party motion and commend it to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Senator John Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I note the wording of the motion, &ldquo;That Seanad &Eacute;ireann, recognising that Ireland is crippled by a lack of confidence, lack of confidence among consumers; lack of confidence among investors in our banks; lack of confidence in the Government; calls on the Government, as a step towards restoring confidence, to demonstrate its seriousness about rooting out corruption, corporate sleaze and crony capitalism by introducing a series of measures, including legislation&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>The first thing the speaker opposite suggested is that we accept that innocuous motion, which of course is patently unacceptable.  The salient points in the motion refer to the need &ldquo;to regulate the practice of political lobbying; to develop a system for whistleblowers&rsquo; protection; to ensure good corporate governance.&rdquo;  I have some good news for the Labour Party on those first three points, which is that they are being comprehensively dealt with by the Government.  The recently published Finance Bill will help to ensure the progressive implementation of any adjustments needed in the economy and to provide for a proportionate sharing of the burden of this adjustment.  There is a commitment in the programme for Government to regulate political lobbying and many initiatives have been taken in Departments to extend whistleblowing protection.</P><Col N="380"/>
        <P>A substantial body of company law exists to provide for good corporate governance under the Companies Acts 1963 to 2006 and the work of the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement must also be taken into account.  In addition, we should recognise the work of the company law review group in producing proposals for the major reform and consolidation of the 13 Companies Acts, resulting early next year in the publication of significant legislation of 1,250 sections.  That Bill will be in the House shortly.</P>
        <P>The Companies (Amendment) Bill 2009 will provide for enhanced powers for the Director of Corporate Enforcement in his efforts to ensure compliance with the company law code and to improve the transparency of loans made by companies that are licensed banks to their directors and to persons connected with them.  We also note the continued operation of the freedom of information legislation.  The fourth point in the Labour Party motion was to restore the original provisions of the Freedom of Information Act 1997, which were causing unnecessary burdens and had to be altered.</P>
        <P>Since the Government came to office we have introduced codes of practice and legislation, including the Standards in Public Office Act 2001 that established the Standards in Public Office Commission and the Prevention of Corruption (Amendment) Act 2001, which provided for the presumption of corruption in certain areas, the Local Government Act 2001, which modernised local government law, the Proceeds of Crime (Amendment) Act 2005, and the Ethics in Public Office Act 2007.  It is clear that the Government has worked strongly to promote openness, transparency and good government.</P>
        <P>The necessary work that had to be undertaken by the Government was not at all times supported by the Opposition.  I refer in particular to the nationalisation of Anglo Irish Bank, a bank of systemic importance to the Irish economy.  I note that an Opposition spokesperson referred to the nationalisation of the bank as an attempt to bail out the friends of Fianna F&aacute;il.  In political terms that is not correct.  In economic terms it was extremely damaging to this country abroad.  At this time of economic uncertainty, comments such as that were bound to lead to repercussions, and that was the case.</P>
        <P>We also had difficulty underpinning the banks, as if anyone would wish to extend &euro;7 billion to the banks for any other purpose than to save those banks and to provide sufficient liquidity for business so that they might survive, rather than the many other deserving areas we were unable to support with the limited means at our disposal.  We had to ensure that we had a financial system and economy.  If one has no economy, there is no support for the necessary social welfare we upheld and maintained at the most difficult time in this country.</P>
        <P>According to international trends, it appears that we have taken the right approach.  We were in a good position, despite the Opposition questions about what we did with the boom.  At that time 2 million people were at work.  We set up the National Treasury Management Agency, which had a deposit of &euro;19 billion.  We had the lowest tax wedge in the OECD.  We ensured that we catered for the less well-off.  When the bad times came we were able to increase borrowing because if we had not done so, we would have had an economy that was in crisis rather than one that was being managed.</P>
        <P>The world economy is looking forward to coming out of recession in 2010.  Long-term low interest rates are having a strong effect.  The quantitative easing taking place in the UK and the US are also having an effect.  The expectation is that we will start to see the recovery in 2011.  Every day that goes by where people lose jobs or are out of work is very serious.  With that in mind, I hope we have an opportunity in this House to debate some of the positive things that are happening.</P><Col N="381"/>
        <P Just="Left">In spite of the fact that 400 people will be let go over time, there are positive signs at the Dublin Airport Authority for the construction of a second terminal and the development of Dublin Airport city, which is as novel, as innovative and as forward thinking as the IFSC was in its day.  It will attract the type of industry and headquarters to Ireland and to Dublin that we want.  The metro will allow for a huge increase in numbers of up to 30 million passengers to pass through Dublin Airport.  There are positive signs and good things towards which we can look forward.  This economy has been well managed.  This Government was prepared to take the pain and was prepared to take the unpalatable decisions.  We had an Opposition that was prepared to say &ldquo;No&rdquo; to the removal of medical cards from people who were earning &euro;70,000 per annum in pension entitlements &mdash; meaning they were earning &euro;100,000 while working &mdash; but this was unaffordable.  The Government dealt with a very progressive and fair tax system and did so with an eye to what is best for Ireland, rather than what is best for the political party.  That is what this Government has done and will continue to do.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I would welcome a debate on the whole question of corporate governance.  We need to be very careful we do not go too far the other way.  I found myself speaking in different countries over the last few years about the wonderful success of Ireland, but that success was clearly due to a number of factors, including our investment in education, our tax policy, our involvement in Europe and our investment in what I call the sunrise industries.  It was also due to the fact we had a Government policy of making ourselves attractive to investors.  If we go to such pains to protect investors and to protect customers to that extent, we must remember those who invest must take some care themselves.  I have some worry about putting in such red tape and strict controls that will make it less attractive for investors in this country.  I would be loathe to go too far along the road of saying we must protect everybody and we must have so many regulations for that.  We were attractive because we gave freedom to institutions, even if we have had some problems with them recently.  Let us not bend over backwards and make a mistake the other way round.</P>
        <P>I would be very careful about how we place restrictions on the area of appointments to State boards.  If we had examined appointees to the extent they had to go through committees and be cross-examined, as happens in the US, we would not have got some of those people who have been willing to give their time to a State board and offer to help.  Those who have done that &mdash; we picked the best &mdash; would not have wanted to go through a grilling by Members of the Oireachtas before getting the nod.  I am not sure of the answer, but if we are to attract people onto State boards, we must attract the best.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On the other hand, I welcome the suggestion to regulate political lobbyists.  It is an idea which has been recently taken up in Europe.  The European Commission has set up a lobbying register, the Register of Interest Representatives, which lists the names of organisations that attempt to influence European legislation, their stated aims and funding sources among other details.  In a proposal I put for the reform of the Seanad, I suggested all lobbyists should be registered and all lobbying should be open and done here in this House.  It is dangerous to have lobbyists who are not recognised as such and who are expressing an opinion when they are not known to be lobbyists by those opposed to that opinion.  It would be much healthier to have it done openly.</P>
        <P>There have been problems with the register because it is voluntary.  This means that lobbyists in Brussels, who number about 15,000, do not have to sign up if they do not wish to do so and only about 9% of lobbyists have registered so far.  However, the register is growing all the time and there are about 1,500 groups registered as of this week.  The intention is that the register will become compulsory in the coming months.  It is also envisioned that the register will require consultancies and law firms to declare their &ldquo;turnover attributable to lobbying the EU insti<Col N="382"/>tutions&rdquo; alongside the &ldquo;relative weight of their major clients,&rdquo; while inhouse lobbyists and trade associations will need to provide an &ldquo;estimate of the costs associated with direct lobbying&rdquo; in this regard.  NGOs and think-tanks will have to publish their overall budgets and a &ldquo;breakdown&rdquo; of their main sources of funding.  All these quotes are taken from the register&rsquo;s website.</P>
        <P>A similar register could be implemented here.  It would be on a much smaller scale so may be easier to do.  The problems associated with the introduction of the register in Brussels should demonstrate the way to introduce a better system in Ireland and we must have a proper debate on a lobby register being introduced.  It is worthy to bring up the issue in this motion, and I am delighted that has been done.</P>
        <P>The other major issue is whistle-blowing legislation.  We need a different approach to whistle blowing or what is also known as &ldquo;good faith reporting&rdquo; in the public interest.  Perhaps it is an un-lrish thing to do, but the behaviour of some of those in the Irish banking system needed to be shown-up earlier.  We need to afford whistleblowers more protection and commend them for their civic contribution rather than ostracise them as &ldquo;informers&rdquo;.  There are people within the banks who knew of malpractices that were happening but were too scared to come forward.  In particular, employees may come across insider or fraudulent dealing, or falsified or misstated company accounts.  The public interest would therefore benefit greatly from such disclosures.</P>
        <P>We need whistle-blowing legislation more than ever.  Mr. Tony Spollen, who exposed the DIRT scandal at AIB ten years ago, was a good example of the sort of white knight we need.  It was a brave thing to do and there are numerous examples of other brave Irish whistleblowers.  Fr. Gerard McGinnity was removed as senior dean at Saint Patrick&rsquo;s College in Maynooth in 1984 when he tried to draw the attention of the bishop trustees to seminarians&rsquo; concerns about the behaviour of the then college vice-president.  Ms Susan O&rsquo;Keeffe was charged with contempt of court for refusing to name her sources to the beef tribunal following her 1991 &ldquo;World in Action&rdquo; documentary.  Ms Sheenagh McMahon experienced devastating personal repercussions when she revealed in 1999 that her husband, Detective Garda Noel McMahon, had planted home-made explosives, later claiming them as significant IRA explosives finds.  This led to the establishment of the Morris tribunal.</P>
        <P>In her 2006 Lourdes Hospital inquiry report, Judge Maureen Harding Clark noted the resentment towards the four nurses who exposed the systemic wrongs in Drogheda:  &ldquo;We heard of comments to the effect that the whistleblowers would never get a job in Ireland, that they would be sued for defamation and would generally come to a bad end.&rdquo;  Judge Harding Clark listed 11 categories of people who did not complain about Dr. Neary&rsquo;s actions and remarked that &ldquo;No one made a formal complaint and no one questioned him openly&rdquo;.  It is almost ten years since Deputy Pat Rabbitte introduced in the D&aacute;il a Private Members&rsquo; Bill entitled the Whistleblowers Protection Bill 1999.  The Government, in March 2006, said it would not proceed with a general legislative proposal although it has introduced certain whistleblowing provisions in limited areas such as the legislation governing child abuse, consumer protection, some competitive issues, ethics in public office and in respect of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Employees should be able to reveal valuable information about their companies on ethical dealings without having to suffer negative consequences.  The Government appears reluctant to introduce adequate legislation in this regard.  I mentioned those areas because the issue of whistleblowing is one in respect of which we need some form of legislation.  As I said, it is regarded as a non-Irish thing to do.  However, I urge the Minister of State to take on board the intent of the motion.</P>
        <P>While I do not support the motion as a whole, I support the general theme, direction and intention of what it seeks to achieve.  I urge the Minister of State in his reply to give some <Col N="383"/>indication that the Government will recognise that part of this motion deserves serious attention.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LarryButler"><NameTxt>Senator Larry Butler</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Quinn has summed up much of what I was going to say.  Over-regulation in any country is not the way to go.  However, I welcome the motion, most of which is reasonable.  What I do not accept is that the Government has not handled well the extremely difficult situation we have experienced during the past 12 months.  I believe it handled the situation confidently and in a measured way.  The public does not have confidence during times of recession and, as such, no matter what a government does in a recession Joe public, whose money is worth less, will opt to defend rather than spend it.  This is happening not alone in Ireland but worldwide.  Income from taxes on which we depend are down.</P>
        <P>I visited the UK last week where spending on the high street is down by approximately 55%.  That is what counts.  One measures one&rsquo;s taxes by what comes in from the high street.  Currently, the high street has no confidence in the economy.  Until such time as we begin to come out of recession the public will not spend.  Germany did not experience a property bubble but its car manufacturing industry has fallen through the floor.  Some 45,000 people employed in that sector are on short-time working.  If the situation does not improve soon there will be major redundancies in that industry in Germany, Europe and America.  The car industry in America is seeking a further bailout.  It is entirely dependent on the public.</P>
        <P>One must ask oneself why the public decides not to spend money.  The answer is simple: they are afraid to spend money that they might need another time for more important matters, including if they lose their job or need to visit the doctor more often.  These are the types of problems that arise when there is a downturn in an economy.  I have experienced five economic downturns, three in the UK and two here.  I have a great deal of experience in terms of how a downturn in an economy affects a country.  As I said, I went on a short trip to the UK last week.  The construction industry in the UK is virtually non-existent.  There would be nothing happening in the UK in terms of construction were it not for the Olympics.  While most of the infrastructure required is already in place, there are steps that must be taken to prepare for the Olympics.  The UK has handled this situation by imposing extra taxes on people, in particular people in London.  It is interesting to note how other countries are handling the crisis.</P>
        <P>It is natural that people blame the Government for all that has gone wrong.  It is the norm when it rains to blame the Government for the bad weather.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LarryButler"><NameTxt>Senator Larry Butler</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, I accept that.  That is human nature.  I agree with much of what is contained in the motion.  The Government led by former Taoiseach, Liam Cosgrave, was in power in the 1970s.  He is a man for whom I have great regard.  Senator Regan referred to the standards applied by Fianna F&aacute;il in appointments to public office.  The Government at that time was a coalition of Labour, Fine Gael and Democratic Left.  On cronyism, that Government, before going out of office, appointed to public office friends, relations and anybody it could get hold of.  It is not fair for Opposition speakers to lecture this side of the House about cronyism when Labour and Fine Gael did likewise in the 1970s.  I accept neither party has been in office too often since &mdash; they were in office for only a short time, in the Government led by former Deputy John Bruton and as such their ability to make appointments was minimised.    </P>
        <P Just="Left">As Senator Quinn said, people from the private sector, if we make it too difficult for them by wanting to know what they had for breakfast, will be reluctant to give of their time to serve in the public interest.  Many of these people do not need the remuneration they are paid.  Many of them would probably do the job for nothing.  It is important we attract people with the requisite knowledge, skill and expertise in whatever field we require.  The group, Spirit of <Col N="384"/>Ireland, which came together and produced a product for energy supply did not engage in that task for financial reward.  That group is to set up a co-operative in which farmers and other members of the public can purchase shares.  Its aim is to make our country energy efficient.  This has come about because we are in crisis.  It might never have happened were we not experiencing the current crisis.</P>
        <P>It is important we encourage people to come up with ideas and to be of service to the country.  I do not have much time for over-regulation or red tape as this makes much more difficult the start up of new business and job creation, which we all want.  Currently, people wishing to develop an idea or project in the interests of the country cannot do so because our planning laws are too restrictive.  We should have a national plan whereby if it is in the national interest we are able to do it.  We could be self-sufficient in energy in five years.  We cannot be self-sufficient in energy in five years because the planning requirements will not allow it.  We as legislators should change the planning legislation to ensure we deliver to the country.</P>

	<P>Therefore I support the Government amendment to the motion.  It is important for us to continue to ensure our finances are in a strong position.  We need to find a proper solution to the banking problem.  I believe we are a good part of the way there.  We need to ensure the smart economy starts to work for us.  Job creation is the number one issue.  A solution to our energy crisis is critical.  It will create many jobs and reduce our imports by &euro;6 billion every year.  Over ten years the investment would save us approximately &euro;60 billion, which is colossal.  That would put the country back on its feet.  We could be self-sufficient in energy and export it.</P>
        <P>I thank the Minister of State for coming in.  He has been a regular visitor to the House and has certainly been able to keep us up to date on all the banking and other issues that have gone on.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>I was somewhat surprised at the Government&rsquo;s amendment to the Labour Party motion.  The amendment focuses very much on the economy.  I took the spirit of the Labour motion to be about how we behave ourselves in public office or in public service and how the people view public service and public office.  The Government amendment went way off the point on a tangent, which might have been deliberate to stop us talking about what is basically corruption in public life and public service.  There has been a systemic acceptance of corruption in recent years.  We pay lip service to ethics in public office.  However, the history of what has been revealed in the tribunals shows an unbelievable acceptance of corruption.  One could almost say it should be legislated for because it is so endemic.</P>
        <P>For instance, the last Taoiseach turned up with loads of cash and money in bank accounts, and nobody quite knew if some of it was sterling or dollars.  There was a convoluted story about all of it.  He came out with an explanation of having won it on the horses.  There was an acceptance of that.  Would that be accepted in any other civilised country?  A premier who claimed to have won his money on the horses would more or less be forced to resign by his party colleagues.  It was laughed off and joked about.  It goes further than that because there was moral indignation about corruption from the Green Party when it was in Opposition.  When it got its opportunity to go into power, the moral indignation disappeared and it was quite happy to go into power with the very same Taoiseach with whom it had so many problems before it went into power.  It seems that when it comes to achieving power, corruption falls way down in the levels of priority.</P><Col N="385"/>
        <P>We have the same hypocrisy day in and day out when Ministers are caught out.  We have never seen a Minister resign for incompetence or poor behaviour, which reinforces the acceptance of lack of ethics and of corruption in our society.  If those at the top do not feel the need to take responsibility, nobody feels the need to take responsibility, which is what is happening at the moment.  Some people said the former Minister of State, Deputy McGuinness, was a man of principle when he stood up and spoke of the incompetence of the T&aacute;naiste and the way she carries out her duties as a Minister was viewed across the world.  However, he only said this after he was fired.  He was there long enough to realise there was a problem but he was not going to come out and say the country was going down the tubes faster than it should be because of the incompetence of his bosses.  He was quite happy to keep his mouth shut as long as he was holding on to a position of power.</P>
        <P>Part of the problem in the country is that we accept very low standards across the board.  It appears to be accepted as part of our culture.  We get morally indignant about corruption in Irish society.  If people are so concerned about corruption they should consider people like Charles Haughey, Ray Burke, Liam Lawlor and Deputy Bertie Ahern, and ask themselves why they have consistently voted the same people back into power in successive general elections.  That means as a society we have no problems with corruption whatsoever.  The problem with poor principles at the top of Irish politics, especially within the Fianna F&aacute;il Party, is that they contribute to the mess in which we find ourselves.  Those same poor standards and lackadaisical ideas about principles and ethics went right through to the banks.  The excuses made by directors of the boards of Anglo Irish Bank, Bank of Ireland and Irish Life &amp; Permanent to their shareholders in recent weeks make one realise they were all just chasing each other around to make the last buck and fastest buck.  Principle and everything else were just thrown to one side.  We have done nothing to get rid of that.</P>
        <P>One of the greatest concerns I have about coming years is over a party like Libertas and where it could end up.  That party has been extremely coy about its financing and its sources of funding in many of its campaigns.  It is extremely adept at manipulating the media and public opinion.  We have been brought into a crisis, with the concept, no doubt encouraged by the Government Members present, that somehow we are all the same.  I am sure the Minister of State, as a keen historian, will accept this was the sort of scenario we saw in Germany in the 1930s where someone was able to take power on the back of very spurious concerns.</P>
        <P>If we are really serious about doing something about this, there is a need particularly for Members from the Government parties to show principles.  They need to understand the concepts of whistle blowing and freedom of information.  Freedom of information is about protecting our democracy.  It was 60 years ago this year that John A. Costello declared Ireland a Republic.  While we have much to be proud of, we equally have much of which we should not be so proud.  Much of that has arisen from the dominance of one political party.  I would like to hear the response of the Minister of State.  We should stay away from the economic arguments for the moment and stick to the principles of ourselves as public representatives in public service.  We should put to one side corruption and the abuse of public office in order to enrich ourselves or a small group of people.  That corruption has totally discredited the political system here in recent years.</P>

	<P>To a great extent the motion and amendment before the House are overshadowed by the severe global difficulties and the impact on our economy.  It was interesting to hear the last speaker, who made a few very valid points.</P>
        <P>It amazes me that a Senator should state in this Chamber that Members should stay away from economic arguments at a time in our history when we probably face the most severe economic difficulties.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Senator Ivor Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>Were the public informed and questioned on the merits or otherwise of this debate, I believe a level of dismay would be recorded.  I am convinced that public reaction would be positive, were there an agreed motion with detailed specifics and a precise understanding of what is involved in respect of restoring confidence and helping to turn around the economy.</P>
        <P>I attended another meeting today and although it was held in private session, those Members who were present undoubtedly will not mind my putting on record that there was unanimity among the political groups on one important issue, namely, recognition that Ireland has lost its edge of competitiveness and the measures that will be necessary to restore it.  I made a number of points regarding matters that must be considered and on which action must be taken, perhaps in consultation with the social partners.  Certainly, issues that affect our competitiveness must be parked for the time being.  All Members are fully <i>au fait</i> with the issues and ingredients that are having an impact on our competitiveness and they need the political courage to spell out the measures that are necessary.  I should add that in the few minutes available to me in this debate, I do not have sufficient time to go into great detail and can only touch briefly on a couple of points.</P>
        <P>The current economic and political position is a frightening and traumatic experience for nearly everyone in our community.  The level of uncertainty and lack of confidence is real for most people and families.  If Members are genuine about their practices, they should try to steer away from the &ldquo;them and us&rdquo; syndrome and from muck-slinging in the hope that if one throws enough muck, some of it will stick.  This is not helpful at this time in particular.  Members are in this crisis together and the public expects them to get out of this crisis.  Members&rsquo; ability to work together in difficult times has never been more important.  They face an historic challenge which must be addressed head on.  They should seize the opportunity to develop new concepts, approaches and a period of fresh creativity.  Otherwise, there may well be, as the previous speaker noted, a revolutionary transition in respect of current systems, political institutions and processes.</P>
        <P>The Labour Party proposal on corporate governance has merit, as do the Fine Gael proposals on some of these matters, such as appointments to State bodies.  On the other hand, as Senator Quinn rightly noted, the question arises as to how to get the balance right if one chooses to adopt the system used in the United States Congress, whereby committees hold confirmation hearings into every State appointment and what impact that ultimately has.  I believe there is a balance to be struck in this regard.</P>
        <P>I listened to Senator Regan&rsquo;s contribution on competitiveness in the economy and wholeheartedly agree with his point in this regard.  Moreover, having listened to the debate to date, I agree with what Senators MacSharry and Hanafin outlined regarding the provisions and mechanisms that are in place, as well as the legislation that has been introduced in recent years.  I believe Senator Butler referred to the accusation that we have blown the boom.  I make this point to all Members because what I have witnessed in my short time in this House is that all of us both lived and enjoyed the boom.  I have participated in debates in both Houses of the Oireachtas in which Members on all sides suggested when we had the money, we should do this or that and should spend more.  I cannot recall great disagreement from Members when measures were being introduced by the Government that now is under fire for taking certain measures.  At that time, I cannot recall such disagreement and the record will show&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Senator Ivor Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>Perhaps it would be interesting to conduct a forensic revision of the debates on all such matters, including those mentioned by Senator Hannigan, to ascertain whether any group had a magic wand or the vision to state that a particular measure was not appropriate, what it envisaged would happen and what other mechanisms it believed would be required to address what would come to fruition a number of years later.  Members will acknowledge that while hindsight is great, they probably all would prefer to shy away from such a forensic revision of contributions to debates on the aforementioned issues.  I gather the answer would be negative for all Members.</P>
        <P>It would be fair &mdash; the public would greatly appreciate it &mdash; were Members somewhat humble in their approach to the present state of affairs.  They should put their hands up, state they all made mistakes, that they do not have a magic wand or the necessary answers and that matters are changing at such a rapid pace that they must change to address those issues.</P>

      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Senator Ivor Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>This is the reason I noted at the outset that it is regrettable that Members have such a short time.  This is such an important issue to try to squeeze into a few minutes.</P>
        <P>I wish to keep to the forefront of Members&rsquo; minds that no matter how one wishes to turn or twist it, they are discussing real-life issues and human beings.  Great numbers of individual human problems have arisen, in addition to distress and an impact on living standards.  While great hopes had been built up, it has been followed rapidly by tragic disappointment.  All Members must be honest and forthcoming with people in regard to the country&rsquo;s actual position and the measures that now are necessary.  Everyone, including the public, has been bombarded to an extent with news on how the Government and its agencies, the Opposition and individual political groupings are dealing with such difficulties, as well as on the measures they consider to be necessary.  At present, what is most necessary is to rebuild the trust of the public.  I do not refer to rebuilding such trust by any individual group, the Government alone, its agencies, the Opposition or any political grouping.  First and foremost, the trust of the public in Members as public representatives must be rebuilt.  Some of the measures that have been referred to constitute steps in the right direction.  Equally however, some of the measures that have been introduced in recent years also constitute steps in the right direction.  I accept the point which has been made to me and undoubtedly to everyone else in the Chamber, that people seek guidance and leadership at this difficult time.</P>
        <P>While I can discern from the Leas-Chathaoirleach&rsquo;s body language that my time is up, as I mentioned at the outset Members&rsquo; ability to work together in difficult times has never been more important and will be most appreciated by the public at large.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Senator Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Ba mhaith liom mo chuid ama a roinnt leis an Seanad&oacute;ir Mullen.  Ba mhaith liom taca&iacute;ocht a thabhairt don r&uacute;n at&aacute; curtha chun tosaigh ag P&aacute;irt&iacute; an Lucht Oibre agus ba mhaith liom labhairt faoi dh&aacute; ph&aacute;irt den r&uacute;n, an reachta&iacute;ocht maidir le whistleblowers&rsquo; protection agus faoin Acht a bhaineann le freedom of information.  These are the specific matters I wish to address.  Regarding political lobbying, at the time of the Companies Act 1990, the banks used their influence to ensure they were exempt from provisions that prohibited <Col N="388"/>loans to companies&rsquo; directors.  I spoke on this previously when the Minister of State was in the Chamber.  We saw how this measure was used by banks.</P>
        <P>The reference to political lobbying in this motion is important.  Legislation along the lines of the False Claims Act in the US is urgently needed in Ireland.  This Act contains strong whistleblower legislation and provides incentives to report fraud.  Since 1986, when the Act was established, it has returned over $20 billion to the American people.  The False Claims Act is about far more than money.  It is about discouraging fraud and changing the corporate culture.  Under the Act, those who knowingly submit or cause another to submit false claims for the repayment of government funds are liable for three times the government&rsquo;s damages plus civil penalties.  The unique aspect of this Act is that it contains whistleblower provisions called <i>qui tam</i>, a legal mechanism that allows citizens with evidence of fraud to sue on behalf of the Government to recover funds that have been stolen.  The whistleblower may be awarded a proportion of the funds recovered, typically between 15% and 25%.  It excludes tax fraud and, while it has been used to tackle fraud in defence contracts, in recent years most actions have centred on health care fraud.</P>
        <P>Some of the scenarios are important for this State and a similar Act would be beneficial, given the growth of the private hospital sector, which remains completely unregulated.  These hospitals will be licensed but it will apply to public hospitals first, meaning that private hospitals will be unregulated.  Contracts have been awarded by the HSE to companies such as Quest, which has the contract for cervical cancer testing and which was obliged to pay over $250 million to the US Government in criminal and civil fines when the HSE had given it a clean bill of health.</P>
        <P>The whistleblower legislation called for in this motion is timely.  It is well beyond the time when we should have had that legislation.  Where doctors engaged in whistle blowing, such as Dr. Gupta&rsquo;s complaints at the treatment of breast cancer patients in Barrington&rsquo;s Hospital, it has been ignored.  Legislation is important to protect those who want to provide information but also to incentivise those who have information.  If the incentive is there, they might give the information.</P>
        <P>The motion refers to the Freedom of Information Act.  We only have to look at the report of the Information Commissioner, Ms Emily O&rsquo;Reilly, where recommendations were made about freedom of information.  The report called for a number of actions to be dealt with by the Government but these went unaddressed.  They included that fees for internal reviews of freedom of information decisions and appeals to her office be brought into line with other jurisdictions that do not charge or have a nominal charge, that such fees be returned in the event of a successful appeal to a public body decision, that some of the amendments made to the Freedom of Information Act in 2003 be removed, particularly those relating to Government records and the fact that the definition of Government was too wide.  It was also recommend that the Freedom of Information Act apply to all records of the Health and Safety Authority, whose enforcement records were removed from the scope of the Act in 2005.  The Information Commissioner has called on all new State bodies to come under the scope of freedom of information legislation as soon as they are established.  Perhaps the Minister of State can clarify that the Freedom of Information Act will apply immediately to NAMA, which will be set up as a State body.  This will place a major burden on taxpayers and transparency in this body is essential if it is ever to gain the confidence of the Irish people.  I support this motion and welcome the fact the Labour Party tabled it.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Ba mhaith liom bu&iacute;ochas a ghabh&aacute;il leis an Seanad&oacute;ir Doherty as ucht a chuid ama a roinnt liom.  I compliment the Labour Party on tabling this motion.  I agree <Col N="389"/>with speakers who said there was no need to table an amending motion.  There is nothing contentious in the motion, nor is there an attempt to play the blame game.  We should have approached this on a cross-party basis.</P>
        <P>Jokes are going around about oxymorons, one of which was the concept of military intelligence.  Independent Newspapers has been offered as a possible oxymoron on another occasion.  It would be a terrible shame if transparency in government, in public policy or in lobbying was seen as an oxymoron.</P>
        <P>I take as my starting point the lack of confidence to which the Labour Party adverts in its motion.  It has been well said that trust takes a long time to build up and an instant to lose.  We can see a collapse in confidence but also a collapse in trust that had been building up over many years <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> many institutions that were seen to let the public and individuals down.  Most recently, it is business and banking.  The collapse in trust is detrimental to our society.  It is in all our interests to try to restore confidence and do what we can as different players in public life to restore confidence in the institutions and people that serve the public.</P>
        <P>We need a renewal of the debate on integrity, morality and the concept of virtue.  For too long we have been ashamed of having a discussion on morality, as if some thought such a discussion required people to go back to an authoritarian past, when people were not allowed to think for themselves.  It is sad to see what is almost an allergy to a proper, searching, thorough debate on the principles of morality, integrity and virtue.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In the business scandals, the economic crisis and the crisis in banking, we see a crisis of virtue more than a crisis of regulation.  People focused on meeting narrow interests such as the interests of shareholders, where they were under pressure to reach short-term goals of profit.  To meet those goals they put self-interest front and centre and disregarded other issues that personal integrity would require them to consider.  I refer to moderation in their dealing, self-control and respect for those who worked beneath them.  Those above put pressure on those below to achieve certain results.  They failed to apply the standard expected and failed to recognise their responsibility, particularly those in positions of leadership, and compromised the integrity of those acting beneath them in the chain.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>The crisis of virtue calls for a reflective response rather than playing the blame game or scoring points off each other.  The media has a particular role to play.  Elements of the media are feeding a scepticism about business and politics and, while it may be deserved, when this veers into cynicism it is damaging to society.  We need a more thoroughgoing journalism that is willing to lead the search for answers.  As Aristotle said, politics is about free people reflecting on how they should order their lives.  How little we get of that genuine, searching debate and how much we get of point scoring.  Today the media has gone off at the deep end about something that should not have happened, namely that the Seanad did not sit yesterday while some people were off playing golf &mdash; not myself I hasten to stress.  Regardless of whether they should have been doing that or whether the Seanad should have been sitting, how predictable and Pavlovian of the media to rise to this and see it as yet another stick with which to beat politicians.  The more contempt generated for politicians, the more contempt generated for politics itself and the more people&rsquo;s willingness to participate in their own democracy is undermined.  We are all the victims when scepticism spills over into cynicism.</P>
        <P>What is the response?  It is to return to these principles of integrity, morality and virtue.  We in politics need to set a standard in areas like how appointments to boards have been made.  It must be the best person for the job rather than the person from the constituency looking for travel expenses.</P><Col N="390"/>
        <P>In the way we raise money, it seems rather odd we have put together a legal apparatus which requires us to declare donations above a certain limit but we can collect a small fortune provided the donations are small enough, without having disclosure.  This nonsense brings the regulatory system for donations into disrepute.  We must be careful about the way we spend taxpayers&rsquo; money in expenses on needless junkets etc.  Until leadership comes from politics, scepticism will sadly spill into cynicism.</P>
        <P>Perhaps it will be for another time, but with regard to lobbying I would like to reflect on the research of Professor Gary Murphy in DCU and others, including Raj Chari and John Hogan, in their brief analysis of the need to regulate lobbying and the different models of doing so in other countries.  The salient point is that where there is regulation of lobbying systems, people are more likely to agree that such regulations help to ensure accountability in government, which is greatly desired.</P>
        <P>The British chief rabbi, Jonathan Sacks, spoke about religion on occasion losing its way when it seeks power rather than influence.  As we consider the role of lobbyists in our society, we should encourage a culture where lobbyists are free to seek influence provided they do so transparently.  It is when they have access to power in a way that is not transparent that damage is done to the public culture and people become cynical about decisions.</P>
        <P>As much as we need to introduce regulation around lobbying, we must never forget we cannot be embarrassed about the need to promote a culture of virtue.  No amount of regulation will save us from problems unless there is a strong culture of civic virtue where people operate the golden rule and act out of respect not just for their own needs but that of others in the wider society.</P>

	<P>I am pleased to be in the Seanad again and to have this opportunity to speak in the debate in support of the Government amendment on the management of the economy, confidence in business and relevant ethical issues.  Some regrets have been expressed by Senators that there is not an agreed motion but realistically, there will not be an agreed motion in which part of the preamble states there is a lack of confidence in the Government.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>At this critical juncture, it is important we have an informed discussion of the issues relevant to the current situation.  The economic environment has changed fundamentally.  The strong and decisive management of the economy now being delivered by the Government will prove key to restoring the confidence essential to the restoration in time of healthy economic growth.</P>
        <P>The world economy is experiencing its deepest and most widespread recession for over a half century.  This severe deterioration has its root in problems emanating from global financial markets and has spread across the world economy.  In an unparalleled post-war development, economic output is contracting and is predicted to be accompanied by a fall in world trade.</P>
        <P>Clearly, as a small open economy, our export performance will be severely affected by the predicted 3.75% contraction this year among the advanced global economies which are Ireland&rsquo;s principal trading partners.  Furthermore, the depreciation of sterling has proven very unhelpful for our indigenous exporting sector and has further eroded its competitiveness.  On the domestic side, the continuing adjustment of the residential building sector to more sustainable levels of output will subtract about 3.75% from economic activity this year.</P><Col N="391"/>
        <P>As the recession which commenced during 2008 extends further, Ireland&rsquo;s GNP is projected to decline by 8% this year, its sharpest decline on record.  A further decline is expected in 2010 but as the expected international recovery gains momentum and the sharp shock to residential housing output passes through, our economy is expected to start growing again in 2011.</P>
        <P>In the supplementary budget, the Minister for Finance highlighted a number of key steps to ensure the economy recovers from this period of economic distress.  These included resolute steps directed at the stabilisation of the public finances, the restoration of the banking system, the recovery of our lost competitiveness, the protection of existing jobs, the stimulation of economic confidence, and the restoration of Ireland&rsquo;s reputation abroad.</P>
        <P>The European Commission has welcomed the Government&rsquo;s reaction to the economic crisis and endorsed the approach pursued in the supplementary budget.  The Minister will meet key investors and explain the Government&rsquo;s strategy in this regard.  Such action will play a further important role in restoring international investor confidence in Ireland&rsquo;s economic prospects and clarify the actions we are taking to underpin the sustainability of our public finances.</P>
        <P>The recent supplementary budget forecast a general Government deficit of 10.75% of GDP at the end of 2009.  It is acknowledged that this deficit is still at a high level but it follows the introduction of a significant level of adjustments in the supplementary budget amounting to some &euro;3.3 billion in 2009 and over &euro;5 billion in a full year.  The supplementary budget built on measures that began last July and which were followed by subsequent measures in the October budget and again in February of this year.  The measures introduced are undoubtedly difficult but are absolutely necessary to stabilise the fiscal position.</P>
        <P>I do not have much time on this occasion to go into the causes of our current position.  I did so in the D&aacute;il earlier this afternoon.  I remember the mantra that the country was awash with money, and this was used as an argument and justification for supporting practically any and every spending project.</P>
        <P>The supplementary budget set out a multi-annual consolidation plan for the public finances to bring the general Government deficit to 3% of GDP by the end of 2013, as is required by European rules.  For the first time, multi-annual plans have been contained in the budgetary projections.  Targets have been set for adjustments to taxation and expenditure in 2010 and 2011 and while the specifics of the measures are still being formulated, the overall policy areas for examination in this context have been announced.  It is clear that further difficult decisions in all areas of policy must be taken.  However, they are necessary to restore sustainability to our public finances and ensure international confidence in Ireland as a place in which to do business.</P>
        <P>The Commission on Taxation and the Special Group on Public Service Numbers and Expenditure Programmes, due to report by mid year, will also have important roles to play in identifying measures that will improve the budgetary position in the coming years.  The exact scale and nature of the measures to be taken in later years will be informed by the course of the economic cycle over the next two years.</P>
        <P>In response to the threats to the financial system in recent months, the Government&rsquo;s actions have been based on three broad principles.  These are to prevent the collapse of systemically important financial institutions, and therefore the banking system as a whole, by protecting depositors and other important creditors who finance the banking system; support the economy by ensuring the flow of credit to sound business and personal borrowers; and protect fully the interests of the taxpayer in all of the Government&rsquo;s interventions to save the banking system.  I attended a lunch with EU ambassadors today and sat next to the Swedish Ambassador.  He made the observation that when they set up a bank for bad loans in the early 1990s, they made a modest profit on the overall transaction.</P><Col N="392"/>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s approach to the financial crisis has been structured and considered, demonstrating its commitment to preventing the failure of any systemically important financial institution.  While the range of measures already introduced have gone a long way to supporting the banking sector and ensuring its stability, it has become clear that Ireland, like many developed countries across the globe, will require further measured and appropriate action.  That is why the Government decided that the asset position of the banking system must also be addressed.  Accordingly, a national asset management agency, NAMA, will be established on a statutory basis under the aegis of the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA.  The Government has received expert financial, economic, legal and valuation advice at every step of its measured response to the recent turbulence in the banking sector.  Likewise, specialist expertise will be procured by NAMA in all relevant areas to ensure it is established in the most efficient manner to safeguard taxpayers&rsquo; interests.  The Government does not consider it practicable to extend freedom of information to the operations of NAMA any more than it would consider such an extension to the activities of the NTMA.</P>
        <P>To ensure the new banking system remains fit for purpose, it will also be necessary to restructure our regulatory and supervisory regime.  This will require the introduction of necessary measures to allow the domestic banking sector to service effectively the needs of the real economy and to restore the reputation of the country as a sound and secure centre of excellence in international financial services &mdash; in which sphere employment has been maintained virtually at the same level as previously &mdash; ahead of its peers and regulated to the best EU and international standards.  As the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, indicated in the recent supplementary budget, the role of the Central Bank of Ireland will be reformed to place it at the centre of financial supervision and financial stability oversight, providing a single integrated structure combining both these critical functions.</P>
        <P>The reconfiguration of our financial regulatory and supervisory system &mdash; the previous system was debated at some length by this House when I served as a Member of it &mdash; is, therefore, a priority for the Government.  It is imperative to establish a new model and approach to financial regulation that will lead to the introduction of new regulatory structures, new standards in banking supervision and new standards of corporate governance for the banks.</P>
        <P>Understandably, there has been a call for measures to improve the regulation of the business and political environment in the aftermath of recent financial and economic developments.  It is worth pointing out that there is already a substantial body of company law which provides for good corporate governance &mdash; I refer here to the Companies Acts 1963 to 2006 &mdash; and for its enforcement by the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, which has a very good track record.  Irish company law is a significant part of the infrastructure which underpins the development of Irish business.  It provides the framework that governs how Irish companies conduct their business, how they communicate with shareholders and other investors and how they deal with creditors.  To remain fit for purpose, company law has been updated and refined regularly since 1963 in response to dynamic changes in the Irish and international corporate environment.  In this connection, I commend the work of the company law review group in producing proposals for the major reform and consolidation of the 13 Companies Acts, resulting early next year in the publication of a significant item of legislation which will contain 1,250 sections.  A lengthy period will be required for the debate on this legislation.  In the meantime, the Companies (Amendment) Bill 2009 is before this House.  Among other things, this legislation provides for enhanced powers for the Director of Corporate Enforcement in his efforts to ensure compliance with the company law code and improvements regarding the transparency of loans made by companies that are licensed banks to their directors and persons connected with them.</P><Col N="393"/>
        <P>The Government is committed to ensuring the corporate governance regime for the financial and corporate sector generally accords with best international practice. The Minister for Finance will be working closely with the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to take account of the lessons that will emerge from current inquiries by the Director of Corporate Enforcement in respect of recent developments.  We will address, as appropriate, any concerns in this area.</P>
        <P>The code of practice for the governance of State bodies sets out a governance framework within which the internal management and internal and external reporting relationships of such bodies is to take place.  A review of the code&rsquo;s operation has been under way since 2005, predating recent events in the financial services area, and drafting of a revised and updated version is now complete.  The Minister for Finance has notified his colleagues that he intends to publish the revised and updated code of practice soon.</P>
        <P>There have been some discussions during this debate with regard to nominations to State boards.  A number of prominent persons associated with Opposition parties have been appointed by the Government to such boards.  Included among their number is a former Leader of the Opposition in this House who was appointed to the Irish Human Rights Commission.  I will be interested in seeing, should there be a change of Government in the near future or in the next few years&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <P>The Government amendment also calls on the House to recognise the many initiatives taken by various Departments to extend protection to whistleblowers.  Subsequent to its introduction by Deputy Rabbitte in 1999, the Government was informed by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel that the initial whistleblower legislation would require substantial redrafting in order that it might deal with a number of detailed and complex issues which had arisen.  As a result, the Government decided on 7 March 2006 to formalise a sectoral approach as part of its policy on the provision of statutory protection for whistleblowers because this would provide a better and more focused way of dealing with the issue.  This decision requires Ministers, in consultation with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to the Government, to include, where appropriate, whistleblowing provisions in draft legislation.  Such an approach also acknowledges situations where the provision of whistleblowing provisions may not be appropriate.</P>
        <P>Before and subsequent to this decision, the Government has included whistleblower provisions in much legislation, including the Standards in Public Office Act 2001, the Competition Act 2002, the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 and the Consumer Protection Act 2007.  This approach ensures new measures will continue to be informed by and benefit from existing legislation and that Members of this House will be able to make contributions to developing legislation on a case-by-case basis in this important area.</P>
        <P>I agree with Senator Quinn that whistleblowing or, as it is otherwise known, informing is not exactly an integral part of Irish culture.  I was asked by <i>The Irish Times</i> to review three volumes of journals of a previous Upper House, namely, the former Irish House of Lords and I came across an interesting debate in which peers agreed that informing on one another was simply not done.  In a modern democracy, however, people who come across serious wrongdoing and bring it to the attention of the authorities should be protected and not, as happened in the fairly recent past in both the commercial world and the public sector, punished and excluded.</P>
        <P>Lobbying is an integral element of democracy where the citizen, interest groups or businesses communicate to policymakers their legitimate concerns and preferences.  We need to be <Col N="394"/>informed by outside views, regardless of whether they come from an industry representative, an environmental non-governmental organisation, a residents&rsquo; association or a trade union.  I reject the notion that golden circles exist.  As a Minister of State, I am in a position to state that, unfortunately, the majority of people who lobby in respect of what they want to be done, and these things usually cost money, receive responses which either are negative or indicate that their desires cannot be fulfilled at that point.</P>
        <P>In Ireland, a small number of public relations companies carry out lobbying work on a fee basis from time to time.  This is a very small industry by international comparison.  However, we have a very open political system in which Senators, Deputies and Ministers meet citizens and interest groups, often on day-to-day business and through their clinics.  Our political system lends itself to easy and free access, a real strength.</P>
        <P>In designing any system of regulation, we must demonstrate that it brings tangible benefits in transparency, that it fits well with public expectations of access and the specifics of our political system and that it does not present an unnecessary drain on public resources to administer, especially at this time of constrained resources.  The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is considering this issue on behalf of the Government.</P>
        <P>The Freedom of Information Act had its origins in the Fianna F&aacute;il-Labour Government in the early 1990s.  People associate the phrase, &ldquo;letting in the light&rdquo; with the then Taoiseach, Albert Reynolds.  The legislation is working well to ensure the public can obtain access to information held by public bodies to the greatest extent possible, consistent with the public interest and the right to privacy, while balancing the effective functioning of the administration.  In areas where much work and research is required to handle a freedom of information request, it cannot be entirely free of charge.  The legislation&rsquo;s remit has been steadily extended by the Government.  Up to 520 public bodies are subject to freedom of information.  The total number of requests made in 2008 was 12,600, representing approximately a 20% annual increase.</P>
        <P>Senator Twomey is wrong in his claim that no Minister has resigned on reputational matters.  In 1946, there was the sad case of the resignation of the then Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, Dr. Con Ward.  He was the victim of a scandal, artificially generated by opponents in the medical profession who did not like the direction he, a pioneer of the health services, was taking towards socialised medicine.  Others such as Eddie Collins, a Minister of State in the Fine Gael-Labour coalition of the 1980s, and Hugh Coveney, a Minister of State in the rainbow Government, both resigned on such grounds.  Ray Burke not only resigned from the Government but from the D&aacute;il.  The idea Ministers never resign is not true.</P>
        <P>I am concerned about an ambivalence that does exist.  I was horrified to hear IBEC&rsquo;s chief executive a few days ago saying we should bend the rules, as the French do, in EU rules governing public procurement.  We have got into many problems with the culture of bending the rules.  I strongly believe we should not bend the rules.</P>
        <P>We are facing tough economic challenges.  To succeed, we must continue to pursue appropriate policies to position the economy to benefit from the global recovery.  We must regain the competitiveness we have lost.  This will mean an adjustment in our labour market, costs and work practices.  We are already demonstrating such wage flexibility in both the public and private sectors, a significant achievement which many countries would wish to emulate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Senator Brendan Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his contribution to this debate.  He has spent much time in this House in recent weeks.</P><Col N="395"/>
        <P>Members spoke about a range of measures needed to restore confidence in our economic and political systems.  As Senators Hannigan and Prendergast pointed out, in the current economic climate failure to act is not an option and the sooner we clean up our act the better.  The Government needs to take a lead in good governance by stamping out political patronage.  The same people keep cropping up on State boards and semi-State companies.  The former Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, unashamedly said he appointed people to boards on the basis of friendship.  Until we adopt a system whereby ministerial appointments to State boards and semi-State companies are based on merit, public bodies cannot function to their full potential and accusations of cronyism will remain valid.</P>
        <P>Senator Hannigan has previously called for the Seanad to have ratification powers for public appointees, which I support.  Considering the Seanad is seeking more powers in response to public criticism, then a scrutiny role over matters such as this fits the bill.  It would create greater public confidence in both the Seanad and the public appointments process.  It is recognised that politics must not have a role in public appointments.  However, the current system is about ensuring an unacceptable continuance of party influence in the public sector.</P>
        <P>Senator Quinn referred to the Labour Party&rsquo;s efforts over the past ten years to introduce whistleblower&rsquo;s protection legislation.  This is an essential element of transparent governance, be it in the public service, the private sector or the Government.  Whistle blowing has already led to the establishment of tribunals inquiring into planning and Garda corruption.  Often those in a position to blow the whistle cannot because they fear being victimised and losing their jobs.  That is why Labour&rsquo;s proposal includes full protection for employees.</P>
        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s reputation abroad has helped our economic interests over the years.  We are reputed for our flexible approach to rules.  It is portrayed, at home and abroad, as an endearing feature, a sign of our relaxed nature.  However, we cannot be relaxed about matters like corporate governance or have international investors regarding us as lax about good regulation.  It is not a selling point for a country that aspires to develop a smart economy and a society of equals.</P>
        <P>I thank Senators Hannigan, Prendergast, MacSharry, Regan, Hanafin, Quinn, Butler, Twomey, Callely, Doherty and Mullen for their contributions.  I commend the motion to the House.</P>

	<P>Will the Minister of State clarify the provisions in stamp duty legislation?  I understand they do not provide for Revenue to accommodate a phased payment system for individual taxpayers who have a liability but who due to economic difficulties cannot make the repayment on a lump sum basis.  Revenue provides such an accommodation in other areas of taxation for taxpayers who get into difficulty.  The standard response on stamp duty is there is no provision within existing legislation to permit staged payments.</P>
        <P>Revenue issued a circular in December 2008 entitled, Case Decision Escalation Framework, which stated the Commissioners would be understanding and accommodating regarding taxpayers who get into particular financial difficulties and they could work with them once the taxpayer was open and forthcoming on his or her position.  It stated, &ldquo;Revenue is disposed to working with such businesses and taxpayers to find a way through these difficulties provided there is a positive and honest engagement with Revenue and the fundamentals of the underlying business are sound&rdquo;.  The circular refers to individual taxpayers in recent times experiencing particular difficulties meeting their tax payment obligations and states, &ldquo;The Collector General has decided that some additional considerations to those that normally or generally apply may arise in determining how Revenue will respond in these type of situations&rdquo; and reference is made to the case decision escalation framework procedure.</P>
        <P>I am aware of a number of cases of individuals in difficulty such as one first-time buyer owing stamp duty.  He did not occupy the property because he lost his job and had to emigrate and find work abroad.  There is a willingness on the part of Revenue in most cases to accommodate individuals who encounter problems meeting their tax liabilities and where Revenue recognises the cases are bona fide, the taxpayer is given time to make phased or staged payments and the matter is resolved.  However, no such provision relates to stamp duty and staged payments are not permitted.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>Timely payment of taxes and duties by specified dates is a fundamental requirement of our tax system and is provided for in the legislation governing all taxes and duties, including stamp duties.  It is not considered appropriate to legislate for financial payment difficulties that individual taxpayers <Col N="397"/>may face in particular circumstances in the payment of taxes or duties.  The Revenue Commissioners are charged with the collection of taxes and duties by the specified due dates for payment and the tax code provides that interest charges, and in appropriate cases penalties, will be incurred by taxpayers who fail to pay their taxes and duties on a timely basis.</P>
        <P>Revenue, under its &ldquo;care and management&rdquo; powers, will in certain circumstances be prepared to consider suspending enforcement action where tax is due but unpaid and will instead accept phased payment arrangements in circumstances where compliant taxpayers are experiencing genuine short-term cash flow difficulties but who otherwise have sound businesses and would be expected to honour the phased payment schedule and ultimately be able to pay their taxes in full.  Revenue will consider such cases on an individual basis by reference to the facts and in accordance with a strict but uniform approach, which will in all cases involve payment of statutory interest on all late payments.</P>
        <P>Details of Revenue&rsquo;s approach, which recognises the genuine difficulties faced by some taxpayers in the current economic climate, are set out on the home page of its website, <i>www.revenue.ie</i>, under the heading, &ldquo;Tax Payment Difficulties&rdquo;.  Furthermore, the recently published Finance Bill contains provision for a significant reduction in the rate of interest charged on overdue taxes, including overdue stamp duty.  Stamp duty is, however, somewhat different from other taxes in that it is paid on instruments, for example, deeds of conveyance, which are stampable on the expiration of a 30-day period after the instrument is first executed.  Generally, a person entering into a transaction that involves payment of stamp duty on an instrument knows in advance what the stamp duty liability will be.  Accordingly, on entering into a transaction giving rise to stamp duty that person must make arrangements for timely payment not only of the consideration payable on the transaction to the other party but also of the stamp duty payable to Revenue.</P>
        <P>Stamp duty is also different in that an instrument that is not correctly stamped cannot be used for any purpose.  For example, it will not be accepted by a bank as a security for a mortgage, by the Property Registration Authority for title purposes, and it cannot be tendered in evidence in court proceedings.  An instrument will not be stamped by Revenue until the full stamp duty is paid.  Interest, charges and penalties arise if the instrument is not stamped on time, but Revenue has power under section 14 of the Stamp Duty Consolidation Act 1999 to remit a penalty in certain exceptional circumstances.</P>
        <P>It is not considered appropriate to legislate in a general way for taxpayers experiencing tax payment difficulties.  Each case will depend on its own facts and circumstances.  In the case of stamp duty, there are additional complicating factors with such a legislative approach because it is a tax on instruments and that payment is linked to such matters as registration of title and evidential requirements.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>First-time buyers who are exempt from stamp duty are aware of the position on entering into the transaction, which the Minister of State said is important, and they know their liability is zero.  However subsequently, due to unforeseen circumstances, if they find themselves in difficulty and it is not practical for them to remain the occupier of the property they purchased, they must pay the duty because they no longer occupy the property having notified the liability to Revenue but there is no facility for the Commissioners to accommodate staged payments.  That is the issue and the Minister of State&rsquo;s reply does not address such a scenario.</P>

    <Title>School Staffing. </Title>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for affording me the opportunity to bring this matter to the Minister&rsquo;s attention.  I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy <Col N="398"/>Mansergh.  My question asks the Minister for Education and Science to outline the educational thinking and approach he recommends to ensure two teachers can now effectively teach English based on his revised circular to 154 foreign national children in Scoil Mhuire, Oranmore, County Galway.  I contend that is not educationally sound nor is it good practice.  As a former teacher and teacher educator, I would not stand over such a practice.  I ask the Minister to reverse his decision to withdraw the two teachers who are being lost to the school on foot of the recent circular and make a statement on this matter.</P>
        <P>The school I refer to is Scoil Mhuire in Oranmore, which is an all-girls primary school.  Currently, 35% of the enrolment this year is of non-national children.  It has four teachers teaching English as an additional language to the pupils in the school.  Next year, 38% of the school&rsquo;s enrolment will be of non-national pupils and its staffing allocation for English as an additional language has now been cut from four to two.</P>
        <P>After the budget last October the Minister, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, promised me in committee, and promised the entire educational community, that he would give consideration to schools with a high concentration of non-national pupils.  It was only after he made the ruling that all schools would be reduced to two teachers that he realised there were extraordinary circumstances throughout the country with large numbers of foreign national pupils in schools.</P>
        <P>The principal stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">In the current school year we had a total of 134 students requiring English Language Support.  We had four EAL teachers who struggled to give that number of children the support they needed.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">Next year we will have 154 children requiring English Language Support.  The Department of Education and Science has told me that I will now only get sanction for two teachers.  The children from 1st class upwards will have received two years support.  However, they are not proficient enough in the language to access the curriculum therefore their education is being compromised.  The class teacher has to spend so much of class time helping those children that the education of all the other children is also being compromised.</P>
        <P FLI="0">That is the reality and it is a serious charge that will lead to reduced educational outcomes into the future, with teachers not being able to cope with the mix of children in their classes and the multiple nationalities.  It will lead to racism in the future.  It is an incitement to discontent and, I contend, to racism, which is very serious.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister how two teachers can feasibly provide support for 154 pupils.  That is a ratio of 77 pupils per teacher.  That is not tenable.  There are other Members in this House with educational experience who will support what I am saying.  Another question the school has raised is how it will explain to parents come September that the education of their children is being compromised owing to the large number of foreign national children in the class who have no English language support.  In standing over this practice, everyone is suffering &mdash; the Irish children, the foreign national children and the teachers who will be driven mad by this practice.</P>
        <P>Would it be more responsible for the school to refuse to accept these children on the grounds that it cannot cater for their needs?  The Education Act states we must meet the educational needs of the pupils.  This measure is not meeting their needs.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister of State to advise me on how to advise the school, Scoil Mhuire in Oranmore, with regard to its English as an additional language staffing allocation.  How will we improve the school&rsquo;s case to ensure this decision can be reversed?  What steps does the school <Col N="399"/>now need to take with the Department of Education and Science to get a result that will benefit both the Irish and the foreign national children?  I look forward to the Minister&rsquo;s response.</P>

	<P>I am taking this Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe.  I thank Senator Healy Eames for raising this matter on the Adjournment.  To date, the Department of Education and Science has not received any application from the school in question in regard to language support teaching posts for the coming school year.</P>
        <P>In light of the 2009 budget decision, the Department has now published a circular for schools which sets out how the new arrangements will operate for the allocation of language support teachers from September 2009.  The circular sets out a structured and transparent approach for the operation of the alleviation measures announced in the budget for schools that have a significant concentration of newcomer pupils.  The alleviation measures mean these schools can qualify for up to four language support posts with the possibility of additional posts also being approved through the independent staffing appeals mechanism.  Schools can now apply to the Department in the normal way for language support posts.  These posts are approved on a provisional basis initially and will be confirmed in September 2009 following receipt from the schools of actual enrolments of pupils requiring language support.</P>
        <P>It is estimated that notwithstanding the budget measures there will be approximately 1,500 language support teaching posts in our primary and post-primary schools in September 2009.  By any standards this is a very significant resource and the challenge will be to ensure it is used to maximum effect.</P>
        <P>Additional supports are provided for children in primary schools who do not meet the qualifying criteria for the appointment of full-time teachers in the form of grant aids for the employment of part-time English language support teachers.  A total of 443 schools have benefited from this type of financial support in the current school year.</P>
        <P>I thank Senator Healy Eames for providing me with the opportunity to address the House on this matter and to outline the current position.</P>

	<P>I am happy with the thrust of the Minister of State&rsquo;s response but in committee last week the Minister, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, told me that he had to change his mind about a matter announced in last autumn&rsquo;s budget.  The Minister of State&rsquo;s news is good news, but it contradicts what the Minister said last week.</P>

	<P>I seek the Chair&rsquo;s indulgence to highlight a matter.  On two occasions I raised in the House the issue of the Magilligan car ferry, or the Foyle ferry, and the status of Magilligan as an international port.  I am pleased to inform the House that further to the push to address that issue by the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, and the Minister, Deputy Ahern, it has been resolved.  Magilligan is no longer an international port.  It is now a domestic port and that will lead to significant supports and assistance for the Foyle ferry.</P>
        <P>I thank the Minister of State because he made an off the cuff comment on the previous occasion that I used copiously in making the case to many people, and it greatly supported the case.  It was done in the best possible taste, as one comedian would say.</P>
      
        <P>I wish to raise the issue of diabetes which will become a very serious problem, if not for this generation then for the next one.  I hope I do not have diabetes.  My last check was fine but I am aware of colleagues in my current employment and from my previous employment as a teacher who suffer from this disease.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">8 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Diabetes mellitus is a group of metabolic disorders characterised by too much glucose in the blood.  Either the pancreas fails to produce enough insulin or the body cannot use the insulin it has.  As a result, the glucose builds up in the blood causing the cells to be starved of energy and other complications.  The condition is associated with a range of serious vascular complications such as heart attacks, kidney disease, nerve disease and eye disease.  Type 1 diabetes is the more serious condition and it affects between 10% and 15% of people with diabetes in European countries.  It is thought to be triggered by environmental factors in genetically susceptible individuals.  Type 2 diabetes causes more concern.  It usually occurs in older people but it is becoming more common among younger people, partly owing to lifestyle factors such as diet, lack of physical activity and obesity.  It accounts for 85% to 90% of all cases of diabetes in Europe.</P>
        <P>Last week I raised the issue of awareness of skin cancer and the dangers of melanoma.  Today, representatives of the Irish Cancer Society appeared before a committee of the Oireachtas to outline the dangers of cancer, preventative measures that can be taken and symptoms to watch.  This House previously discussed bowel cancer and Members managed to get through that debate without mentioning the symptoms and signals.  It is important they would be put on the record in case somebody, somewhere might see what we said and realise they have a problem.</P>
        <P>The symptoms of diabetes are often ignored.  People are unaware of them, which often leads to the condition only being discovered when it is at the stage of causing complications in their lives.  It is also far more dangerous than it would have been if caught earlier.  The symptoms are frequent urination, excessive thirst, excessive hunger, unusual weight loss, increased fatigue, irritability and blurry vision.  People with any one of those symptoms should immediately try to visit the doctor.</P>
        <P>With regard to prevention, small dietary changes and exercise can help prevent type 2 diabetes from developing or slow its progress.  According to the Diabetes Federation of Ireland, in 2005 it was estimated there were 141,064 adults in the republic or 4.7% of the population with diabetes, diagnosed and undiagnosed.  In the republic, diabetes is more common among female adults than among male adults.  The percentages are 5.5% for females and 4% for males.</P>
        <P>It is a lifestyle issue.  It is important some mechanism is found to direct young people.  I have been examining dietary issues recently.  Food is a science.  Should we make food science an examination subject in schools?  It is probably part of the domestic science course.  We have seen the results of diabetes in terms of the lifestyle change it causes for sufferers.  They must constantly watch their intake of carbohydrates, they must know what carbohydrates do to their <Col N="401"/>blood sugars and they must know how to balance that with exercise.  If there was greater awareness of food science and the amount of saturated fats, salt and sugars in processed foods and if people could use the information that is available on the products we buy, the children who will become the parents of the next generation would become far more familiar with what they put into their bodies and what exercise they must do to work it off.  It would become second nature for them to opt for the healthier food option.  Diabetics have the same nutritional needs as everybody else.  If they exercise, take their medication and eat well-balanced, regular meals in correct amounts, there can be very good diabetes control.</P>
        <P>We must try to prevent what is believed will be a disaster in the future.  This issue is linked to many others, such as sport and its benefits for the person, what people are eating, what they should be eating and how to balance that.  I succeeded in losing two and a half stone since July.  It is not a case of denying oneself anything in particular but being aware that if one eats a packet of crisps, one must compensate by not having an extra slice of bread.  Food science in school might be the way forward.</P>

	<P>I thank the Senator for raising this matter on the Adjournment, to which I am replying on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney.</P>
        <P>Diabetes is a chronic, progressive metabolic disease that impacts on almost every aspect of the person&rsquo;s life.  There is a great deal of concern because diabetes is becoming more common throughout the developed world.  There are two types of diabetes.  Type 1 or insulin-dependent diabetes affects mainly young people and has a sudden onset.  Type 2 diabetes is much more common and accounts for 90% of all cases.  It usually has its onset in middle age.  The prevalence of type 2 diabetes is increasing owing to a number of factors, including the ageing population and lifestyle factors such as obesity.</P>
        <P>Diabetes can have a profound impact on lifestyle, work, well-being and life expectancy.  It also causes significant morbidity.  Studies have estimated that type 2 diabetes is present for an average of seven years prior to the diagnosis and that up to half of people at this stage may have evidence of complications of diabetes.  These include eye, kidney and nerve damage, and vascular complications.</P>
        <P>The Department of Health and Children policy on diabetes, Diabetes: Prevention and Model for Patient Care, was published in 2006.  This identified a model of care which included shared care between primary care and acute services, retinopathy screening, patient education and empowerment and podiatry services as key areas for development.</P>
        <P>The HSE established an expert advisory group, EAG, to take forward and implement the policy recommendations.  The EAG framework document, which charts how this public health challenge can be addressed, was launched by the HSE in November 2008.  The group&rsquo;s work represents the blueprint for the development of first-class services for people with diabetes.  It is practical and patient-focused with a strong emphasis on prevention, service integration and community-based management supported by specialist services.</P>
        <P>The EAG emphasised that real savings can be achieved in health care costs by preventing the complications of diabetes such as eye disease or retinopathy, kidney disease or cardiovascular disease.  This will be achieved through patient education and empowerment, excellent primary care linked to specialist secondary care and special provisions for early detection and treatment of any complications that develop.  A regional model of care is recommended for children and adolescents with diabetes.</P>
        <P>The key recommendations include agreement of a core set of standards for diabetes care.  A comprehensive set of clinical guidelines has been agreed for diabetes care.  This is a significant <Col N="402"/>development and included the Irish Council of General Practitioners and Irish Endocrine Society in the drawing up of these guidelines for an integrated care model between primary and hospital care.  These will be of considerable clinical benefit, will advance patient care throughout the country and have the support of the Department of Health and Children.</P>
        <P>The second key recommendation is education and empowerment which relates not only to education but empowering patients with diabetes to take greater control in the management of their condition.  The third key recommendation is the development of information and communications technology to support diabetes care, especially in the primary care setting.  The fourth key recommendation is the continuing roll-out of diabetic retinopathy screening.<b><i>  </i></b>Diabetic retinopathy is one of the major causes of adult blindness.  The fifth key recommendation is the<b> </b>prioritisation of podiatry services for patients with diabetes.  With regard to capacity, the report includes recommendations on acute care service needs including consultant staff, diabetes nurse specialists, dieticians and other health care workers.</P>
        <P>Current lifestyle patterns in Ireland are a major cause of concern as they play a significant part in the increase in type 2 diabetes.  Prevention is key to halting the rise in incidence. Not many people realise that almost 60% of the disease burden in Europe is accounted for by seven leading risk factors, which we can influence: high blood pressure, tobacco, alcohol, high blood cholesterol, overweight, low fruit and vegetable intake, and physical inactivity.</P>
        <P>Health care systems continue to focus on the treatment of diseases.  However, prevention is a key issue in halting the rise in prevalence of type 2 diabetes.  The Department of Health and Children will continue to focus on highlighting the risk factors which contribute to the development of chronic diseases such as this.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>Perhaps the Minister of State would refer my specific question to the Department with regard to whether an examination subject on food science could be introduced in the first year of secondary school.  Prevention is better than cure.</P>
