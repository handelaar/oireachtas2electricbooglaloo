      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>Yesterday the Garda searched the offices of Anglo Irish Bank.  While most people welcome this development, I want to raise some questions on the Government&rsquo;s role in this regard.  It is very clear the Government knew about the existence of the so-called golden circle for almost a year, yet the matter is only now being investigated.  I am obviously aware there are legal constraints but there are certain legitimate questions that must be asked.</P>
        <P>The Government also knew about the extraordinary transactions between Irish Life &amp; Permanent and Anglo Irish Bank, yet these are only now being investigated.  People throughout the country are asking why it took so long for the Government to act.  A reporter who wrote an article in the <i>Irish Independent</i> today spoke to a go-between who stated one member of the golden circle claims not to have been approached by anyone for information on his or her involvement in the matter.  In spite of this, the Garda raided the bank yesterday.  One wonders, one year on, what evidence will be available in the bank, given that the information has been known for so long.</P><Col N="55"/>
        <P>I raise these questions because the key issue concerns confidence and the Government&rsquo;s overall map.  We still have not got from the Government the overall map for national recovery.  We have not got the overall map for banking, managing the country&rsquo;s economy or retraining and support for those who have become unemployed.  Every day we hear stories of people who are facing extraordinary hardship.  We need answers from the Government as to how those becoming unemployed today will receive help, be it in respect of mortgages, retraining or upskilling.  These are very serious questions.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister for Education and Science stated this morning that there are 254 teacher posts being lost and the INTO stated there are 1,000.  Will the Minister state the rationale for these losses, given that every school is crying out for more support for children with special needs and those who require special attention in one way or other?  It seems extraordinary that we face the loss of 1,000 teaching posts.  We in this House have called for the protection of front-line services.  I am very concerned about this.</P>
        <P>The Leader agreed with me yesterday that every effort should be made to protect front-line services.  However, without debate in this House or the D&aacute;il, front-line services are being attacked, be it in respect of health or education.  Hospitals are being closed down in Dublin and around the country and this is happening without political accountability and without any Minister coming to this House.  There is talk of cross-party support but all I hear is denigration of the efforts of the Opposition to put forward constructive solutions.  The Government is not accepting our motion tonight, which is very constructive and would give the banking sector a fresh start.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to pick up on an issue raised in the House previously and raised just now by Senator Fitzgerald, that is, the loss of teaching posts.  When the cuts were announced weeks or months ago, I made the point it would cost 1,000 jobs.  The Government side stated the figure would be between 200 and 300.  I have analysed the list with the INTO and am absolutely certain it will be 1,000 jobs.  The least we should demand is for the Minister for Education and Science to explain how he made his calculation so we can decide whether we were misled deliberately or the Department or those in Government circles just cannot count.  We need to see the facts rather than shout abuse across the floor at each other.  When we obtain the relevant information, we can debate it.  I ask the Leader to prioritise that issue.</P>
        <P>President Obama made a highly aspirational speech last night which, while saying very little, raised people from their bootstraps.  He sought a united front and to jazz up the whole world.  That is extraordinary by comparison with what is occurring here in that, while the Opposition parties have offered their hands across the House to deal with the economic problems in a united manner, the Government has rejected them.  ICTU has published a ten-point plan and I have heard nobody reject it out of hand thus far.  Various politicians on the Government side have said it is worth discussing.  That is another offer of support but it seems it is being rejected also.  Bearing in mind that the Minister for Finance asked us some months ago to adopt a patriotic perspective, it is a bit odd that the hand of friendship and support is being rejected when offered.</P>
        <P>We will have a chance to discuss some of these issues tonight.  The Government&rsquo;s decision on the Fine Gael motion today is simply so old-fashioned and untimely that it demeans politics.  If there were points the Government did not agree with, it could have left them out and retained some of the positive measures.  I ask that we have a real debate on that tonight in which people will state genuinely what is worth doing and what we might do.</P>
        <P>I congratulate the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement on the measure it is taking, although some will say it is too late.  When a murder takes place, it is very often weeks before somebody is arrested and two years before the case &ndash; I refer to a simple murder case <Col N="56"/>&mdash; comes to court.  It is often some time after the event before we see action.  Where the banks are concerned, we are dealing with the richest people in the country who can buy the best lawyers and the best defence.  For the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement or the Garda fraud squad to rush in blindly to address the banking scandal would be absolutely stupid.  I want to know they are working on it.  I was glad to see the images last night and I am looking forward to the results.  However, the matter needs to be addressed properly, forensically, progressively and effectively.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>I previously called for a debate in this House on the incredible disparity between prices here and those in the North and Great Britain.  I and others asked for this debate to be arranged a couple of weeks ago but there is no sign of it.  Surely it is a very urgent issue, sufficiently urgent to have the Minister in the House to explain what action, if any, is being taken by her to address the question of price disparities.  It appears none is being taken.</P>
        <P>I have no problem with having a debate on intellectual property rights this afternoon but, for the life of me, I do not know precisely why we are having it and what it is about.  I am in favour of a debate, but there are urgent issues that require to be dealt with today and tomorrow, including the issue of prices, and we are not debating them.  Senators Fitzgerald and O&rsquo;Toole are correct in that not only is the economy grinding to a halt, but the political system is doing so also.  We are not allowing debates on issues about which the people on the streets are talking.</P>
        <P>With regard to prices, consider what has been happening in recent months.  I think it was in the autumn that the question arose in the D&aacute;il, when the Taoiseach had a famous Paul Gogarty moment and said to the T&aacute;naiste that she should bring in certain people and speak to them.  Then the Director of Consumer Affairs expressed certain views on the issue of prices, after which there was a Forf&aacute;s report.  Most incredibly, the T&aacute;naiste is not taking action or addressing the issue but, as she stated on the radio this morning, she is asking the Competition Authority to conduct an investigation.  When will a Minister make a decision on an urgent question facing the people?  Will the Government ever make a decision?  As somebody said yesterday, will it constantly off-load and subcontract decisions on serious issues facing us all?  We cannot talk about tax because the Commission on Taxation must deal with it, and we might deal with it in next year&rsquo;s budget.  We cannot talk about prices because this or that body is being asked to investigate them.  From what I can see, the political, parliamentary and government systems are grinding to a halt.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Senator O&rsquo;Toole is absolutely right, although I slightly disagree with him about whether President Obama said anything of substance.  He said one thing of considerable substance, which applies to us here.  He said that a day of reckoning had arrived in the American economy in regard to decisions that had been put off there for many years, which people were now having to face up to making.  The day of reckoning has arrived for the people of this country, for those who have lost their jobs and for those involved in the real economy.  Sooner or later the day of reckoning will arrive for the people who made the decisions and those responsible for indecision over a period of ten or 11 years who have us where we are today.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I will call some Senators I missed yesterday first.  I call Senator Coffey.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="57"/>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>We have seen serious unrest in society recently, which is worrying.  People are very angry about what is happening in the economy, especially with the loss of jobs, the financial pressures on families and the loss of front-line services that my colleague, Senator Fitzgerald, has spoken about, especially in areas such as education and health.</P>
        <P>I am also concerned by the evidence that people are turning on each other, namely, public sector workers versus private sector workers, employers versus employees, the rural and farming sector is being criticised by the urbanites and social welfare recipients are being criticised by those who are working.  That unrest is of great concern to a society such as ours.  I fear there is an underlying sense of anarchy that is ready to surface and we should be ready to act on it.</P>
        <P>There are many honest bank employees and some of them are being turned on by the public.  That should be a source of great concern to all of us as public representatives.  This has all been driven by pure greed.  It has been driven by the revelations in the banking system, the lack of corporate governance and the current lack of truth and honesty.  The Government must take responsibility for oversight, corporate governance and the governance of the regulatory system.  It is only right that the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement and the fraud squad are in Anglo Irish Bank.  I hope it is not too little, too late.  The full rigours of the law must be brought to bear on the incestuous inter-bank relationship we have witnessed in this country.  We need a purge of the banking system at the top level before we can restore integrity and confidence in the system and in the economy.  This evening&rsquo;s Fine Gael motion focuses on that.  It is disappointing that despite all the soundbites from the Government on improving working relationships in Parliament the Government side has tabled an amendment.  It is a pity that has happened.</P>
        <P>I call for a debate on employment and competitiveness in this country.  Serious pressures are evident in the manufacturing industry.  Competitiveness is at an all-time low and we are seriously struggling as an economy.  More than 3,600 apprentices have been made redundant in the past year.  I congratulate the ESB on its initiative in taking on 400 apprentices to finish their qualifications.  I urge other companies to step up to the mark in this regard, for example, Eircom.  It was a large semi-State company that has its networks falling down around the country.  I would like to see Eircom and other large companies step up to the mark and take on apprentices.</P>
        <P>More importantly, I would like to see Government initiatives for apprentices and the unemployed.  We need to give hope to young people who are on the dole.  It would not cost much to set up schemes to take them off the dole.  For example, local authorities have boarded-up houses throughout the country.  People could be employed on constructive schemes to re-open houses to take people off the housing list.  We need to think outside the box.  As a representative of Government, I ask the Leader to get the Government out of the comatose state it is in, start thinking outside the box, send out positive signals to our citizens, take the young people off the dole and give them hope.  There are ways and means of doing it and we, as an Opposition, are prepared to assist the Government if it would only listen.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>This is the first day of Lent.  It is traditional in Lent that we give up something.  I suggest that we have a lot of things to give up.  I read years ago that a British politician said it is the duty of the Opposition to oppose.  The Opposition should consider whether that is its duty.  Perhaps that is something it should give up and it should find a way to support the correct actions.</P>

      </Speaker><Col N="58"/>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>We could also start accepting it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I still hear bickering from both sides.  What happened in 1987 was that the Opposition of the day said it would support the Government even in the tough decisions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>It was a minority Government.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not hear those sounds being made now.  I know there has been talk of a national Government but we had something that got us out of problems back in 1987.  That was when the Opposition stopped opposing for the sake of opposing and started to say it would support the Government if it was doing the right thing.  There are many right things to be done and I am not just talking about the Opposition.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P><i>(Interruptions).</i></P>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Quinn should be allowed to speak without interruption.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I am talking about the various factions.  Senator Coffey has just referred to the infighting that is taking place in the country.  Let us find a way to avoid that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>That is good advice.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I remind the Leader of what happened in Easter Island.  It is an island in the Pacific that had a thriving civilisation but the people there did not realise what was happening and as they continued to behave in the way they had done for many years their civilisation ended because there was nothing to eat.  There was no food and the island became deserted.  All that remains there are the monuments, the statues that were left from those previous days.  We are in danger of acting in that way in this country at present.</P>
        <P>I was impressed by the words President Obama used last night and the sympathy he showed for those who are having a tough time.  For example, when he talked about the student who is no longer able to go to college because his father is losing his job, he showed sympathy but he also showed courage and said we can get out of this.  The Government&rsquo;s job is to remind us of the tough decisions we will have to take.</P>
         <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I am complying with the requirement not to refer to names, but in the article yesterday by the former Attorney General who is an active member of Fine Gael he indicated that because of the deterioration in the financial situation, what may have been the right thing to do only a month ago is no longer the right thing now.  He focused in particular on the front-loading of the difficult decisions we have to make.  We were planning to take tough decisions this year, tougher ones next year and even tougher decisions the following year.  He believes that what we should have done was taken the heavy hit now.  We were willing to take it and I think the country is willing to take it if we show the leadership, determination and the confidence in the future that we can get out of this.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the points made by my colleagues on the actions that have been taken in regard to Anglo Irish Bank, in particular in recent days.  It is worth emphasising, however, that in the eyes of the people who have been making the decisions about the future of the country, especially the financial markets, the game has moved on.  They are now looking at completely different things in regard to this country.  A small but growing number of commentators is now questioning the solvency of the country and our ability to fund it.  I strongly believe that is the core issue on which the Oireachtas and the Government should now engage.</P><Col N="59"/>
        <P>I wish to offer three small pieces of evidence to support that point.  This morning it emerged that the financial markets believe that it is as risky to buy the Government debt of Brazil as it is of Ireland.  They believe that buying the Government debt of many other countries, including Thailand, Malaysia, Israel, Greece, Chile, China and Slovakia is a safer bet than this country.  Last week the German finance minister stated that the eurozone could not afford any small economy to be threatened.  The question must be asked why he made that statement.  Last week we saw evidence of huge capital outflows from the country.  If we were looking at any other country we would be sounding warning bells about that.  Perhaps because the implications are so grave there is almost a reluctance on our part to talk about this openly and engage upon it in the manner required.</P>
     
        <P>I ask the Leader to make time available regularly in the House to do two things. First, we must speak loudly and clearly to those buying our bonds and debt that there is no risk to the solvency of our country this year and in coming years and, second, the steps that will be taken to ensure that does not happen must be outlined.  Unfortunately, that is the only game in town.  Risk is increasing and everybody who makes decisions outside Leinster House is talking about it.  It is urgent that we do the same.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>Notwithstanding tonight&rsquo;s Private Members&rsquo; motion, we need an ongoing debate about restoring confidence in the economy and the financial system.  I agree with Senator Quinn that not only should cultural and political mindsets be changed in opposition, they need to change in government as well.  The notion of the Opposition saying &ldquo;No&rdquo; to what the Government does is no longer an option.  </P>

	<P>Whoever is in government needs to acknowledge here and now that such is the situation we find ourselves in internationally that all choices will not be popular, palatable and comfortable.

      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome yesterday&rsquo;s initiative on the part of the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement and the Garda fraud squad.  Given our extremely poor record in tackling white collar crime, it is important there be a public investigation of matters of ongoing public concern and I wish the investigation well.  Other actions are needed.  Now that Anglo Irish Bank is owned by the State, gratuities payable to, and pension agreements with, the principals of the bank should be suspended until all investigations are finished.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>It is in our motion.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>People involved in Anglo Irish bank at the time recent events unfolded who are on State boards and bodies should voluntarily step aside until all investigations are finished in order that a climate is created where confidence in this country can be restored.  The investigation is ongoing but the Government and the political system need to send out proper signals and as of yet, we have not adopted enough of them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>I disagree with Senator Quinn, although I am not comfortable with that because he is a wise and sensible man.  However, the contribution of my learned colleague on the Government benches causes my blood to boil because we are not getting leadership.  The day of reckoning has come and if we had such leadership in our country, would it not be easy?  Earlier, I listened to the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment on the radio on my way to the House.  She said the difference in the VAT rate between the North and the South was only 0.5% and it applied only to white goods.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased the House prompted action on Anglo Irish Bank because Members called for the deployment of the Garda fraud squad.  Given the investigation is under way, names cannot be released because that could prejudice the case that will come before the courts.  When the issue was discussed last week, Mr. Appleby and the fraud squad had not taken action in this regard.  It appeared no action would be taken against the bank but it has happened and, hopefully, that will lead to criminal proceedings.</P>
        <P>Senator Fitzgerald mentioned an article published today by Sam Smyth and it is interesting that a person who was seemingly involved has issued a statement saying he was misled in this regard.  Let him put his case to the courts and defend his position.</P>
        <P>I welcome the appointment of the new board of the RTE Authority and, in particular, the appointment of Tom Savage as chairman.  This was an excellent choice by the Government and he will bring great leadership to RTE.  I wish him well in his appointment.</P>

	<P>I have a good deal sympathy for the Cathaoirleach because he does his best but the situation here is highlighted by the fact that virtually every day he must call Members on the Order of Business who were not heard the previous day.  Why does the Leader continually resist attempts to regulate the Order of Business in the interests of the House in order that we can have a full and proper discussion?  Everybody knows he is standing up against this but many Government Members would support an expansion of the Order of Business.  The Leader should get off the fence and he should not refer&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <P Just="Left">Radio broadcasts of proceedings have stopped completely.  It is not surprising the only business ever reported on television or in newspapers is the Order of Business.  Today, <i>The Irish Times</i> columnist, Miriam Lord, had precisely three times the column inches of the column devoted to the collective wisdom of the Seanad.  It is the Leader&rsquo;s responsibility with the other officers to make sure we get proper attention and we get a proper way to give our views.</P>
        <P>I refer to the issue of the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment&rsquo;s interview, which I also heard and which should be discussed.  We need leadership.  President Obama was splendid.  He said America would have to face this day of reckoning and so on.  Half the time what we got from the T&aacute;naiste was not even English.  She talked about the need for &ldquo;strident government&rdquo;.  We might need prudent government but we do not need strident government.  She talked about &ldquo;a percentile increase&rdquo;.  I do not know what is a percentile increase.  I never heard of it.  I taught English for 30 years and I do not know what she was talking about.</P><Col N="62"/>
        <P>I accept there is a little movement and the Director of Corporate Enforcement has sent in garda&iacute;.  They can recover some of the information from the hard drives of computers.

	<P>The greatest criticism that I received from the public during the weekend concerned what purported to be democracy in the D&aacute;il last week.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>We are not dealing with the D&aacute;il.  On the Order of Business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>We should follow the lead of the voice in this House that is most measured, reasonable and probably knowledgeable, namely, that of Senator Quinn.  He may be the only person who takes that approach.  We must consider the situation calmly and constructively determine what should be done.  Will the Leader arrange a debate on Ireland&rsquo;s fiscal position?  I agree with the comments made by Mr. Peter Sutherland, a man of great expertise and who is well renowned in this field.  Many people inside and outside the public service have stated they are prepared to play their part.</P>
        <P>Concerning the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s statement this morning, I disagree with those who have criticised her.  She came across well and was reasonable and logical.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator would think that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>She spoke about the necessity for a cohesive approach.  Mr. Sutherland recognises the fact that, if none of our expenditure of &euro;55 billion, comprising &euro;20 billion on pay, &euro;20 billion on social welfare and &euro;15 billion on non-pay costs, can be cut despite our revenue falling short by &euro;18 billion or &euro;20 billion, we are on the road to ruin.  Anyone with any sort of mathematical sense would recognise this fact.</P>
        <P>During the debate, would it be possible to fill the Visitors Gallery with those who have recently been made unemployed?  It might bring a modicum of common sense and measurement to Senators who are inclined to use partisan language in the House&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>

      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and lead them to recognise that there is a constituency depending on those of us in politics to find a way through the current difficulties.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Will the Leader arrange for a separate debate on the ten-point plan proposed by congress?  It includes excellent ideas and others with which I would not agree, but it should be properly debated.</P>
        <P>When the Leader arranges the debates, would it be possible to organise them in a way that is not essentially stage managed?  Currently, people stand up to speak for ten or 15 minutes and much of their comments are irrelevant.  Could it not be done like the way in which discussions are held in committees?  Were we asked to defend and put logic behind some of our more outlandish statements, it would lead to a more constructive interaction, which is necessary in both Houses, not just the Seanad.</P>

	<P>I wish to ask the Leader three questions.  To echo other speakers on this side of the House, will the Leader arrange for the Minister for Education and Science to attend the House in respect of the loss of teaching posts?  Staffing schedules for <Col N="64"/>schools are issuing and have issued in the past week.  Schools are up in arms because so many posts are being lost to the children.  At a joint committee, the Minister told me that English language teaching posts would not be lost, but the reverse seems to be the case.  There is total confusion.</P>
        <P>Like other Senators, I am delighted that the Garda and the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement have moved on Anglo Irish Bank.  Given that international confidence in our banking system is at an all-time low, the move was necessary.  No regulation has worked and the situation has been too cosy.  Moreover, the move was necessary in terms of public confidence.  Businesses have told me that they are experiencing difficulties collecting money due to them.  It is not the case that people do not have the money owed.  Rather, they are not ashamed to refuse to pay thanks to the poor example being set by the top.  It has come to this because the Government has not set a good example and tackled white collar crime.  We must move on the matter and the Government must send the message that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>

For the sake of the country, will the Leader ask the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, to work co-operatively with Deputy Bruton, who has offered constructive solutions to the banking crisis?  Deputy Burton and Senator Ross would also be willing.  This is not a national Government proposal.  Rather, it is a question of seeking the competence&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>I have listened to this morning&rsquo;s contributions with interest.  Some Senators have spoken as if the serious economic difficulties gripping the world are of no concern to us or have no implications for us.</P>
        <P>When Members make a contribution, they should appreciate and understand, as a small island nation in the free market, the implications the present global problems have for weaker nations.  Equally, Members should neither underestimate the challenge facing us nor overstate our difficulties.  Individually, Members must send out a clear message of positivity to the effect they have firmness of resolve, unity of purpose and the determination to succeed.  I make this point because I support Senator Quinn&rsquo;s comments regarding unity of purpose.  Other world leaders, such as President Obama last night, also have made the point that, together, we can climb out of this crisis and this mess.</P>

	<P>However, this only can be done by working together.</P>
        <P>Some months ago, I asked the Leader whether he would discuss with the other group leaders in the House putting in place a structure within the proceedings of the House that would allow Members to deal with topical issues.  It would be done in order that Members could deal with whatever was the topical issue, be it economic, financial, educational, health related or whatever, and would be incorporated into the schedule of the House&rsquo;s business.  This would be helpful and I support its incorporation into the schedule of the House.  The Leader should respond as to how the discussions with the other group leaders progressed in that regard.</P>
        <P>I wish to raise two further issues with the Leader.  First, in respect of education, concern has been expressed regarding the loss of teachers and the capital building programme.  Will the Leader ask the Minister for Education and Science to put in place an official at the end of a helpline who would explain the implications or procedures that have been adopted in respect of these two issues?</P>
        <P>Second, I seek clarification from the Minister for Defence regarding the decision not to raise the <i>Asgard II</i>.  Should the <i>Asgard II</i> be left on the seabed where it lies, will there be other cost implications?  Will the French authorities ask us to raise it and so on?</P>

	<P>There has been much discussion today on competitiveness and the remarks made on the radio by the T&aacute;naiste this morning.  However, the Leader should ask the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, to explain the reason she has announced a salary of &euro;240,000 for hospital consultants on this side of the Border when consultants are paid &pound;100,000 north of the Border for doing more or less the same job.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>Perhaps she can explain the competitiveness of that issue.</P>
        <P>Moreover, the Minister, Deputy Harney, should appear before the House to explain why, although she spoke last year of 1,000 redundancies in the Health Service Executive&rsquo;s administration, all that have been seen since the beginning of the year are plans to close 11 hospitals, reduce home help services to elderly people and remove services to people with disabilities.  Only yesterday, it was announced that she intends to close 27 beds in Wexford General Hospital, 21 of which only were opened four years ago.  The Minister should appear before the House to discuss such issues with regard to competitiveness and how it affects the health service, rather than the waffle I hear from Government representatives.</P>
        <P>I wish to make a point in respect of the Government&rsquo;s seeking of support from the Opposition.  Although it received such support during the Lisbon treaty campaign, it was thrown back at us.</P>

At present however, only smart-alec talk can be heard from the Government side.  Its Members have no interest in working for the national interest and are present only for their own interest.

	<P>A crisis, by its nature, stultifies motivation and certainly slows down progress and solutions.  Often, a turning point comes in such a crisis unexpectedly.  The ingredient for such a turning point often comes without any fanfare.  A good example is provided by the situation in Northern Ireland.  Members debated the issue many times and felt there was no way out of it.  Then however, when least expected, such a resolution happened.  I believe Members have experienced the ingredient of a turning point in this House this morning, which was provided by Senator Quinn.  I believe he may have provided Members with a water<Col N="67"/>shed that will give them the potential to go forward in a united manner.  For instance, I do not believe that the Opposition perceives its role solely in terms of opposing.</P>

	<P>I believe Opposition Members perceive themselves to be watchdogs, and much more besides, in the democratic system.  This is exactly as it should be.  They also are reflecting the anger and disappointment that obtains at present.  However, when all that has finished, one moves on to a new phase.</P>
        <P>At the outset of this debate many months ago, I saluted Alan Dukes.  I can remember that at the time, one or two Opposition Members would not even allow me to finish the sentence.  The only reason I mentioned Alan Dukes was because of his courage.  He also provided the ingredients for a turning point at that time.  Members should not underestimate the contribution made by Senator Quinn this morning.  I have no doubts regarding its significance because of its source.  I believe Members will hear a lot more about this contribution in the coming months.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AlanKelly"><NameTxt>Senator Alan Kelly</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the action taken by the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement in the past 24 hours, which is essential from a symbolic perspective.  While one must await developments, the people must see action.  Although they now are seeing it, they need to see more such action from the Government to indicate how the investigation into the banks will be advanced and to create the conditions under which this cannot happen again.  Members may not be aware that the European Commission is considering the area of regulation from a European perspective as a layer above national regulation for banking.  Members should welcome this initiative because it would offer some protection that may not be afforded at national level at present.  It should be embraced and is something Ireland should play its part in trying to shape as this is a European issue as much as it is an Irish issue.  While particular components are Irish in outlook, a wider issue certainly exists and we need to play our part on the European stage.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I fully agree with Senator Twomey.  I have raised this issue on the Order of Business a number of times.  The current development in respect of hospital consultants in Ireland is wrong.  The proposed level of pay for such consultants is wrong.  The point has been made on all sides of the House that comparative analysis of salaries on this island reveals a complete disparity.  Moreover, I raised the issue in respect of back pay with the Leader last week.  While a statement has been made in this regard, its payment only has been postponed.  I do not believe it ever should be paid.  The issue that people pay consultants &euro;200 to &euro;300 for a consultation must be considered.  Such individuals are paid between &euro;220,000 and &euro;260,000 per year and can practise privately in public hospitals and may earn up to equal that amount again.  This is ridiculous.  In six months&rsquo; time, will any of the consultants concerned have dropped their charges?  My bet is they will not unless forced to so do and this must be addressed immediately.</P>

	<P>I am greatly heartened by the tenor in the House this morning regarding responsibility, which is taken seriously by all sides.  Senator Quinn has touched on the point superbly.  He has asked Members on all sides, regardless of their beliefs, to consider putting on the green jersey together and to put their shoulders to the wheel.  That is what the public expects us to do.  The debate has moved on.  There is much anger among the public.</P>

	<P Just="Left">We have been badly let down by the banking system.  In the European context, I welcome this morning&rsquo;s statement that there will be a higher layer of law to ensure we have a more strict and better run banking system.  The public will demand that.  The Leader should give us time to put ideas together.  I welcome Fine Gael&rsquo;s motion and am in agreement with much of it.</P>
        <P>I agree with Senator Walsh that the Government must re-enter talks with the social partners.  Time should be allocated for a debate in this regard.  I urge Senator O&rsquo;Toole to use his influence in this matter.  There are more intelligent routes to pursue than opting for strikes and causing widespread disruption to services.  That is exactly what we do not need at this time.  Senator Quinn&rsquo;s proposal should be developed.  Will the Leader engage with him to ascertain his suggestions in this regard?  It is important that we learn something every day in this House.</P>

	<P>Before responding to the Order of Business, I offer the sympathies of the House to the Government Whip on the sudden death of his mother last night.  It is a terrible time for any family when one of its number dies suddenly.  Our thoughts and prayers are with Senator Wilson, his wife and family on this Ash Wednesday morning.</P>
        <P>Senators Fitzgerald, O&rsquo;Toole, Alex White, Coffey, Donohoe, Boyle, Leyden, Norris, Walsh, Healy Eames, Callely, &Oacute; Murch&uacute; and Kelly expressed serious concerns regarding the current crisis in the banking system.  This matter will be discussed during Private Members&rsquo; time today.  Friday&rsquo;s debate on the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Bill 2009 will afford Members a further opportunity to express their views.  We are all aware of yesterday&rsquo;s search of the headquarters of Anglo Irish Bank by the Garda fraud squad.  Whatever can be done is being done by the Taoiseach and Minister for Finance.  Everybody must be given an opportunity to prove their innocence so that natural justice can take its course.  I welcome everything that is taking place to ensure the banking system is more transparent so that we all can say we had absolutely nothing to do with it.  We, as parliamentarians, put procedures in place and those procedures must be adhered to.  If they have to be amended or if new legislation is necessary, neither House will be found wanting, just as we were not found wanting in the past.  I say this confidently on behalf of the Taoiseach and the Government.</P>
        <P>I too welcome the magnificent state of the union address by the President of the United States, Mr. Barack Obama.  God bless him, he is a welcome guest wherever he goes and a shining light to uplift the world.  As I have said in this House before, Ireland can only hope to enjoy a corresponding recovery once the United States begins to lift its economy, followed by the United Kingdom.  We have a population of 4.5 million and a small, open economy.  We have gone down quickly but I am confident we will bounce back just as quickly.  We have the best opportunity we have ever had in terms of infrastructural, educational and other tools available to us to meet the challenges of the future.  We are facing a global crisis.  There is no race to the bottom and we are not talking ourselves down.  How uplifting it was to hear President Obama speak last night.  I spoke to many friends this morning who waited up until 2 a.m. or 3 a.m. to hear his speech.</P><Col N="69"/>
        <P>We all want to be uplifted.  The extent of bad news is one of the reasons that newspaper sales are declining.  It is lovely to be able to lift one&rsquo;s mood from time to time by tuning into a country music channel.</P>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;Members would display more common sense.  I never interrupt any Member but it seems to be the fashion now that the more educated one is, the more one interrupts.</P>
        <P>Senator Callely and others spoke about the situation in regard to the <i>Asgard II</i>.  I have no difficulty in asking the Minister for Defence to come to the House to update us on his proposals in this regard.</P>
        <P>Senators Healy Eames, Callely, Fitzgerald, O&rsquo;Toole and Kelly called for a debate on education in the course of which the Minister would update us on issues relating to his portfolio.  I have no difficulty with this proposal.  However, Members should bear in mind that, despite the extent of our financial difficulties, more than &euro;600 million is being spent this year under the capital programme.</P>
        <P>Senator Alex White called for a debate on retail prices.  The Senator&rsquo;s Labour Party colleague, Deputy Penrose, is the Chairman of the Oireachtas Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment, which is at an advanced stage in its deliberations on the review of the groceries order.  I propose we await the conclusion of that review in the coming weeks before inviting the Minister to the House to discuss the challenges identified by the committee.  It is interesting to note that members of the previous committee, which was called the Oireachtas Committee on Enterprise and Small Business and which I had the privilege of chairing, were in complete unison on this matter.  However, our all-party recommendations were not taken on board.</P>
        <P>That committee has been vindicated in this matter.  We conducted an in-depth analysis, consultants engaged by the committee worked hard to produce those recommendations and we made our case strongly.  We knew what would happen.  People must have options.  Corner shops and convenience stores continue to provide an important service to society in a situation where the nearest large store is often a drive away.  Poorer people may be obliged to hire taxis to bring them shopping outside their home town because there is no longer a corner shop or convenience store.  Local shops also offered a service in the past by allowing people a few days&rsquo; credit to purchase their groceries before they received their wages or social welfare cheque.  Now such people must go without.  That is another aspect of the issue.  There is much to be gained by reviewing the report of the last committee.  I hope it will be considered by the House when we deliberate on this matter.  Senators Coghlan and Leyden worked hard in formulating that report.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senators Coffey and McFadden called for a debate on competitiveness.  This is the greatest single challenge facing the State.  When the global economy begins to improve, the high cost <Col N="70"/>of doing business in Ireland will be to our disadvantage.  The Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, Deputy Cullen, observed on &ldquo;Questions and Answers&rdquo; on Monday night that in the case of a particular employer employing in the United States, Scotland and Ireland, the average wage paid in this jurisdiction is &euro;43,000, compared with a figure of &euro;33,000 in the United States and &euro;27,000 in Scotland.  That is a serious challenge to us, irrespective of whether the economy is buoyant or down as it is at present.  We have to address it and the social partners have a responsibility and duty, as we do as legislators, to see how we can do so.  I have no difficulty in providing in the very near future the longest time available for this debate on competitiveness.</P>
        <P>Senators Boyle, Walsh, Callely, &Oacute; Murch&uacute; and Buttimer referred to the proposal by Senator Quinn to call for support across the political divide for good projects.  The call has been made in sincerity and has been received well on all sides of the House.  As Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; said, perhaps this is the start of something positive for this session and the remainder of the year.  I support the call.</P>
        <P>The views of the former Attorney General were quoted in the House.  He is one of the leading businessmen in the world, which I acknowledge despite the fact that he is a member of Fine Gael.</P>

    <Title>Report on Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann: Statements. </Title>
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to take part in this discussion on the cost and efficiency review of Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann.  We welcome all contributions in considering the future of bus services in Ireland.  It is important we consider the context in which the review was undertaken.  Current and capital <Col N="72"/>Exchequer investment in Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann over the past ten years has been at unprecedented levels.  The CIE companies, including Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann are, like so many businesses, experiencing serious financial challenges, the magnitude of which was quite unexpected.  We have new and exciting opportunities with the launch of the policy document, Smarter Travel &mdash; A Sustainable Transport Future.</P>
        <P>The Government has, year on year, shown its commitment to public transport as investment has skyrocketed.  Since 2000 almost &euro;800 million has been paid to Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann in compensation for the public service obligation, PSO, services they provide.  In 2009 this will amount to approximately &euro;125 million, an increase of almost 120% on 2000.  Over the same period more than &euro;300 million in capital has been made available to the two companies towards the cost of 271 additional buses, 1,150 replacement buses and new and improved garages and bus stations.  This investment has delivered new and better services throughout the country and supported the economic prosperity that we have enjoyed over the past decade.  Despite the demands on Exchequer funding this year, the Government has taken the strategic view that continued support for public transport is essential to ensure that when the economy regains it strength we are ready to cope with every demand.</P>
        <P>The report, Smarter Travel &mdash; A Sustainable Transport Future, acknowledges that buses will have to play an even greater role in the future as we seek to make our transport system more sustainable.  The report sets a challenging agenda for the bus sector in terms of more frequent, reliable and comfortable services and through this we will get more people using bus services.</P>
        <P>We will have more and higher quality bus services and major improvements in traffic management.  Such measures will support the frequency and reliability of services and accordingly ensure essential bus services grow and prosper.  On first inspection it may seem like an unlikely time to launch an ambitious new action plan for bus services given the financial difficulties facing the sector.  However, such an approach would fail to take advantage of and utilise the appetite for change that is now present in how we deliver public transport.  A clear and strategic view of the type of bus services we want is essential to assist us in developing a world class public transport system and to guide the development of services.  Such a clear view is even more necessary when resources are limited and finances are under pressure.</P>
        <P>Like many organisations the CIE group is facing severe financial difficulties.  The annual Exchequer subvention in 2009 of &euro;313 million is an all time high and the CIE group was granted a 10% fares increase in 2009 to help offset rising costs and declining revenue due to a drop in demand for services throughout their networks.  The CIE companies are considering measures to reinstate their financial stability by reducing costs through greater efficiencies and services reduction.  We in Government have emphasised the need for any efficiencies to support the integrity of the public transport networks by maintaining services, especially peak hour services, at the highest possible level.</P>
        <P>Against the background I have outlined, the Deloitte &amp; Touche report is very timely.  The bus companies now have a valuable resource to assist in designing and implementing effective cost recovery plans that are responsive to the needs of the customer, the community and the economy.  The focus of the report is on the effectiveness and efficiency of the network of services provided by both companies.  The report emphasises that network design and the scheduling of drivers and buses should be led by the requirements of passengers and that bus services should be integrated and simple to understand.</P>
        <P>To date, our emphasis has been on giving the companies the tools they need to supply a high quality service.  Now our emphasis is turning to ensuring the best use is made of the valuable tools available to both bus companies.  The Deloitte &amp; Touche review facilitates our new focus. <Col N="73"/> With regard to Bus &Eacute;ireann, it concludes that the network is efficient and identified no potential scope to achieve cost savings without cutting services.</P>
        <P>Encouragingly, with regard to the Dublin Bus network the report reaches a number of key conclusions.  The current bus network has not been significantly redesigned for many years and this has produced a complex network with a significant amount of service duplication.  Dublin Bus now has the opportunity to create a simplified network offering improved services using fewer resources and serving the customer better.  The review identified that on one key corridor alone there may be the scope for savings of up to 17%.</P>
        <P>The report also concluded that timetables are not sufficiently co-ordinated in areas served by multiple routes and that bunching is a significant problem due not only to congestion but also to a lack of even headways between buses.  However, it is significant that the Dublin Bus fleet was found to be adequate to serve current demand.  This is testament to our investment decisions over the past ten years or so.  The report also recommends that scheduling efficiency be improved through timetable redesign, measures to deal with &ldquo;out of service running&rdquo;, and routes operating to a garage termini without apparent demand.</P>
        <P>On foot of its analysis, the Deloitte &amp; Touche report sets out a series of measures which will enhance the role of the bus.  With the identification of considerable scope within Dublin Bus to improve services to customers, increase efficiencies and save money through, for example, redesigning the network, eliminating unnecessary service duplication, and improving customer information, we now have an opportunity to improve public transport and we must seize it.</P>
        <P>It should be noted that the report rightly draws attention to the impact of congestion on bus services and the critical need to intensify efforts to improve bus priority.  Sound legislative frameworks and good levels of funding are important for good bus services.  However, from a daily operational perspective, the improvement of bus services is critically dependent on providing more and better bus priority to enable bus operators provide more frequent, reliable and attractive services for passengers and to derive maximum value from their fleets.</P>
        <P>In this context and reflecting the priority we attach to ensuring the effective operation of buses, &euro;70 million in Exchequer funding has been allocated for traffic management measures, including bus priority in 2009, despite the current difficult Exchequer funding position.  Some &euro;50 million of this funding is available for the Dublin area and I anticipate significant progress being made by Dublin City Council this year in addressing critical pinch points for the movement of buses.  Major works planned for this year include the provision of the College Green bus gate.</P>
        <P>In the regional cities of Cork, Galway, Limerick and Waterford, approximately &euro;20 million in funding is being made available for bus priority and park-and-ride projects.  Major works will include completion of the Carrigaline and Farranree-Blackpool green routes in Cork, the completion of phase 2 of the Dublin Road green route by Limerick County Council and further bus priority works in Claregalway and the Dublin Road in Galway.</P>
        <P>Now we have identified opportunities to improve the efficiencies of the bus companies and work in tandem with new policies such as smarter travel, we must consider the next steps.  Funding for bus services over the coming years will need to be very carefully managed.  Action is needed now not only to secure greater efficiency and value for money but also to ensure bus services can realise their potential to better meet the needs of the public and increase passenger numbers.</P>
        <P>We must move quickly to ensure we exploit the opportunities we have.  We now have a good framework for the fundamental review and reshaping of the network in the Dublin area to better meet the needs of the public at a lower cost.  Implementation plans are expected in the <Col N="74"/>coming days from the companies and I envisage these plans laying the groundwork for more customer-focused bus companies carrying more passengers.</P>
        <P>The bus is and should remain the backbone of public transport in Dublin for the foreseeable future and therefore we need to see major bus reform now.  People are looking for a fast, efficient, reliable bus service so they can leave their cars at home.  Through the implementation of the Deloitte &amp; Touche recommendations and other bus priority measures, we can deliver a better bus service to the public and start to grow passenger numbers again.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and thank him for his statement on the grave position of the bus market in Dublin and other providers of bus services.  In my contribution I will refer directly to the points made by the Minister of State but I will begin by referencing the current position.  A statement was made very recently by one of the unions involved in Dublin Bus to the effect that its members would go out and stay on strike until the needs of its members have been met.  I have not up to now heard that statement changed or retracted but it is disappointing to hear such a statement.</P>
        <P>With very few if any exceptions, the trade union movement has been very responsible and proactive in trying to deal with many of the difficulties faced by our country.  I would look to the actions taken by SIPTU in dealing with Aer Lingus and the leadership it exhibited in finding new deals and new ways of working to ensure the interests of its members are protected and recognised while also responding to the changed circumstances that Aer Lingus and our country finds itself in.  I would also look to the statement put forward by the ICTU relating to a ten-point economic recovery plan and although I do not agree with everything in it, it is a positive, constructive and detailed contribution to try to find a way forward in the awful difficulties of our country.</P>
        <P>These can be contrasted with a statement where a body indicates it will take its members out on strike and not come back until the matter is dealt with.  That is the last thing we want and such action would be very bad for members of the union and place them in awful difficulty.  It would cause chaos in Dublin and the surrounding region.  Things are bad enough for people at the moment trying to get in and out of their jobs, staying in employment and dealing with the mounting levels of stress that obtain.  To find our buses disappearing from our roads and streets at this point would deal a hammer blow to businesses within Dublin which depend on transport links for their employees and customers getting in.  It would be a severe blow for economic activity and the morale of our country.</P>
        <P>I call on the union in question to revise that statement and look to deal with the matter differently.  I call for the full machinery of the State that has the expertise and ability to deal with issues such as this to become involved and ensure something such as this does not happen.  It is the last thing our bus market and country needs at the moment.</P>
        <P>There are a number of points to be made about the Minister of State&rsquo;s contribution.  The overall theme is that many of the measures mentioned are to be welcomed and recognised.  The question should be asked why this kind of work was not done sooner and why the kind of reforms being spoken about were not implemented when times were good so that the right decisions could have been made.  We find ourselves, when times are bad, looking at the wrong decisions being made.  It would amount to nothing less than a colossal failure if Government transport policy resulted in a reduction in the number of buses &mdash; bus transport still being the most popular form of public transport here &mdash; in operation on routes at a time when commuters need them most.  Why were the measures outlined in the report not implemented sooner?  Why were they not in place to ensure members of Dublin Bus and the other bus companies would have had time to understand the changes that were needed and for such changes to be gradually <Col N="75"/>implemented to ensure bus users and bus providers would be far better placed to deal with the terrible difficulties we now face?</P>
      
        <P>There are three areas where the implementation of such measures would have been most significant.  The first one, touched on by the Minister of State, is the huge investment in public transport by the taxpayer.  He rightly referred to the huge amount of money that has been paid to Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann since 2000, amounting to nearly &euro;800 million.  In 2009 the allocation will amount to approximately &euro;125 million.  The key question is why was the release of such a large amount of taxpayers&rsquo; money to these organisations not tied to performance measures, measures related to the reliability of bus services and the ability to meet the transport needs of commuters?</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>In a recent discussion on this matter at a meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport, the Minister for Transport admitted that he could not find reliability measures to gauge if buses were arriving on time at bus depots and bus stations.  He said he had provided a map to many of the stakeholders who were involved in this crisis showing huge swathes of the Dublin region where bus routes are not provided or where bus services are not available at the frequency required by commuters.  The question that must be asked is why was nearly &euro;1 billion of taxpayers&rsquo; money released to these companies during the past nine years without this work being done, namely, without ensuring reliability measures were in place and such reforms were implemented to ensure that bus services on routes operate at the required frequencies.  Responsibility for this lies with the Government.  Having regard to challenges we face in terms of Dublin Bus and, to a lesser extent, Bus &Eacute;ireann, I question whether such challenges are not a symbol of the difficulties we face in terms of public expenditure, given that large subventions were made available to these organisations without asking them for explicit guarantees on the provision of their services.</P>
        <P>I am not the only one who is saying this.  The Booz Allen Hamilton report, commissioned by the Department of Transport approximately a year ago, examined whether the amounts of money released to these companies was adequate and how such allocations stacked up with allocations to providers in other European countries?  It had two interesting conclusions.  One was that the quantity of money being released to these companies is in line with that being made available to providers in other European countries.  That was reassuring.  The other question was why was the releasing of such moneys not made conditional on certain elements being delivered.  That was an obvious point.  Why were the moneys not released on condition that a certain mileage was covered each year or certain performance indicators were met?  Now that the Government and the political system will need to manage the difficulties faced by these companies in the coming months, the question that must be asked is why was &euro;800 million of taxpayers&rsquo; money released during the past ten years without the necessary preparatory work being done to ensure we had an efficient and a fair bus market in Dublin?</P>
        <P>I wish to raise two other points, one of which concerns the Dublin Transport Authority.  We had excellent debates here on the legislation establishing that authority.  An innovative and welcome measure is that the DTA will have the power to be the provider of last resort in terms of transport.  If for some reason transport services are not available, whether it be bus or train services or the Luas service, the DTA will have the ability to step in and provide that service.  As we approach a period of what appears to be significant industrial upheaval in our bus market, I want to ensure that a measure such as that will be examined by the Government because the legislative foundation for that measure is in place.  The Army made a statement recently that, if called upon, it would be willing to step in and provide essential services.  I hope that will be the last scenario we will need to consider.  We cannot reach a situation where there will be no buses in our capital or throughout the country.  That is unacceptable.  We need to examine ways to ensure that is avoided.  The law is in place to provide for that.  We must ensure <Col N="76"/>that the Government takes this matter seriously and puts in place new or different measures to ensure that we do not find ourselves in that awful situation.</P>
        <P>I wish to refer to the role the private sector can play in dealing with the position we face.  I lived in London for six years and I saw the diabolical state of the bus market in that city resulting from its deregulation.  Under no circumstances should people find themselves in a similar situation here.  It is a characteristic of human nature that a person will work harder when he or she knows that another company or person is seeking to do the same work.  I have to work very hard as a politician, as does the Minister of State, because he and I know that somebody else in our constituencies would like our jobs.  That is a powerful motivator in terms of human nature.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State signalled that legislation would be introduced to reform the bus licensing regime.  When it is being introduced, we should ensure that, if there are other operators that can provide bus services in an efficient manner and at good value for the taxpayer, we find a way of allowing them to operate in a regulated manner.  In opening the market we would need to ensure that such operators complement a well funded well run public service provider.  Both elements have a role to play in ensuring our bus market works not only now but in the years to come.  As was said here earlier, we know that the difficulties we now face will not disappear next month or even next year.  We must plan to ensure the necessary foundations are put in place to provide efficient services and guard against ever finding ourselves in a situation where  huge amounts of taxpayers&rsquo; money is released to organisations without the right reforms having been made to guarantee the provision of good companies and markets to serve the needs of our commuters.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I also welcome the debate on this issue.  Although I would probably be more at home speaking about ferries travelling to and from Bear Island, I am tasked with speaking on this matter.  </P>

	<P>It is good to see the Senator and the Minister of State together again.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>I acknowledge that the Government has spent considerable sums of money on the development of Bus &Eacute;ireann&rsquo;s bus services.  Like my colleague, Senator Donohoe, I lived in London for four or five years many years ago and I was a student in Dublin a long time ago.  When I am in the capital every week I notice the quality of the bus fleet and hundreds of new buses are now operating on various routes.  However, the efficiency of the service is a matter to be taken up under the Deloitte &amp; Touche report.</P>
        <P>I wish to raise two points with the Minister of State.  I thought the proposal for an integrated ticketing system, similar to that which operates in Paris, had evolved and was being developed.  One can buy a one day ticket or a weekly ticket to travel on the metro, bus or rail systems in Paris.  Whatever about Cork city or Galway city, in Dublin, the capital city, there should be an integrated ticketing system, given that there is the DART service, Luas services and bus services.  I would like the Minister of State to examine the introduction of such a system.  I will concede my colleague, Senator Donohoe, is much more familiar with the situation in Dublin than I am.  I mentioned the situation regarding the Dublin Transport Authority.  It is a point of interest the Minister might deal with in his response.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I chaired a Joint Committee on the Constitution which looked at the proposal to build the metro link from Dublin city centre to the airport.  We are living in a very difficult economic situation and I am not sure of the current status of that proposal.  An important aspect of it is that we concluded, because of the complexity of the issue of land and building an appropriate <Col N="77"/>tunnel to take the metro underground from the city centre to Dublin Airport, a simple piece of legislation could be introduced to provide, under our Constitution, for land on the route under 10 metres or approximately 30 feet underground, provided no structural damage was done to property, thereby getting over the constitutional issue of dealing with every householder and landowner between the city centre and Dublin airport.</P>
        <P>It was an interesting conclusion.  There was a parallel situation when gas was brought from Kinsale to Dublin, at little cost.  It is an angle which could be looked at from the point of view of securing the property issue and is a sensible provision used in other European capitals in such situations.  It is something which could be prepared for and done now, and when money is available down the road, the project could proceed.</P>
        <P>It is important to note the Deloitte &amp; Touche report which was published recently has a number of recommendations which the Minister and Government must take on board.  There are very valid resources out there.  I would like to see more competition, but what is important is that the focus of the report is on the effectiveness and efficiency of the network of services provided by both companies.  There is no doubt there is a situation where routes have been established for many years and have been extended, just for the sake of running the routes.  There must be a root and branch examination of the efficiency of each route to see if they are delivering value for money, if population shifts are changing, if different routes can cross the city and if there can be linked routes so every route does not automatically end up at the city centre and if there can be a simpler and more integrated system.</P>
        <P>It is imperative that we acknowledge the significant contribution made by Government over the last number of years, particularly since 2000.  Some &euro;800 million has been paid to Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann in compensation for their public services obligations.  In 2009 alone, the amount allocated is approximately &euro;125 million, an increase of 120% on the allocation for 2000.  The provision of substantial sums of money from the Exchequer and the taxpayer means one must demand and seek out value for money in all areas.</P>
        <P>It is also interesting to note that over the same period a total of &euro;300 million in capital has been made available to the two companies towards the cost of providing 271 additional buses.  This is something which should be recognised.  We can be critical of how things are done, but the fact that has been achieved is important.  It is also worth recording that 1,160 replacement buses and new and improved garages and bus stations have been provided in that time.  There has been significant investment by Government in this area.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It begs the question of whether we are getting value for money.  With all the money that has been spent, we must ask if the two bus companies will turn the corner and become profitable ventures.  The point made by Senator Donohoe about competition on routes is of critical importance.  As someone who occasionally uses Dublin Airport, I believe it is important to provide at least two or three different options to get from the airport to Dublin city centre.  More competition and perhaps more input from private enterprise would also be of some benefit to the public.</P>
        <P>There is an imminent threat of strikes by the trade union movement.  In particular, I hope those involved with running buses in Dublin stand back from the abyss of having strikes.  I was caught in Paris when bus drivers went on strike for two days and it was almost impossible to travel on the metro as it created a major knock-on effect.  I hope such a scenario will not emerge in this difficult situation.  I ask those responsible to think twice before bringing the capital to a halt and look at the financial consequences and the loss of revenue to the economy of Dublin if that were to happen.</P>
        <P>The smarter travel report was mentioned, which acknowledges that buses will have to play an even greater role in the future as we seek to make our transport more sustainable.  Perhaps <Col N="78"/>in his reply the Minister, in dealing with the smarter travel suggestion for higher quality bus services and major improvements in traffic management, would also look at the possibility of an integrated ticketing system for the capital.  As he has pointed out, significant future financial implications are involved.  The annual Exchequer subvention of &euro;313 million in 2009 is frightening.  It is a major service.</P>
        <P>In the era of the Celtic tiger &mdash; it is doubtful if it is still alive or purring and I think it may have gone to its cave &mdash; it is difficult to believe that, given the population growth in Dublin, an efficient bus service could not run on a profitable basis, but it is not happening in Dublin.  It is a significant challenge for the Minister and his Department.</P>
        <P>Another concern, which is sporadic and in a minority, is that of the safety of those travelling on Dublin buses.  It is regrettable that in this day and age bus drivers can be attacked, and in one instance a bus was more or less highjacked.  It creates major pressure and affects certain routes.  I hope the Minister, in conjunction with the Garda, will look at ensuring people working on and driving buses have a safe passage and the vast majority of the commuting public are respected.</P>
        <P>I wish to acknowledge the major works planned in 2009 for College Green bus gate are well under way.  The Minister also mentioned funding of &euro;20 million for regional cities such as Cork, Galway, Limerick and Waterford is being made available in 2009 for bus priorities and park and ride projects.  I compliment the Minister.  I have seen the park and ride efforts first hand in my home city of Cork and it is a significant boost in peak times to ensure city centres are not clogged up.  I would like to see a greater roll-out of it, whether in Dublin, Cork, Limerick or other areas where it is feasible.  It is something which should be lauded.</P>
        <P>I thank the Minister for coming to the House for this important debate.  I am sure my other colleagues will give a more in-depth analysis of the successes and failures of the bus and transport system in the city.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Senator Brendan Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State.  The Labour Party welcomes the report on the cost and efficiency review of Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann, which we are debating.  It is a very useful document which can, if implemented, provide a framework for a customer-focused approach to improving bus transport in Dublin and throughout the country.</P>
        <P>The terms of reference specified that the review should assess whether the resources currently available to Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann are used in the most effective and efficient way possible to deliver an optimum public transport service and to assess the effectiveness and appropriateness of the network of services currently provided; assess the operational efficiency of Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann with particular reference to resource utilisation; identify any issues, such as human resource or organisational issues, which adversely impact on the efficiency, effectiveness and sustainability of service; and make recommendations in regard to actions required to enhance efficiency, effectiveness and reliability of public transport services.</P>
        <P>Those terms of reference were appropriate and, by and large, were met.  Under the effectiveness and appropriateness heading, several improvement opportunities for Dublin Bus have been identified, which make sense.  They are as follows: over-complexity of network and services; the need for co-ordination of services along core corridors; direct routing where possible; need for timetable redesign such as clock-face departures; marketing and information provisions such as real-time bus stop information; and achieving value for money from service provision, all essential elements of any service.</P>
        <P>All these make sense, are very obvious and have been recommended by the transport user bodies for many years.  I question whether it was necessary to engage consultants to come up <Col N="79"/>with these recommendations because they must be part of any comprehensive blueprint for improvement and change.</P>
        <P>Given the nature of the Bus &Eacute;ireann service, there are not many challenges under this heading for the company other than more direct town to town services, which it provides.</P>
        <P>Under the efficiency heading, both companies come out well by international comparison and benchmarking.  Wages, fuel costs and engineering-maintenance costs are in line with benchmarks and many cost improvement efforts are already under way, which is encouraging.  Both companies can be rightly proud of those findings.  Before the report came out, I would have expected something worse than has been reported in this regard.</P>
        <P>On Dublin Bus fleet size, the report states:</P>
        <P LI="1">Our analysis shows that the current fleet size is adequate to service current demand.  We favour optimising the existing network and extracting full value from existing fleet before considering future fleet expansion.</P>
        <P FLI="0">However, the report does not recommend reducing the fleet size, which is what is being implemented by both companies.  It is the subject of some of the union problems referred to by my colleagues on both sides of the House.  This decision must be reversed in the interests of the bus user and of maintaining services.</P>
        <P>Senator Donohoe raised issues about the unions and Senator O&rsquo;Donovan said those responsible must reconsider their position.  There are two sides to every equation and the company has a certain responsibility in this regard as well.  Presenting a group of workers with a <i>fait accompli </i>, saying their jobs are gone and that one is taking the buses off the route is not the way to do business, whether in the public or the private sector.  If one adopts that attitude, whether in the public or the private sector, one will get the result we are seeing at present.</P>
        <P>The report laments the decline in numbers using the service, yet the decisions being taken by the companies will make matters worse.  I was informed by Dublin Bus yesterday that as a direct result of the reduction in the fleet by 10%, a very important route, the 105, which takes students from Malahide, Portmarnock and other points along the way to Dublin City University, is to be decommissioned.  These areas, which are within a six to ten mile radius of the regional third level college, will not be served by a direct service to the campus.  How can that make sense?  This decision must be reversed.  Given that the Minister requisitioned this study, should the bus companies not have focused on the recommendations contained in it rather than taking actions which were not recommended in the report?</P>
        <P>In the area of human resources or organisational issues, the report does not seriously reference any matters that might get in the way of the required changes being delivered other than the possibility of claims for disturbance money.  That is also relatively good news.</P>
        <P>I take issue with the methodology employed by the study.  Deloitte &amp; Touche&rsquo;s approach to this review was to undertake a substantial amount of desktop analysis, consult extensively with senior management in both companies covering a range of functions and hold stakeholder meetings with Dublin City Council, D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, the Dublin Transportation Office, Dublin City Council and the bus route licensing division of the Department.  All those measures were justifiably carried out, but the key stakeholders are the bus users.  Surely there is some merit in gaining insights from the workforce below senior management level.  This report would be much stronger if there was some involvement by the workforce.  Some effort should have been made to tap into the insights of this very important group of stakeholders.</P><Col N="80"/>
        <P>I refer to the public sector obligation, PSO.  The report concludes that Government PSO payments, including capital payments to both companies, are relatively low.  It states that in Europe, levels of operational subvention are generally higher as a percentage of revenue &mdash; it is 68% in Brussels, 57% in Zurich, 62% in Amsterdam, 79% in Lyon and 38.5% in London.  The Dublin Bus PSO payment in 2007 equated to 29% and Bus &Eacute;ireann was 12% of total revenue.  These significant differences in commitment to public transport are worthy of note and confirm what the Labour Party has been saying in this regard for many years.  Under the efficiency heading, the bus companies met the benchmark targets but the Government did not in regard to PSO.</P>
        <P>The report touches on a number of supply and demand side considerations to deal with congestion, which is rightly considered a major issue for both companies, restricting their efficiencies and increasing their cost bases.  One of these is congestion charges in the city centre.  These may become part of a solution in the future but not before the various elements of Transport 21 are in place which will allow people to get out of their cars.  London had the public transport infrastructure but Dublin does not yet have it.</P>
        <P>The report notes that the outdated Road Transport Act 1932, as amended, is the primary legislation governing the provision of passenger services by private bus operators while a separate authorisation regime applies to Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann.  It states that the current system is reactive rather than proactive when it comes to granting licences and that Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann are concerned that the current licensing regime does not take into account the impact of granting a licence to a private operator on its overall obligations to operate comprehensive PSO networks.  They believe a clearer policy is required to avoid cherry-picking of profitable routes by private operators and I have some sympathy with that position.</P>
        <P>We need to modernise the licensing system and have a comprehensive debate on it.  We cannot have a continuation of a licensing regime which last year did not allow Dublin Bus, with its 41X service, to pass through major expensive national infrastructure like the port tunnel.</P>
        <P>I refer to the recommendations that include Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann recommendations and some general recommendations that apply to both.  They make perfect sense and have the potential to deliver real improvements for service users.  I do not intend to go through them as they are in the report.  However, as mere recommendations they are useless; they must be implemented.</P>
        <P>On implementation, the report suggests a three-phase approach: phase one, focus on assembling the team, planning the programme of work and initial consultations; phase two, design and implement a pilot; and phase three onwards, design and roll out new services to remaining corridors.</P>
        <P>It estimates that the initial phases one and two could be set up and implemented in a six-month timeframe with the subsequent roll-outs over an 18 to 24 month timeframe.  I have some sympathy with the views of Senator Donohoe that perhaps this is not the time to do this, that there is less chance of implementing and achieving these phases now and that if we had done this four or five years ago, we might have had a greater chance of success and we might have the infrastructure in place today.</P>
        <P>The Minister has the report so he should implement it.  As I said, he should stick to the report&rsquo;s recommendations and not decommission the buses.  He should also heed the warning contained in the report.  The programme of work represents fundamental change for the company and should be regarded as a major change and transformation programme.  The correct sponsorship and resources will be required if it is to be successful.  The changes must be made in a co-ordinated way and it is essential the needs of the customer are central.  It is important <Col N="81"/>to remember it is an integrated set of recommendations and that an <i>ad hoc</i> approach or the selection of some elements or the ignoring of others will be unsuccessful.  Let us hope the report does not end up on the shelf covered in dust.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>It is apt that we have this report at a time of considerable public controversy with regard to the funding of bus services.  The impression has been created that the Government has been providing fewer resources for Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann, but subvention to both companies has remained the same.  What has happened is that the number of passengers has decreased and this is what has led to the decisions taken by management with regard to the curtailment of services and routes, particularly in the case of Dublin Bus.  This is regrettable, but it was not a Government decision.</P>
        <P>It could be argued that Government could increase subvention and if resources were available, that should be given serious consideration.  However, due to the current economic situation the two companies concerned must cut their cloth according to their resources.  Although I wish it were otherwise, we provide lower subvention for public transport compared to other European countries.  In recent years the subvention rate has increased and, by default, will, ironically, increase further as the cost base of both Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann is reduced.  This is the sad effect of the current situation.</P>
        <P>We must not only acknowledge the slight increase in subvention over the past ten years, but also recognise the significant capital spent, which has provided some 1,400 buses for both companies.  While these were mainly replacement buses, some 271 were new buses.  This demonstrates the redirecting of a commitment towards public transport, particularly bus transport.</P>
        <P>We need to make public transport more diverse and to provide people with more options, but at the same time, any public transport policy must have a bus-centred approach.  This is true not just for Dublin, but for the rest of the country.  The figures mentioned by Senator Ryan, indicating the level of subvention for Dublin Bus as opposed to Bus &Eacute;ireann, demonstrate how significantly the major urban centres outside of Dublin continue to be at a disadvantage.  Dublin Bus gets two and a half times the subvention rate provided to Bus &Eacute;ireann, despite the fact it has alternative public transport in the form of DART, Luas and suburban rail.  In all our other major urban centres all we have is a bus service, often quite a meagre service.</P>
        <P>Despite this, the report indicates there are better management and efficiencies in Bus &Eacute;ireann than in Dublin Bus.  We need to ask the reason for this.  Two years ago, Dublin Bus earned a profit of &euro;5 million, but this year it has suffered significant losses.  Following the introduction of Luas and an overall increase in the numbers of people using public transport, Dublin Bus, despite being given additional resources and new buses, found itself carrying fewer passengers.  We must ask why this has happened.</P>
        <P>Ten years ago, I was appointed through the social partnership process to represent the community and voluntary sector on the public transport consultative forum, which was established by the Department of Transport and included trade union and business representatives and representatives of community interests, to examine the direction public transport should take in the years ahead.  It is somewhat depressing that we have not moved far down that road, but we should still give consideration to some of the proposals made then.</P>
        <P>We had a somewhat fruitless argument about whether State transport companies should be privatised or whether more private interests should be included.  There are other alternatives, such as the French public transport system, the city-based bus system in particular.  A method used in France to reinvigorate the public transport systems in metropolitan areas is to put the management of the companies, which are municipal companies, up for tender every five years <Col N="82"/>or so.  Therefore, there is a new management system every five years.  This system is successful because it avoids the ennui and predictability we see here with public transport.</P>
        <P>This may be off the point, but I remember as a first time councillor visiting the manager of a train station in Cork who did not seem to realise that the towns of Cobh and Mallow were of equal size, but was considering withdrawing a successful train service to Cobh.  I have often found it frustrating that many of the principals in our public transport companies do not use public transport.  It makes the situation even more difficult when we have this kind of mindset in the management of companies meant to be promoting public transport and making it more efficient.</P>
        <P>We still have difficulty in Ireland convincing the public that public transport should be the first option for getting from A to B.  This is the norm in most countries, but in Ireland public transport seems to be the poor relation.  Until we can get past this mindset, we will continue to be, despite recent economic circumstances, one of the most car-dependent countries in the world.  There is no reason we cannot have greater reliance on public transport.  I welcome the increased subvention and capital for public transport, but we are still in a situation where the greater preponderance of resources is given to private motor transport.  Until we get the right equilibrium in this regard, we will still treat public transport as the poor relation.</P>
        <P>Dublin has successful alternatives to buses in the Luas and the DART.  Despite this, we have seen obstructionism on the part of Dublin Bus, in terms of both competency and management, with regard to bringing about the changes needed in public transport in our capital city.  The main reason we do not have an integrated ticket system &mdash; as is found in most developed public transport systems of the world &mdash; is reluctance on the part of Dublin Bus management.  Until it overcomes this difficulty, Dublin Bus will remain a loss-making company and will be portrayed as a company that does not fulfil its potential to meet public transport needs.</P>
        <P>Given the lower level of subvention it receives, Bus &Eacute;ireann does far better with the resources available to it and has a more effective management system.  The Government needs to discover why the company with fewer resources is doing better than the company that receives more.  This is the essence of what we must learn from this report and I hope we do that.  If we put the lessons we learn into practice, we can, I hope, point the way, because we have a considerable journey to make.  I am not playing a pun here on the Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann slogan &mdash; we&rsquo;ll get you there, eventually.  Public transport has a journey to go, but it can get there given the appropriate resources, political support and attention to the details of this report.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sorry Senator Boyle is leaving the House because we share common ground on this issue.  I welcome the Minister of State.</P>
        <P>It is important we focus on two aspects of the report, namely Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann.  The issue of subvention is controversial and Senator Ryan read into the record the public service obligation.  Capital payments here are low compared to other countries.  The basic question is whether we want proper public transport.  We must stop hiding behind the unions of Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann or behind their management.  We need ministerial leadership and authority on the question of the provision of public transport by Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann.  Let us stop the charade of blaming the workers and managers and let us have leadership and authority from Government.</P>
        <P>We need value for money and we must examine and create better efficiencies in the provision of public transport.  The bottom line is that public transport must be about serving people and, as Senators Boyle and Donohoe rightly said, offering diverse transportation arrangements.  We must think beyond the old regime and the traditional formats of public transport.  Undoubtedly, <Col N="83"/>much change has taken place and much of it has been good, which we welcome.  This is down to commitment by workers, management and successive Governments.  As Senator Boyle stated, we made a profit of &euro;2.5 million and it is gone.  Where did it go?</P>
        <P>The report states that Bus &Eacute;ireann passenger numbers increased between 2001 and 2007 and they increased by 6% in Dublin Bus.  Surely at a time of economic recession and frugal living more people will look to public transport.  I will return to Senator Boyle&rsquo;s comments on the French and Spanish models.  The French model with regard to putting the management up for tender is one we should examine and I would have no difficulty with this.</P>
        <P>We should tie in more with local authorities.  Rapid transport corridors will be introduced in Cork in three parts of the city.  I welcome this and I accept that at a time of economic stringency the money may not be available to fund and promote these new routes from the train station to Ballincollig via UCC and the CIT and from the airport into town and to Blackpool and from Mahon to the city centre.  The planning process should begin now so that when we come into times of money again, which will happen, we will have the plans ready to go and we will not be waiting or procrastinating.  It is important that we look at how the local authorities and the Department of Transport interact and the way in which people use various modes of transport.  Is the Minister of State prepared to do this with regard to Cork city?</P>
        <P>The car is the first port of call, and it should not be, for the majority of people in our cities and in metropolitan Cork covered by the Cork area strategic plan, CASP.  Last week, when schools were on mid-term break, one could drive from Bishopstown to the city centre in ten minutes.  On a school day, it takes almost 45 minutes at peak times in the evening and in the afternoon.  We have failed miserably to move people away from car dependency.  The modal shift must start again and we must sell the package better.  We must offer people a reason to move.</P>
        <P>To prepare for today&rsquo;s debate I spoke to a number of people who use buses on a regular basis in Cork and Dublin.  I was told services were unreliable, expensive and had poor timetabling.  Dublin has the Luas and the DART but Cork has no competition.  I praise the workers of Bus &Eacute;ireann in Cork and Joe Fitzgerald, the manager, who is very affable and is willing to meet and speak to public representatives.  By comparison, private companies are reasonably priced, well structured and reliable.</P>
        <P>A passenger who uses public transport to get to work in Dublin told me it was preferable to walk a mile to get the Luas rather than wait for a bus.  When I ask why I was told by the person that taking the Luas would mean getting into town in 20 minutes and getting to work on time whereas the No. 44 bus would take at least an hour.  Another passenger told me of seeing people who, after waiting for a 46A but, flagged down a taxi.  This does not make sense.  Surely, as the report states, our bus schedules should be led by the requirements of passengers.  Passengers must be at the core of public transport delivery.  It is a service for people to ferry them from point A to point B.</P>
        <P>I call for more radical routes.  Displays at bus stops showing real time arrival, as at Luas stations, must become part of our commitment to the people.  Integrated ticketing has been discussed and I blame the Government for failure to do this.  There is no other excuse.  Stop blaming the management and the workers.  The Government has the authority and it should drive it on.  It makes no sense that we do not have integrated ticketing in this city.  Consider Barcelona where one can buy tickets for zones and hop on and off.</P>
        <P>I welcome the commitment of Bus &Eacute;ireann in Cork and I acknowledge what the Minister of State stated about the Carrigaline route.  I hope we will see it come to fruition.  Recently, Bus &Eacute;ireann changed the Cork city to Monkstown route.  These are growing satellite towns in Cork <Col N="84"/>which require a proactive bus service.  CASP must be integrated with the local authority and Bus &Eacute;ireann.</P>
        <P>How many people here can tell me the cost of a bus ticket in Dublin?  The last time I checked, it was &euro;2.20, which is preposterous.  We should consider allowing bicycles to be carried on buses, DART and commuter trains during off peak hours and on Saturdays.  Introducing ticket zones, as exist in Barcelona, would also be of help.  To incentivise people, can we provide a better discount for buying tickets in bulk?</P>
        <P Just="Left">We can get people away from cars and into buses.  I travel by train, bus, plane and car.  If we had a proper bus system and public transport system we would have a healthier society with less traffic congestion and pollution and more efficiencies.  This is in the hands of the Government.  The Minister of State can drive the bus or be the back seat passenger.  It is his choice.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Senator Ann Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>I love constructive thinking rather than talking the talk, as we do much of the time here.  At long last we have what I would call a brainstorming exercise.  I do not have great knowledge on this area.  I did not have time to read the report.  I scanned it this morning and, from my scanning, I can see there is much more to read in it.  I would love to have a more detailed debate on it.  Listening to the contributions this morning, I will echo many of the points made already.</P>
        <P>This report is on how to bring about better efficiency and a reliable mode of transport in cities and towns and in rural and express services.  Because I had not done much thinking on it, yesterday morning I stood at a bus stop for 25 minutes at which point four buses came together.  I had thought I would have had to get a taxi to the Seanad.  I love the line in the report which refers to this as &ldquo;bunching&rdquo;.  What a lovely line to use.  I would never have thought to use it.  When the four buses arrived, each of them had approximately three passengers.  Before they arrived, there was an out-of-service bus.  I believed I was going to have a heart attack at that stage.  It was the first bus that came and the others came after it.  The report touched on the fact there is a real need to ascertain how we can best stagger timetables such that buses would come every five minutes and that one would not have to wait any longer than this.  During the 25 minutes for which I was waiting, I looked at the timetable, which was on a little barrelled thing, but could not read it.  I took out my glasses, looked at the timetable and tried to see the print but one would have wanted binoculars to read it.  I could not get the feel of it.</P>
        <P>We talked today about subvention and the very bad economic times.  It was suggested that, with the downturn, we will not be able to invest much in the bus service.  I sometimes wonder whether money has any bearing because it is a question of efficiency and management.  How do we go about managing routes and integrating services?  I live in Dublin 4 but I figured out that if I wanted to go to Tallaght Hospital, I would have to get a bus to the Luas stop at St. Stephen&rsquo;s Green, from where I would get a Luas to Tallaght.  That is not too bad for me.  However, if I were living farther out, for example in Stillorgan, how would I get to Tallaght?  How is the system working, if at all?  Perhaps it is and I do not know about it.  It should not be too hard to create an integrated system.</P><Col N="85"/>
        <P>Have we debated linking services with big schools, retail centres and HSE services?  Have we thought about the City Imps?  Are these buses still in existence?  How about facilitating senior citizens to travel from A to B between 2 p.m. and 5 p.m.?  I do not know if such services exist.  I have not done enough reading and am, therefore, not knowledgeable enough to say much more, but I would like my questions to be answered simply so the public will have the relevant information.  Perhaps timetabling is the way forward, such that people could, at various points, step on the bus with their tickets.  This seems to be the European approach.  We should certainly consider it because I am not so sure we have got it right yet in this country.</P>
        <P>Duplication on routes is a waste.  Five or six buses of different numbers may travel on the one route, albeit coming from different angles.  Perhaps I am lucky to live in a location where four or five buses of different numbers operate on the route that serves me.  However, when one sees two No. 10 buses coming one after the other, something is not right.  A 64A and 46A may be coming behind them, which is not right either.  We must stagger the service.  Timetables should be made easy to understand.  Out-of-service buses should not be going to garages during peak traffic times and they should come on stream during non-peak times.</P>
        <P>It is not always a question of money.  The way to deal with any changes is to sit around the table with the unions, management and other interested parties.  People want to co-operate.  Now, more than ever, there is need for change.  The philosophy of life is changing, as is our psychological approach to everything.  We have the opportunity to interact and bring about change in a non-confrontational way.  We have been confrontational in the past.  Let our union representatives and others sit down and negotiate.  The change I propose should not be too hard to make.  I look forward to a more detailed debate on this subject, perhaps in a couple of months when circumstances stabilise somewhat.  At present, everybody is frantic in his or her thinking and I hope we steady up, settle down and decide how we will make services work in every way.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Paddy Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to say a few words on transport.  The bus service is so complicated that the ordinary individual is put off using it.  Reports show a drop in the number of passengers using the service last year and it is forecast that there will be an even bigger drop this year.  I presume the same will be the case in 2010.</P>
        <P>While Dublin is not a big city compared to others, it lacks a major central bus station where all buses from rural areas would converge and from which all routes would begin.  There are a number of central stations in Dublin and this adds to the complication.  Coupled with this, there are two Luas lines that do not join up.  The transport system in Dublin is an absolute mess and the Government is not doing enough to create a system for the whole city that is considered easy to use by both urban and rural passengers.</P>
        <P>Integrated ticketing has been on the agenda for quite a number of years.  It is unbelievable to think we have not progressed further in this regard than we did five or ten years ago.  Integrated ticketing is essential in a city such as Dublin.  That one cannot avail of it in this day and age, regardless of where one comes from, is unbelievable.  I do not really know what is holding us back from having integrated ticketing but achieving it should surely be high on the agenda.  It should not be too difficult to solve the problem.</P>
        <P>I received an e-mail in recent days from a student going to college in Sallynoggin.  He outlined the difficulties he experiences trying to obtain public transport to travel to college.  There are no feeder buses at one end of the DART line, which makes it very difficult for him to travel on the DART, and he must therefore take the bus.  The bus costs him &euro;3 per day, or &euro;60 per month, which, as student, he cannot afford.  There should be feeder buses serving the DART and Luas systems.  It seems there is none in many cases.  It is reasonable to have feeder buses rather than to have all buses come straight into the city and go from the centre out.</P><Col N="86"/>
        <P>There is a lot to be done if public transport is to be improved.  As Senator Buttimer and others have said, a better public transport system would be better for the country and the passenger and it would reduce air pollution.  Some of the issues raised today need to be prioritised urgently.  There is no doubt that we need union agreement on some of the issues and I am sure that, with negotiation, this is possible.  The problem needs to be tackled urgently because it seems to feature from one year to the next.</P>
      
        <P>Integrated ticketing has been on the agenda for some considerable time but we are no closer to achieving it than we were some years ago.  I do not know how advanced the plans are for linking the two Luas lines.  I am delighted to have had an opportunity to speak on the report.  I urge the Minister to put an integrated ticketing system in place as a matter of priority.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MariaCorrigan"><NameTxt>Senator Maria Corrigan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern.  I am pleased to have an opportunity to speak on this important issue which has a real impact on people&rsquo;s quality of life.  I was struck by the contributions made by speakers on all sides of the Chamber.  I will not repeat what has been said but I support many of the points made.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I wish to focus on a number of the report&rsquo;s recommendations.  There has never been a better time to consider how we can improve the public transport service for customers, increase efficiency and save money.  I note that the report recommends an increased move towards cashless transactions and the introduction of an integrated smart card ticketing system.  The report outlines that such a system would be especially important to decrease the amount of time buses are stopped at bus stops.  As buses operate on a driver-only system, customers paying cash can result in an increased amount of standing time.  I strongly support the recommendation for a number of reasons that go beyond the decrease in the amount of bus dwelling time.  It is essential to have an integrated ticketing system if we are serious about enhancing the attractiveness of public transport as a viable option for the travelling public and if we are serious about asking people to leave cars at home.</P>
        <P>When reading that section of the report I was reminded of the time I spoke to staff in Dublin Bus about the provision of a shuttle service that would not necessarily go to town but would link into other modes of transport, for example, the Luas or DART.  I was told such a service would never work because people would not use it and that I did not understand the psychology of the commuter.  As a psychologist I was especially taken with being told I did not understand the psychology of the commuter.  I was informed that commuters do not like to switch vehicles and that they like to get from the start of their journey to their destination using only one vehicle.  I was not able to locate the study that came to that conclusion and I am not sure which psychologist carried it out but we have all had opportunities to travel abroad and utilise complex transport systems and we do not appear to mind if we have to switch vehicles in other countries.  I do not see what psychology has to do with us not wishing to switch vehicles when we come back to Dublin, Cork, Galway or wherever.</P>
        <P>I believe that being asked to pay twice for the same journey is an issue for commuters.  Without an integrated ticketing system in place people are asked to pay for the bus that takes them to the Luas station and then they must buy another ticket at a vending machine to use the Luas.  I welcome the fact that so much work has gone into the integrated ticketing system and that we are coming to the stage where it will be possible to pilot it.  I urge the Minister to look carefully at the fare structure we put in place for the system.  It could be useful to base it around designated travel zones to get the maximum benefit from the system.  The journey from Leopardstown to Stillorgan could be one travel zone and from Stillorgan to Donnybrook could be another one so that a journey from Leopardstown into the city could be two or three travel zones.  It should not matter how many vehicles one utilises to get from one point to the other <Col N="87"/>if the journey cost is based on the number of travel zones involved.  That system is in place in London and New York, for example, and it is beneficial in that one pays once for the journey and one does not have to spend time buying another ticket.  The recommendation on real time passenger information contained in the report is a practical one that would be of benefit also.</P>
        <P>I understand that given the economic circumstances we will have to consider readjusting some of the services we provide.  I urge that those changes be made on the basis of knowing and meeting customer need.  We must bear in mind that certain customers do not have an alternative.  I refer to schoolchildren going to school, students going to college, commuters going to work or older people living within the community.  We should readjust our thinking and not assume that all journeys begin and end in the city centre.  That comes across strongly in the report.  We must consider introducing radial routes, alternative modes of transport and taking people directly to centres of public use such as schools, shopping centres or hospitals.</P>
        <P>Dublin Bus must take into account that continuing infrastructural developments such as the ongoing development of the Luas system will present a challenge to it.  There is no point in it trying to compete directly with the routes served by the Luas.  Rather it would be more beneficial, efficient and better value for money if Dublin Bus could consider ways to augment and supplement the transport options provided by the Luas.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Members for their constructive comments.  We had a good discussion.  It is evident that people wish Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann well and that they would like to see a greater use of public transport.</P>
        <P>Senator Donohoe referred to the danger of a hammer blow in the event of a strike.  Today we are discussing the Deloitte &amp; Touche report and the strike relates to day-to-day public transport operations.  The subvention is at a very high level but there are financial problems in Dublin Bus because of reduced passenger numbers and increased costs.  The company has to meet that challenge in the same way as any other organisation.  This year the subvention for Dublin Bus is approximately &euro;125 million and it is more than &euro;300 million for the CIE group of companies this year.  The subvention is at its highest level but, obviously, Dublin Bus would like it to be higher.</P>
        <P>Meetings are taking place at the Labour Relations Commission today and it is for the companies to work out matters through the industrial relations process with the unions.  I hope they can do business.  I agree strikes do not achieve anything and it would be better if both sides could work things out.  I fully agree with Senator Ryan&rsquo;s suggestion that companies should consult people below management level.  That is a good idea.  Nobody has a patent on good ideas. Many workers in Dublin Bus and elsewhere have good suggestions and ideas about how to run everything on a proper basis.  We are in a new world and times are difficult and different.  Many workers realise circumstances have changed and people must give a little.  Sometimes workers are more understanding of the realities than managers.  If everyone is reasonable, I hope there will not be a strike but that is for the relevant parties to work out.  Sooner or later they will have to do this and, therefore, they might as well do it before the workers strike.</P>
        <P>Senator Donohoe asked why a review was not conducted previously.  Dublin Bus says it was, but it was not implemented fully.  Equally, public representatives have been blamed occasionally where the company had proposals to amalgamate services and amend routes.  People at different levels as well as public representatives, together with local community groups, might have lobbied against proposals by Dublin Bus.  Occasionally, the company puts that forward as a partial excuse.</P><Col N="88"/>
        <P>I refer to the Finglas route highlighted in the report.  Amalgamations and linkages are proposed but a number of the new routes could not have been put in place ten years ago because they serve housing estates that were not built at the time.  One route serves Hampton Wood, Charlestown, Lanesborough, Macetown and Meekstown in north-west Dublin where between 3,000 and 4,000 houses and apartments were built in the past few years.  The bus route goes through Finglas into the city centre.  That could have not happened ten years ago because the houses had not been built.</P>
        <P>However, in many cases routes are fundamentally the same and when new housing estates were built, two stops were added to the end of routes and the company did not adjust them.  The view is that the company did not take a fundamental look at bus routes, and now might be the time to do so.  Timing is important with everything.  Senator Ryan asked why a consultant was needed because everything he came up with is based on common sense and everyone knew this, but if everyone knew this, it did not happen previously.  Actions are often proposed but they do not happen because the timing and the other ingredients needed are not right.  This might be the time to examine the issue more deeply, as people realise funding is not limitless.</P>
        <P>It is a difficult set-up and Senator Donohoe referred to reliability measures, which are debatable.  It is more difficult to adopt such measures on public roads compared to, for example, a railway track where everything is under the company&rsquo;s control and such measures are easier to employ in theory.  I do not excuse Dublin Bus, but traffic is an issue on a public road, policing comes under the Garda, the roads are managed by the local authority and other motorists use the roads.  Even with investment in bus lanes, it is difficult for bus companies to operate.  When buses arrive in bunches, it drives everybody nuts because they have waited 25 minutes for a service, but it is a complicated business.  At the same time, the Senator stated that subvention payments are linked to memoranda of understanding with the companies on the basis that they meet targets relating to mileage, hours of service and so on.  The money was not lashed out willy-nilly.  Reliability measures and other standards relating to what should be achieved might be laid down but, unfortunately, they are not as easy to implement as we would like.</P>
        <P>A number of members, including Senator O&rsquo;Donovan, mentioned integrated ticketing and I do not deny it has been debated for a long time but progress is being made.  The CIE companies launch interim smart cards towards the end of this year and next year.  IBM was appointed last year to build the back office computer system and it is hoped the full roll-out of real time passenger information will be completed by 2011.  That is currently one of the problems with the DART and Luas.  While one reads the timetable, it is sometimes a work of fiction.  It outlines the services scheduled and planned but they are not provided sometimes and, therefore, proper real time information is needed so that customers can have a greater belief that the service they expect will be delivered.</P>
        <P>Dublin Bus is introducing an automatic vehicle location measure.  Every bus will have a gadget that will signal its location and this, in turn, will provide real time information at bus stops, which will be updated, as necessary.  It will never be perfect because even if the bus is only 100 yards from a stop, it could still be delayed.  However, the system will be programmed with information about how long it takes to travel, for example, from Parnell Street to College Green at different times of the day.  If real time information was provided at bus stops and linked to the smart card system, commuters would be able to move between services more freely, which is the ultimate aim.  This would provide for the DART, Luas, metro and bus services to be linked.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Donovan raised the issue of the metro.  The oral hearing for the railway order, which concerns planning permission, will commence next week.  Hopefully, it will remain on <Col N="89"/>schedule, subject to the railway order application.  The final say so will be given when the cost of the project is finalised.  It will be part funded by the Exchequer and a PPP will be pursued.  Four major companies are working on a price and, hopefully, a good price will be achieved.  Some commentators will say times are difficult and large projects such as this should not be undertaken, but this is the time to do it and I sincerely hope it is undertaken.  Fewer people are at work, which means fewer people are using buses and the M50, for example, which means it is easier to move around to do one&rsquo;s business.  If major capital works are to be undertaken in the city centre, it is better to do them when business is quieter than when it is hectic.</P>
        <P>A number of Members said that even if subvention to the bus companies amounts to &euro;300 million a year, it is still much lower than in other countries.  However, I referred to the number of new buses bought by Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann through Government funding in recent years.  Other countries might have a better subvention system but buses are never supplied by the Government.  The subvention might be more generous but the bus companies have to replace and purchase news buses themselves.  One should watch out when considering international subvention statistics.  It is important to realise that it is sometimes a case of apples and oranges in that one may not be comparing like with like.  While I accept the general principle and am not suggesting that Ireland has the highest subvention levels in Europe, since we certainly do not, we must be careful concerning what we are considering.</P>
        <P>Senator Boyle referred to the mindset, in that a number of people view public transport as the poor relation.  Unfortunately, this contains a degree of truth.  The Luas and DART are labelled as good services, but I accept that there is a bit of an attitude.  Despite how much CIE and Dublin Bus have done over the years, they have not been able to change how people think.  While it is sometimes the case that the bus companies and staff need to realise that they must be nice to their customers, that the customer is king and that the customer is god, the real issue is the question of service reliability.  Had we real-time information to let people know when buses are due and were four or five buses not to arrive together, people might feel better about it.</P>
        <P>While the ongoing subvention problems and Dublin Bus&rsquo;s management of its funds are issues, the report concerns existing resources, how to improve the service, how to sharpen up on some routes, whether they reflect people&rsquo;s movements, whether life and age profiles in certain suburbs have changed, for example, whether there are more pensioners in the area, and whether the same number of buses are required at 7.45 a.m. as were needed 20 years ago.  During the morning, commuters will walk five or seven minutes to a service if they know where it is and that it is reliable.  An older clientele does not need a bus every five minutes, but the elderly want to be sure that the 11 a.m. bus will arrive on time.  They also want it closer to their homes.  Different age groups, time periods and parts of the city have different requirements.  Some bus routes are more or less the way they were 20 years ago.  They have not adjusted to the fact that aspects of life have moved on.</P>
        <P>Several Senators referred to real-time information and integrated ticketing.  Senator Burke referred to the need for a single large bus station, but I am unsure.  It was discussed a number of years ago, but I do not know whether we want to revert to it, including the plans for Bachelor&rsquo;s Walk and so on.  Since so many routes enter Dublin city, the Senator&rsquo;s suggestion is not the plan at this stage.  It was planned for Temple Bar, but life has moved on.</P>
        <P>I note Senator Corrigan&rsquo;s comments on switching vehicles, in which there is some truth irrespective of whether a study has been done that backs them up.  The theory is that someone who gets on a bus in Finglas west and who is dropped off in the village will switch to another bus and, hey presto, head off.  It is a question of reliability, as such a switch would not be a big deal if the bus arrived in Stillorgan or Finglas on time.  People are worried they will spend <Col N="90"/>seven minutes in the rain at a bus stop and then spend another ten or 15 minutes in the village.  Were the service reliable, jumping from bus to bus would not be a big deal, but people do not want to be left standing for 15 minutes or sitting in a bus on Parnell Square or wherever while a driver goes for dinner or tea.</P>

	<P>Everything links to people&rsquo;s belief that any switching means a delay or problem.  Were the service good and reliable, people would get past that belief.</P>
        <P>This is a report from a consultant that is trying to say what is probably obvious and to have the workers and company sit down together.  Implementation plans are being drawn up.  The Department is not a bus operator and, at policy level, cannot tell the workers or Dublin Bus what to do and where and which buses should stop.  However, we are asking them to examine what they are doing in an attempt to be more efficient and to make routes and times more relevant.  It is for management, unions and workers to work in this regard.  We look forward to receiving the plans to determine to what extent the report, which contains a number of good ideas, can be implemented.  I thank Senators for their contributions.</P>

        <P>The concept of intellectual property covers a wide range of creations of the human mind from the inventions, symbols and designs used in industry to literary and artistic works such as novels, paintings and films.  Over the centuries, various societies came to recognise that it was in the public interest to recognise these as being the property of the people who created them and, consequently, the wider modern concept of intellectual property rights became more widely used.  Today, intellectual property rights consist of concrete protections such as patents on inventions, trademarks and industrial designs, as well as copyright on artistic works such as books, films, music and paintings.</P>
        <P>IP is of growing importance in the global economy.  In practice, it means that through innovation, good quality design, effective branding and top quality production, one can sell products at a premium price without having to compete purely on the basis of price alone.  However, our intellectual property must be protected to ensure we can convert the fruits of our research into saleable products, processes and services and secure comparative advantage, thereby moving up the value chain.  Ireland&rsquo;s future prosperity depends on being able to so do.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JimmyDevinsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Devins</NameTxt>
	<P>National policy strategies and reviews in recent years have placed an increasing stress on the creation and protection of intellectual property.  For example, last December&rsquo;s framework document, Building Ireland&rsquo;s Smart Economy: A Framework for Sustainable Economic Renewal, points to intellectual property protection as being a top priority <Col N="91"/>and points out that creative industries cannot survive in the marketplace without adequate protection from copyright infringement.</P>
        <P>As our aim nationally must be to build and maintain a world class knowledge-based economy and society, then equally we must have effective means of ensuring the creation, protection, commercialisation and profitable use of intellectual property.  There are several closely linked but distinct elements in our approach to IP, including strategies to promote its creation, protection and commercialisation.  The Government is active in each of those elements.  In the case of the protection of IP, it exercises its responsibilities through providing a suitable and responsive legislative and regulatory framework.  It promotes the production and development of creative industries and innovation through giving exclusive rights to exploit intellectual property, while also making provisions that act as a considerable deterrent to would-be imitators and infringers.  Directly related to this protection of IP through the legal system is the matter of the enforcement of that protection, to which I hope to return later.</P>
        <P>The extent of IP legal protection has to be balanced by the Government with other considerations.  The extent of the effective monopoly given in law has to be weighed against the wider economic good and the need to promote innovation.  Sometimes, in seeking longer or higher levels of protection, rights owners can seem to forget that this wider public interest must be considered.  Moreover, that a piece of IP exists and has been protected by, for instance, a patent or a copyright unfortunately does not always lead to its commercialisation.  Again, for example, it is important that the levels of protection provided can sustain general public support and respect for rights holders&rsquo; creations.  This can have an important bearing on attitudes and behaviour in the fight against piracy and counterfeiting.</P>
        <P>Intellectual property theft now is big business.  Counterfeiting and piracy are pressing problems in IP protection and enforcement.  Those who take the right steps to protect their creations are in a stronger position but those who do not are wide open to counterfeiting and piracy.  It already is a big problem.  The OECD estimated that in 2007 global trade in fake goods was worth around $200 billion and that does not include goods produced and consumed within countries.  The real figure, therefore, is far higher.  Counterfeiting and piracy also are rapidly growing problems.  While customs services across the European Union seized approximately 75 million fake articles in 2005, that almost doubled to 128 million items by 2007.  Some countries have bigger problems with counterfeiting and piracy than others but these problems now feature everywhere.  The aforementioned OECD report includes customs data showing that infringing products had been intercepted from nearly 150 countries, including no fewer than 27 of the OECD&rsquo;s 30 member countries.  Apart altogether from the scale of this problem, it is important to note that some counterfeiting, such as that of airline industry spare parts or fake or dangerous medicines, poses a direct and deadly threat to human life.</P>
        <P>The essence of IP protection is a strong focus on having and managing an effective legislative and regulatory system.  My Department has been making a sustained effort in recent years to ensure our patent, trademark, industrial design and copyright laws, among other IP areas, are kept as up to date as possible.  Most of this ongoing effort arises, however, from our EU and other international obligations rather than from the purely national context.  Over recent decades the increasingly international nature of IP protection rules has grown.  This has facilitated and reflected the increasing levels of international trade, both traditional and Internet-based.  The development of Internet-based businesses over recent years has underlined further, even for the biggest of countries, the global as against the national nature of markets and IP protection.  It would now be more difficult than ever for countries or their economies to take part in the global economy without signing up to and enforcing a range of globally agreed rules.</P><Col N="92"/>
        <P>The World Intellectual Property Organisation, WIPO, which is the UN body charged with the development of global IP rules, and the World Trade Organisation, WTO, through its trade related aspects of intellectual property rights, TRIPS, agreement, are the two main rule-making bodies at global level in IP protection.  In Europe, the European Patent Office, EPO, plays a crucial role in the patents field and in the EU proper, the Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market (Trade Marks and Designs), OHIM, promotes and manages the Community trade-marks and designs systems.</P>
        <P>While WIPO, the EPO and OHIM variously implement operational patent, trade-mark and design protection services, they also variously generate conventions, treaties or other rules that require national, legal or regulatory changes which shape much of our domestic IP protection arrangements.  However, the most important single source of rule making, here as in other fields, is now the European Union.  It has established a legal competence to act <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> the member states in most areas of IP protection law, including copyright, trademarks and designs.  In patents, it also has come to play an increased role in member state regulation over the past decade or so.  Many of the provisions included in Irish primary legislation and many of the supporting statutory instruments made in this field over the period are in transposition into Irish law of EU directives in intellectual property.</P>
        <P>The Commission&rsquo;s work over the years in harmonising and co-ordinating national approaches in the intellectual property field has had a powerful effect in creating and securing benefits for all member states in the Internal Market.  Much has been done to harmonise the intellectual property environment across the European Union in the collective interest of member states, rights-holders and of business.  New issues and proposals continue to surface.  Several significant Commission proposals in this field of policy are under active negotiation at Council and in the European Parliament.</P>
        <P>In regard to patents, reduced legal, translation and other costs are in prospect through proposals for the creation of a Community patent, COMPAT.  There are also proposals to create a European patent litigation jurisdiction.  The aim of these proposals is to deliver a simple, cost-effective and high-quality patent system for Europe.  In the trademarks field, there is a proposal to provide a major fee reduction for trademark applicants at the Office of Harmonisation for the Internal Market, OHIM, which is the European Union&rsquo;s trademark agency.</P>
        <P>In the field of copyright, there are proposals in discussion at Council working party level to amend Directive 2006/116/EC on the term of protection of copyright and related rights for performers and record companies.  The central element of these opening proposals would be to extend the length of copyright protection for performers and producers from 50 to 95 years.</P>
        <P>There are differing views and trends at global level regarding the correct approach to, and levels of, intellectual property protection.  Within the European Union there is normally a limited range of views on how best to approach and address such issues, including, for example, how to consider proposals to deal in a co-ordinated way with issues such as counterfeiting and piracy.  Opinions and approaches are more diverse, however, at the global level in such bodies as the World Trade Organisation&rsquo;s body on trade-related aspects of intellectual property rights, WTO-TRIPS, and the World Intellectual Property Organisation, WIPO.  Some developing countries are still not in full compliance with their obligations to provide minimum standards of intellectual property protection in national laws under the TRIPS agreement of 1995.  At the WIPO, many developing countries regularly oppose the negotiation of new conventions and treaties which would effectively raise the bar of the 1995 TRIPS standards to a new TRIPS plus level.  In other United Nations bodies such as the World Health Organisation, WHO, and the Convention on Biological Diversity, CBD, there are also development-related issues arising <Col N="93"/>from the links between patents, serious diseases and the ownership of biologically-based medicines.</P>
        <P>On the other hand, the proposed anti-counterfeiting trade agreement, ACTA, put forward by Japan and the United States in 2006, is now at an advanced stage of negotiation between a group of developed countries including the European Union.  It aims to agree an obligation to meet a stronger set of enforcement measures to reduce counterfeiting and piracy in trade between countries by filling gaps in existing multilateral agreements such as the WTO-TRIPS agreement and WIPO treaties, by improving international co-operation, especially at customs borders, and in providing a strong new legal framework for intellectual property protection.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Nationally, there are also differences of view in evidence when my Department puts particular proposals out to consultation.  The detailed views provided by parties vary from one proposal to the next but, in broad terms, rights-holders such as authors and the film and music industries seek to maximise the number of situations in which royalties or licences are needed, the duration of such intellectual property protection and the amounts to be paid while, on the other hand, groups such as consumers and broadcasters seek to minimise the scope for such charges, the periods of protection and the levels of payments to rights-holders.</P>
        <P>Patents, trademarks, design rights and copyright are the four main forms of intellectual property protection worldwide.  In Ireland, together with various more recent amendments and a large corpus of statutory instruments, the primary legal instruments in the intellectual property protection field are the Patents Act 1992, the Trade Marks Act 1996, the Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000 and the Industrial Designs Act 2001.  These provide broad, flexible and practical civil remedies for the owners of intellectual property as well as credible and proportionate criminal sanctions.  Provisions on search and seizure, delivery up and disposal of infringing goods, and enhanced civil damages add up to a varied and effective toolkit against pirates.  These exist to aid legitimate businesses and rights-holders in tackling piracy in the most immediate and effective manner through civil proceedings.</P>
        <P>The main aim of the Trade Marks Act 1996 was to give effect to the European Union trademarks directive and to establish a more comprehensive set of protections for trademark owners.  It provided for the Community trademarks system that operates in parallel with national systems and offers trademark owners the opportunity to register their mark throughout the Union via a single registration.</P>
        <P>As well as being a party to the European Community system of trademark and design registration, we are also a party to the international system of trademark registration under the Madrid system administered by the WIPO.  A further aim of the Act, therefore, was to enable ratification of the protocol to the Madrid Agreement concerning the international registration of marks and also to implement certain provisions of the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property.  The Act also facilitated the registration of trademarks in respect of services.</P>
        <P>The Act introduced important new measures to deal with the growing problems of the fraudulent use of trademarks and counterfeiting.  It provided trademark proprietors with wider rights against acts of infringement and gave strong protection to registered trademarks by broadening the scope of offences to include use of a mark which is identical to, or nearly resembles, a registered trademark.</P>
        <P>The Industrial Designs Act 2001 had four main purposes.  It modernised Irish industrial design law, broadened the civil and criminal remedies available in respect of infringements of design rights, implemented the EU directive on the legal protection of designs and enabled future access for Irish designers and business to an international system of design protection under the Geneva Act of the Hague Agreement.</P><Col N="94"/>
        <P>The remedies contained in the legislation are very effective both as deterrents to infringement and as recompense for such unlawful acts.  The Act extended the protection afforded to designs to 25 years and extended the protection of copyright to registered designs for the first time in Irish law.  The Act gave rights-owners greater capability to enforce their rights, through reference to the Controller of Patents, Designs and Trade Marks or through the courts, and provided a more efficient and speedier system of registration of designs.  It also made user-friendly provision for invalidation and rectification procedures where persons, who are not entitled to design rights, poach those rights from rightful owners.</P>
        <P>The main body of current Irish patents law is contained in the Patents Act 1992.  This sets out the detailed procedures for the operation of our patents system as well as providing for national ratification of the European Patent Convention, EPC, and the WIPO Patent Co-operation Treaty, PCT.  The Patents (Amendment) Act 2006 updated its provisions to reflect various later obligations under international agreements that had arisen since the 1992 Act.  These included ensuring compliance with the TRIPS agreement of 1995, the revision of the EPC, and the WIPO Patent Law Treaty.</P>
        <P>The Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000 provides the main legislative provisions governing the protection of copyright in this State.  The Act is a comprehensive item of legislation which provided &mdash; in some cases, for the first time in Irish law &mdash; for moral rights, performers&rsquo; rights, rights in performances, a database right for non-original databases and for rights and remedies against those who unlawfully circumvent technological protection measures designed to protect copyright materials.  The Act&rsquo;s 376 sections provide a coherent legislative regime that conforms to the best standard of international practice in this area.  It has regularly been acknowledged as a good legislative model.  Last year, for example, the Business Software Alliance, in its annual study on international piracy losses, acknowledged that, through the Act, Ireland had one of the most stringent copyright laws in Europe.</P>
        <P>I said I would come back to the issue of the enforcement of the protections provided by our IP protection legislation.  Each of the items of primary legislation across the main areas of IP specifies civil sanctions for breach of the rights-holders&rsquo; rights to be exercised by them.  The measures also contain criminal sanctions by way of fines or imprisonment, or both, for more serious infringements.</P>
        <P>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Customs and Excise authorities play active roles in ensuring effective enforcement of the legislation.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na policing plan in the IP protection field has focused on high value white-collar crime, particularly trading in contraband goods.  It has adopted a proactive approach in tackling IP enforcement issues, with the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation targeting the main players.</P>
        <P>Regarding DVD piracy, its activity has been maintained at a high level, with searches being carried out countrywide by the anti-racketeering unit with assistance from Infact and IRMA.  Significant quantities of counterfeit DVDs, CDs, DVD burners, copiers and scanners have been seized in recent years.  The Customs and Excise enforcement action in tackling counterfeit or pirated goods has concentrated mainly on the points of importation into the State.  It has seized growing quantities of products.</P>
        <P>We are fortunate to have a well developed IP protection system in this country that has been crucial to ensuring free trade for our goods and services on foreign markets.  This body of law is set to become even more important in support of our future knowledge-based society.  While there are competing pressures and interests in this field at international and national level, I hope to reassure the Seanad that thus far we have provided for effective decisions through <Col N="95"/>dialogue.  While there are many international players in IP regulation, for Ireland, the EU role has been particularly important.</P>
        <P Just="Left">While the debate today should focus primarily on the legal and regulatory regime, it is also appropriate that the Seanad notes the effective enforcement support for those laws provided by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Customs and Excise Service in co-operation with the relevant industries and rights-holders.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Devins, and I welcome this opportunity to have this discussion on intellectual property rights.  I did not realise that the Commissioner for Internal Markets and Services, Mr. McCreevy, is responsible for this whole area.  The Minister of State praised the Copyright and Related Rights Act.  Nevertheless, there is a body of opinion that there should be greater protection for intellectual property rights in Ireland.  There has been much litigation on intellectual property in other jurisdictions, such as Australia and the United States, in recent years.  The Feist Publications Inc <i>v</i> Rural Telephone Service case changed the interpretation of intellectual property in the US and there was a knock-on case in Canada, which led to a reinterpretation of Canadian law on intellectual property.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister of State referred to intellectual property as dealing with creations of the mind, inventions, literary and artistic work, symbols, names, images and designs used in commerce.  This area is dealt with by the WTO under the trade related aspects of intellectual property, TRIPS, to which the Minister of State referred.  Intellectual property is divided into two categories, industrial property, which includes inventions, patents, trademarks, industrial designs etc. and copyright, which includes literary and artistic works such as novels and plays, films, musical works and other artistic works.  Intellectual property plays an important role in an increasingly broad range of areas, ranging from the Internet to health care to all aspects of science, technology and literature and the arts.  Understanding the role of intellectual property in these areas, many of which are still emerging, requires significant new research and study.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Strong protection of intellectual property rights allows companies that create something original to benefit from the creation through the granting of a patent.  This allows the company the sole use of the creation for a set time, which is generally 20 years.  A patent prevents others from using the invention until the patent has expired.  Patented protection means that the invention cannot be commercially made, used, distributed or sold without the patent owner&rsquo;s consent.  These patents&rsquo; rights are in force in a court which, in most systems, holds the authority to stop patent infringement.  Conversely, a court can also declare a patent invalid upon a successful challenge by a third party.  Strong protection serves as an incentive for creating new works.  The creation is protected under law and the creator can benefit financially from his creation.  On the other hand, weaker protection allows more companies to benefit from a creation.  This can be achieved through a reduction in the length of time of a patent or a change in the way a patent is granted, such as only allowing patents for certain types of inventions.  If protection is too weak there is less incentive to devote time and resources to research.  If a company cannot recover the initial investment it would be less likely to undertake costly research.</P>
        <P>One of the more controversial areas covered by intellectual property is HIV and retroviral drugs in Africa.  Many poorer countries cannot afford to pay the high costs of these patented drugs and want to be able to make generic copies.  Drug companies claim that this is infringing their rights and typically they looked to the WTO to enforce their intellectual property rights.  The subject is particularly contentious and has not been addressed but it will come to the fore.</P>
        <P>Another contentious area is file-sharing on the Internet, particularly down-loading music.  Ireland does not have much regulation in this area and there is a need for more regulation of <Col N="96"/>the Internet and greater protection of copyright, particularly in respect of websites.  In respect of reforming the Copyright and Related Rights Act, we should examine a minimum level of creativity.  This stems from the Canadian case to which I referred, where Canadian law has changed to require a minimum level of creativity in order for an item to be protected under intellectual property protection.  There is a case for similar legislation to be introduced in Ireland.  There is a need to reform the Act in respect of further strengthening the protection of copyright.  The Minister of State said that, in European terms, Ireland is seen as having particularly strong copyright protection.  Some think we should have stronger protection.</P>
        <P>Arising from a recent foreign case, there is a need to introduce the defence of parody so that an item cannot be declared original and therefore is not protected under intellectual property rights if it is a parody of something that has existed before.  Therefore it is not infringing the copyright of the original item.  There must be greater protection of educational facilities and libraries with regard to copyright protection.  It is fair to argue that the patent registration process must be simplified and made less costly.</P>
      
        <P>I briefly mentioned patentable drugs and I have particular and strict view on copyright protection and the protection of intellectual property rights.  There is a humanitarian element to the issue in terms of developing new drugs.  I am thinking particularly in terms of the difficulty with anti-retroviral drugs such as those used to treat HIV.  There is a humanitarian case to be made that patents in those instances would have different time limits and perhaps would be open to other drug companies to make cheaper generic forms of the same drug.</P>
        <P>There is also the patentability of computer programmes and copyright in that regard, which has been brought to my attention.  We must have some form of standardisation introduced globally in that area as such a measure does not currently exist.  There is also the regulation of trademark domain names for political and corporate entities because this is not currently sufficiently regulated either.  I previously mentioned file sharing, whether it is a person downloading music or movies from the Internet.  There is a whole new world pertaining to the Internet and how we deal with protecting people&rsquo;s intellectual property rights in that regard.</P>
        <P>I recently did some research on the subject and there was a recent debate within the European Parliament, with it rejecting a European Union directive in the area of intellectual property rights in 2005.  The Minister of State referred to a subsequent directive from 2006.  Perhaps I am just confused but would the Minister of State shed some light on that subject?</P>
        <P>It is fair to state that Ireland has pretty good copyright protection.  Under the areas of health care provision, such as the drugs I mentioned earlier, and Internet file sharing, a significant body of work is required.  It is nine years since we enacted the legislation and with technology in particular, everything changes so quickly that there is a danger our protections will become outdated very quickly.  The Minister of State in his concluding remarks may be able to shed some light on that subject to indicate the Government&rsquo;s thinking on Internet protocol rights into the future.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State.  The appointment of Dr. Jimmy Devins, our Deputy for Sligo-Leitrim, to his current portfolio, which relates to intellectual property in particular, is probably one of the more important in Cabinet currently.  It could be the most important Minister of State appointment by the Taoiseach in the Thirtieth D&aacute;il.

	<P>It was a very wise choice by the Taoiseach.  As somebody who was chairman of the Oireachtas committee dealing with enterprise, trade and small business for four and a half years as a D&aacute;il Deputy, I look forward to working with the Minister of State in this area and helping him and his officials.  I had the privilege and honour of accompanying the Minister of the day and the Taoiseach on many promotional trips and efforts to see what the future would hold for Ireland in general.</P>
        <P>We are told Ireland&rsquo;s future prosperity depends on being able to adapt and we are also told that our aim nationally must be to build and maintain a world class knowledge-based economy and society.  Equally, we must have effective means of ensuring the creation, protection, commercialisation and profitable use of intellectual property.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Minister of State&rsquo;s contribution which stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">In the field of copyright, there are proposals in discussion at Council working party level to amend Directive 2006/116/EC on the term of protection of copyright and related rights for performers and record companies.  The central element of those opening proposals would be to extend the length of copyright protection for performers and producers from 50 to 95 years.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I fully support this as people are living much longer.  This has the wide support of very many of our EU colleagues.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State also indicated:</P>
        <P LI="1">The Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000 provides the main legislative provisions governing the protection of copyright in this State.  The Act is a comprehensive item of legislation which provided &mdash; in some cases, for the first time in Irish law &mdash; for moral rights, performers&rsquo; rights, rights in performances, a database right for non-original databases and for rights and remedies against those who unlawfully circumvent technological protection measures designed to protect copyright materials.  The Act&rsquo;s 376 sections provide a coherent legislative regime that conforms to the best standard of international practice in this area.  It has regularly been acknowledged as a good legislative model.</P>
        <P FLI="0">That has stood us in great stead, especially with regard to the computer industry where software and various innovations and creations have been put to such good use.</P>
        <P>In considering our young population of boys and girls and the high-end jobs that we are now aiming to provide for them, we must now excel in this area for the future.  Up to now we have had the 12.5% corporation tax rate, which has been a significant advantage in attracting multinationals.  They have had a destination where they could make a reasonable profit while employing up to 100,000 people.  The American multinationals include Intel, Hewlett Packard and other great companies in Ireland.</P>
        <P>Where will Ireland go to attract inward investment for the next 25 years for the next generation?  I suggest that we should be known in future as &ldquo;Ireland, the innovation island of Europe&rdquo;.  To have the ability to achieve that, I suggest we look at a particular model.  If we look back through the generations, the big success story in Ireland over the past 30 or 40 years has been the institutes of education, from Letterkenny to Sligo to Athlone to Carlow.  There are outreaches going from Galway to Castlebar and they have all been a shining example of how the middle and lower income earner&rsquo;s son or daughter could have a chance for third level education.  That has given us a significant advantage worldwide, and we have never had a better generation of educated people than we do currently.</P>
        <P>Where will all these young students find jobs for the future?  As we all know, jobs in the future will be in technology and we must encourage our students and future graduates in this <Col N="98"/>regard.  I strongly suggest to the Minister of State that the majority of our students must go for a higher level of mathematics and science.  I propose in this debate in Seanad &Eacute;ireann on Ash Wednesday 2009 that the Government consider increasing by 50% the points value in the leaving certificate for mathematics and science to encourage our young students to take up these subjects.  As we have been told by Science Foundation Ireland and the American Chamber of Commerce Ireland, our student levels in this regard will not be of the required numbers for the jobs that will be available when the students leave school in two or three years.</P>
        <P>With the success of the third level institutes, we can open every IDA Ireland site throughout Ireland to facilitate research and development.  Those students who take science as a subject in university must sign away their intellectual property rights in the event that they are fortunate enough to be a creator and innovator in that field.  We should follow the role model of Waterloo university, located 25 miles from the city of Toronto, in what we do here.  The three young men who devised the BlackBerry technology were the students who started the Waterloo Campus outside Toronto.  At that time there was nothing there only marshy land and the local authority gave those three young men an option to build an incubator unit there.  Many incubator units are there today, operated by world-class multinational companies.  However, the difference between that site in Toronto and any other site I visited throughout the world is that the intellectual property can become the ownership of the creator and innovator.  That means in the majority of cases the brains who are creators and innovators throughout America and Canada now go to Waterloo university to develop their new technologies  That results in that university campus having a higher percentage of success than any other such place I have visited on my travels.</P>
        <P>Our institutes should work with IDA Ireland, which has 82 sites throughout the country.  There is a 68-acre state-of-the-art IDA Ireland site in Mullingar.  All the services, including broadband and gas, are connected and there are two bus stops near the site, but there is not 1 sq. ft. of building because no project is being set up on the site.  The third level institute in Athlone is a state-of-the-art complex with 6,500 students.  It is a fabulous campus.  In Tullamore, like Mullingar, there are IDA Ireland sites, but there is no third level institute.  An outreach arm, so to speak, has been extended to what is known as a gateway destination, that of Athlone, Tullamore and Mullingar, the ATM, as it is known in the midlands.</P>
        <P>IDA Ireland has 82 sites throughout Ireland but no one is interested in investing in them.  They could all operate as outreach sites and work hand in hand with the institutes of technology.  Ireland could be the innovation centre of Europe if we introduced a regulation to provide that intellectual property will be the owner of the creator and innovator.  By doing that we would ensure that Ireland would be the magnet to attract young creators and innovators throughout Europe to work here.  It could employ hundreds of thousands of young people who would be the creators and innovators in the future.  This is one idea I have observed on my travels during the past four and a half years that Ireland could put to good use.  Perhaps the Minister of State and his staff will research the opportunity that exists for this to take place.</P>
        <P>I stress the importance of giving 50% more points immediately for mathematics and science in the leaving certificate.  That would send a message to our students that if they take up those two subjects they could play a pivotal role and be centre stage in Ireland&rsquo;s success into the future.</P>
        <P>The IDA Ireland sites are available and could be taken over with the stroke of a pen and it would be wonderful if they were used in the way I outlined.  I understand from the Waterloo Campus that a by-law is in place stipulating that the campus success is dependent on the creator or innovator giving a licence to the campus for ten years, 15 years or 20 years, for a 15%, 20% or 30% share of the royalty for the facilities.  In that way the campus can grow and develop <Col N="99"/>further activities and progress and retain the concept of the genius of the creator and innovator which is central to the future of job creation.  We need only reflect on the success of the BlackBerry technology, which has transformed the working lives of every person who has been fortunate enough to purchase one.  Governments throughout the western world use this technology as the centre stage of their art of communication.</P>
        <P>This is one idea I want to bring to the Minister of State&rsquo;s attention.  It is something I feel strongly about and not enough is being done about it.  Science Foundation Ireland, Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and former Ministers for Enterprise, Trade and Employment know exactly what is the successful format in this regard.  This idea would complement the huge success of the institutes of technology throughout the country.  We owe a vote of thanks to the teaching staff, the boards of management and all those administrators who have handled our institutes since they were first set up.  The institutes have transformed rural Ireland.  They have transformed the lives of the sons and daughters of middle income to lower income earners, who previously would not have had a chance to go to university.  I say that as one who has hard experience in this area.  Poor men&rsquo;s daughters and sons born in Ireland are the brainiest people anywhere in the world and they did not get a chance until now.  I pay tribute to the vision of the Governments that put these institutes in place.  They have served our country way beyond our wildest dreams.</P>
        <P>Now we must move to the next step.  We must put in place the necessary regulations and policies and provide the necessary tools to encourage young creators and innovators throughout Europe to work here.  Ireland would be an attractive destination for such activity.  Such an initiative, coupled with the 12.5% corporation tax rate, which is still in place and will be for the long term, would give us a huge advantage.  The smaller the country, the easier it is to implement such an initiative.  Conversely, the larger the country, the more difficult it is to do so because universities, in the main, will not want this departure.  Such activity is the lifeblood of income for them also.</P>
        <P>The IDA Ireland sites could be available with the stroke of a pen to facilitate such activity and it could happen quickly.  It could be responsible for a great number of young people getting employment into the future.  We are advised that research and development is important for the future.  It is the driving force that is needed to gel the pieces together.  We can do that, North and South.  This could be a Thirty-two County initiative.  It would be wonderful for our friends in the Six Counties and the other part of Ulster to be involved in it.  My parish in Castlepollard bounds the Ulster border.  Would it not be wonderful and uplifting to have this as a Thirty-two County initiative?  What a wonderful opportunity it would be to demonstrate our friendship and for the North-South bodies, one of which I am privileged to be a member, as well as being a member of the Good Friday Agreement committee.  If we were to introduce this initiative, the island of Ireland, with Thirty-two Counties, would be the innovation island of Europe.</P>
        <P>I give the Minister of State that idea today and I hope that in the very near future we can revisit the subject of intellectual property rights, ascertain what progress is being made on it and see how we can assist the Minister of State and his officials on this country&rsquo;s future, which depends to such a large extent on the Minister of State&rsquo;s portfolio.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State.  I also welcome his words.  It was interesting to listen and read what he said.</P>
        <P>In response to what Senator Cassidy said about mathematics and science, it was interesting to hear the American Chamber of Commerce Ireland speak about the need for mathematics and science graduates last week, and the figures show there are fewer mathematics and science undergraduates attending university, with an increase in the numbers pursuing arts, business <Col N="100"/>and law degrees.  We must encourage more students to study those subjects.  Senator Cassidy&rsquo;s suggestion of giving extra points for those subjects at leaving certificate is novel and well worth supporting.</P>
        <P>I like what the Minister of State said about the need to ensure we can convert the fruits of our research into saleable products.  That is the interesting part.  They are saleable and there are some great successes.  I can think of two such developments I mentioned previously &mdash; Senators Cassidy and John Paul Phelan talked about others.  One is a development from Trinity College, chaired by Dr. Patrick Cunningham who is the chief scientific adviser.  The company is called IdentiGEN and it uses DNA technology to identify the ability to trace animals right back to source at birth.  It is usually used for beef but can be used in a much wider way.  The product is now being sold in the United States.  Another idea which is being sold very successfully in the United States is from a company from Cork called Nualight which provides modern refrigeration lighting.  Both were developed from research which took place in universities and are well worth supporting.</P>
        <P>I mentioned Dr. Patrick Cunningham.  Dublin will be the European City of Science in 2012.  I know the Minister of State is fully behind that and it is something we must support and encourage because it can put us to the forefront of where we are going.</P>
        <P>Mr. Charles Handy, in 1992, said: &ldquo;Business today depends largely on intellectual property, which resides inalienably in the hearts and heads of individuals.&rdquo;  Mr. Lester Thurow, an American management professor went so far as to suggest in 1997 in an article in the <i>Harvard Business Review</i> that intellectual property rights have become more important than manufacturing products or dealing in commodities.  It is fair to say that knowledge is the key to the creation not only of business wealth but also, to a much wider extent, of national wealth.</P>
        <P>The recent trend of UK companies moving to Ireland appears to have been prompted in part by the British Government proposals raised last year to change the taxation of UK firms&rsquo; overseas earnings, in particular passive income such as intellectual property rights.  It shows, in some way, the importance many businesses are now placing on intellectual property rights.</P>
        <P>It is a major issue, particularly given the massive number of fake goods coming into Europe.  The EU reports that 80% of these fake goods were made in China.  India has also built up an industry which produces the vast majority of fake pharmaceutical products.  In 2006, seizures of such products rose by almost 400%.</P>
        <P>I am surprised at the situation in Europe.  I was in Italy last year and could not believe the range of fake products being sold.  They were being sold openly and there did not seem to be any steps being taken to control the situation.  There seem to be European Union regulations and rules which apply in some countries but not in others.  I have even heard of instances where the Chinese fakes are so convincing that electronic goods have an EU energy efficiency label and safety stickers on them.</P>
        <P>Intellectual property rights are key to our competitiveness.  Europe has repeatedly said it needs to see much better protection of intellectual property rights in emerging economies, especially in China and Russia.  This is crucial to Irish companies doing business in such countries.  We are now seeing China responding to these concerns.  It no longer wants to be branded as the world&rsquo;s number one counterfeiting country for such products.</P>
        <P>There is an interesting recent case in Ireland regarding intellectual property rights, which is the case of Irish Distillers Limited <i>v. </i>Cooley Distillery plc and is very important to the subject of intellectual property rights.  It illustrated that even where a look-alike product is clearly branded with a name that is quite different from the brand it is copying, this may not be enough <Col N="101"/>to defend an application for a temporary injunction where the overall visual impression is very similar.</P>
        <P>In the Cooley case, Irish Distillers, which produces Jameson, was granted an injunction preventing Cooley Distillery from using labels on its St Patrick brand that were judged to be so similar to Jameson labels as to lead customers to believe the St Patrick whiskey was part of the Jameson family of products.  A lawyer from Matheson Ormbsy Prentice Solicitors said:</P>
        <P LI="1">This decision highlights the risk of a court restraining the sale of a look-alike product even where the look-alike features a highly distinctive trademark element or brand name of its own, where the product appearance is similar and the method of consumer choice could lead to confusion.  From a brand owner&rsquo;s perspective, this decision may make it easier to bring successful temporary injunction applications in respect of look-alike products going forward.  For those designing look-alike products that will be sold on supermarket shelves, care must be taken that including a distinctive brand name is not the only distinguishing feature they rely on.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This case shows how businesses now have the power to stop this more subtle type of copying and intellectual property right infringement.  It also shows that businesses must be aware that there if there is a likelihood of confusion on the part of the public between two labels on a product, then a court may grant an injunction against that product.  It is a very significant progression for the area of intellectual property rights in this country and shows how importantly we take any infringement of these rights.</P>
        <P>Ireland, as part of the European Union, has a major part to play in progressing these rights, particularly in developing economies.  Therefore, I welcome what the Minister of State said today and the areas he covered, which he did very well.  I can remember when legislation on this issue passed through the House in 2000 and 2006.  The Bills took a long time to pass because we took an in-depth look at the issues.</P>
        <P>The legislation has been very successful and has placed us at the top and in a high regard for those considering investing here because it has the possibility of being able to protect their investment rather than their losing it as might otherwise have happened.  I am pleased to hear the Minister of State&rsquo;s words today.  We cannot do any more than encourage him to continue along the line he is going and strengthen the legislation, if it is possible to do so.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State, in his contribution to this wide-ranging debate, pointed out the current situation regarding legislation and intellectual property, the role which Ireland plays in terms of international organisations such the EU and the European Patent Office and its role within the World Trade Organisation.  To develop legislation in this area further we must distinguish between the commercial application of intellectual property, such as the production of a good or the development of a new process, and the creative use of intellectual property, which is in need of separate legislation, possibly through the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism.</P>
        <P>I listened intently to Senator Quinn&rsquo;s contribution, which concentrated, rightly, on the commercial application of intellectual property.  In his contribution, the Minister of State pointed out that research and development is pinpointed in the smarter economy document released before Christmas.  If we are to recover and sustain such recovery in our economy, the development through research and development of new pieces of intellectual property will be a key component of the new economy we hope for and aspire to in the future.</P>
        <P>It is important our own legislation has sufficient protections in that regard, as well as the international fora in which we are involved, in terms of protecting Irish international patents. <Col N="102"/> It has been to our detriment as a society and economy that in the past we have tended to buy in commercial expertise and the intellectual properties that go with it through our use of foreign direct investment.  We could do better and learn from, in particular, the Scandinavian example where government policies over decades and generations have been directed towards trying to encourage people in those countries to develop a mindset whereby new intellectual property and goods and services are produced as a result.</P>
        <P>Much has already been said in this debate about the economic importance of intellectual property.  I would like to mention the creative side of things, which I accept may be outside the Minister of State&rsquo;s brief but which needs to be looked at in the context of new legislation.  There is an ongoing debate about creative intellectual property and the production of songs, poetry and paintings, who actually owns them and secondary rights in terms of royalties.  As I said earlier, there needs to be separate legislation on this issue which is not necessarily the remit of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  Nevertheless, this is an issue in which, as a country, we have expertise.</P>
        <P>People have skills and are plying their trades and earning foreign income from the country.  The band U2 is an obvious example, notwithstanding the fact that many of its members choose to pay their taxes in the Netherlands.  There was a time in the 1970s when the pop group Abba was a larger foreign earner for Sweden than the car companies Saab and Volvo combined.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>That might happen again.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>If we are talking about intellectual property, especially in the creative area, the legislation needs to be very strong in this regard.</P>
        <P>There have been moves in the European Union to lengthen the copyright period beyond the lifetime of the producer of the creative work.  This is unfortunate.  The time behind a lifespan should be quite narrow, perhaps 20 years or so, because it tends to benefit people who have not been involved in the creation of the work.  I hope our legislation will bear that in mind.</P>
        <P>There could be an argument that our taxation system takes that somewhat into account with the artist exemption scheme.  However, we are reaching a stage where this scheme, as open-minded as it was at that time, needs to be looked at.  People involved in the creative arts need to be more secure in terms of their source of income rather than how, or if, they will be taxed because the reality is that many people in the arts do not earn sufficient income to be taxed.  I would like attention to be devoted to this particular area.</P>
        <P>I refer to the production of goods and services and copyright in regard to medicines and pharmaceuticals.  This country benefits from a very vibrant pharmaceutical industry.  Some 13 of the 15 top industries are based in Ireland.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDevinsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Devins</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">It is eight out of ten.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>That is even better.  Copyright in the production of new medicines does not have a very positive worldwide use.  We need only look at the incidence of AIDS on the continent of Africa and at how the existence of copyright and the insistence of many companies to earn full profit from such copyright has led many thousands, if not millions, of people to needless deaths.</P>
        <P>Whether through our own legislation or, more importantly, in whatever regulations in which we are involved in establishing, I would like to see the development of criteria whereby copyright for medicines can be relaxed in incidences of epidemics and pandemics.  The fact that does not exist at present means the balance is very much on the side of the copyright holder <Col N="103"/>which tends to be the pharmaceutical multinational.  That is very much to the disadvantage of the people suffering the illness.  If we could contribute to this debate through our own experience and if we could develop a base for the pharmaceutical industry, our views would be listened to more than most.</P>
        <P>This is a useful debate which I hope will inform the development of new legislation.  I look forward to the Minister of State and the Department presenting such legislation.  I refer again to the idea of having separate legislation, possibly from the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism, to look at the area of creative intellectual property.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Paddy Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State.  As Senator Cassidy and other Senators said, this is a very important subject.  When one asks people about intellectual property rights, they will ask what it is.  Few people know what intellectual property rights is about.  However, the Minister of State set it out very well.  He said:</P>
        <P LI="1">The concept of intellectual property covers a wide range of creations of the human mind from the inventions, symbols and designs used in industry to literary and artistic works such as novels, paintings and films.  Over the centuries, various societies came to recognise that it was in the public interest to recognise these as being the property of the people who created them and, consequently, the wider modern concept of intellectual property rights became more widely used. Today, intellectual property rights consist of concrete protections such as patents on inventions, trademarks and industrial designs, as well as copyright on artistic works such as books, films, music and paintings.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Senator Quinn spoke about fakes and so on.  It is only right that we strengthen intellectual property rights and I congratulate the Minister of State in this regard.  Senator Cassidy asked an important question about where we go from here.  Over the past ten years, various sections of our workforce have diminished, including our cottage industry, manufacturing industry and, to a degree, our tourism industry, although that could be rectified.  We have lost heavily in regard to our manufacturing and cottage industries because our cost base has become too high.</P>
        <P>We now talk about high-level jobs and about more funding going to research and development.  I agree with Senators who said we need to invest heavily in research and development, in particular in science and mathematics.  There are great opportunities here.  Senator Cassidy mentioned the IDA, universities and regional technical colleges.  This country is well covered with third level facilities ranging from universities to regional technical colleges and we must invest heavily in them.</P>
        <P>When one thinks of what can be done from wave and wind energy, there is a great opening here for innovation.  The Government must create jobs in this area.  There is a great opening to create new models which we could test.  We have access to the ocean, hills and wind.  There must be opportunities.</P>
        <P>I compliment the Minister of State.  We need to invest heavily in research and development because we have lost many of our manufacturing and cottage industries.  Our tourism industry can be rectified.  I wish the Minister of State well.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn"><NameTxt>Senator Camillus Glynn</NameTxt>
	<P>One of the things which will ruin what we have come to regard as intellectual property is piracy which has been brought to my notice on a number of occasions.  I have had an interest in the music business for quite some time.  The products of struggling artists, especially in the area of traditional music, are being pirated.</P>
        <P>On a recent visit to Scotland, I spoke to Jimmy Shand junior.  I have a great interest in the music his father played.  He was very famous and a great favourite in Ireland, especially among accordion players.  Much of the music of Jimmy Shand senior has been pirated.  On that visit, I <Col N="104"/>produced a CD but Jimmy junior was not aware that this CD was on the market.  It had certainly not come from the publisher who dealt with his father&rsquo;s music or, indeed, his music.  That is an example of what is going on.</P>
        <P>The same is the case with videos and DVDs.  Even films currently showing are pirated.  A person goes into a cinema with a camera, records the film, downloads it onto a DVD and sells it.  People who buy that type of material are encouraging people of that ilk to carry on with that practice, which should be done away with. People who pirate copyrighted property should suffer the full rigours of the law because they are destroying the livelihood of honest artists.  Everything possible must be done to eliminate this practice from our important entertainment industry.  The late Joe Dolan was from Mullingar and no matter what part of the world one was in, if one mentioned Mullingar, people knew it was his town.  He made the town famous and was responsible for many people visiting it and the surrounding lakes.  He put the town on the tourism map.  However, even his music, and that of people like him, has been pirated.  Everything that can be done to eliminate pirating must be done and severe penalties must be imposed on those involved in it.</P>
        <P>The same goes for copying paintings, whether copies of rustic scenes or portraits.  Some art fakes have found themselves up for sale when properties are sold and others have appeared in art sales.  This must be eliminated.  I wish the Minister of State well in his endeavour to stamp out the theft of intellectual property because such theft damages the arts and the work of individuals.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Senator Ivor Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Jimmy Devins, and congratulate him on his words of wisdom.</P>
        <P>This debate about the protection of intellectual property is happening at a time of exceptional global economic and financial turbulence and for that reason it is essential we explore areas of opportunity.  The area of intellectual property protection is of immense importance and growth.</P>
        <P>The Government is rightly in the business of promoting and protecting innovation, research and development and of offering protection on patents, inventions, trade marks, industrial design rights and for copyright on artistic work.  We have witnessed a new industrial revolution in this area over the past decade or more, one that is likely to continue in the foreseeable future, albeit there are world economic difficulties.  This area will not be affected to the same extent as other areas.  I fully support the concept of intellectual property rights.  I envisage Ireland will continue to experience innovation and development, with new markets being created and endless scope to share in further development.</P>
        <P>Ireland may have been found wanting with regard to the various industrial revolutions of the past.  We were just a small island nation in the 1930s and 1940s compared to America, Germany and other developing wealthier nations.  However, Ireland is totally different today.  In the recent past we have built up a knowledge base, a highly skilled workforce and resources necessary for progress and development.  We compete easily with other countries on the world stage.  For example, from 1995 to 2005 we competed with and compared favourably with other countries.  It was often said we boxed above our capacity and we often won out in competition with other leading destinations for foreign direct investment and developments.</P>
        <P>We can compete too in the area of intellectual property.  The essential element for developers in this area is the required protection.  This is a complicated area and no one person, perhaps, has a clear handle on the state of play.  I am not sure any acid test has been carried out with regard to what legislation is applicable.  Is it the law of the country where innovation has taken place or does it relate to where there are other European applications?  The complications are significant.</P><Col N="105"/>
        <P>I know the Minister of State shares an interest with me in the area of pharmaceuticals where there has been a level of ambiguity with regard to the protection applicable.  Perhaps the Minister of State has information in this regard, but we do not know what test cases have been taken in this area nor what the outcome of those cases has been.  One thing I do know is that the regulation of such areas has come under scrutiny and been found wanting in the past.  It is easy in hindsight to say we should have provided such and such a power or put such and such a regulation in place.</P>
        <P>While I like to consider myself relatively young, I have some experience under my belt.  I have found that no matter what provisions are in place, it is only when we come to the acid test we realise there is scope for improvement.  It is only looking back after experience that one realises one should have made certain other provisions.</P>
        <P>I have read some of the documents from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and am aware of the good work being done by the T&aacute;naiste and Minister, Deputy Mary Coughlan, and her Ministers of State, Deputies Devins and McGuinness, in this area and congratulate them on the launch of the document on innovation last year.  I commend them too on their targeting of companies that will bring innovation enterprise and research and development here.</P>
        <P>The development of the smart economy ties into this in so far as it identifies the measures that will help promote economic stabilisation and the restructuring of the economy over the coming years and the framework to set them out.  With regard to our economy and industrial development it is fair to state that we are at a point in our national history where we have never been able to see more clearly how we should be able to achieve, compete and be somewhat as successful as we have been on the road we travelled over recent years.  We know Ireland has undergone a huge transformation and we are now a pulsating economy.</P>
        <P>As I stated at the outset, all of us expect the country to feel some of the tremors of the turbulence of the present global economic and financial difficulties.  Having stated this, equally we should acknowledge the success of our economic performance and the dividends that came out of that performance in so far as we were able to attract foreign direct investment.  We have been hugely successful.  We have trade links and markets and most importantly we have the entrepreneurial capacity to drive projects.  We have established a reputation for our ability to succeed.</P>
        <P>Having stated this, it is very important that whatever can be done within the confines and jurisdiction in which the Minister of State operates and in the globalised markets which operate it is important we have a Minister of State with responsibility for innovation such as Deputy Devins who is leading in the field of intellectual property protection.  Whatever we can do to attract this very important factor in the development of our economy over the next period is worthy of the support of this House to ensure we can continue to attract the very important area of what is often referred to as &ldquo;blue chip&rdquo; research and development facilities and industrial designs.</P>
        <P>I was Chairman of the committee which brought through the Copyright and Related Rights Act some years ago.  It was complex legislation and at the time the amount of data coming through was mind boggling and we wondered whether we would ever get through it or address the variety of issues contained in it.  We were able to do so and were successful.  We ventured into a new area which warranted address by legislators.  In the area of intellectual property, we are in uncharted waters and we can do the same and come out on top.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDevinsFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Devins</NameTxt>
	<P>Many important points and contributions were made by Senators on the protection of intellectual property.  I take this opportunity to thank all the Senators for their contributions.</P><Col N="106"/>
        <P>Several interventions reflected the view, which I share, that intellectual property is becoming more important to the country&rsquo;s future.  Already, the creating, licensing, protection, commercialisation, use and enforcement of intellectual property is very important to our economy.  The way forward for our country towards developing a knowledge society means intellectual property needs to become more important still.  The Government, business and universities and institutes of technology among others will all have to work more closely together on many aspects of intellectual protection.</P>
        <P>Although copyright is just one of several major forms of intellectual property protection, it was a particular focus for Senators&rsquo; interventions.  Increasingly, the rate of change in digital technologies and internet developments and business models has been throwing up new legal issues and redefining older ones in copyright.  That said, it is fair to state that to date we have been fortunate that our main legislation in this field, namely, the Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000, has proved to be quite resilient, as we hoped it would be at the time of enactment.</P>
        <P>I will refer briefly to some of the points raised by Senators.  Senator John Paul Phelan was correct to state that in the EU software as such cannot be patented under the European patent convention.  This contrasts with the situation in the United States where it can be registered.  The Senator was also correct to state that the European Parliament voted down a draft EU directive proposal in 2006 which was to provide patents for some copyright protection.  Commissioner McCreevy accepted this outcome and postponed a further effort on this front until later.</P>
        <P>A couple of Senators, including Senators John Paul Phelan and Boyle, raised the issue of drugs.  The TRIPS agreement has been amended to facilitate easier compulsory licensing of drugs to deal with various health emergencies.  For its part, the EU adopted a regulation to help member states in this regard.  I am pleased to state that last year we introduced regulations to facilitate Irish exporters if they were asked by overseas firms to produce and export drugs to countries where there were health emergencies involving HIV and malaria.  As I stated in my opening speech, it is true that there are tensions and unresolved issues at UN level between the WHO, WIPO and the WTO TRIPS agreement.</P>
        <P>Senator Cassidy mentioned the idea of developing Ireland as an innovation island of Europe and this is something to which we would all subscribe.  He also mentioned the institutes of technology and the very important part they can play in our educational system.  I concur entirely with him.  As a former chairman of the Institute of Technology Sligo I am a great believer in the value of the institutes.</P>
        <P>Senator Cassidy and other Senators raised the matter of the difficulties we face with regard to students taking up mathematics and science and then progressing to engineering or science at third level and I am examining this issue.  I have met many groups and certain opinions are being developed which I hope to bring shortly to the Cabinet committee on science, technology and innovation with my colleague the Minister for Education and Science.  This area is vital for the future of the country.  We must have students taking mathematics and science so we can produce scientists and engineers in the coming years.</P>
      
        <P>I endorse Senator Cassidy&rsquo;s proposal that innovators need to be able to benefit from their creations and inventions.  This is why our intellectual property legislation in trademarks, patents, designs and copyright exists.  However, there is the challenge that inventors need to be aware of the need for this and they must take more steps to encourage people to protect their inventions.  In that regard, Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and Science Foundation Ireland are working together with the universities, institutes of technology, principal investigators and their staff to protect intellectual property.  I pay tribute to Enterprise Ireland and its technology <Col N="107"/>transfer offices, which are now located in all institutes of technology and universities to help facilitate the protection of ideas developed through our outstanding principal investigators.</P>
        <P>It is important that young people are aware of intellectual property.  In that regard, I draw attention to the fact that World Intellectual Property Day will take place on 26 April this year.  The Irish Patents Office will hold an essay writing competition to encourage an interest in and awareness of invention.  I look forward to other bodies following its example.</P>
        <P>Senator Quinn raised some issues, particularly the problem associated with mathematics and science.  He is correct that there is a major problem with fake goods.  It is important to note that and it is vital that tough legislation in this regard is enforced by the Garda and the Customs and Excise, as is the case.  In no way can we be complacent.  With regard to intellectual property protection legislation and the equally important area of enforcement, our position is worth defending.</P>
        <P>Senator Boyle rightly pointed to the strategic importance of intellectual property protection.  It is true there are different views and philosophies on the balance between respecting the monopoly rights protection period and the need to promote innovation and the development of new knowledge.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Senator Glynn raised a very important issue regarding DVD and CD piracy.  In recent years, entertainment industry representatives have continued to raise the extent of DVD and CD piracy in Ireland and have highlighted its cost to the sector and the viability of legitimate retail and rental outlets, which have recently experienced trading difficulties.  In late 2007, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform set up an interdepartmental committee on this subject comprising representatives from several Departments, including mine.  The group met industry representatives and invited submissions from the public.  It held discussions concerning the issues arising and reported towards the end of last year.</P>
        <P>In its report, it made a wide range of recommendations on operational improvements and legislative changes, which are being pursued vigorously.  I have assured the industry that I intend to introduce at the earliest opportunity further provisions or refinements that are necessary and that could strengthen our copyright and casual trading legislation.  While I am glad to reiterate this assurance to the Seanad, I am also pleased our ongoing contracts with the film industry have not pointed to our legislation in this field being particularly weak.  The priority for action, as identified in the report to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, was improved co-ordination in respect of enforcement, and that has been addressed.</P>
        <P>Senator Callely stated that we have been boxing above our weight for a number of years and I agree completely.  In the area of intellectual property and in life, no one person has a monopoly of wisdom and that is particularly true in the area of intellectual property.  We must all work closely together and my Department and I are open to suggestions which Senators might make.  We work very closely with the EU authorities in this area.</P>
        <P>Senator Callely raised the issue of research and development, which is very important.  The future of our country depends on it.  This morning I was present at the launch of a programme to allocate over &euro;25 million for five strategic research clusters at various third level institutions.  It involves industry representatives, researchers and principal investigators working hand in glove to develop ideas that will, I hope, lead to the development of patented products and, ultimately, jobs.</P>
        <P>This debate has highlighted the growing importance of intellectual property protection.  Protection is just one of several policy elements in the intellectual property field, ranging from its creation to its use.  Reference was made to the central role of the law and regulation in intellec<Col N="108"/>tual property protection and the international nature of most intellectual property rule making.  There is a very important supporting role for intellectual property enforcement authorities.</P>
        <P>Many important points were made by Senators, to which I have attempted to respond.  If Senators would like to raise any particular issue, I would be more than willing to meet them.  This debate has confirmed that we have a proven and well developed protection system in place.  While that system of rules, together with its associated enforcement support, has evolved over the years to deal with new issues, as needed, I trust Members will agree we are in a good position as we look to the future.</P>

        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash82" />require the banks to acknowledge the true scale of their likely loan losses over the coming years and to reflect these losses on their accounts.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The motion is another element of the ongoing debate we are having on the economy.  It is amazing to look back at the transcripts of debates over the past six months to see how quickly everything has changed for the worst day by day.  While there is a global recession, we are not only in a financial crisis but also a political crisis.  When the financial elements of the crisis are addressed, we must bear in mind what is happening politically and in wider society.  The old battlegrounds of rich and poor, private and public sector, North and South and left and right are surfacing again in a way that is more divisive and emotionally charged and, on occasion, the debate has become more irrational and unpredictable.  Like many others, I am concerned about the political crisis emanating from the financial crisis in recent weeks.</P>
        <P>However, we are forgetting the big picture.  Ireland needs to borrow &euro;30 billion to deal with the banking crisis and the crisis in the public finances.  The gap between taxes, which is the Government&rsquo;s income, and what it must spend, will be &euro;20 billion this year.  Tax revenues have reduced by more than &euro;10 billion in one year, which represents an amazing deterioration in the public finances.  The Government has still not succeeded in getting that message through to the public, which is one of the reasons for the unrest we have witnessed on the streets involving many groups and organisations who are clearly suffering.  If the public finances are not addressed, we face an economic meltdown which could happen faster than we think.  The Government&rsquo;s response thus far is akin to a customer paying off the minimum amount on his or her credit card bill while, at the same time, continuing to spend at the same rate while his or her income drops like a stone.  In a short period of two to three years, we could lose all the gains made during the Celtic tiger era.</P>
        <P>Our future is going backwards so fast, as it were, that it is not funny anymore.  The Government parties have not addressed the crisis in the appropriate manner.  They throw around statements about the need to borrow for &euro;20 billion this year and &euro;30 billion next year while implying they will be able to get their hands on these amounts.  However, the US will not provide this money because its Administration has its own issues to deal with and the former eastern bloc countries and the Baltic states of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia have similar economic problems to us.  I attended a few European Parliament meetings recently and I had the sense the western European countries such as Sweden, Germany and Austria are more concerned about what is happening in the eastern bloc and Baltic states than about what is happening in western European states such as Ireland.  They are seriously concerned about what an economic meltdown might mean for the other countries.  They are worried not only about social unrest but, as the old fault lines of Europe reopen, such as the east-west divide, an increasing sense of nationalism and social and political unrest in the eastern bloc and Baltic states as well.  This is a major concern for the more stable western European states because this will have a significant knock-on impact within their own countries.</P><Col N="110"/>
        <P>Commentators who suggest Ireland can borrow billions of euro from the European Union think we can tap into an endless pot of gold but that is not the case.  I do not get a sense from the Minister for Finance or the Taoiseach that they have a plan to inspire confidence in international investors that we can overcome our problems.  Ireland is subject to disproportionately negative media coverage internationally regarding its economic problems in comparison with other countries.  Many European power brokers are taking their lead from English newspapers, which are painting Irish in a great light, and they are not being challenged.  There are many dirty bankers and toxic banks throughout Europe and the rest of the world, yet we are getting unbelievably bad press.</P>
        <P>I am disappointed when Ministers make simplistic remarks that Opposition Members should not talk negatively about the economy because of the impact that has on international investors when they could not give a hoot what we have to say in either House.  We are trying to wake the Government up to our concerns in order that something is done about them.  Adopting a policy similar to paying off the minimum amount on one&rsquo;s credit card bill will not work forever.  The Government was supposed to have saved &euro;2 billion this year through cutbacks but that will not happen.  There is a sense the Government is not selling the crisis to the public but, at the same time, an early budget will be announced this year, probably shortly after we resume following the summer recess.  The Government will need to increase taxes while continuing to reduce spending because the gap currently is unsustainable for a small, open economy.  I do not sense concern about this from the Taoiseach or the Minister for Finance.</P>
        <P>No matter what is said in this debate regarding Anglo Irish Bank, the Financial Regulator, friends of the major political parties and what may have gone on in other banks, these are sideshows relative to the greater issue.  However, these sideshows highlight for the people the rotten core of our political and financial sectors.  I would like a greater focus from the Government parties on how to deal with this.  They need to get rid of those who regulated the system over the past decade to restore public confidence in it.  There is no way the Financial Regulator has any credibility in investigating what went on in our banks.  No one in the Central Bank has credibility when dictating to the people what needs to be done.  The Central Bank&rsquo;s reports highlighted concerns in 2007 but its officials only squeaked and they did not make an alarming call on Ministers.  They were too close to the Government to say what had to be said loudly enough to make a difference and Government Members were more occupied with winning elections and political gain than putting the country&rsquo;s interests first.  That is why we find ourselves in our current position.</P>
        <P>That Government Members now want the Opposition to bail them out of their problems, despite having no respect for what the Opposition offers, is galling.  All we hear is that the Opposition is attacking and unwilling to work with the Government, but we worked with it on the bank guarantee a few months ago.  We have clear policy differences in that we believed that Anglo Irish Bank should have been wound down because it was not a suitable going concern.  We are being proven right in that regard, but the Government has landed itself in a mire.</P>
        <P>There are rumours that the Government wants to nationalise AIB and Bank of Ireland, but it is not making their bad debts clear to the people.  For example, AIB is one of the few Irish banks that is heavily exposed to lending in eastern Europe, in this instance to the tune of billions of euro.  In terms of debt, it is not considered to be one of our safer banks in eastern Europe.  AIB and Bank of Ireland have loaned heavily in the English property market, the substantial losses from which are in addition to the losses that they will suffer in this jurisdiction, but we have not heard what the Minister for Finance has to say about those issues.  The Govern<Col N="111"/>ment is covering them up to some degree because it does not want to spook the markets.  Given those banks&rsquo; share prices this morning, the markets could not be spooked further.</P>
        <P>It is time that we move together, be more realistic and decide on what to do about the state of the economy and how to get out of this mess.  We will not access the billions of euro that the Government hopes will arrive during the next two years.  We must make serious decisions on the economy.</P>
        <P>Public and private sector unions are discussing striking in one month&rsquo;s time unless partnership talks are re-entered.  Ministers have a role in redefining what those talks are about.  In recent years, it has been easy for both sides to be involved in those talks, but it is no longer that easy.  When the Government begins partnership talks, perhaps the public should be included and fully informed of what is occurring.  The Government must carry the people with it because they must carry the heavy burden that will face everyone in the coming years.  It should be done immediately.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the motion.  I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, who is a regular visitor to the Seanad, for this important and timely discussion.  At the start of the week, a number of Senators, including Senator Hanafin, referred to the need for a debate on regulation and part of this motion deals extensively with that matter.</P>
        <P>As Senator Twomey pointed out, Ireland is at a grave juncture economically and socially.  On the Order of Business earlier this week, a number of Senators, particularly Senator Ross, discussed the problem that we will face if we believe, as the Government persists in doing, that our European friends will somehow bail us out and that money from Germany or the International Monetary Fund will save our banking structure.  The indication is that Germany is looking eastwards and the IMF will be left stretched by its upcoming commitments during the coming months.</P>
        <P>The economic indicators are stark.  The unemployment rate is 9%, which includes an increase of 38,000 in January.  We are witnessing the opening stages of social unrest.  A protest occurred outside today and the building will be picketed tomorrow.  Those actions are part of a continuous stream of people with concerns about the direction in which the economy is going.  Tax revenue this year is projected to decline by as much as &euro;20 billion.  As Senator Twomey pointed out, the Government will need to borrow approximately &euro;30 billion.  It costs us twice as much as Germany to borrow money.  Of every &euro;3 spent by the Government domestically this year, &euro;1 will be borrowed.  On top of all those difficulties is the calamitous banking situation, which is making our credit rating worse.</P>
        <P>One would be wrong not to acknowledge the global economic downturn, but one would equally be wrong not to acknowledge the fact that we have contributed considerably to our own difficulties through Government property decisions in the past seven or eight years.  The Celtic tiger had two distinct incarnations.  Its early years saw foreign direct investment and job creation in domestic companies, but in the past seven or eight years concentration has been on construction.  We were good at building houses and selling them to one another, but such an economic basis could never have been strong.</P>
        <P>Last week it was estimated, conservatively, that &euro;10 billion left the country in light of the most recent Anglo Irish Bank revelations.  The jobs, careers, lives and future of 20,000 workers in the IFSC depend on some semblance of stability in the banking structure, but that is missing.  Part of the problem is the Government&rsquo;s failure to realise its role in undermining our banking system in recent years.  For too long, there has been a cosy cartel between the Government, regulators and the banks.</P><Col N="112"/>
        <P>The motion refers to the golden circle.  I would like to know who its members are, but the necessary information on the substantive issues surrounding the contracts for difference fiasco is in the public domain.  The regulator, the Central Bank and, in some shape or form, the Government knew.  The Taoiseach, the then Minister for Finance, knew of a difficulty surrounding contracts for difference and the Quinn Group shareholding.  Extraordinarily, the Central Bank and the regulator charged Anglo Irish Bank with solving its own problem and a number of months later they were told that the problem had been solved.</P>
        <P>A first year economics student in college knows that if a problem with so large a shareholding in a public limited company was supposed to have been solved, the share price would have fluctuated.  However, the Taoiseach has asked us to believe that he did not have a clue as to what was occurring.  He did not ask why there was no fluctuation despite the alarm bells that should have been ringing in his and the regulator&rsquo;s heads.  This question has never been answered, but perhaps the Minister of State will do so.  It makes no sense.</P>
        <P>There must be a clear-out in terms of the regulator.  I support the notion that foreign expertise on banking regulation should be introduced in the Central Bank and the office of the regulator.  The system cries out for that expertise.</P>
        <P>At times, I have been a critic of social partnership, but it will and should have an important role in determining where we go from here.  Senator Twomey was correct in that it has been very easy in recent years to be involved in social partnership, but difficult decisions must be made.  I was struck by the Taoiseach&rsquo;s comments today, namely, that baggage must be left outside the door in the renewal of social partnership.  Was he referring to his own baggage or the political baggage of successive Governments in the past ten or 12 years that has left us in this position?</P>
        <P>While I might share with other Members some of the cynicism attached to the Garda raid on Anglo Irish Bank, it was something to be welcomed.  I remember from my school days, a famous man named Ernest Saunders, of whom the Minister of State may have heard, who went to jail because of his involvement in an attempt to manipulate share prices.  There appears to be some resemblance between the case under discussion and the events in which he was involved and for which I understand he served six years in prison.</P>
        <P>I spoke to a school tour group here yesterday and it saddens me that their futures are at stake in the midst of all this.  I was fortunate enough to be born in 1978, to benefit from the abolition of third level fees and to get a third level education.  Thankfully, I have a job here for at least another few months.</P>

I remember a famous comment made by Deputy Cowen when he was Minister for either Foreign Affairs or Finance, to the effect that if we build enough houses, they will become cheap.  While I distinctly remember him making this comment, I cannot recall whether it was to me in this Chamber or elsewhere.  His policy and that of the Government in recent years, has been partially responsible, together with the global situation, for bringing this to the present juncture.  I am delighted to support this motion and the Government should take on board some of the constructive suggestions contained therein as a way to move us out of the quagmire in which we now are.</P>

        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash66" />expresses its confidence in the Government&rsquo;s measures to stabilise and revitalise the banking system.&rdquo;</P>
        <P FLI="0">I am highly conscious that in the financial markets, especially perhaps in the City of London, the word was that the only difference between Ireland and Iceland was one letter and six months.  Such commentators were wrong as the difference is eight letters, namely, &ldquo;currency&rdquo;.  As part of the euro, Ireland is part of the largest economy in the world.  Moreover, that commitment, through the euro, has been reinforced today by a member of the European Central Bank and the head of the Bundesbank in Germany, who has confirmed that it would be possible for countries such as Ireland to have a bond that would be taken out in the joint names of Germany and Ireland, were this to be necessary, thereby mitigating the additional necessary two and a half percentage points.  Ireland is highly fortunate to be part of the euro.  I am highly conscious that the Lisbon treaty is on its way again and I have one question for those who will oppose it.  Were we to vote &ldquo;No&rdquo; to Lisbon again, what interest rate do they think we would pay?</P>
        <P>It has been suggested in the House today that international markets do not watch what Opposition parties do but that is incorrect.  Whereas I might disagree with Opposition Members from Fine Gael on many matters, they did support the bank guarantee scheme, whereas the Labour Party did not and neither did they support the taking over of Anglo Irish Bank.  However, it was unhelpful that the Labour Party&rsquo;s spokesperson for finance stated that the reason the Government was bailing out Anglo Irish Bank was to assist the friends of Fianna F&aacute;il.  Such comments cannot help internationally and were incorrect.  If the four names that appeared in <i>The Sunday Times</i> are correct, I did not recognise any of them.  This is interesting from one perspective because, having been a fundraiser for Fianna F&aacute;il for a number of years, I would know.  It begs the question as to what misrepresentations are circulating in the marketplace.</P>
        <P>The Government acted highly responsibly in the bank guarantee scheme.  It was necessary at a time of unprecedented upheaval in the international markets.  Some of the figures are quite difficult to comprehend because they do not merely refer to billions but in some cases refer to hundreds and thousands of billions.  This is somewhat beyond the normal understanding of finance to hear how much, and how badly, the international markets were pirated.  As I have mentioned in the House previously, I remember the Big Bang in London and the introduction of financial deregulation.  However, I never thought it would mean no regulation.  As I have noted previously, Captains Blackbeard and Kidd, the pirates of the Caribbean, were better regulated than some of the carry-on associated with sub-prime lending, hedge funds and the amount of money that was lost.  White-collar crime is not victimless and I am conscious that any wrongdoing that took place in Ireland will come before the courts.  The Government is determined to bring those involved before the courts and from that perspective, this is to be welcomed.</P>
        <P>International regulation is required because had there not been an international crisis, Ireland would have got through this recession.  There inevitably would have been a downturn in Ireland and Members in this House debated whether there would be a soft landing or otherwise.  However, they did not anticipate that the international banking institutions would begin to collapse.  Some major banks fell and others were nationalised, both in America and the United Kingdom, some of which had branches here.  While difficulties existed in the Irish market, some of which have come to light recently, the main problems, and the vast majority of the problems, were created internationally.  However, this leaves us with the difficulty of regulation, of which we must be part.  A society and world in which a flick of a switch can transfer billions abroad or to different companies or accounts is becoming increasingly difficult <Col N="115"/>to regulate.  This is the reason an international dimension, a European dimension and a national dimension are required.  We have a strong interest in this regard to maintain strong regulation for the financial services centre, which comprises a major part of the economy.</P>
        <P>When considering such regulation, one must specifically examine the misselling of sub-prime loans.  There is a suggestion from Europe that 5% of the value of sub-prime lending would be held by the initiator, that is, the seller.  The original proposal was for 15% and the Minister should consider the retention of this suggestion because the profit margins in selling such products are so great, that in time, the capacity for greed again may take hold and in ten or 20 years we would find ourselves with unstable banks that were creating instability.</P>
        <P>What could the Government do in this climate?  After 11 years of budget surpluses, the surpluses suddenly eroded and major deficits arose.  I contend that it took the right course.  Had it taken more money out of the economy this year, it would have made the situation worse.  The Government has modulated the amount it can borrow while being committed to reducing the deficit over a number of years.  However, Members also should be cognisant that there is light at the end of the tunnel.  Oil costs $40 a barrel, the United States dollar is cheap and the price of money, at a rate of 2%, is low.  Moreover, an additional half percent cut in interest rates is expected at the ECB&rsquo;s March meeting next week.  We have low inflation but most of all, we have low expectations.  This is a real opportunity for Opposition Members to pull together with the Government to do what is necessary to bring us as quickly as possible back to where we should be.  I have mentioned that the bailout figures are quite astounding.  More than &euro;1.2 trillion has been spent in Europe bailing out banks and there has been recapitalisation of &euro;200 billion to stimulate the economy.  Such stimulation packages and bailouts, together with their American equivalent, will bring us back.  While it may take a couple of years, if we take the correct steps and if we all pull together equally, we will get there.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh.  We are getting fond of him now that he is in the House so often.  I do not propose to talk about the past.  Instead, I prefer to query how we propose to resolve the current difficulties.  The Government amendment does not provide the solution because it lacks urgency and fails to recognise the magnitude of the problem.</P>
        <P>Our reputation has been greatly damaged internationally, especially from the perspective of financial investors.  Despite this, insufficient action is being taken to address this issue.  Members of the boards of all the banks, including the Central Bank, must be replaced.  So too must there be an overhaul of the Financial Regulator which failed to guard adequately against these abuses.  Such action is desperately needed to repair Ireland&rsquo;s reputation.  How can we trust those who led us into this mess to lead us into recovery?  Whistle-blowers are needed more than ever.  Mr. Tony Spollen, who exposed the DIRT scandal at AIB ten years ago, was a good example of the type of white knight so urgently needed now.  There are people within the banks who are aware of malpractice.  They must come forward without delay.</P>
        <P>I recently read an interesting OECD report on the causes of the current financial crisis and its effect on policy issues.  It is not surprising the report is highly critical of many of the banking practices that were prevalent before the current global crisis.  Its recommendations include a reform of the incentive system for employees in financial institutions through a focus on the slow vesting of shares in employees rather than rewards for quick returns.  The report also recommends matching the cost of capital to the risk being taken in its use.  In other words, risk-taking sections of banks should be separated from the rest and should pay more internally for <Col N="116"/>their funds.  These are the types of financial reforms that should be implemented as a matter of priority so that we can rebuild the banking system as a properly functioning entity which serves the consumer rather than the risk-taking, high-earning cowboys who play with other people&rsquo;s money.</P>
        <P>Before people regain their confidence in the banking system, there must be some type of admission of guilt.  In the United Kingdom, for instance, unreserved and public apologies were given by HBOS and Royal Bank of Scotland to their customers.  A similar apology on the part of Irish banks would be a good start.</P>
        <P>I have not focused on the past but have instead looked to the future.  There are certain actions that can and must be taken.  I urge the Government to grasp the opportunity immediately to resolve this crisis.  It is a crisis that is solvable.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Quinn for sharing time.  We have debated this issue in various forms, on various occasions and at some length.  The motion represents an opportunity to mark time.  I agree with Senator Quinn that it is not helpful to harbour resentments about the past.  The problem is that the Government does not recognise the nature of the crisis with which we are faced.  There is a worrying pattern here.  Given that the Irish banking system had only a minimal involvement in sub-prime lending, we cannot hide beneath the international umbrella and blame that for our current difficulties.  The reality is that many of our problems are home grown.</P>
        <P>The alarming and continuing pattern indicates that the Government is not taking control of events.  The guarantee that was given at the end of September was a response to the banks putting a gun to the Government&rsquo;s head and warning it that fire and brimstone would erupt the following morning if action was not taken.  The provision of the guarantee may or may not have been the correct action to take.  Likewise, the decision to nationalise Anglo Irish Bank represented the forcing of the Government into an action to which it was initially opposed, as it made clear.  The recapitalisation move was part of the same pattern in that it was not the first choice of the Government.</P>
        <P>Now there is clearly a serious possibility that the two largest banks, Allied Irish Banks and Bank of Ireland, may also be nationalised.  As the Minister for Finance has said, this will only be done as a last resort.  It is clear from the Minister&rsquo;s remarks on &ldquo;Drivetime&rdquo; yesterday and those of the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment today on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; that recapitalisation is close to failing and that the next step will be nationalisation of the two largest banks.  If that happens, it will, once again, be a case of the Government, instead of proactively taking steps that are necessary, being forced to do what is necessary by events and international markets.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I was in the city of London on Monday and spoke to people who had investments in Ireland.  What they said about the state of the economy and how it is being run and the state of the banks is unprintable and I do not intend to repeat it, even though I may do so under privilege in this Chamber.  It might be damaging to do so because it is the view of these responsible investors that this economy is heading for the rocks and that the Government is in denial.</P>
        <P>As I said, the pattern is that the Government waits until it is pursued before responding.  We need something more proactive.  The Government must recognise the problem and instead of taking the minimalist approach, being merely the target and victim of events, it must, to some extent &mdash; but not to a total extent; I acknowledge that is not possible in a global market &mdash; take charge of events.  I dread to wake up tomorrow morning or the morning after to hear that the Government has decided &mdash; which will mean it has been forced &mdash; to nationalise the two major banks.  However, I suggest this is very likely to happen.  It will not be a voluntary or <Col N="117"/>proactive move by the Government but, once again, an action of last resort.  This type of pattern offers no confidence to international observers.  It suggests the Government is not in control of the economy and not confident enough to take the necessary steps.</P>
        <P>It is unfair to blame the Government entirely for the current difficulties.  The Government is full of people who are without experience of this or any other such crisis.  Bankers must take a large portion of the blame for living in denial for so long and hoodwinking the people, the Government and the regulator.  Likewise, the Financial Regulator must take its share of responsibility.  It is an absolute fiasco when the regulator is making inquiries into a situation in which it is directly involved and almost undoubtedly culpable.  One cannot expect international investors or any objective analysts or observers to have faith in the financial behaviour and economy of a country where the regulator is culpable and intends to issue a report exonerating itself.  Despite it all, that is what will happen.  This is the desperately damaging situation in which we find ourselves.  The buck stops with the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, the Minister, Deputy Lenihan, and the Taoiseach.  It is high time they at least gave the impression that they are in control of events instead of <i>vice versa</i>.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>It is important to put the current economic situation in context.  If I were to devise a ratio for where we stand and where culpability lies, I would say that 70% is accounted for by international factors and 30% by policies that primed an economy that was too heavily reliant on the construction industry, property prices and the merry-go-round of easily lent money that is now impossible to recover.  These are the essential flaws in the Irish economy which are meeting with an already intolerable international situation.  Yesterday the US Treasury Secretary spoke of the US having a severe contraction in its economy.  As a country that has prided itself, probably unfortunately, on being one of the most open economies in the world one of our main trading partners will be in a severe recession before we can seek to achieve economic recovery.</P>
        <P>The economy of Japan contracted by 3.3% in the past quarter alone.  Every four weeks its GDP shrinks by 1%.  The bank liabilities of the two biggest banks in Switzerland, the citadel of banking, Credit Suisse and UBS have combined current liabilities that are seven times the GDP of Switzerland.  This is an international crisis.  Our nearest neighbour has already invested in or guaranteed its financial system to a cost of &pound;1.3 trillion.  The responses we are dealing with are the same as those of every other major economy in the world.  This will affect how we do things.</P>
        <P>People have made criticisms, which may be justified, of the pace of change and the choices being made but these circumstances are unparalleled in world history.  Many people are discovering policy approaches as we go along.  In the UK, there were four separate approaches in respect of Government interventions in the financial institutions; in the US, there were six.  One year after the collapse of Lehman Brothers, the banking situation in those countries has not improved.  We are dealing with this on top of bad economic choices we made in the past and on top of a financial services sector that, in some elements and in terms of certain individuals, has shown itself to be corrupt.  There are necessary obstacles that we must overcome.  We must acknowledge that an international crisis exists, which we are suffering disproportionately because of policies followed here.</P>
        <P>On the other hand, it is important that the political debate gets beyond the pantomime politics we have experienced since we entered this critical juncture in the country&rsquo;s economic history.  The main Opposition party referred to having better options in terms of only the most recent &euro;2 billion that had to be corrected in public expenditure because of the shortfall in tax receipts in November and December of last year, never mind any ideas about the &euro;4 billion we must save at the end of this year, the &euro;4 billion at the end of next year or the &euro;3.5 billion <Col N="118"/>for the year after that.  Some of the proposals made by Fine Gael do not add up and some include measures that have already taken place.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>Almost half of the &euro;2 billion that Deputy Richard Bruton is claiming can be saved refers to &euro;850 million being saved in wages.  This includes a pay freeze, which will happen, and increments that are still in place and partly because of 5,000 people being taken out of the public sector. </P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>These 5,000 people would save &euro;250 million, according to Fine Gael, and this is where we are going wrong in our economics.  The &euro;250 million is based on the presumption that the 5,000 people are earning an average of &euro;50,000 each.  What about redundancy payments, pension payments and unemployment payments?  That is no saving at all.  How is it saved in the first year when we need to repair our public expenditure?  This is a danger in some of the Opposition approaches.  The Opposition believes there are easy fixes and populist measures that can be announced to give people the impression that the Opposition can solve this situation without difficulty, without pain and without any effect on people who live in this country.  It will not be done like that, it will not happen.</P>

	<P>We must control public expenditure and we must restore confidence in the banking sector.  Much of it has been discussed already and with eight minutes I am sorry I cannot give Senator Twomey all the answers to the world economic crisis.</P>

Until we understand this, the kind of pantomime, table tennis politics does nothing for the benefit of this country and does nothing in terms of the honesty of presenting motions of this type in Private Members&rsquo; time.  I ask the Opposition to consider this and to avoid the party political advantage it is seeking in this period of utmost crisis.  The Opposition should ask the questions that need to be asked and tell people what they need to hear.  Until we do so, this is a crisis that will worsen.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sorry Senator Boyle is leaving the Chamber because I tuned into what he said about correcting mistakes.  That was the only conciliatory remark he made before speaking about the Opposition and pantomime politics.  Then he started into a big rant and I am disappointed in him.  The Cathaoirleach does not like us referring to the D&aacute;il but the Minister for Finance stated he would reject the Fine Gael motion.  This motion includes the <Col N="119"/>point that all members of the board of the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority be removed, that a cap of &euro;250,000 be imposed on banking executives and that the ten members of the so-called golden circle be named.  Senators Boyle and Hanafin were asking us to wear the green jersey.  This is a fair motion yet the Government parties are playing party politics, over and back, tit-for-tat, pantomime politics.</P>
        <P>President Obama delivered his state of the nation speech yesterday and spoke about the day of reckoning.  Members on this side agreed that our country is in a serious state and we do not need to be lectured by the Government telling us we need to wake up and that it is not about scoring points.  I ask Fianna F&aacute;il to give the leadership this country deserves.  While there is a serious global situation it is not all about the global situation.  It is about the irresponsible, bad banking that has gone on in this country.</P>
        <P>We would like decisive, prudent and responsible management of our capital investment and deposits and a reliable source of credit for Irish businesses.  Last week a survey of small and medium enterprises found that 48% of such firms were refused credit by the banking institutions.  It is almost impossible to get money to buy a car.  These are the banks we have guaranteed and this is not good enough.  The motion refers to the need for the regulatory authority to be replaced with a new, honest, vibrant group of people.  The cronyism that existed between the Irish banking fraternity must stop.  Some members of these institutions were also members of other banks&rsquo; boards.  There must have been much backslapping and this does not really represent reassurance or confidence.  I ask the Minister of State to comment on this.  The Minister rejected this, saying he would not do it.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>A regulator must be able to investigate transparently transactions by banks, their investors and directors.  The regulators should be independent.  The Government knew about the transactions of the so-called golden circle for over a year and it was only yesterday the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na went into the offices of Anglo Irish Bank.  I find that extraordinary.  If the names are known, the beans should be spilt.  I do not accept the excuse of banker confidentiality.  This golden circle must be named.  The drip feeding of information must stop because every day there is a new revelation which further damages our reputation.  Most importantly, we must recover the associated &euro;300 million in debts taken by this so-called golden circle from the Irish taxpayer.  The assets of these people should be confiscated.</P>
      
        <P>I fully support my party&rsquo;s call in this motion for open advertisement for the appointment of the next Governor of the Central Bank, and that the position should be open to international competition and scrutiny by this Oireachtas.  It is an outrage that the Government has now guaranteed and recapitalised three of our banks and that some of the chief executives of these banks are still earning in excess of &euro;250,000, which includes bonuses and share options.</P>
        <P>A person must earn a bonus.  Investors and poor people have lost money because of these corrupt transactions.  A bonus should be earned if people are helped to invest their money wisely rather than when all that money is lost.  Why are these people still allowed to live freely as if nothing has happened?  The Minister of State will argue this is due process but how long will due process continue?  Our banking reputation has been destroyed and ordinary hard-working and honest people have lost thousands.</P>
        <P>I thank the Minister of State for coming to the Seanad, as he does regularly, but on this side we are acutely aware of the need to get together and sort out this matter.  I will do anything I can to support sound and wise suggestions from this Government.</P>

	<P>I second the amendment to the motion, which was put forward by my good friend and colleague, Senator John Hanafin.  I am happy to participate in this debate and I welcome and congratulate those who have tabled the motion.  I am not sure whether there are other ways we can achieve the same results or whether there are better avenues we should travel to achieve those results.</P>
        <P>All Members of this House would be united in their desire that this House and our Government would take the necessary steps to stabilise our financial institutions and secure the funding base.  We all acknowledge that we must reboot our banking system and ensure the availability of credit and a fully operational banking sector.</P>
        <P>There is no doubt it is very disquieting to look at the current state of our banking sector and financial institutions, and every day something new unfolds.  People are inclined to jump on the bandwagon of a sensational media headline and are not prepared to allow due process.  For a while, everybody in Ireland was blaming one man for the financial position of Ireland with no acknowledgement of the international and global difficulties.</P>
        <P>I accept there is real hardship and deprivation across society and the public is rightly angry.  This is not owing to the difficulties in one sector or another and there are many facets to the public perception and its reaction.  Our banking and regulatory systems have been found wanting and business closures and job losses are escalating at levels not experienced in recent times.  Unemployment is creating uncertainty and destroying self-respect.  Our spiralling and out-of-control public finances warrant exceptional measures.  There are new levels of security threats, as well as social and industrial unrest, which threaten the very foundations of the State.</P>
        <P>The depressing state of Irish society is due to the anxiety of the Irish people about the direction in which our economy is heading.  The public witnesses more evidence of job losses and economic and financial failures every day.  Its view is that the position is deteriorating with no light at the end of the tunnel.  There is a genuine call for resolution to our banking problems, economic revival, more job opportunities and a relaxation of the anxiety by the vast majority of people for the future of the country.</P>
        <P>Some of this is stimulated by people in the Houses and other leadership roles, including the media.  We must not underestimate the challenge ahead, and it is essential not to overstate our difficulties.  Most importantly, we should remain positive in our ability to address these issues and succeed.  In the unprecedented set of international circumstances that has emerged, it is our duty in this House to address the public&rsquo;s concerns and anxieties, restore confidence and bring the public with us in our resolve and belief in our ability to get ourselves out of this crisis.</P>
        <P>I will send out a clear message from this side of the House.  There is a determination and an ambitious Government programme to resolve.  In global terms, Ireland is vulnerable and we have no special protection from the global economic and financial difficulties.  This is not an easy time to be in Government but this Fianna F&aacute;il-led Administration is determined, with every beat of our heart, to resolve our acute difficulties in the national interest.  Ireland has been very successful in growth and development recently and we all have an awareness of what we have achieved.  With our can-do attitude, we will do it again.  I earnestly ask that we all get down to the task of getting our economy and financial difficulties resolved to get back on the road we successfully travelled in the past.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LarryButler"><NameTxt>Senator Larry Butler</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the amendment to the motion.  Although we are experiencing difficulties and we need a solid banking system, we still have a very good economy, with 1.8 million people still at work.  We have to ensure we govern the economy and we are doing so.  The Opposition has tabled motions and this is a reasonably good motion that I would not have <Col N="121"/>too much difficulty with.  It indicates a much more conciliatory approach from the other side of the House, which is very welcome.  We should continue to act this way.</P>
        <P>There is much silly talk about golden circles and people are trying to say that Fianna F&aacute;il is more involved than others.  The other day I heard the views of one member of a golden circle, Mr. McEvaddy, who would be a strong member of Fine Gael.  I am sure most people would know him.  He stated these people were heroes.  Before there is any further dirt thrown at our party, the Opposition should look at what is on its own side.  I say this with the best intentions and without wanting to change the tone of the debate because the issue is too important for that.</P>
        <P>It is important when the Minister is recapitalising our banks the directors should ensure small businesses, which create work for approximately 800,000 people, are looked after.  I support what the Minister is doing.  Senator Ross indicated we may have to nationalise the banks and I would not rule that out.  It may be one of the options we should consider.  We should bring the social partners back into play because we must bring everybody on board.  Everybody is feeling a certain amount pain and will continue to do so in the current economic circumstances.  We need to have a solid banking system, as that will stand us all in good stead.  There are no quick fixes and no easy answers.  The Minister has been cautious in his approach to addressing the banking system and I congratulate him on that.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Ba maith liom f&aacute;ilte a chur roimh an tAire St&aacute;it.</P>
        <P>A recurring theme running through many of the contributions is an attempt to ascertain the degree of culpability of the Fianna F&aacute;il section of the Administration for our current ills.  I do not propose to devote too much time to that aspect given that we must look to policy positions and the future, other than to say it would be in the best interests of this House to clear that up.  There is no avoiding the fact the Government in office during the last 11 years allowed an unquestionable culture of waste, recklessness and reckless spending to develop in this country.  I will cite four instances where the Taoiseach, when Minister for Finance, contributed to our economic woes to date.  In 2005 his decision to extend tax breaks for property developers and investors was done against the advice of the National Competitiveness Council and all current advice at the time.  From 2005 to 2007, Government expenditure was extended by twice the sustainable rate of growth.  There was a runaway increase in Government expenditure over that time.  Because of mismanagement, over-spending and lack of controls it is not clear that we have an infrastructural bonus to match that sort of expenditure.</P>
        <P Just="Left">An assurance was given by the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, in 2006 to home owners that our economic fundamentals were strong.  The failure of the Financial Regulator to interfere with the banking sector was ignored during all that time.  That puts it on the line that culpability for the current position rests with the Administration in place during the past 11 years.  There is no denying that.  In terms of how we move forward, it is unhelpful not to accept that.  The attempts, in so far as they have been some by Members on the other side of the House, to suggest the contrary is not assisting their cause.  It is as well to take that as read and try to move forward.  It is clear from many sources that the necessity for those on the Government side, as they perceived it, to win the last general election stopped reaction to what they knew was the developing ills of the economy.</P>
        <P>We are in a situation where strict regulation of the banking sector is required at home and internationally.  We should contribute to that.  There is no doubt there was a huge international contribution as well as a domestic contribution to our economic ills.  We need to be associated with the international efforts to regulate the financial world.  The same <i>laissez-faire</i>,<i> </i>light touch regulation can never again be allowed again.  We have all learned our lesson.</P><Col N="122"/>
        <P>Good news emanated from the European Commission in that respect today, but we, as a State, must be at the vanguard in promoting international financial regulation, and we have to begin that at home.  Clear regulation and control of the sector domestically is needed.  There is a need to remove boards, directors and for a huge culling in the sector.  There is also a need to eliminate the astronomical salaries and bonuses, which contributed to a hedonistic atmosphere, childish irresponsibility and a lack of connection to reality that permeated the banking sector and the top echelons of the developer sector here such that they lost all sense of reason, connectiveness and balance.  That must be taken into consideration.</P>
        <P>The banks are short of capital due to loan losses.  Consequently, they have cut credit lines to small and medium sized enterprises, but that cannot be allowed.  The banks cannot be allowed to solve their difficulties in that fashion, if they are to be supported by taxpayers.  They are anxious not to use their capital in that way because they are afraid of bringing down share prices.  They are only concerned with profit and with maintaining the value of shares.  It is important we do not let the banks away with cutting off credit to the small and medium sized enterprises and to individual consumers.  It is important to ensure such credit is maintained.</P>
        <P>The banks lack of creditability internationally is damaging their capacity to borrow.  They are also afraid to dilute share prices.  The strategy Fine Gael recommended to Government and on which we look favourably is the idea of buying preference shares.  Buying them has the advantage in that a preference share takes precedence over ordinary equities and preference shares are a safer bet for the taxpayer.  This does not mean we would become hands-on bankers, which is not necessarily a role for the Oireachtas, although we should have tight control of the sector.</P>
        <P>There is no point in giving the banks extra capital that they can use for lending overseas and on other speculative ventures.  The extra capital they get must be to power the domestic economy and strict controls should apply.  AIB recently bemoaned the fact it would only have a profit of &euro;500 million this year, that its profit would be down to that level.  The onus in this respect should be on generating our economy and on there being only modest profits for our banks.  If there is to be taxpayers&rsquo; investment in the sector, that should be the case.</P>
        <P>Recent statistics suggest that 43% of small and medium sized enterprises are waiting for money and in need of financing.  It is shocking that Mr. Wallace recently &mdash; I know the Cathaoirleach is anxious we do not name individuals&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>It was shocking that people &mdash; I will put it that way &mdash; appearing on a &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme recently openly boasted they were not paying the interest on their loans.  That is a horrendous state of affairs, while huge pressure is being put on individual consumers and on small and medium sized enterprises.  That must be a source of concern.  We should buy preference shares, remove many executives and boards, introduce rigorous control, insist the banking sector responds to the needs of our economy and those of ordinary people and that it plays its role.  If there is a crisis, and all conventional and accepted wisdom suggests there is one, the banking sector cannot be exempt from its role in solving it, particularly in light of the fact it played an enormous and pivotal role in bringing us into it in the first instance.</P>

        <P>I thank Senators for their contributions and for what has been a good debate.  I assure them that I listen carefully to what the Opposition and everyone has to say.</P>
        <P>I will give a short response to the last contribution.  Senator Paul Bradford was correct in the last debate I attended when he said nearly all of us were, to a degree, to blame and nearly all of us had to help find a solution.  That was a very accurate statement.</P>
        <P>There was a reference to infrastructure bonus.  The national motorway network, which was started in the late 1990s, will be completed next year and is a quite a large infrastructure bonus.  As far as preference shares are concerned, that is the route the Government has gone down.  I agree with Senator O&rsquo;Reilly on that point.</P>
        <P>While commentators here are naturally very much focused on our own internal problems, it is important to put the banking crisis in an international context and Senator Boyle, in particular, did so.  Governments all across the world are grappling with collapsing confidence in the global financial system, and all are making a variety of interventions to try to achieve the best possible outcomes for their country.  It is important, therefore, to understand what the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, sees as the Irish strategy.</P>
        <P>The Minister is keen to ensure there is an independent banking sector in Ireland.  This requires us to protect systemically important banks and avoid nationalisation of these institutions, if at all possible.  His aim is to ensure there continues to be competition in the Irish market for consumers.  To that end, we are seeking to ensure that Bank of Ireland and Allied Irish Banks plc continue as a strong and competitive banking presence in the marketplace.</P>
        <P>Given the uncertain position of the UK and foreign owned banks, we would ideally like to see a third significant Irish player in the banking sector.  This situation reminds me of debates in the early 1990s on a third banking force which was part of the Fianna F&aacute;il and Labour Party programme for Government, but it did not come to fruition at that time.</P>
        <P>The prerequisites for the success of this strategy are sufficient liquidity in the system and adequate capitalisation of our banks.  The introduction of the Government guarantee scheme in 2008 was designed to ensure the banks would have sufficient liquidity to operate on a day-to-day basis.  This move has since been followed by many other countries.</P>
        <P>Market expectations regarding the capital banks hold have altered significantly.  As a result, banks have had to compete vigorously for deposits and other forms of funding in a weakening economic environment.  They have also been forced to seek capital in an unwilling and unfriendly market, resulting in an array of State recapitalisation programmes across the developed world.  It is in this context we have announced our plans to capitalise the two main banks.  In due course, we will look at the remaining institutions.</P>
        <P>In this extremely challenging period for the banking sector, and where investors dealing with banks are even more risk-conscious, the good standing of a bank, its reputation and a strong ethos of corporate governance through its board and senior management become even more important.  There have been important issues for the Government to address in taking on this role, at a time when we have also to redress a large fiscal imbalance and take difficult decisions to restore our competitiveness internationally.</P>
        <P>The Government is providing &euro;3.5 billion in core tier 1 capital<b> </b>for each of the two main banks.  The capital to be provided to each was determined following detailed engagement with the banks themselves and with the benefit of survey information of the bank&rsquo;s loan books, which was conducted for the Financial Regulator<b> </b>by PricewaterhouseCoopers.  A careful assessment was made of the potential losses that the banks face on their loan books in the coming years, taking into account the impact of likely trends in property values and various stress scenarios for the economy.</P><Col N="124"/>
        <P>The Minister was criticised in some quarters for being slow to proceed with a recapitalisation of our major financial institutions, but he strongly believes the time spent on assessing as accurately as possible the capital requirements of each bank was worthwhile in terms of the assurance that can now be offered to the markets on the levels of capital in the two largest banks.</P>
        <P>The level of capital being provided by the State will boost the core tier 1 capital ratio of AIB to 8.5% and of Bank of Ireland to 9%.  It is important to note that these are high capital ratios by international standards.  The banks will therefore be in a strong position, able to raise the funding they require on international markets and withstand loan losses arising.</P>
        <P>The continued flow of credit is vital to our economy.  To establish the exact position regarding the availability of credit, the recapitalised banks have agreed to fund and co-operate with an independent review of credit availability which will be managed jointly by the banks, Government and business representatives.  The recapitalised banks have also agreed to work closely with the IDA, Enterprise Ireland and State agencies to ensure the supply of appropriate finance to contractors engaged on major projects sponsored by them.  They have also agreed to engage in a clearing group to identify specific patterns of events or cases where the flow of credit to viable projects appears to be blocked and to seek to identify credit supply solutions.  The two banks have also agreed to provide &euro;15 million each to a new seed capital fund.</P>
        <P>The international credit crunch is severely limiting the availability of credit to sound businesses and thereby doing severe damage to our economy.  The bank customer package announced as part of the recapitalisation program addresses this problem in a number of ways.  The banks have agreed to make additional funds available for lending.  A statutory code of conduct for SME lending has been devised to help create a better climate for SME lending and to give potential borrowers greater confidence.  This covers all banks and not just those which have been recapitalised.  An independent review of credit availability will give a definite picture of the current supply, demand and conditions for business lending.</P>
        <P>In addition, statutory codes of practice on business lending and mortgage arrears were published by the Financial Regulator on 13 February 2009 and apply to all banks.  The business lending code includes a requirement for banks to offer their business customers annual review meetings, to inform them of the basis for decisions regarding their accounts and to have written procedures for the proper handling of complaints.</P>
        <P>Decisions to grant, refuse or alter credit must be taken on a case by case basis.  Where a customer gets into difficulty, the banks will allow reasonable time to seek to agree an approach to resolve problems and to provide appropriate advice.  The Minister wants to stress this is a statutory code and banks will be required to demonstrate compliance with it.</P>
        <P>The code of practice on mortgage arrears applies to all mortgage lending on a customer&rsquo;s principal private residence.  A lender may not seek repossession until every reasonable effort has been made to agree an alternative repayment schedule with the borrower.  The code will ensure that mortgage lenders can only commence legal action for repossession six months from the time arrears first arise. <b> </b>A number of days ago the <i>Financial Times</i> quoted a figure of, I understand, 70,000 repossessions in the UK.  Proportionately what is happening here is, properly, far below that figure.</P>
        <P>In January, against a background of concerns about governance issues and market confidence in Anglo Irish Bank, the Government, following consultation with the Central Bank, the National Treasury Management Agency and the Financial Regulator, decided to take it into public ownership.  This decisive step was taken to safeguard the interest of its depositors and the stability of the economy.</P><Col N="125"/>
        <P>The Government, along with the entire country, has been shocked by the revelations of the practices in Anglo Irish Bank, and as the Minister for Finance has said time and again, we are fully committed to getting to the bottom of the situation and ensuring the full rigours of the law are applied to anyone found to have abused the system.  The Government will fully investigate the loans to Mr. Sean FitzPatrick, the loans to purchase shares transaction and the Irish Life &amp; Permanent deposit arrangement.  Any further issues that may emerge will also be dealt with by appropriate action, but the Government must remain fully cognisant of, and committed to, upholding the principle of natural justice.</P>
        <P>It is vitally important that the country now regains confidence in its banking system.  There are many thousands of loyal and hard-working banking staff out there who are shocked at recent revelations.  It is important they and the public can be reassured about the long-term future of the financial sector in Ireland.  It is also important that we collectively give confidence to the international markets about Ireland&rsquo;s financial sector and its long-term future.  Continued revelations of alleged malfeasance damage all of us individually and collectively.  However, it is incumbent upon all of us, the media included, to ensure there is a balance struck between the exposition of past alleged wrongdoings and the solidity and proper functioning of a significant and vitally important part of the country&rsquo;s infrastructure.</P>
        <P>There is no doubt that there are inherited problems in the banking sector and there has been much comment about how these might be resolved.  As the Minister for Finance indicated in his recapitalisation statement, the Government is prepared to look at and examine proposals such as an insurance scheme, the creation of a bad bank, or other, more innovative Irish solutions to deal with this problem.  The Minister has appointed Dr. Peter Bacon to work in conjunction with NTMA to report and advise me on suitable options in this area.</P>
        <P>At the recent ECOFIN meeting, there was considerable debate and discussion on this topic and desire was expressed for an EU-wide response.</P>
        <P>The British Government has examined many possible options in this area and may well announce a scheme in the coming weeks.  The Minister is firmly of the belief that there is no huge benefit to being first with a solution on this issue and that the best approach is to learn from other experiences and to move as quickly as possible when we have devised a scheme that uniquely suits the Irish circumstances.</P>
        <P>It is widely accepted that bank regulation on a global scale has been too lax, and Ireland is no exception in this regard.  A new structure is clearly required and the Minister is committed to its implementation.  The Minister has already indicated in the D&aacute;il that this may involve the merger of the Financial Regulator and the Central Bank and he is close to securing international expertise, which will help advise him on this matter.  Several Senators pointed out, properly, during the debate the extreme importance of this, given the size of the financial services sector in Ireland and, in particular, the International Financial Services Centre.</P>
        <P>The oversight of the banks concerned has been greatly intensified since the introduction of the credit institutions &mdash; financial support &mdash; scheme.  This new regime provides for a heightened direct engagement with each of the covered institutions and new reporting arrangements, including the provision of scheme compliance certificates by the covered institutions themselves and by their external auditors.  The bank guarantee scheme requirements and conditions are the first step in a new system of financial regulation and supervision.  The joint boards of the Central Bank and Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority are considering further reform measures and the Minister has received a report in that regard which he will examine closely.</P>
        <P>In addition, other regulatory considerations, both domestically and at international level, are under way, including the following: the regulatory authority is reviewing its overall strategic regulatory approach with a view to ensuring that the authority meets its statutory mandate and <Col N="126"/>responds to EU developments in financial regulation; the Financial Regulator business process review, designed to improve its effectiveness and value for money, is now close to finalisation; the Financial Regulator is also processing a strategic plan for 2009, which will address the particular EU and guarantee scheme requirements for 2009; at EU level, new regulatory proposals, including improvements to the capital requirements directive, are due for adoption in early 2009 and more generally; and at ECOFIN, which will incorporate the work being carried out at a wider international level, the role and mandates of national regulators are now the subject of in-depth consideration and, arising from this, it can be expected that proposals will be forthcoming on matters such as prudential soundness, the orderly functioning of markets and stronger European co-operation on financial stability oversight.  The Minister proposes to progress those issues and to bring proposals to Government as a matter of urgency.</P>
        <P>There is absolutely no doubt that there needs to be accountability in the financial sector for what has happened.  We have seen a number of senior people stand down for various reasons and the Minister is clear that more will follow when that is appropriate.  What we have witnessed is a massive failure on a global scale of a banking culture that went beyond all bounds in pursuit of high short-term rewards, with appalling global economic and financial consequences on a scale that few countries, including our own, ever expected to be faced with.</P>
        <P>At all stages, the EU has been consulted regarding any involvement in the banking sector.  In the coming days an EU high level group is due to unveil its blueprint for reforming the financial system.  This is one of several topics the Minister intends to discuss with the President of the European Central Bank, Jean Claude Trichet, when he visits Ireland tomorrow.  It is essential that we work with our EU counterparts to ensure a consistent and decisive approach is adopted that will see us emerge from this very difficult time with a strong and well regulated banking system.</P>
        <P>The Minister has already put on the record that there will be a new pay regime in the banking sector in Ireland.  It is imperative that this regime is organised in such a way that any rewards in the sector are structured to meet the long-term objectives of both the banking institutions themselves and the overall health of the Irish financial system.  The banks have accepted this in principle and we await CIROC findings to help us ultimately flesh out and implement these principles.  The Minister has been advised that this committee, headed up by Mr. Eddie Sullivan, will report on 5  March 2009 and that the report may well  include a recommendation regarding a cap on the salaries of senior executives.</P>
        <P>I agree with Senator Twomey that we are perhaps involved in a redefinition of the scope and role of social partnership which has served this country well over the past 22 years but which must be reshaped to respond to present circumstances.</P>
        <P>The Government recognises that the future prosperity of the country hinges on the actions we take now.  It has a strategy to deal with the complex problems in the banking sector and actions have been undertaken firmly and fairly in accordance with the national interest.  The Government&rsquo;s approach to the banking system has been structured and measured.  All Government intervention in the banking sector has as its ultimate goal the benefit to the citizens and the taxpayer of ensuring stability and securing the position of the customers of the banks, account-holders, mortgage-holders, businesses and entrepreneurs, not ignoring the thousands of rank and file employees who work conscientiously in the banks for reasonable but essentially modest reward.</P>
        <P>I call on the Seanad to support the amended motion and to contribute to the leadership needed to see us through this crisis.</P>

	<P>I very much welcome the Minister of State.  He has been very attentive to the House and, if I might be so bold as to say, perhaps this House stood him in good stead.  I also thank him for what he said.  He always manages to impart a message and he has done so with undoubted enthusiasm.  I hope and sincerely trust that what he outlined will be followed through as a matter of urgency.  He placed great stress on that.  I support everything he said and sincerely hope there can be follow through because, in a sense, we are all in this together.  The banking system is essential to the proper functioning of our economy.  Without the stability of the banks, we would be lost and in a deep mire.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I was glad to note the Minister of State&rsquo;s remarks on Allied Irish Banks and the Bank of Ireland, in particular, and the strong competitive banking presence they provided heretofore in the marketplace.  Sadly, faltering steps have been taken, as we know from recent history.  The Minister of State also referred to the uncertain position of UK and foreign-owned banks.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State said the Government would like a significant third player.  The only issue I have about that is that some months ago, the Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, spoke about restructuring and, as I understood it at the time, from the point of view of the country&rsquo;s strength, he lead us to believe that he wanted to see the six covered institutions reduced to two or, at most, three.  Perhaps the Minister of State will address what is envisaged by way of further restructuring.</P>
        <P>On recapitalisation and sufficient liquidity, that is the key, with time, to the healing process which we require to restore confidence.  This is all about instilling in the people confidence in the banking system because without that, we are lost.</P>
        <P>The guarantee scheme was the most fundamental requirement.  Without that scheme, we would have been totally lost.  It has helped to bring a minimum level of stability.  The only difficulty I see with the guarantee scheme, with which nearly all of us agreed, is that it is set to finish in 2010.  It is vital that timeframe is extended.  The Minister should indicate as early as possible that an extension will be provided as the guarantee is essential to maintain liquidity.  In the context of interbank lending and bonds to the value of hundreds of millions of euro in Irish institutions, many of these are due to mature in the coming months.  Normal practice would be that these would be issued for three years at a time.  How, therefore, can they be reissued if there is no guarantee available beyond 2010?</P>
        <P>I agree with what was intended to be provided by way of core tier 1 capital for both Allied Irish Banks and Bank of Ireland.  However, I would like the banks to apologise to the public, as did their British counterparts before the Select Treasury Committee.  There are many formulas for doing that here.  That said, I compliment Allied Irish Banks on the public notice it issued in the newspapers some weeks ago.  While it was not quite an apology, it acknowledged the commitment of taxpayers to the bank and set out the bank&rsquo;s commitment to work harder on behalf of the public.  Hopefully, that will happen.  Sufficient capital for our two major banks is vital.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State spoke about the European Union.  I agree we should stay in line with international best practice.  I am delighted the president of the European Central Bank will visit Ireland tomorrow and that the Government is staying in close touch in that regard.  We are fortunate to be part of the European Union and of the euro.  This is a great strength to us in this difficult time.  Hopefully, our membership will help make it easier for us to maintain ratios and raise the required level of funding on interbank markets.  The Minister of State indicated that some new developments are expected and, hopefully, these will happen as quickly as possible.</P>
        <P>I was glad to note what the Minister of State said with regard to the statutory code and that the banks will be required to demonstrate compliance, because lack of compliance is part of <Col N="128"/>the reason for what has happened within our system.  There was a lack of compliance, too cosy a relationship among bankers and a total breakdown of the Financial Services Regulatory Authority&rsquo;s ability to deal with the banks.  Clearly, it was not fit for the purpose.  I agree there should be an amalgamation of the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator.</P>
        <P>The availability of working capital to small and medium-sized businesses is a matter of concern to all.  We are just as concerned with regard to first-time purchasers seeking mortgages, which are not being provided in large numbers currently.  However, I understand the Government is working with the banks to follow through on this and commit funds for people seeking mortgages.  Long-term big business customers of the banks are pretty well all right, because the banks continue to deal with them and in the two major banks senior lenders are designated for that purpose.  I would like to see more of this approach available to other customers.  The Minister of State suggested this should be the approach in his speech and I welcome that.  The bigger clients of the banks are having their loans rescheduled or rolled over and interest is being deferred.  I do not say this should not happen, especially where these clients have a good record.  Hopefully, the current difficulty for small enterprises is only temporary and we will get through it, even if it lasts for longer than first expected.</P>
        <P>I welcome the action of the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement and have great faith in that office.  In the past the Government left the office short of staff, but I hope it now has sufficient staff to deal with the business in hand.  The office is constrained by law to deal only with company law and matters and will do that efficiently, no doubt, in Anglo Irish Bank.  However, with regard to inter-transactions between Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide and Irish Life &amp; Permanent, the law may not meet the requirements and may not allow it to go into the affairs of Irish Nationwide, which is a building society, or the other institution.  Will the Minister of State address that issue in his response?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad to have the opportunity to support the Fine Gael motion.  I have noticed repeatedly on Private Members&rsquo; business and across the board that Senators on the Government side of the House frequently complain about the Opposition&rsquo;s refusal to be positive and co-operative.  Senator Boyle got particularly exercised in this regard this evening in his contribution.  Senator Hanafin mentioned this too, but was somewhat less exercised on the issue.</P>
        <P>I find it difficult to take the frustration of the Government side seriously because the Fine Gael motion is very reasonable.  I cannot see how any reasonable person, including Members on the Government side, can argue with the motion.  However, the Government side proposes to delete the Fine Gael motion and substitute its own for it.  This goes to the heart of the issue of co-operation and Opposition politics.  If Senators Boyle, Hanafin and others are serious about wanting co-operation, why do they wish to delete the Fine Gael motion and replace it with their own?</P>
        <P>I can understand that some aspects of the Fine Gael motion might give some pause to the Government side of the House.  It might find it difficult to agree to phraseology that calls on the Government to take more decisive action to restore the reputation of the Irish banking system.  I understand too it might find it difficult to accept one or two other aspects of the motion, and if I was on that side of the House, I might want to amend or vary those aspects.  However, I see no reason for the Government side to strike down the basic thrust of the Fine Gael motion.</P>
        <P>The motion recognises that the reckless and incompetent management, regulation and oversight of the domestic Irish banking system has damaged domestic and international confidence, that the Irish economy cannot recover from the deepening economic depression without a <Col N="129"/>functioning banking system that enjoys the trust of depositors and everybody else and the public perception that the resolution of the banking crisis is being manipulated in the interests of powerful and wealthy elites.  Perhaps the Government spotted itself in that phrase, but it does not necessarily refer to the Government.  Perhaps there is some paranoia in that regard.  The phrase &ldquo;powerful and wealthy elites&rdquo; does not necessarily mean the Fianna F&aacute;il Party and could be a reference to other people.</P>
        <P>I see no reason therefore for scrapping the Opposition motion and introducing a totally new amendment.  I have made the point before that I am relatively new to this forum, but&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>Leaving aside anything to do with the legal profession, I have been dealing with motions and amendments to motions since I became involved in student politics.  Then, the view was always taken that if one was to amend a motion and suit it to one&rsquo;s own argument and point of view, it would not be done with a blunderbuss or hatchet.  One would go through it and select the parts one agreed with and the part one wished to delete and where one wished to substitute one&rsquo;s own point.  That is the spirit and kind of co-operation Government Senators claim they want from the Opposition.  However, when they have the opportunity to make common cause with the Opposition on an issue such as this, they take a different approach.  We cannot take them seriously with regard to co-operation given that approach.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Minister of State.  He raised a number of issues in his reasonably comprehensive speech in terms of what the Government is doing or attempting to do in this matter.</P>
        <P>I do not know whether the Minister of State will have an opportunity today but perhaps the following issues can be addressed on another occasion.  The Minister of State referred to the code of practice on mortgage arrears.  He stated the code will ensure mortgage lenders can only commence legal action for repossession six months from the time arrears first arise.  I have a serious concern as to whether the length of time that will be allowed for this moratorium is sufficiently generous or lengthy.</P>
        <P>I am aware, as I am sure are others, that already in the courts there is, appropriately and reasonably, a measure of indulgence &mdash; if this is the right word &mdash; given to people who have difficulty making repayments in respect of mortgages and bank loans.  It is very rare, particularly on the first or second and often on the third and fourth occasion for a judge to make an order for repossession.  Already there is an element of flexibility in the system.  I would not like to see this being zeroed and replaced by the new code and period.</P>
        <P>The new period being allowed should be added on to the existing flexibility in the system and not be a replacement for it.  I do not want to see the banks simply adopting a position of pocketing the flexibility that is there already rather than affording to people an additional element of flexibility and a longer period of time and moratorium than is already there in practice if not by reason of law or any code.</P>
        <P>Colleagues dealt with the question of regulation in the course of the debate.  I welcome, however belated it is, recognition on the part of the Government and its spokespersons of the importance of regulation.  Until recently, regulation was almost a dirty word in debate about economic matters and business.  Now it is back in vogue and everybody is in favour of it and this is good.  I was always in favour of a fairly high level of regulation.  I am not a convert to this as are some people.  I do not mean the needless officious regulation we sometimes see.  There was always a very compelling argument, in good times and in bad, for a very high level of regulation of the banking and financial industries.  We lost sight of that and now we have almost to reinvent a regulatory system given the crisis we face.</P><Col N="130"/>
        <P>I note the various bullet points set out by the Minister of State and I am a little frustrated.  I would prefer to see the Government making one solid clear statement of principle and intent in terms of legislation to be introduced urgently in these Houses in respect of regulation.  I get a little concerned when I see not one clear bullet point but four or five.  When there are four or five different answers to a question one does not have any answer to a question.  The regulatory authority is reviewing its overall strategic regulatory approach, the Financial Regulator business process review is now close to finalisation, the Financial Regulator is processing a strategic plan for 2009 which will address the EU and guarantee scheme, new regulatory proposals are being made at EU level and ECOFIN is also getting involved.  I do not state that any of these initiatives are unimportant.  However, I would prefer to see a single clear commitment from the Government as to its intentions in respect of introducing a vigorous regulatory regime.</P>
        <P>In respect of accountability, the Minister of State stated, &ldquo;We have already seen a number of senior people stand down for various reasons and the Minister is quite clear that more will follow when that is appropriate&rdquo;.  If the Minister is clear that more will follow, he must be clear that there is wrongdoing or potential wrongdoing on the part of those persons.  If he is clear there will be further resignations why must we wait?  How long will we wait?  What exactly does the Minister mean?</P>
        <P>I wanted to make some points on the Labour Party&rsquo;s proposals in respect of bank regulation and how to deal with the crisis but I will not have an opportunity to do so.  I will flag the fact that they exist so the Minister of State is aware of them.</P>
        <P>With regard to pay, the committee will report next week on 5 March, but why was a committee required to deal with the issue of pay?  I cannot understand this and I want an explanation for it.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State and I am glad to have the opportunity to make a couple of points on this most important issue.  I thank the Opposition for using its Private Members&rsquo; time to debate this issue because it is the single most important matter facing the country.  We cannot overstate the unprecedented nature of the position we are in.</P>
        <P>In recent days, I made a point in the House quoting Dan O&rsquo;Brien who is with the Economist Intelligence Unit of <i>The Economist</i>.  He is an Irishman based in Geneva and one sees him from time to time on various programmes.  Recently, he made an analogy on where we are at present when the entire international banking system has seized and collapsed.  We are all at point A, which is an earthquake zone where one must keep one eye on the sky or roof for fear something might fall on us and one eye on the floor to ensure we do not lose our footing as the ground is moving.  We are trying to get to point B but nobody in the entire planet has managed to identify where is point B and nobody has been able to identify what vehicle or path should be <Col N="131"/>used to get there when one identifies where it is.  Dan O&rsquo;Brien also stated that the most prudent moves, therefore, are to take baby steps in approximately every direction.</P>
        <?oasys _cl14.5- ?><P>I like this analogy because it appears to be what is happening internationally.  Recapitalisation has been tried as have guarantees.  The idea of an aggregated bank or insurance scheme has been mooted.  However, it would appear that the market adjudicating on all of these issues has given mixed signals and we continue to try to evolve a solution to the international crisis in which we are.</P>
        <P>I support the Government amendment to the motion.  As this situation has evolved the Minister of Finance and the Government have taken the appropriate actions.  We had the guarantee scheme, the nationalisation of Anglo Irish Bank and recapitalisation to try to restore a level of confidence to the financial system.  Other problems emerged along the way.</P>
        <P>With regard to Anglo Irish Bank, the palpable anger and frustration among the public is fully understandable.  I share it.  I am angry and I want a pound of flesh.  I want people to be punished for any wrongdoing which was carried out.  In this country, as all the criminal lawyers in the House well know, we have what is called &ldquo;due process&rdquo;.  As I stated on other occasions, it is not possible to return to medieval times and set up a guillotine on Leinster Lawn or in St. Stephen&rsquo;s Green and begin beheadings based on our opinions, which may be justified ultimately, of an individual&rsquo;s guilt or wrongdoing.</P>
        <P>Due process takes time.  Today or yesterday on the Order of Business Senator O&rsquo;Toole pointed out that if a murder is carried out often it may be two years before somebody is convicted albeit that he or she may have been arrested on the day the murder was committed.  Due process will take time.  I am as anxious as any self-respecting Member of the Oireachtas of all parties and none who want to see justice done.  We are going through the appropriate measures in terms of the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, the Financial Regulator and the various agencies within the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We saw a quite public display of that yesterday as part of that due process.  However, I am afraid it will not be possible to increase the speed or have lynchings at dawn to satisfy the desires of those who are effectively expressing personal opinions.  Although the evidence is very compelling, we must have due process.  Due process will occur.</P>
        <P>I would like to see us maintaining some agility and an ability to improvise and adapt to the ever-changing environment.  The rate and type of change over recent months have been simply inconceivable and nobody could possibly have predicted the magnitude of what has gone wrong in international financial markets and in terms of asset values, nationally and internationally.  There is no question that substantial mistakes have been made.  Ireland is no different from anywhere else in this regard.  If we knew some time ago what we know now, different steps would have been taken.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I agree with Senator Alex White that it would be wonderful to have a single regulatory measure or recommendation to solve all problems but I regret this is not possible.  The numerous points being made in the amendment are vital.  It is clear we will need some kind of pan-European, if not global, set of basic rules to which we must adhere from now on.  Until we have this and follow the rules globally, recovery will be a step further away than we desire.  I share Senator Alex White&rsquo;s sense of urgency in wishing for us to identify a regulatory measure but unfortunately we can only play our part in a European and global context.  I would like to see this addressed as a matter of urgency but I welcome the measures that have been adopted thus far.</P>
       <?oasys _cl14.5- ?><P>While we are all angry over how business was conducted over recent years, we must acknowledge there are many good people working in our banking system.  Their morale is particularly <Col N="132"/>low at present.  We should spare a thought for the vast majority of personnel who work within the industry in Ireland because they have done their jobs to the best of their ability.</P>

	<P>I am very pleased to be able to contribute.  I thank the Minister of State and Senator Hanafin for graciously being flexible to allow it to happen.  I will not fire all my shots on this occasion because I am seeking, and will continue determinedly to seek, a rolling debate on finance, to take place every week.  One reason I want to speak is because I <Col N="133"/>know the way in which the Leader of the House tends to pick people off.  If I did not speak tonight, I would be asked why I did not bother doing so when I had the opportunity.</P>
        <P>With regard to what Senator MacSharry said on the leadership of the banks, the banks have betrayed us.  Every single one of the four principal pillars of this country &mdash; priests, politicians, lawyers and bankers &mdash; has let us down.  There is an analogy with the church because there are decent priests in the church who are afraid to go out.  They, in the aftermath of the scandals over sexual abuse, have been spat upon.  They are decent people and the same is the case for front-of-house staff in the banks.  I know this and never attacked the ordinary, decent front-of-house staff.  By God, for years I have had disagreements with the banks.  They never wanted to know the ordinary, decent customer.  They were established to look after and manage savings and keep safe the earnings of ordinary, decent people.  They then pushed us out and did not want to be dirtied by ordinary people.  They chased speculative profits and that is why<?oasys _jy ?>the current circumstances have arisen and why the unfortunate front-of-house staff get attacked.</P>
        <P>I have a couple of remarks on the general area of finance.  We are always talking about Seanad reform and there is supposed to be a committee sitting to discuss it.  I do not know what the committee is doing and the only thing it seems to be doing is targeting university seats, in the name of democracy, although those seats comprise the only democratic element in the whole bloody place.  Let the committee take on board the question as to why Senators are treated as some kind of intellectual and moral halfwits such that they are not allowed to have anything to do with money.  We can prate here for as long as we like but, under the Constitution, we are not allowed to spend or supervise the spending of one single brass farthing.  Let us address this.</P>
        <P>Let us consider the question of the nationalisation of the banks.  Everybody is saying it is a great idea and that we must recapitalise etc.  I made a few suggestions in this regard, one of which is that we should sequester all the rotten, speculative property.  It will increase in value at some stage.  Let us take it from the speculators, take it out of the books of the banks and put it under the aegis of a particular body.  I am not suggesting a toxic bank but a national property management agency similar to the National Treasury Management Agency.  It should be staffed by proper professionals who can mange the properties and eventually make a profit.  Let the property owners have 10% of the proceeds as a gratuity at the end of the process.</P>
        <P>Nobody can wave the Constitution in front of my nose and say property is protected because it is dependent on the governing clause, which refers to the public good.  I doubt any person on this island would say to me the public good is better served in the interest of a tiny number of people who have ripped off every decent citizen in the land rather than in the interest of the ordinary people.  My argument could clearly be sustained.</P>
        <P>Let us have a bit of leadership.  Reference was made to President Obama, who did at least talk clearly, intelligibly and forthrightly.  I have always listened to Senator MacSharry, who is usually very good, but tonight I had no idea what he was talking about.  He referred to what seemed to be some kind of financial octopus moving in many different directions at the same time in baby steps.  What in the name of God does that mean?  Can the T&aacute;naiste be kept off the airwaves as she does not inspire confidence?  I will restrain myself to making that point.  Can we please get somebody who knows what he or she is talking about?</P>
        <P>Will the Minister of State please ask the banks to learn a little?  Why are they handing out below-cost mortgages?  Yesterday morning people were receiving offers of unsecured loans to the value of &euro;9,000.  What happened to the notion of collateral?  The senior management of <Col N="134"/>banks should be cleared out.  Who should they be replaced with?  Not hedge fund managers.  I laughed hollowly when at the weekend I noticed our two former taoisigh, Garret FitzGerald, retired from a hedge fund, and Deputy Bertie Ahern, who was off in Tegucigalpa collecting large sums of money for talking to the misfortunate, misguided inhabitants over there about the Celtic tiger.  He apparently has not realised that particular animal picked up a thorn on its back foot fairly recently.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I will not eat into but I just serve warning that I have a lot to say and I hope the Minister, Deputy Mansergh, will be there because I wish to examine the philosophical basis of the whole thing, including definitions of money and what is behind the market.</P>
        <P>I am sorry to see this stuff about competition is still here.  I voted against the abolition of the groceries order.  Was I right?  Everyone said that would result in lower prices but I knew it would not, that it would serve the interests of supermarkets.  That is one thing.  The Competition Authority was so stupid it did not even provide in the Bill for advertising an open competition for the chief executive&rsquo;s post &mdash; until I put it in &mdash; and then it missed the date when one of the major international corporations was supposed to be examined.  It forgot about it until it was too late.  Do not give me the Competition Authority.</P>
        <P>Let us look at the ESB.  We were told the ESB could not reduce its prices, as the regulator would not allow it because of competition.  The idea behind that was to keep the prices high so that we could suck in people from outside to undermine our own State utilities.  Let us preserve the public service.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Senator Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>Chomh maith leis an Seanad&oacute;ir Norris, ba mhaith liom mo bhu&iacute;ochas a ghabh&aacute;il leis an ceannaire sa su&iacute;och&aacute;n anocht f&aacute; choinne s&iacute;neadh ama a thabhairt d&uacute;inn ar an d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht seo.  Is ceann de na h&aacute;bhair is t&aacute;bhachta&iacute; &eacute; a th&aacute;inig os &aacute;r gcomhair sa t&iacute;r seo.  Is &aacute;bhar &eacute; at&aacute; i mb&eacute;al an phobail ar fad, an d&oacute;igh at&aacute; na bancanna ag l&aacute;imhse&aacute;il iad f&eacute;in le blianta anuas.</P>
        <P>I thank the Acting Leader for extending tonight&rsquo;s debate because it is a hugely important one.  I will support the motion tabled by the Fine Gael Party.</P>
        <P>Senator MacSharry is right.  The Government is taking baby steps in every direction.  He is correct; the Government is all over the place on this issue.  It does not know if it is coming or going.  What is going on is laughable but, unfortunately, it is far too serious to be laughing about it.  The Government does not know what to do.  We know the ground is changing all the time but the Government needs to take decisive action and it needs to show leadership.  This type of hokey pokey dance the Government is doing around the future of the banking and financial system, and of this country, is not good enough.  We are losing credibility internationally and people are suffering as a result.</P>
        <P>It has been five months since the Government, the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator had in their possession the PricewaterhouseCoopers report and it was only yesterday that the Garda raids took place on the headquarters of Anglo Irish Bank.  That begs a serious question.  Does the Minister really believe that the incriminating evidence will still be there five months after the report was in the Government&rsquo;s hands and many months after the dirty deeds were done?  Everybody on this side of the House knew Anglo Irish Bank was rotten to the core.  At the time of its nationalisation we said the bank was poison but nobody could believe the extent of the corruption that was endemic in that institution.  What the Minister and his colleagues <Col N="135"/>asked us to do in January was to nationalise a bank that had given &euro;800 million to six customers, was involved in a &euro;6 billion transfer with Irish Life &amp; Permanent and had given out &euro;180 million in loans to its directors.  The report said the bank had large exposures.  There was a duty on the Government to tell the public about the toxic debts before asking the taxpayer to take on the burden.</P>
        <P>Last Saturday, 120,000 people marched on the streets of the capital because of what they perceive as a gross injustice in the Government making lower paid workers pay for the mistakes of the Minister&rsquo;s party and of bankers.  It has been said time and again and everybody knows it, that we are all willing to accept our share of the pain, but the fact is the Government is letting the banks and their executives away with embezzlement and fraud.</P>
        <P>The time has come for action.  That means taking bold steps.  We called yesterday for the freezing of the accounts of senior executives such as Mr. FitzPatrick and others who have been involved in the fraud that has been exposed over many months.  We must start to ensure banks lend to people.  The Government must take control of banks such as Bank of Ireland and AIB and do something that is positive and stop allowing the drip feed of negativity regarding what is happening in the banking sector to come out as it is damaging our credibility internationally.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Paddy Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to say a few words on the motion.  Like other Senators, I cannot believe the Government Members will not accept it, as it is a good motion and I do not think they can disagree with any aspect of it.  We call on the Government to replace the current board and senior management of the Financial Regulator, to give the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement the lead role, to reveal the names of the golden circle, to set a cap of &euro;250,000 on bank salaries, and to open up the appointment of the next Governor of the Central Bank to international competition.</P>
        <P>The motion is simple and if accepted by the Government it would give confidence to the markets and the country.  The Government amendment will give no confidence to the markets. When he was proposing the recapitalisation of the banks the Minister for Finance said it was all about confidence in the markets.  He said that again when he was nationalising Anglo Irish Bank and he repeated the mantra recently.  Every time the Minister said it, the markets went in the exact opposite direction.</P>
        <P>The Government amendment would certainly not give any confidence to the markets.  The Minister, Deputy Mansergh, stated the ongoing investigation has a criminal dimension to it.  Who decided the matter had a criminal dimension?  At what stage was the Garda called in and why?  Most of the information was available since last September or October and I do not understand why it took so long for action to be taken.</P>
        <P>The Minister, Deputy Mansergh, paid tribute to the taxpayer who is ensuring stability and referred to the need to secure the position of account holders, mortgage holders, businesses and entrepreneurs.  He did not mention shareholders at any point nor investment in the banks.  That is what gives confidence.  There is no confidence in the banking system at present.  Why would anyone invest in one of the Irish banks?  Why would anyone invest money in banks that are going down the tubes?  The Minister is at variance with the Government amendment.  He is saying he wants to instil confidence in the markets but no reference was made to the shareholders.  We can rightly see why the share price of all the Irish banks has gone to the floor.  I urge Government Members not to press the amendment and to accept and take on board the motion tabled by Senator Twomey.  We could see confidence restored to the markets.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh.  I ask the Minister for Finance to introduce the VAT margin scheme that operates in the rest of Europe for Irish car dealerships.  New car sales for 2009 have fallen by 63% when compared to sales in January 2008 and the motor industry is losing jobs rapidly.  Dealerships are closing by the week and I am aware of one that closed recently with debts amounting to &euro;26 million.  Moreover, such dealerships had been obliged to invest heavily in their premises to retain their dealerships.  Prices of new cars have plummeted in recent months as dealers increasingly come under pressure to maintain their businesses.  There are a number of reasons for prices to be at such a level.  One is that they are not helped by the number of non-Irish registered cars in this State.  I ask the Minister of State to discuss with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform ways in which the law might be upheld in respect of those people who are breaking the law.  There should be Garda checkpoints etc. to prevent such people from riding roughshod over the law by driving unregistered cars in this State.</P>
        <P>While this problem exists beyond Ireland and the industry is in trouble globally, a competitive market is needed.  Competition is not all one-sided and Ireland cannot expect simultaneously to raise the level of VAT and incentivise the car industry.  I believe the Government&rsquo;s increase in the VAT rate is killing the market.  This morning, the T&aacute;naiste stated on the radio that it is only, I emphasise the word, &ldquo;only&rdquo;, an increase of one half of one percent.  That certainly personified the measure of proficiency and adeptness she brings to her portfolio.  While I hate to be so critical, the T&aacute;naiste appears to have failed to grasp that so much of Ireland&rsquo;s business depends on the global market and that in particular, the policies and practices initiated by our closest neighbours in Britain seriously affect us.  Consequently, it is Britain&rsquo;s reduction in its VAT rate from 17.5% to 15% and Ireland&rsquo;s increase in the rate of VAT that is causing much of the problem for our small and medium sized businesses.  As for the car industry, Ireland&rsquo;s VAT rate is 21.5%.  The reason this has not yet dawned on the T&aacute;naiste is unfathomable.</P>
        <P>There are other contributing factors, such as the weakening of sterling against the euro.  People have realised it is cheaper and better value to buy the equivalent in Northern Ireland <Col N="138"/>or in Britain.  It is incumbent on the Government to find ways to encourage competitiveness.  However, less is being said in respect of the car industry and just as much damage is being done.  By saying nothing, it simply is being left almost to fester.  It has been paralysed and while I do not wish to talk down the industry, I merely am being truthful.  Were logic and common sense to dictate, in the absence of something being done, the car industry would be shattered.  Moreover, jobs must be saved now.  Consumers also must be able to realise they can get value for money if they buy in the Republic.  As I noted, car prices must be adjusted in line with our neighbours.  There is no alternative if we wish to be competitive.  Consequently, we must create the correct economic conditions for this to be viable and which balances competitiveness for consumers and profits for retailers in the car industry.  The focus must be on maintaining current jobs and looking to the future for new ways of creating employment.</P>
        <P>A major problem car dealers are experiencing and on which I particularly wish to focus pertains to VRT.  Members are aware that significant changes in this regard were introduced in July 2008.  Dealers had purchased and had received their orders for huge numbers of cars but car sales have fallen and consequently, dealers are being forced to cut prices.  However, the biggest sin is that dealers are obliged to pay VAT on their losses.  My request to the Minister of State is that they simply should be obliged to pay VAT on their profits.  This is a highly reasonable request.  After all, were increased numbers of people in the car industry to lose their jobs, which is happening, we would be obliged to provide social welfare payments for them, which in the long term will cost a great deal more.  Consequently, the focus of my motion is to ensure car dealers only pay VAT on their profits.</P>

	<P>I am pleased to have this opportunity to contribute to today&rsquo;s debate and to respond to Senator McFadden&rsquo;s Adjournment matter concerning the introduction of a VAT margin scheme for Irish car dealers similar to that which operates in most other member states.  I am acutely aware of the serious difficulties and the acute downturn facing the motor industry and will meet representatives of SIMI early next week in my constituency.  The Garda Traffic Corps is fairly good at enforcement, certainly to judge by the number of times I have been stopped to have my various discs checked.  I accept the danger and acknowledge that all sorts of people find themselves in difficult situations today.  That said, it requires some effort of imagination to think of my local friendly car dealer queueing up for social welfare.</P>
        <P>At the outset, it is important to clarify that the margin scheme to which the Senator refers in her motion concerns the VAT treatment of second-hand goods, in this case, second-hand cars.  In this regard, we are talking about how VAT is applied to second-hand cars bought by garages and dealers or acquired through a trade-in arrangement and the subsequent resale of such cars by the garages or dealers involved to private individuals.</P>
        <P>The margin scheme, which was introduced under the VAT directive in 1994, is applied by 25 member states.  Only Ireland and Denmark do not operate such a scheme.  Under the margin scheme, a dealer accounts for VAT on his or her profit margin, that is, on the difference between the cost of acquiring a second-hand car and the selling price of the vehicle.  However, following strong representations from the motor industry at that time, Ireland did not implement the margin scheme but instead negotiated a derogation in the form of the current special scheme, which also is provided for under the VAT directive.</P>
        <P>In informing today&rsquo;s discussion, it is important to outline the existing special scheme as applied in Ireland and the margin scheme which is applied by all other member states except Denmark.  I will take the special scheme first.  The distinguishing feature of the special scheme operating in Ireland is that it allows garages and dealers, at the time of acquiring a second-<Col N="139"/>hand car, to reclaim immediately or deduct the VAT considered to be embodied in the price of the car.  The car typically would be purchased by the garage or accepted as part of a trade-in arrangement.  For example, if a second-hand car costs &euro;12,500, the garage can reclaim or get a VAT credit up-front for &euro;2,212.  The State therefore is part-financing the second-hand car until such time as the garage resells it.  When the car is sold on, the garage then must account to Revenue for the VAT on the full price of the car.  However, if the car is sold at a loss, then an adjustment or clawback must be made.  This amounts to the difference between the VAT credit originally claimed by the garage when it bought the car and the amount of VAT actually charged by the garage in the eventual selling of the car.</P>
        <P>At a minimum, the garage or dealer must account for VAT to the tune of the up-front VAT credit received when the car was purchased or accepted as a trade-in.  In the example I have just given, if the car which was bought in by the garage at &euro;12,500 was resold for &euro;10,000, the VAT collected by the garage on the sale would amount to &euro;1,770.  This falls short of the original VAT credit of &euro;2,212 received by the garage when it acquired the car in the first place.  The difference, which amounts to &euro;442 in this example, represents the claw-back which must then be paid by the garage to Revenue.  In response to difficulties being experienced by some garages and dealers, particularly their increasing exposure to claw-back payments, the Revenue Commissioners have granted concessionary treatment which has allowed dealers to postpone payment of the claw-back arising in recent months until 19 May 2009.</P>
        <P>As I have already explained, under the margin scheme, the dealer accounts for VAT on his profit margin.  In other words, VAT is accounted for on the difference in the trade-in price and the resale price of a second-hand car passing through a dealership.  If there is no profit margin, which means the car is sold at a loss, no VAT liability arises.  For example, if a dealer agrees to allow an amount of &euro;10,000 on a second-hand car as a trade-in and subsequently resells that car at a VAT inclusive price of &euro;12,000, the VAT due to the Exchequer is based on the margin achieved by the dealer.  In this particular case, the dealer would be liable for &euro;354 in VAT.  A key difference between the margin scheme and the special scheme is that under the former, a dealer is not entitled to reclaim or receive credit for any VAT when acquiring a second-hand car, but he or she is entitled to do so under the current special scheme.</P>
        <P>The current special scheme has provided considerable benefit down the years to the motor industry since, through the VAT reclaim mechanism, the Exchequer is part-financing the second-hand car until such time as it is resold by the garage or dealer.  However, in the current difficult economic climate, the motor industry considers the margin scheme to hold specific advantages over the special scheme.  We do not have a difficulty with the principle of moving to the margin scheme for the VAT treatment of second-hand cars.  Such a move would bring Ireland into line with most other member states and is a development which we would be prepared to consider favourably.  However, difficulties arise in regard to how a move to the margin scheme would be made.  As I understand it, the motor industry is seeking as part of a transitional arrangement that the outstanding VAT credits that garages and dealers have already received in respect of their existing stock of second-hand cars be written off in full.  This outstanding VAT credit could be between &euro;70 million and &euro;90 million.</P>
        <P>A loss of this magnitude to the Exchequer could not be contemplated.  In addition, the writing off of outstanding VAT credits already provided to the motor industry in full as proposed, even as a transitional arrangement, would be contrary to the underlying principles that apply to VAT, which is a European Union-harmonised tax.  We must also remember that the current special scheme is a derogation from the normal rules granted to Ireland under the VAT directive and once a derogation is given up, it cannot be restored.</P><Col N="140"/>
        <P>We will reflect on the issues raised and the balance to be struck on possible transition costs.  The Government is certainly open to moving to the new basis in a cost-neutral way.  Further discussions with the motor industry will be required to achieve that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his positive and interesting reply.  I am sure dealers will be pleased to learn that he is willing to engage with them on this matter.  The VRT charged on cars imported from one state to another should not be at a reduced rate.  In other words, the same VRT should apply in the case of an imported car and a car that is registered in the State.</P>
        <P>In the North, no VAT is payable on a second-hand car.  However, a car dealer is liable for VAT on the same second-hand car because he is engaged in a commercial venture.  This gives an unfair advantage to those engaged in roadside sales and so on.  Will the Minister of State comment on this?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>The question of differences in VAT rates between Ireland and the United Kingdom, and especially between Ireland and Northern Ireland, is part of a much broader and more fraught discussion.  There would be a vast cost to the Exchequer, which we simply cannot contemplate at this time, in harmonising VAT rates North and South.  As I said in response to a question on this broader issue that was put to me on the &ldquo;Hearts and Minds&rdquo; television programme, which will be broadcast tomorrow night, there have been swings and roundabouts in this regard over the years.  For instance, Northerners have tended in recent years to come to the South for petrol.  In recent months, people from the South are heading north of the Border in increasing numbers to do their grocery shopping.  This is a broader issue to which there are no simple, short-term solutions.  I am sure discussions on the various issues will take place between the motor industry and the Government without prejudice to the desire shared by me and the Minister of State, Deputy Sargent, who has arrived to take my place, to encourage an increased use of public transport.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>In recent weeks I have met many farmers who were approved for grant aid under the farm waste management scheme.  These farmers understood they had a clear contract with the State and that the specified grant moneys would be paid.  I was horrified to discover that many of the farmers are seriously exposed as a consequence of the large loans they took out in good faith on the understanding that grant moneys would be paid by the Department.</P>
        <P>These farmers were obliged to upgrade their farm buildings and infrastructure to comply with nitrates directives and they did that.  However, they now find themselves with serious cash flow difficulties that could put many of them out of business if they are not addressed urgently.  Farmers spent a great deal of money in an effort to comply with these regulations and are now hugely indebted to the banks.  As a result, some of them find themselves in difficult, if not dire, financial circumstances.  They are depending on these grants as the means by which their farms will survive.  I have met many young farmers who are exposed to the banks for more than <Col N="141"/>&euro;100,000 and they cannot wait much longer for these grant allocations to be paid.  Cash flow is now very restricted and could possibly be withdrawn by banks if farmers cannot make repayments on their loans.</P>
        <P>These farmers seek only some certainty with regard to the contract they had with the State and the promise of grant aid.  I urge the Minister of State, Deputy Sargent, to ensure that his Department issues to the approved applicants letters of comfort which would provide them and the banks with some certainty in regard to payments.  I understand the Department faces a shortfall of &euro;105 million in the allocation for this scheme in its 2009 budget and that it is intended to deal with this matter in the Revised Estimates.  Will the Minister of State tell the House when these Revised Estimates will issue?  Will he ensure that we do not rob Peter to pay Paul, that is, that we do not make up the shortfall by withdrawing funds from other farm assistance schemes?</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">8 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P Just="Left">I come from a predominantly rural constituency in County Waterford where many young farmers are exposed and where restricted cash flows could put them out of business.  I understand 424 farmers are still awaiting payment under the farm waste management scheme.  The Department is introducing a deferred payment system whereby 40% will be paid in year one, another 40% in year two and the final 20% in year three.  I urge the Minister of State to ensure the initial payments are paid to the approved farmers as soon as possible to ease their financial difficulties and help the cash flow in farming enterprises.  Farm waste management schemes were set up as a regulatory requirement and farmers have had to comply with the guidelines of the Departments of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the EU.  They have done so and farmers cannot be left in the lurch or isolated.  They depend on the Minister of State to assist them in this time of difficulty and to support farming enterprises so that they stay in business and keep our economy and rural Ireland going.  In the interim I ask the Minister of State to examine giving tax credits for any interest paid on bridging loans to give farmers some relief in this regard.  Fine Gael has tabled an amendment to this effect in the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Bill being debated in the D&aacute;il.  I hope the Minister of State and the Government do not ignore this proposal or guillotine the Bill without giving it due consideration.  I hope to hear some positive news for farmers and a clear statement from the Minister of State when farmers will be paid this grant.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Leas-Chathaoirleach for the indulgence of one minute.  I share the concerns of my colleagues and I raised this matter on the Order of Business last week after numerous representations from farmers in the constituency of Longford-Westmeath.  I have serious concerns about how farmers will make ends meet because of the horrendous pressure they are under in repaying these loans, on which they were given commitments.  A commitment means a promise or a contract that the commitment will be honoured.  This was given by the Minister, Deputy Brendan Smith, to the farming community of Ireland because Irish farmers had to abide by EU directives.  Now the farmers have elaborate slatted sheds but they have no money to pay the bridging loans.  I ask the Minister of State to consider the individual hardships experienced by farmers and their families.  Installation aid and the early retirement scheme have been removed and now the commitments given are being reneged upon.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Coffey for sharing his time.  Like Senator McFadden, I raised this matter on the Order of Business last week and this week I am seeking a full debate.  Like the previous speakers I come from a rural constituency, Carlow-Kilkenny, and I know of a great deal of people affected by the Government announcement that the outstanding grants will be paid over a three-year period rather than in one year.  This is a severe <Col N="142"/>imposition on those affected, many of whom are young farmers who are losing their installation aid grant and whose parents or predecessors cannot avail of the pension scheme.  The same people are being affected by this announcement.</P>
        <P>Surely someone in the Department realised that there would be many applications for this scheme.  I have two brothers, both of whom are full-time farmers and who availed of the scheme.  I find it amazing that the Department&rsquo;s excuse was that there was an underestimate of how many people would apply for the scheme.  It smacks of what happens when the medical card for those over 70 was introduced.  The Government later said it did not know how many people over 70 would take up the offer.  The same excuses are being used at this time.  It is a difficult time for anyone involved in business and farmers are business people.  If they have a bridging loan to pay for the construction of these sheds, they have repayments to meet and it is not much consolation to the bank manager in the current climate to be told that the Government has changed its mind mid-stream and that the scheme will be repaid over three years rather than one.  As Senator Coffey pointed out, these people are in serious financial difficulty because the cash flow situation is not too hectic.  I hope this can be improved and that additional funds can be found.  In the overall scheme of things this is not a huge sum of money.  I realise that money is tight across the board but perhaps some can be found to rectify the situation.</P>

	<P>Ba mhaith liom bu&iacute;ochas a ghabh&aacute;il leis na Seanad&oacute;ir&iacute; as an cheist seo a ard&uacute;.  I am pleased to have the opportunity to outline the current position regarding the farm waste management scheme.  There is particular reference to Waterford but Senator John Paul Phelan will be glad to hear that the reply also refers to south Kilkenny.</P>
        <P>A revised and greatly improved farm waste management scheme was introduced by my Department in March 2006 to assist farmers to meet the additional requirements of the nitrates directive.  The amendments to the scheme included an increase in the standard grant rate from the previous 40% to 60%, with 70% being available in the zone C counties of Cavan, Donegal, Leitrim and Monaghan.  The new scheme also provided for an increase in the maximum eligible investment ceiling from &euro;75,000 to &euro;120,000 and removed any minimum income requirements from farming so that all small farmers could participate in the scheme.</P>
        <P>It is acknowledged that Ireland was in a very difficult position prior to the introduction of the revised scheme in 2006 because Ireland had been found to be in breach of the terms of the nitrates directive in 2004 by virtue of a judgment of the European Court of Justice.  Continued failure to implement this directive to the satisfaction of the Commission would have had serious implications for Ireland, including the threat of substantial daily fines and the undermining of EU funding for rural development schemes and the single farm payment.  The annual EU funding to Ireland under both headings amounts to about &euro;1.6 billion.</P>
        <P>The immense success of the scheme is demonstrated by the 48,580 applications which were received from Irish farmers by the closing date of the end of December 2006, of which more than 30,000 were received during the final month for receipt of applications.  Almost 43,000 approvals to commence work issued to farmers under the scheme prior to the end of 2008 deadline for completion of work.  These figures are virtually unprecedented within the context of on-farm investment schemes in Ireland.  This could explain why the Department was surprised at the extent of applications.</P>
        <P>The financial commitment of this Government to the scheme is substantial, especially during these challenging economic times.  This is demonstrated by the fact that in 2008, &euro;413.7 million was paid out to farmers under the scheme.  Of these, almost 17,600 farmers were paid by 31 December 2008 and about 17,400 payment claims now remain to be processed in 2009.  In <Col N="143"/>excess of 14,200 of these claims were received in the last month of operation of the scheme, December 2008.</P>
        <P>All farmers who completed work in accordance with the terms and conditions of the scheme will be paid.  This has been made clear on several previous occasions.  Around 17,400 payment claims remain to be processed in 2009.  Based on the average grant payment in the past, the cost of these claims is likely to be of the order of &euro;550 million.  Given the current economic and fiscal situation, the Government has decided, with little choice, that payment of outstanding grants under the scheme will be made on the basis of 40% in 2009, 40% in 2010 and the balance of 20% in 2011.  Expeditious payment of the initial 40% in respect of approved claims will commence shortly.</P>
        <P>To date the Government has contributed around &euro;527 million in grant aid under this scheme to about 17,600 farmers.  Further grant aid of around &euro;550 million is envisaged over the coming years to the 17,400 farmers whose claims are being processed.  This expenditure in excess of &euro;1 billion represents a massive level of public support by any standards.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The current position with regard to applications under the scheme in County Waterford is as follows.  In 2006, 67 payments totalling approximately &euro;590,000 were made; in 2007, 116 payments totalling approximately &euro;2.4 million were made; and in 2008, 225 payments totalling more than &euro;6 million were made.  By way of clarification, I point out that the 2006 figures would have included some expenditure under previous versions of the scheme.  A total of 762 payment claims under the scheme remain to be processed by the Department's offices in County Waterford.  This figure also includes claims in respect of farmers in south Kilkenny.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his response.  I do not doubt for one minute the success of the scheme which has allowed farmers to upgrade their infrastructure and improve their positions.  That comes as a result of the significant investment in this area.  I welcome the Minister of State&rsquo;s indication that farmers will be paid as it has been a concern.  It is good to hear it clearly outlined that such farmers will be paid.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State mentioned that 40% of the grant will be paid shortly but what is the exact timescale?  The matter must be dealt with urgently as farmers are concerned because cash flow is seriously restricted.  We must have a definitive timescale for this payment.  The Minister of State and I believe in a future for farming but this will only happen if farming and agriculture as a whole is properly supported and assisted by Government.  One way we can inspire confidence is by making this scheme happen as quickly as possible.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent"><NameTxt>Deputy Trevor Sargent</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the Senator in that the scheme has been very successful.  Even in the programme for Government when the projected growth rate in the country was of a totally different order to what we are now experiencing, at &euro;2 million it was only a fraction of what we are now faced with.  It is a reflection of the need for farmers to upgrade their facilities.</P>
        <P>My understanding of the term &ldquo;shortly&rdquo; is next week or in that timeframe.  I do not know if each farmer will be paid next week but the priority of the Department is to recognise that although it is not a perfect situation, within the boundaries of the available money it will not be held back.  It will be paid out shortly which is the most my Department has been able to say.  We are talking about days rather than months.</P>

	<P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for choosing this Adjournment matter.  It is important not only in the context of the economic climate we are in but also in the context of the environment.  We do not want to have to pay money to Brussels unnecessarily for having <Col N="144"/>broken EU directives.  It is a win-win scenario if we do not have to do this as it would mean our basic infrastructure was in place.</P>
        <P>The Adjournment matter is the need for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to give an update on how well the towns of Buncrana, Moville, Greencastle, Clonmany and Ballyliffen fulfil European standards on waste water and the processes in place between the local authorities and his Department to ensure such regulation compliance.  I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Kitt, for coming to the House to provide a response on the issue.</P>
        <P>We all know any recovery in the quality of Irish water in recent years can be attributed to the fact that Europe is watching us and there is European environmental legislation.  As a result of this legislation, approximately 70% of waste water currently receives secondary treatment, up from 29% in 2001.  Although this is significant progress, the latest information from the Environmental Protection Agency&rsquo;s office of environmental enforcement suggests that almost two thirds of secondary waste water treatment plants failed to comply with one or more of the required standards during the most recent reporting period.</P>
        <P>On 13 January 2004, the European Commission acted against eight member states in a programme on water policy.  At that point in 2004, the Commission took legal action against Ireland for non-compliance with EU laws on water quality.  It had sent written warnings to Ireland relating to the protection and designation of shellfish waters.  There are 14 shellfish waters under the directive.</P>
        <P>I could go into the nitty gritty but the bottom line is that by September 2008, Letterkenny unfortunately made headlines because it was in breach of an EU directive on the provision of waste water treatment in urban environments.  The European Court of Justice found against Ireland and threatened heavy fines under the 1991 urban waste water treatment directive.  At this time I am unsure of exactly where that process lies.</P>
        <P>Buncrana is expanding and gained much under the Celtic tiger.  Its Celtic tiger began early with Fruit of the Loom.  The amount of construction at that time ensured a relatively small town became very robust, yet the treatment works have not expanded to deal with the much bigger town.  In Clonmany and especially Ballyliffen we now have a number of high quality hotels added to the residential and holiday home market but there is no scheme at all.  It seems that everybody is waiting for another hotel development to facilitate or supply the town sewerage scheme.  I am not sure it is as feasible in the current climate as it was even six months or a year ago, so I am reluctant to think we should look to the private sector to provide solutions for waste management.</P>
        <P>I am from Moville and I see the Moville and Greencastle area as one with poor drinking water facilities which require upgrading.  The water is of good quality but the system must be upgraded.  There is no sewage treatment so it does not matter whether the secondary plants are up to the right standard.  We do not have a treatment plant so the sewage in my area goes raw into the Foyle.  People try to explain that tertiary treatment would still leave the Foyle very polluted.  Derry only had primary treatment until very recently and it is not tertiary even at this stage.</P>
        <P>We had an environmental impact statement, EIS, submitted to An Bord Plean&aacute;la in May 2007, although it was not a requirement of the time because of the population it would serve.  By 3 September, An Bord Plean&aacute;la had returned it because an EIS was not required.  We put in place the Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Act and the board then determined that an EIS was required.  It was a year before the EIS was sent in for the second time and the matter has been ongoing for a considerable period.</P><Col N="145"/>
        <P>There is always a discussion and row on the location of a sewerage scheme and it is no different in my area.  The process must come to an end at some point.  I would like the Minister of State to indicate the relevant dates if possible.  Dates were set regarding towns with a populations greater than 15,000, between 10,000 and 15,000, greater than 5,000, greater than 1,500 and under 5,000, and under 1,500.  Dates were given by Europe as to when we were supposed to comply with various water directives.  I could list out the different types of directive.</P>
        <P>Will the Minister of State help me to ensure our basic infrastructural needs are addressed sooner rather than later?  It is more than 30 years since my father first took on the issue of trying to get a basic sewerage scheme for our area.  Many mistakes were made at that time and probably many have been made since then, but processes that have commenced must be brought to a conclusion.  We need such facilities not only for residential development but to facilitate the opportunity for commercial developments.  We want businesses to invest in these towns.  They are in the heart of a white fleet area where there are opportunities in the marine sector for product development and for the addition of quality to our products.  All these developments rely on the existence of basic water and sewerage infrastructure.</P>
        <P>What is the current position on the provision of sewerage schemes to service Buncrana, Moville, Greencastle, Clonmany and Ballyliffen?  Will the Minister of State give a guarantee that the procedures involved will be brought to a conclusion as soon as possible?</P>

	<P>I thank the Senator for this opportunity to clarify the position regarding waste water facilities and the standards applicable to urban waste water discharges from the towns and villages she mentioned.  The urban waste water treatment directive dictates specific standards of treatment for municipal waste water discharges.  The level of treatment depends on the size of the population and the type of water body to which the waste water is being discharged.</P>
        <P>Local authorities, under the general supervision of the Environmental Protection Agency, are responsible for ensuring that urban waste water receives adequate treatment prior to discharge to the aquatic environment.  My Department provides funding to local authorities under the water services investment programme for the installation of waste water collection and treatment facilities that are needed for statutory compliance or other priority reasons.</P>
        <P>As part of its remit in this area, the EPA audits local authority compliance with the regulatory requirements and publishes regular reports detailing waste water treatment arrangements for all agglomerations with populations over 500.  The last such report, covering 2004 and 2005, was published in 2007 and is available in the Oireachtas Library.  In addition, as part of the compliance regime, the EPA licences local authority waste water discharges and is currently dealing with a number of such licence applications from Donegal County Council.</P>
        <P>That council&rsquo;s proposals to provide an upgraded waste water collection network and a new treatment plant to serve Moville and Greencastle have been included for funding in my Department&rsquo;s water services investment programme which covers the period 2007 to 2009.  Planning on the scheme is being advanced by the council and my Department is awaiting submission of a preliminary report for approval.</P>
        <P>In May 2008, my Department approved the council&rsquo;s brief for the appointment of consultants to prepare a preliminary report for waste water infrastructure for a number of locations, including Buncrana.  The Buncrana scheme is also included for funding in the current investment programme.  The council will submit the preliminary report in due course to my Department for approval.</P><Col N="146"/>
        <P>Ballyliffen and Clonmany were part of a wider proposal for sewerage facilities to service a large number of towns and villages in the northern part of County Donegal.  It was ranked as the lowest priority in the most recent assessment of water services needs produced by Donegal County Council.  The assessment of needs informed the selection of new schemes under the current water services investment programme.  Because of the low priority afforded to the proposal, of which Ballyliffen and Clonmany were components, regrettably, it was not possible to include it in the programme.  The council will have an opportunity to review the priority of these schemes when the next assessment of needs is being undertaken.  I take on board the questions raised by the Senator.</P>

	<P>What I find scary in the Minister of State&rsquo;s reply is the sentence, &ldquo;Planning on the scheme has been advanced by the council and my Department is awaiting submission of a preliminary report for approval&rdquo;.  I know that is the lingo used.  My difficulty with it is that this scheme has been under planning for a considerable period.  Planning is not leading to the provision of a sewerage scheme and in the towns concerned raw sewage is ending up in the River Foyle, which is totally unacceptable.</P>
        <P>In regard to Clonmany and Ballyliffen, does the Minister of State have any idea as to when the next assessment of needs will be undertaken?  Is it undertaken annually, biannually or less frequently than that?  I appreciate he might not have that information to hand.</P>

	<P>I do not have the answer to that question, but I understand it is a matter for Donegal County Council to review the priority of these schemes.</P>
