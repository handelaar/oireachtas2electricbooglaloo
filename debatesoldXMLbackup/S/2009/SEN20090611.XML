	<P>I have received notice from Senator Shane Ross that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Transport  to instruct Dublin Bus to cease predatory activities in relation to private operators in the Dublin region, as exemplified by the recent issues between Swords Express and Dublin Bus.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Paschal Donohoe that he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to guarantee that Gaelscoil Bharra, Cabra, Dublin 7 will be placed on the next available school building list.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Eugene Regan that he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Health and Children to clarify when funding will be made available for a patient (details supplied) in Loughlinstown hospital who has a place in Blackrock Cheshire Home but cannot avail of it as he is waiting for funding to be made available for a personal assistant-carer.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

    <Title>Order of Business. </Title>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>The Order of Business is No. 1, Aviation (Preclearance) Bill 2009 &mdash; Committee and Remaining Stages, and No. 2, statements on the recent elections.  No. 1 will be taken at the conclusion of the Order of Business and No. 2 at the conclusion of No. 1 but not before 1.30 p.m. and to conclude not later than 3.30 p.m.  Spokespersons may speak for ten minutes and all other Senators for seven; Senators may share time, with the Minister to be called no later than 3.20 p.m. for concluding comments and to take questions from spokespersons or leaders.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose an amendment to the Order of Business that No. 34, motion 31, is taken immediately after the Aviation (Preclearance) Bill 2009.  I object strongly <Col N="1002"/>to any time limit being placed on it.  It is unnecessary in that if Members wish to speak, they should be allowed to do so without any time limit on the debate.  By refusing to accept this motion, the Government parties are trying to avoid a vote on the issue.  That shows a lack of confidence in their Government.  A watered down debate, namely, statements on the recent elections, is not good enough.</P>
        <P>There is ongoing concern about the Lisbon treaty.  Currently, the Government is in negotiations with its EU partners to try to get an Irish protocol through in order to hold another Lisbon treaty referendum in the autumn.  There is a possibility that the Irish protocol may not be accepted, especially by the UK Government, which is very weak.  The opposition in the UK, the Conservative Party, is very eurosceptic.  There is a need for us to stand up to the plate and get working on the Lisbon referendum.</P>
        <P>The Government should put forward proposals where the Opposition parties lead off on this debate because they have the confidence of the people more than the Government does.  There should also be a strong role for those who are neutral, neither for nor against the Lisbon treaty, to explain Europe in a very dispassionate way.  Like everything, when one is for or against something, one can get very passionate about it and lose the message.  There should be a three way debate on the Lisbon treaty between those who are for it, those who are against it and those who can explain Europe to the people.</P>
        <P>In light of the march yesterday outside the House, we should accept the issues around the report of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse will not go away quickly.  What struck me when the Ferns Report was published a couple of years ago was that a large number of people wanted the debate to go away.  I noticed that again when this commission report was published.  A significant proportion of the people do not want this debate to take place and want it to go away because it is not a stain on the Irish nation but on the Irish character that we allowed this to happen.</P>
        <P>I read some of the headlines in the newspapers this morning in the Library.  Paddy Doyle&rsquo;s book, <i>The God Squad</i>, was published in 1989.  We are now talking about the publication of the Report of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse 20 years later.  We need a wide-ranging debate on this matter and to cleanse the Irish character of this stain.</P>
        <P>I was very struck by comments made by Members on both sides of the House on the Order of Business the day this report was published.  We need to have further debates because that is for what victims of abuse and the people are looking.  I would like to think we could be non-political about this.  This House said it would be non-political but I was absolutely disgusted by the comments of the Minister for Defence, Deputy Willie O&rsquo;Dea, in the Lower House.  He quite clearly tried to make this a political issue and to up the ante with victims of abuse, which was disgusting and low.  I hope we can all rise above that and give the commission and the victims the respect and dignity they deserve and not play politics with them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>On the Ryan report, I complimented the Leader previously on arranging the debate, as did Senator Fitzgerald.  It was the first debate to take place in the Houses.  It was immediate and was important for that reason.  It was also important to survivors who mentioned it to me on many occasions.  The Leader also made the point, which was raised by Senator Alex White yesterday, that it is an issue to which we need to come back.  We should do that but in the meantime, it is absolutely crucial that we look beyond the Ryan report to see where we are going.  A number of things need to be done.</P>
        <P>This House is aware that within the next six weeks, the Government response from the Minister of State with responsibility for children to the Ryan report will be published, as will the Archdiocese of Dublin report into clerical child sexual abuse.  This House will be in recess <Col N="1003"/>when the Government report is published but we should return to debate it.  We should do the same when the Archdiocese of Dublin report is published.</P>
        <P>The Dublin archdiocese is sitting on more assets than any other group in the country.  I make that point because while the Residential Institutions Redress Board is doing its work, we are now aware that this went far beyond residential institutions.  We need to ensure people who were abused in schools and other places and who may not have been resident in them also have access to redress.</P>
        <P>In that regard, the churches and other groups have a role to play, and I am not just hammering the churches.  We should set the agenda.  Every victim and survivor is entitled to be respected and to have an opportunity for some redress.</P>
        <P>Le dh&aacute; l&aacute; anuas, I raised na deacrachta&iacute; ar leith a bh&iacute; ag<i> Foinse</i>.  Inn&eacute; phl&eacute;amar an t-&aacute;bhar mar bh&iacute; cruinni&uacute; le bheith ann idir bainist&iacute;ocht <i>Foinse</i> agus Foras na Gaeilge.  N&iacute; raibh aon dul chun cinn mar gheall ar an gcruinni&uacute; sin.  I do not want anybody to have any doubts about this.  The only Irish language newspaper is going out of business because the State will not make provision for it.  I am appalled by the apparent attitude of the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs who, as I said before, is quick to come into the House and argue minor points of Irish language policy.</P>
        <P>This is a significant issue for the intellectual life of the country, in terms of current affairs information for people in the Gaeltacht and for the development of many aspects of Irish life, including Irish language schools etc.  The Minister said Foras na Gaeilge, the channel through which <i>Foinse</i> gets its money, is a North-South body over which he has no control.  That is a cowardly abrogation of responsibility.</P>
        <P>I have said to the Leader before that North-South bodies do not report to the D&aacute;il or the Seanad but that Ministers should tell us what is going on in them.  This is an example of why I asked for that.  The Minister is walking away from this.  Foras na Gaeilge said it will extend the contract for the publication of <i>Foinse </i>but extending the contract is no good without the money to do so.  This is crucially important.</P>
        <P>I support the point made by Senator Twomey that we should discuss a motion this afternoon.  Parties, Government and otherwise, should have a bit of fire in their bellies discussing this issue.  Members on both sides should be prepared to vote on a motion.   I second the amendment to the Order of Business.  I apologise for going over my time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>In regard to the Ryan commission report, has a suggestion I made to the Leader yesterday been considered by him?  Will he revert to me in respect of the redress board and aggravated damages which could be paid to persons who have appeared before it?</P>
        <P>Senator Twomey touched on the aftermath of the Ryan report and the debate taking place.  Since the publication of the report, many people have called for the immediate inclusion in the Constitution of a provision in respect of children&rsquo;s rights.  I very much support that call.  I am a member of the all-party Oireachtas committee dealing with that question and I imagine that in the coming months, that call will be on the top of the agenda of that committee.</P>
        <P>Let nobody believe, in this House or anywhere else, that all these issues belong in the past or can be dealt with purely in retrospect.  If we are genuinely to change our Constitution and place the rights of children at the heart of it, we will come up against political forces and others in our society who hold fast to the notion that we cannot change, or alter in any way, the centrality of the family in the Constitution and that children&rsquo;s rights should be mediated only through their membership of families.  That is the constitutional order in this country.  All the issues which relate to intervention, whether by social workers or the State, in families or in <Col N="1004"/>situations involving child welfare come up against that central constitutional fact in regard to the rights of the family and the centrality of the family in the Constitution.</P>
        <P>I am not saying we cannot include a clause in the Constitution which would sit reasonably comfortably in it.  However, let nobody believe this is an argument about the past.  Questions about the rights of children arise in the context of the Ryan report on the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse and those questions will inevitably cause controversy and contention across communities and society.  I invite people to begin looking at the responses they may have to the debate which must take place in the aftermath of the Ryan report.</P>
        <P>Will the Leader arrange a debate on issues relating to Dublin and the wider Dublin area?  I am prompted to ask for such a debate by the publication yesterday of an interesting report by the Futures Academy, setting out various options and scenarios in terms of the growth of Dublin city and the greater Dublin area.  This is an issue that comes in and out of public debate, whether in regard to the Government&rsquo;s so-called decentralisation proposal, the question of a directly elected major or the question of integrated public transport systems.  What is our vision for the future of Dublin city and the greater Dublin area?  We should debate these issues in this House.  Perhaps the publication of this interesting report, as outlined in today&rsquo;s newspapers, could act as a starting point for that debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>Following on from the issues raised by Senator O&rsquo;Toole, I call for an urgent debate on North-South bodies.  I have raised this issue on several occasions.  For example, Translink, the cross-Border body that operates the train service between Belfast and Dublin, is co-funded by the European Union.  If one purchases a ticket in the North, one will pay &pound;40, this price having recently increased from &pound;36, but one must pay at least &euro;55 &mdash; I understand this fare has increased recently &mdash; to purchase a ticket in Dublin.  An effective exchange rate of 69 cent for &pound;1 has been in operation for as long as I care to remember.  I have not succeeded in getting Translink to answer my questions on this matter.  I seek a mechanism to deal with a situation where commuters from the South are being exploited by a company which manages co-funded infrastructural services.</P>
        <P>Other North-South bodies include the Foyle, Carlingford and Irish Lights Commission and the Foyle Fisheries Commission.  The latter can issue licences for aquaculture, but when it does so, there is a veto by the Crown Estate.  The question of the territorial status of the seabed of the River Foyle has never been dealt with.  How can these bodies do their jobs when there is a third party which can veto their decisions?  This House offers a forum where we can put our point of view and seek to deal with these difficult issues.</P>
        <P>I agree with Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s comments regarding <i>Foinse</i> and Foras na Gaeilge.  At the recent Council of Europe meeting, during a discussion on a report on endangered languages, we were told that Irish had moved from endangered to vulnerable.  I extolled the virtues of the actions being taken in this State to support the language.  It is disturbing to hear a North-South body charged with the development of the language saying it will not support an Irish language newspaper.  These are the issues we must address.  I recognise it is difficult to frame a debate on these matters but it must be done so we can tackle what are serious issues both for people living in Border areas and for the island as a whole.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I strongly support the amendment to the Order of Business proposed by Senator Twomey.  I agree with the points raised by Senators O&rsquo;Toole and Keaveney.  I have supported Senator O&rsquo;Toole on this issue before in the House, on which occasion the Leader gave an indication he was willing to proceed along the lines proposed.  There is a role for this House to fulfil in this regard.  As the Senator said, there is no democratic scrutiny of what is <Col N="1005"/>happening in these North-South bodies and no report to this or the other House.  I ask the Leader to revisit this issue.</P>
        <P>I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, for his visit last week to Killarney House despite everything else that is going on.  The Minister of State has responsibility at the Department of Finance for the Office of Public Works and also has responsibilities at the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism.  He is not Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  Killarney House, like Muckross House, is a very important part of our built heritage.  Unfortunately, some years ago, there was a Government decision to remove these fine buildings from the aegis of the Office of the Public Works and place them under the remit of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  The National Parks and Wildlife Service may know much about wildlife, or the wild side of life, but I am concerned about its level of knowledge of our built heritage.  This matter is crying out for redress.  I was pleased that the Office of Public Works was called in by the National Parks and Wildlife Service to examine what can be done to shore the situation.  I am glad the Minister of State saw for himself the appalling deterioration of Killarney House.  However, I am very worried about the ability to follow through on this.  There is no concrete plan in place.  I ask the Leader to do what he can to address this situation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Leader arrange a pre-legislative debate on the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, with the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan?  This body should be called the Private Asset Management Agency because none of the assets concerned is in the State.  This House should have a role in this matter.  It is one of the most important decisions ever made by the State and there are merits and demerits to the proposal.  Why should 83 Fianna F&aacute;il councillors lose their jobs because of a banking crisis?  They are not responsible for the situation at Anglo Irish Bank.</P>

	<P>The decision yesterday by the Minister for Defence to give the order for food for the Army to two Ulster companies is interesting.  One of them, which obtained the order for eggs for the Army for the coming year, is based in County Monaghan.  The other, which obtained the order for fresh poultry, worth &euro;350,000, is in County Down.  This is a reminder that we are one country in this area and it is not a question of North versus South.  It seems to me that the other Minister who asked us some time ago to do our patriotic duty by shopping south of the Border was acting in a partitionist manner.  It is probably out of the hands of the Department of Defence to do anything other than award the contract to the company offering the best value.  If the best value is north of the Border, it is up to businesses in the South to reduce their prices in order to be competitive.  There has not been nearly enough recognition of the need to do so.  I ask the Leader to draw the Minister&rsquo;s attention to this issue so that action can be taken to address it.</P>
        <P>Mr. Willie Walsh, the chief executive officer of British Airways, announced yesterday that he will not accept the bonus to which he is entitled because he wishes to set an example to his employees and to indicate his willingness to make the businesses successful.  That is a standard of behaviour to which we in this State should look.  Those who encourage others to accept pay cuts should do so themselves.  We should have a guarantee that this will be done.</P>
        <P>I heard with interest about a conference taking place next week in the United States.  Some 100 Japanese citizens were due to attend that conference but were obliged to cancel because their country&rsquo;s Government has put in place a seven-day quarantine in respect of anyone visiting the United States.  I understand that later today the World Health Organisation may upgrade its alert in respect of swine flu &mdash; the H1N1 virus &mdash; to level 6.  This should act as a reminder to us to keep our eyes on the ball with regard to a possible pandemic.  The problem has not gone away and we must continue to monitor events.</P>
      
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>I call on the Leader to demand that the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, come before the House as a matter of urgency to inform Members what the HSE intends to do with regard to the number of people in this country who die as a <Col N="1007"/>result of suicide each year.  Yesterday, the Sub-Committee on the High Level of Suicide in Ireland launched a report on evaluating what has happened in respect of the recommendations contained in a suicide prevention document published three years ago.  I am Vice Chairman of the sub-committee, on which Senator Phil Prendergast also serves.  It is a small sub-committee with a membership of just four.</P>
        <P>The findings in the report of the sub-committee are frightening.  Very few of the 33 recommendations contained in the document published three years ago have been implemented.  What in God&rsquo;s name is going on?  Each year, more people in this country die as a result of suicide than are killed in road accidents.  However, this matter has not registered on the political radar.  At least six and a half times more money is invested in road safety initiatives than is invested in suicide prevention.  A major reason for this is the stigma that still attaches in respect of mental illness, depression and those who may feel suicidal.</P>
        <P>I could discuss this matter for an hour but I will cut to the chase.  I demand that the Minister for Health and Children and not some Minister of State come before the House to discuss this matter.  The 2007 joint programme for Government states that the rate of suicide will be reduced by 20% by 2012.  What is the position in this regard and what are the costs involved?  What are the Government&rsquo;s plans and how will these be implemented?</P>
        <P>The 33 recommendations contained in the 2003 document have been evaluated but very few of them have been implemented.  If I could have the attention of the Cathaoirleach for a moment&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>A worrying report appears in <i>The Irish Times</i> today under the headline &ldquo;EU members fear Lisbon guarantees may reopen whole debate&rdquo;.  I presume this refers to the concern of other EU governments that the possible inclusion in the Lisbon treaty of a protocol relating to the guarantees Ireland is seeking in respect of abortion, workers&rsquo; rights, neutrality etc. may cause political problems in their jurisdictions.  What is of concern to us is that we still do not know the nature of the guarantees the Government is seeking from the EU.  It has not been made clear whether the guarantees being sought will reflect the concerns that arose during the referendum campaign, in which we all participated.</P>
        <P>It is worrying that the Government has failed to make the House aware of what is happening in respect of such a fundamental issue, namely, ratification of the Lisbon treaty.  Is it wise that the Taoiseach appears to be going it alone again in respect of the treaty?  Is there an intention to work with Opposition parties and take a bipartisan approach to ensuring that the &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; side will win the second referendum on the Lisbon treaty?  I put it to the Leader that it is important to obtain clarity on the guarantees that are being sought, particularly in view of the fact that <Col N="1008"/>we do not want a row to take place here or in the Lower House after the event.  It would be much better if we could agree on these issues before seeking assurances from Brussels.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Another report in one of this morning&rsquo;s newspapers refers to the fact that new welfare checks being introduced on foot of a clampdown on social welfare fraud will, as a result of a reduction in costs, net the Exchequer &euro;600 million.  The report in question refers to the fact that social welfare inspectors have been taking part in a series of vehicle checks with the Garda in<?oasys _jy ?>Border areas in order to put a stop fraud etc., which may involve people living in Northern Ireland.</P>

	<P>I would welcome the holding of an ongoing debate on the Ryan report and I ask the Leader to make suitable provision in this regard.  I welcome Pope Benedict&rsquo;s call for justice for the victims at his recent meeting with Cardinal Brady and Archbishop Martin.  I was impressed by the calls for dignity that were made at yesterday&rsquo;s march.  I was also impressed by the prayers and scripture readings of the victims.  The latter prove that they were much closer to the church than those who perpetrated any vile acts against them.</P>
        <P>I again call &mdash; I will continue to do so &mdash; for a two-day debate on the budget deficit.  In such a debate, each of the political parties could put forward costed proposals to deal with that deficit.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Senator Michael McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish again to raise a particular issue and I have informed the Leader that I will continue to raise it until action is taken.  I would appreciate it if the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, not one of his Ministers of State, would come before the House to discuss it.  With respect to junior Ministers, it is about time their senior counterparts began coming before the House to take debates.</P>
        <P>A survey carried out by the Irish Mortgage Corporation indicates that one in five holders of variable rate mortgages are saving in the region of &euro;500 on their repayments.  This is of little consolation to the one in three holders of fixed rate mortgages.  Some of the latter are locked into agreements under which they are obliged to pay in excess of 5% in interest.  The ECB&rsquo;s rate has been dropping since September last and now stands at 1%.  Many people who entered into fixed rate agreements did so on the basis of the good mortgage and financial advice <Col N="1009"/>available to them.  The forecast at the time was that interest rates would rise.  As a result, the people to whom I refer are locked into fixed rate mortgages and, as stated, are paying interest at 5%.</P>
        <P>The penalties for extricating oneself from a fixed rate agreement are massive and do not make it worthwhile to do so.  Compliant taxpayers, through the actions of the Government, have recapitalised and bailed out the banks.  It would, therefore, be reasonable to expect a small element of <i>quid pro quo</i> from the banks, which should allow people to negotiate their way out of fixed rate mortgage agreements.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, must take the lead on this issue.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>

	<P>Yes, most certainly.  I look forward to again outlining our proposals.  I am sure we are at one on Senator McCarthy&rsquo;s point regarding fixed rate mortgages and I understand the Minister intends to bring forward some proposals in that regard.  I look forward to hearing the latter.</P>
        <P>I join Senator Alex White in requesting a debate on the future of Dublin.  As someone from the west, I acknowledge it is important for Dublin to be a vibrant, coherent and cohesive capital city.  However, there is also a need for balanced regional development.  In that context, I again request a debate on the national spatial strategy and the lack of progress relating thereto.  When circumstances suit, announcements are made in line with the national spatial strategy, but when they do not suit, such announcements are not made.  This matter must be addressed.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I refer to the progress in the context of the north west and equitably accessible services or the lack of progress of the national cancer control programme.  One sees the disarray when the management of University College Hospital, Galway says it is in no position to act as a centre of excellence.  Why would people of the north west, including Sligo, Letterkenny and elsewhere, want services to be directed from there when it is not in the best interest of patients of that area?  General practitioners in that region and the medical body of the general hospitals stated <i>ad nauseam</i> that to co-operate with the proposals of the Professor, whose name cannot be mentioned, would not be in the best interests of the patients.  We require an adjustment to what is a good policy.  There is nothing more honourable than to adjust a good policy to make it better.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Has the Leader noticed a bit of a whiff or a pong around the place?  I think there is a stink and it comes from the deal done in the aftermath of the abuse allegations.  It is an extraordinary deal, prepared by a firm of solicitors acting on behalf of the religious, and it was not subjected to the advice of the Attorney General or the Department of Finance.  It was signed off by Dr. Michael Woods, on behalf of the Government two days before the election.  In light of the fact that 90% of the financial smack administered was diverted from the guilty to the taxpayers of Ireland, it seems as if Dr. Woods was deliberately or inadvertently acting on behalf of the church rather than the taxpayers.  There is a track record of this.  In 1987 the abortion referendum was delivered by Dr. Woods two days before the election.</P>
        <P>There were suggestions on the radio that this deal was a secret handshake deal, and it was described by a senior politician in the other House as such.  We all know what that means.  There were references in this House to various eminent people being members of groups such as the Knights of Saint Columbanus and Opus Dei.  They may well be members but the public is entitled to know.  I am including on the Order Paper a motion that membership of groups <Col N="1010"/>such as these would be a matter that would be required to be disclosed to the Standards in Public Office Commission.  People are entitled to know what pressures are brought to bear by these extra-parliamentary agencies on people who are supposed to be acting in the interests of the Irish people.</P>
        <P>I deplore the fact that our business starts with a prayer.  I find it offensive and I say that as a practising Christian who goes to church every Sunday.  It is a rigamarole, it means nothing and we should be alert to the fact that there are atheists, agnostics, Jews and Muslims.  It makes a mockery of the whole thing to invoke Jesus Christ as the source of our doings here.  It is not that I have no faith but it is offensive politically.</P>

It has always been accessible to all people.  It is important to remember that in the current debate on <i>Foinse</i>.  I hope it can get the funding and support it requests.

        <P>I join Senator Mary White in praising the report of the Sub-Committee on the High Level of Suicide in Ireland.  It is extraordinary.  I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Health and Children to the Chamber for an urgent debate on mental health, especially with regard to suicide.  It is unacceptable that in Ireland suicide is four times more common in men than in women and, more importantly, men aged under 35 years of age account for 40% of all suicide deaths.  That statistic should not be left on the page of a report; we must act upon it.  A Vision for Change was promulgated as being the next big thing.  What has happened to it?  Are we <Col N="1011"/>taking men&rsquo;s health and mental health seriously in this country?  I do not think we are and it is time for an all-day debate on men&rsquo;s health and mental health.</P>
        <P>Will the Leader invite the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Martin, to the House for a debate on the Lisbon treaty?  It is important that the nation and Members prepare for the Lisbon referendum.  The ratification of the Lisbon treaty will be the next big electoral test.  More importantly, it will determine our future role in Europe.  We cannot be the peripheral nation on the edge of Europe by having the treaty defeated.  We must have a debate on it, on the guarantees, and on the changes being made to the treaty.  That must take place now so that we can move this country to the heart of Europe.</P>

	<P>I support the call for a debate on Dublin.  I congratulate the city manager and his team in Dublin City Council on the work done in the development of our capital over recent years.  A number of serious issues and challenges face the city.  Some work has been done on the 2030 vision project and we must give credit to those involved.  One of the big issues facing the capital is the development of the port and whether the development should be in the area just outside the city in Bremore, which has much public support and which would protect the amenities in Dublin Bay.  We will see the outcome of the process.</P>
        <P>A new political office that is likely to hold serious influence and a large budget is that of the directly elected mayor of the city.  We should have an open debate on this to ensure the public knows the consequences of the development of the office and its impact.</P>
        <P>Will the Leader arrange a briefing on the co-ordination between the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Prison Service, especially on the serving of warrants?  I raise this in light of the horrific case before Mr. Justice Birmingham yesterday, involving Michael Murphy also known as Michael Barrett, where there was a delay in processing a European warrant for a person with a litany of serious convictions for rape and manslaughter and who went on to carry out an horrific offence in a Dublin hotel.  Will the Leader arrange for an appropriate briefing on the process involved in the serving of these warrants and why in this instance was there such a delay?</P>

	<P>Immediately after the Order of Business we are to take Committee and Remaining Stages of the Aviation (Preclearance) Bill.  Unfortunately, no time has been provided between Committee and Report Stages for this Bill.  Many Senators know this is a very important space between Committee and Report Stages, which provides the opportunity for the Minister and officials to reflect on some of the amendments and arguments put before them.</P>
        <P>We have some very important amendments and perhaps I am pre-empting the decision of the Minister and his officials.  Perhaps he will accept all our amendments, although experience here would suggest otherwise.  The response from the Leader might be that we cannot delay Report Stage until next week because the Bill is due in the D&aacute;il at that time.  I suspect the Bill is due in the D&aacute;il next week because it can be taken at that time; if we required an additional hour next Tuesday, it would not be the end of the world in terms of timing.  There is no urgency in that regard.  I propose an amendment to the Order of Business today where we would only take Committee Stage and have Report Stage next week.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LarryButler"><NameTxt>Senator Larry Butler</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to deal with a matter which we are all concerned about in this House, namely fixed rate mortgages.  I draw the Leader&rsquo;s attention to the importance of the Minister for Finance coming before the House on this matter, and I have a proposal on how the matter could be dealt with.  In the long term, this will create a major problem for mortgage holders in the country, who are at an all-time low now.  There is an opportunity for both the Minister and the banks to facilitate mortgage holders being fixed in at a moderate rate for five years.</P><Col N="1012"/>
        <P>This would support mortgage holders five years down the road and stop any further problems for them.  I propose that the Minister look at having a small break facility in mortgages.  The cost of such a break should be reduced and instead of any money changing hands, it should be added to people&rsquo;s mortgages over the period.  This would be a way in which we could reduce our commitment to borrowings on behalf of the lender.  I suggest the Leader consider this matter.  I am getting further details on it and it is important we act on it now.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>I raise the request by the HSE for &euro;15 million in cuts at the University College Hospital in Galway.  Yesterday some other Senators raised the review and downgrading of services in the south but there appears to be a continuing trend around the country.  How can the people who are sick and vulnerable have confidence in centres of excellence which are consistently downgraded?</P>
        <P>It was quite extraordinary to see the manager, Ms Brigid Howley, stating this morning that she would not be able to run the centre of excellence in Galway as she has already made &euro;9 million in cuts and is now expected to make a further cut of &euro;15 million.  That will lead to the loss of 126 jobs.  We depend on services like this in the midlands as we have lost services in Mullingar.  How can people have faith and be reassured when they are sick if there is a consistent downgrading of services?</P>
        <P>I ask the Cathaoirleach to extend a vote of congratulations to Westmeath County Council today as the official opening is taking place of a brand new flagship county building.  I compliment the council led by Fine Gael and Labour, the county manager and the executive for their foresight and wish them well.  I hope it will be a centre for great work in future.</P>

      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I support calls made by other colleagues for a debate on some issues arising from the Ryan report.  I found it incredibly moving yesterday to stand outside Leinster House with the many survivors and victims of abuse present, and to hear the names of over 200 Catholic-run institutions being read out while people stood in silence.  Many were very emotional as the names of the institution in which they had been held were read out.  It was a particularly poignant solidarity march and it is important we acknowledge that.</P>
        <P>It is interesting that the march occurred on the same day that we heard revelations on RTE about the obstructionism and dismissal of allegations of abuse by the church authorities at the time the negotiations were conducted in 2002.  It would be irresponsible of us not to debate the bigger issues arising from the Ryan report.  As my colleague Senator Norris stated, first among these must be the way in which the indemnity agreement was conducted in 2002, and particularly the role of Deputy Michael Woods in conducting it.  Serious questions must be asked about that.</P>
        <P>There are other questions.  There was a great deal of abuse in institutions not covered by the agreement, such as the Magdalene institutions mentioned by others and national schools where children were not resident but where we know abuse was carried out.  We must look at the extension of the redress scheme to those institutions and the lack of outside regulation of residential institutions in which children and adults with disabilities are still being held today.  There was an excellent article by Ms Deirdre Carroll of Inclusion Ireland in yesterday&rsquo;s <i>The Irish Times</i> which highlighted the absence of regulation as to the conditions in which children and adults with disabilities are held.</P>
        <P>As Senator Alex White indicated, there are the important issues of governance of schools and general children&rsquo;s rights, which arise from any consideration of the Ryan report.  It is not <Col N="1013"/>accurate to say, as Catholic bishops appeared to last night, that these matters are just in the past.  We must consider how our schools are currently being managed and whether we are respecting children&rsquo;s rights fully in our education and welfare systems.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>I join with my colleagues in support of a debate on the broader aspects of the Ryan report.  The need for this is underscored in documents which appear in many of today&rsquo;s newspapers regarding reports given by local health area managers to the HSE on the quality of child protection measures within their own areas.  The quotes from some of these reports underscore the need for this debate.</P>
        <P>Such quotes refer to dangerous waiting lists for children in need of care, serious breaches of regulation, staff being thin on the ground and a lack of family support services.  For example, they refer to Cork and indicate that the list of cases which the managers have is sufficiently high as to make them unmanageable.  This emphasises the point that, unfortunately, the dilemmas and difficulties &mdash; to use mild language &mdash; which existed in the past are still there.</P>
        <P>What is the point in having a Minister of State with responsibility for children if on a day when the Lower House is debating the Ryan report, we find people within the HSE indicating they do not have the staff or ability to cope with children in difficulty today?  Surely this merits an urgent debate.</P>
        <P>I support calls from some of my colleagues for a debate on the Lisbon treaty and the guarantees which have been made in that regard.  I spent time at the end of last year working with colleagues in the Oireachtas on a report on Ireland&rsquo;s future in Europe.  The main recommendation made with regard to the need for guarantees was a strengthening of the role of the Oireachtas in European affairs.  Today we find a front page article in the <i>The Irish Times</i> stating the negotiations on guarantees may not be as smooth as first believed.  Why is this happening?  At 11.45 a.m. the Minister for Foreign Affairs will brief an Oireachtas committee on how the negotiations are going.  The only conclusion I can draw from that is the last thing we want to happen is for the Oireachtas to find out before members of the public do.  Otherwise, why would this appear in a newspaper article this morning?</P>
        <P>I support Senator Ryan&rsquo;s amendment to the Order of Business regarding the Aviation (Preclearance) Bill.  He is correct that this debate could be phased over a week and allow us to do better work on this important legislation.</P>

	<P>Senators Twomey, O&rsquo;Toole, Alex White, Regan, Hanafin, Norris, Buttimer, Bacik and Donohoe expressed their concerns regarding the Lisbon treaty referendum.  There will of course be an all-party approach.  I agree with Senator Regan on that.  Everything that can be done must be done to make it a successful referendum.  I know it will be done.  We are all agreed Ireland&rsquo;s future is in Europe, as Senator Donohoe stated.  I commend the great work done by the Sub-committee on Ireland&rsquo;s Future in the European Union under his stewardship.  Any time needed in the House will be granted.  I will request the Minister for Foreign Affairs to attend the House in this session to allow for a lengthy debate on the Lisbon treaty.  It would allow Members to express their views on how to assist the Government in the forthcoming referendum.</P>

	<P>Members&rsquo; contributions were outstanding.  I congratulated all those who made a contribution.  I accept there is quite a number of other Senators who want to make a contribution on the serious findings of the report.  As Senator O&rsquo;Toole said, I have no diffi<Col N="1014"/>culty in recalling the House, even during the holidays, to debate the serious matters that will be brought to our attention over the coming months.</P>
        <P>I intend for the House to revisit the Ryan report before the end of this session to accommodate those Senators who did not have an opportunity to contribute in the last debate.  I will return to Senator Alex White on his queries concerning the Residential Institutions Redress Board as I am still awaiting a response from the Minister&rsquo;s office.</P>
        <P>Senators O&rsquo;Toole, Keaveney, &Oacute; Murch&uacute; expressed disappointment at the lack of funding for the only remaining Irish-language newspaper published in the island of Ireland.  The House has complimented TG4 to no end on the amount of good work it has done for the Irish language.  Its achievements are mind-boggling.  Media penetration breaks down at 70% for television, 20% for radio and, unfortunately, 10% for the printed media.  TG4 has filled the void in the 70% media penetration for the Irish language.  It has also done more than just cover the Irish language, being in my opinion, the best Irish television station available.  We in rural Ireland can identify more with TG4&rsquo;s programming and coverage of the various aspects of Irish life with which we were brought up.  Cathal Goan, now the director general of RTE, can take a bow for his work in the creation and putting in place of TG4.  I wish those deliberating on the funding for <i>Foinse</i> well in these difficult times.  As it is a cross-Border publication and an integral part of our whole being, I hope the deliberations can be brought to a successful conclusion.</P>
        <P>Senators O&rsquo;Toole, Keaveney and Coghlan called for debates on North-South bodies and cross-Border funded projects.  In their submissions on Seanad reform, all parties have called for this to be an important part of a monthly debate in the House.  Such debates would allow us to assist our fellow parliamentarians in Stormont in their deliberations on cross-Border projects and activities and the achievements, North and South.</P>
        <P>Senators Alex White, MacSharry and Callely called for a debate on a Dublin action plan for the next ten years and the 2030 vision for Dublin.  Senator MacSharry pointed out that development in the regions should be part of this debate.  I will discuss this with the leaders of the groups at our meeting next Tuesday, along with the Seanad being the conduit for the local authorities, Government agencies and Departments on this matter.</P>
        <P>Senator Coghlan, as always, brought to the House&rsquo;s attention his great concerns regarding his native town of Killarney and Killarney House.  I will pass his strong views on to the Minister.</P>
        <P>Senator Leyden called for a debate with the Minister for Finance on pre-legislative changes needed for the setting up of LAMA.</P>

        <P>Senator Quinn highlighted the successful two companies which won the tenders for food contracts for the Department of Defence.  It is good to see competition between North and South.  It is the only way we will get to grips with competitiveness, as has been pointed out repeatedly in the House.  I wish these companies well and it is an eye-opener for what we have to do in the South to stay competitive.  Wages are a serious challenge and I have no doubt that wages played an important factor in the winning tenders.</P>
        <P>Senator Quinn also pointed out the good example set by Willie Walsh, leading by example by not taking his bonus at British Airways.  I know everyone will have to do this because the money will not be there for bonuses.  The private sector is doing it and I know an bord snip <Col N="1015"/>nua will have to seriously deliberate on this for our consideration regarding the challenges in the other areas that have to be addressed.</P>
        <P>Senator Quinn also highlighted the WHO has taken the swine flu alert to level 6.  We will have an update on this, every week if necessary, from the Minister for Health and Children.  I look forward to hearing the views of Senator Twomey and other Members with experience in medical care on how to bring the matter to the attention of the public.</P>
        <P>Senators Mary White and Buttimer called for the Minister for Health and Children to debate the report on suicide published yesterday by the Oireachtas health sub-committee on suicide levels.  Up to 500 lives are lost every year through suicide.  The Seanad will do everything it can in tackling this challenge and I have no problem having a debate on the matter.</P>
        <P>Senator Regan requested the Minister for Social and Family Affairs attend a debate on social welfare fraud.  He outlined his experience in this matter and pointed out the many savings being made in tackling it.</P>
        <P>Senators Hanafin and MacSharry again called for a two-day debate on costed proposals from all parties regarding their views on our direction as a Government, an economy and a nation for the next three years.  I will discuss this proposal with the leaders of the groups at our meeting next Tuesday and I have no difficulty in supporting this call.</P>
        <P>As for the matters outlined to the House this morning by Senators McCarthy and MacSharry, I will deal with them and will respond to them next Tuesday.  Senators Buttimer, McCarthy and others outlined their serious concerns regarding fixed rated mortgages.  I understand this affects approximately 20% of mortgage holders.  There is a serious gap at present and I hope the Minister will address this matter when he comes before the House.  Senator Butler also outlined a proposal and he should elaborate further on his suggestion as to how the issue can be addressed in the coming weeks.</P>
        <P>Senator MacSharry again called for a debate on the HSE in the presence of the Minister regarding cancer services in the north west and on the adjustment to be made in services in that part of the country.  I agreed to this and a debate took place, but I have no difficulty in such a debate taking place once again.</P>
        <P>Senator Callely sought a briefing in respect of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the possession of European warrants, and referred to the bitter experience about which all Members read in the newspapers this morning.  I certainly will contact the Garda Commissioner in this regard to ascertain what is the up-to-date position on the serving of such warrants.</P>
        <P>Senator Ryan expressed his concern regarding taking all Stages of the Aviation (Preclearance) Bill today.  If it is helpful to the Senator, Members can take a sos between Committee and Report Stages to allow him, as is usual, to table whatever amendments are necessary.  I always have tried to facilitate every political party&rsquo;s tabling of amendments during the passage of Bills.  As this Bill was initiated in this House, I hope to get agreement with the spokespersons on this portfolio this morning and we can have a short sos between Stages.  If Members request that I so do, I will propose an amendment to the Order of Business at a later stage to allow this to happen.</P>
        <P>Senator McFadden raised the issue of HSE services in the context of the centre of excellence in Galway and the proposed shortfall in funding.  Everyone simply must make the best of their budgets and work as hard as they can to give the best possible services.  We can only wish them all well in this regard.</P>
        <P>Senator McFadden requested that congratulations be extended to all past and present members of Westmeath County Council on the opening of the new council offices today.  I am pleased to have been a member of the council before the Senator became a member.  However, <Col N="1016"/>her father was a member and joined us on the Fianna F&aacute;il-led council that initiated this wonderful project.  Moreover, a Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government supplied the funding and I am delighted it is happening today&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>Having considered further the provisions of sections 3 and 5 of the Bill, I have decided to propose to amend the Bill to create the new subsections (3) and (4) to section 3.  That is what this amendment is about.  The proposed subsection 3(3) provides that in proceedings regarding a failure to make an accurate written declaration of all goods required to be declared, it shall be a good defence to show that the traveller had reasonable grounds for believing the declaration was duly made in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 3(1)(<i>b</i>).  This is to make provision for persons making an honest mistake in filling out the declaration.  It is a further protection for the individual.  The proposed subsection 3(4) would qualify the provisions of subsection 3(2), which creates an offence in respect of the making of an inaccurate written declaration.  The proposal is that in <Col N="1018"/>situations where the traveller would otherwise be subject to the administrative penalty on post-clearance where the traveller agrees to pay the sum requested as a precondition of the grant of preclearance, as in subsection (5)(<i>a</i>), proceedings would not be entered into against that traveller.  The purpose of the amendment is to ensure the traveller is not penalised twice for the same action.  Both of those provisions are added protections for the traveller.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 7, subsection (2), between lines 21 and 22, to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;(<i>b</i>) not require the person to remove any garment other than an outer garment save in the presence of and subject to the directions of an Irish law enforcement officer,&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This amendment is in the section describing the functions of preclearance officers, who are officials from the US side.  We propose that instead of including the phrase proposed in paragraph (<i>b</i>), &ldquo;have due respect for the person being searched&rdquo;, we should include the phrase &ldquo;not require the person to remove any garment other than an outer garment save in the presence of and subject to the directions of an Irish law enforcement officer&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>The Bill, as drafted, would allow US personnel to strip search Irish citizens on Irish soil without supervision or control.  The sole safeguard is the meaningless one that the search must show &ldquo;due respect for the person being searched&rdquo;.  The Minister and his officials may believe this is adequate but the Labour Party does not believe so.  We need an express prohibition on strip searching, except in the presence of an Irish law enforcement officer.  That is a very reasonable requirement to include in the legislation and I ask the Minister to accept it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>From my understanding of the Bill, I do not believe it confers the capacity on a preclearance officer to engage in strip searching, as Senator Ryan described.  That said, his amendment is a good idea because it addresses our concerns, raised on Second Stage, regarding the fact that the powers of the preclearance officer will be quite extensive.  Those powers will be wielded under the terms of what is in effect diplomatic immunity.  My understanding of the thrust of Senator Ryan&rsquo;s amendment is that it will ensure the power of the preclearance officer can only be wielded in the presence of an official of the Irish State.  The amendment will improve the operation of the Bill on the ground and I support it for that reason.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand the concern behind amendments Nos. 3 and 4 but amendment No. 3 would appear to do the opposite to what the Senators intend.  The intent of the legislation is that there be limited searching powers for preclearance officers and provision in this regard is included in the Bill.  The proposed amendments relate to the functions of preclearance officers, specifically in regard to the conduct of searches subject to the consent of the traveller.  I refer to paragraph 5(1)(<i>d</i>).  What the Senators propose could have the effect of <Col N="1019"/>broadening the range of search powers envisaged for preclearance officers under the agreement itself.  The range of search powers afforded to the Irish law enforcement officers under section 6(1) is intentionally broader than those powers afforded to the preclearance officer.  Therefore, the proposed amendments do not serve any useful purpose.  We are making a distinction.</P>
        <P>Senators should note that it is not intended, nor is it provided for in the Bill, that the US preclearance officers would have the power to strip search or anything else.  If we accepted amendment No. 3, there would be a risk that the preclearance officers would actually interpret the legislation as affording them wider search powers than are now intended.  I know that is not the intention of Senator Ryan.  In plain English, the intent is that the preclearance officers would be able to conduct a search, perhaps by removing outer garments, but that if anything further had to happen, it would have to be in the presence of an Irish law officer, a garda.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Senator Brendan Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not accept the Minister&rsquo;s view on that.  We are just asking that there be a specific requirement stating, &ldquo;other than an outer garment save in the presence of and subject to the directions of an Irish law enforcement officer&rdquo;.  I do not see the downside of including this.  I do not understand the Minister&rsquo;s view that this provision, rather than amendment No. 4, would give the US side greater powers.  All we are asking is that strip searching be precluded specifically.</P>
        <P>With regard to amendment No. 4, the protection we require pertains to the functions of preclearance officers.  The wording associated with the functions of Irish law enforcement officers is not used in respect of the functions of preclearance officers.  All we are asking is that there be consistency in terms of the requirements in this regard in the relevant sections.</P></Speaker>

        <P LI="1" el="5">In page 8, subsection (1), lines 17 to 49 and in page 9, lines 1 and 2, to delete paragraph (<i>b</i>) and substitute the following:</P>
        <P LI="2" el="5">&ldquo;(<i>b</i>) any person (whether or not a traveller) is in possession of any goods (including a weapon) the possession of, or the export of which, is controlled or prohibited in the State, or otherwise poses a threat to the safety of officers or other persons in the preclearance area, may, without warrant&mdash;</P>

        <P LI="5" el="5">(A) the officer conducting a search of a person being detained shall ensure, so far as practicable, that the person understands the reason for the search and that it is conducted with due respect for the person being searched,</P>
        <P LI="5" el="5">(B) a person being detained shall not be searched by an officer or person of the opposite sex, and</P>
        <P LI="4" el="5">(II) where a search of a person being detained involves removal of clothing, other than headgear or a coat, jacket, glove or similar article of clothing, no officer or person of the opposite sex shall be present, unless either that person is a medical practitioner <Col N="1021"/>designated by the officer conducting the search, or the officer considers that the presence of that person is necessary for the protection of the person carrying out the search, or is otherwise expedient, and</P>
        <P LI="3" el="5">(ii) examine (by opening or otherwise), seize and detain anything found in the course of a search under this section that appears to him or her to be something that might be required as evidence in proceedings for an offence.&rdquo;.</P>
      
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The first purpose of the Government&rsquo;s amendment No. 6 is to correctly align the words &ldquo;may without warrant&rdquo; in line 21 of page 8 so that there is no doubt that they refer to the entirety of subsection (1) as intended.  That is a technical change.</P>
        <P>There is a further proposed change at paragraph (1)(B)(II) clarifying the reference to a designated medical practitioner.  The amendment specifies that the medical practitioner would be designated by the officer conducting the search.  As the section stands it is unclear as to who would make that designation.</P>
        <P>The Labour Party&rsquo;s amendment No. 7 refers to the functions of Irish law enforcement officers and specifically the range of search powers to be afforded under the relevant section of the Bill, which is section 6.  The specific powers arise where a person is reasonably suspected of making a false declaration of goods or of being in possession of controlled or prohibited goods in the State, or is reasonably suspected of otherwise posing a threat to a person in the preclearance area.  It is in those circumstances the specific powers arise.  In those circumstances an Irish law enforcement officer may search the person without warrant and detain the person for such time as is reasonably necessary to carry out the search subject to certain conditions.  Where a search of a person being detained involves the removal of clothing other than the general outer garments, no officer or person of the opposite sex shall be present unless either that person is a medical practitioner or the officer considers the presence of that person is necessary for the protection of the person carrying out the search or is otherwise expedient.</P>
        <P>Senator Ryan proposes that this final phrase be deleted but the Department&rsquo;s legal advice is that the phrase should be retained.  Its purpose is to provide the appropriate level of protection for the individual in certain circumstances, for example, where the person being searched is a minor.  It is necessary to retain the wording &ldquo;or is otherwise expedient&rdquo; for the protection of a minor or in certain other circumstances.</P>
        <P>I cannot accept amendment No. 7 on the basis that acceptance of it would remove a protection for a minor.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Senator Brendan Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The reference to &ldquo;expedient&rdquo; in the phrase &ldquo;or is otherwise expedient&rdquo; renders the protection meaningless.  Does it not undermine the right to be searched in the presence of the other sex?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>No, it does not.  I understand the Senator&rsquo;s concern, but the intent in the legislation, as is clearly stated, is that this cannot happen with a person of the other sex present except where it is otherwise expedient.  The inclusion of the words &ldquo;otherwise expedient&rdquo; does not remove the previous obligation, it just adds a protection for people such as minors.

        <P FLI="0">We propose the inclusion of the above wording.  The power to order the removal of a preclearance officer exists only where the officer has abused his position, as outlined in the section.

	<P>This amendment arises under section 13, which provides for privileges and immunities for citizens of the USA who are assigned to carry out preclearance functions.  Section 13(4) provides that the Minister may, after consultation with the US, require the departure from the State of a preclearance officer in certain circumstances, which are outlined.  The provision in the Bill reflects the relevant articles of the intergovernmental agreement to which both parties are bound and, as such, there is no necessity to refer to any other power of a Minister or Government.  We have an international agreement on this.  The wording of the amendment does not remove any of the intent of either the agreement or the legislation and is not objectionable to me.  I can accept this amendment as it does not raise a legal difficulty.</P>

The Bill would introduce a lower sentence of five years for such assaults, which would be undesirable.

	<P>I thank the Senator for his amendment.  He was correct in stating there is already a provision under existing legislation with regard to this issue.  The Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994 outlines the penalties for the offence of assaulting a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which carries a higher penalty on indictment than that outlined in this Bill.

    <Title>Elections of June 2009: Statements. </Title>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>I have been asked by the Taoiseach to address this House today on the recent elections.  There has been much debate in both Chambers on last week&rsquo;s local and European elections and by-elections.  No one can deny the Opposition&rsquo;s performances in the recent elections, and I congratulate the Opposition on the results.  The results were very disappointing for my party and indeed for my own family.  However, these were local and European elections, with two by-elections, and from this Government&rsquo;s perspective, the position is very simple.  National issues are decided at a general election and the next general election is not due until sometime around the summer of 2012.  Until then, the Government must continue to lead as we chart our way back to economic renewal.</P>
        <P>On the major issue of creating financial stability as a prerequisite for economic growth and ensuring our public finances are brought into balance over the period until 2013, external observers are commenting favourably on the direction of Government policy.  This Government has put the country&rsquo;s long-term prospects above politics and we are doing what is necessary to get the country back on track.  Perhaps the Government parties are paying the price for those hard decisions.</P>
        <P>It is a feature of democracies across the world that incumbent governments suffer badly in mid-term elections.  Certainly in this country, incumbent governments suffered bad results in local elections in 2004, 1991 and 1985, yet there was no general election as a result.  Under our Constitution, the Government and the Taoiseach are elected by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  They are not <Col N="1024"/>elected by county councils or members of the European Parliament.  The D&aacute;il gave a resounding vote of confidence to the Taoiseach just last night, clearly stating its commitment to this Government and this Taoiseach.</P>
        <P>This Government, along with the Green Party, is solid and cohesive and, as the Taoiseach has said, we are in it together for the long haul.  I have an excellent working relationship with the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, as does the Taoiseach, and I look forward to continuing to work with him and his colleagues as this Government does its utmost to bring growth and jobs back to Ireland.  The business of government continues and important legislation continues.  The Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2008, which began life here in the Seanad, passed Committee Stage this week and I hope it will return to this House before the summer.</P>
        <P>Our country now needs its elected representatives to focus on the business of government in the worst economic downturn in 70 years.  It does not need an election campaign which would have a hugely negative effect on the economy at a time when we require stability more than ever.  We must put our shoulders to the wheel.</P>
        <P>Contrary to some commentary, this Government is not isolated from the views of the public.  We are very much aware of the direct effect of the current recession on families and individuals across the State.  We see every day the effect of job losses on our friends and neighbours.  The hard reality this year is that employment will decrease for the first time in many years in terms of total numbers employed, but it is also important to say that, in historic terms, many more people are working now compared with five, ten or 15 years ago.  Some 1.8 million people are working as we speak because of the level of economic activity we are generating, even in these recessionary times.</P>
        <P>The numbers on the live register are clearly a matter for concern but the only way we can return jobs to our economy is by restoring growth.  The decisions we take now we do not take lightly; we take them with the long-term good of the State in mind.  The electorate is clearly angry with the Government and within Government we hear and understand that anger.</P>
        <P>This recession has had a range of effects across society and the recession stems from a range of reasons.  This Government accepts that our current difficulties are not all down to international factors, although clearly the international economy has a huge impact on a small open economy such as ours.</P>
        <P>As Minister of State with responsibility for housing, I know as well as anyone that property development and, in particular, the housing market, have been important factors in Ireland&rsquo;s economic performance over the past decade and a half.  Successive years of record housing output, strong demand for home ownership through record employment and strong demographic fundamentals, all supported by a steady availability of credit, allowed many thousands of households to realise their home ownership ambitions.  This Government accepts that we should have done more to contain the housing market which was fuelled by low interest rates and the easy availability of credit.  While the housing market has reflected the good times, it has also been an advance herald of the downturn with the signs of slowdown becoming apparent long before the onset of the global financial crisis in the second half of last year.</P>
        <P>The Irish housing market, like housing markets in all parts of the world, has experienced a sharp contraction over the past 18 months to two years.  This has been reflected in lowering levels of construction activity, easing house prices and decreasing volume of mortgage lending.  In terms of prices, the slowdown in the market for both new and second-hand houses has been under way for some time now.  At this point, prices are now back to 2005 levels.  Output last year matched the level of output in 2000.  The volume of new mortgage lending in 2008 barely <Col N="1025"/>reached half the levels seen in 2005 and 2006.  Affordability ratios have changed significantly with the national ratio now at 2003-04 levels and the Dublin ratio now back at 1996-97 levels.  Nationally, 30,000 to 40,000 fully completed units remain unsold, with many thousands more substantially complete.  A couple of years on from the start of the Towards 2016 agreement, under which 17,000 affordable housing units were to be delivered in a three-year period, local authorities have almost 4,000 unsold units on hand.  At the same time, net social housing need has climbed by more than 30% since 2005, approximately 1,000 new households each month are becoming reliant on rent supplement, and the numbers of households in receipt of mortgage interest supplement has increased by more than 100% in the past 12 months.  All in all, it is a very different proposition, a very different housing market, and a very different economy.  Most commentators point towards further house price decreases in the period ahead and for as long as wider economic sentiment remains weak, it is difficult to see a radical reversal in sentiment towards the housing market.</P>
        <P>Many sectors did well from the performance of the housing market over the last decade and a half.  However, as a key component in our economic performance generally, the housing market did more than just create wealth for a few individuals.  It also delivered wider benefits through the revenues it generated for investment in priority social, economic and environmental infrastructure throughout the country which has modernised and transformed Ireland beyond recognition.  However, those days are behind us now and there is little to be gained from trying to get them back, even if we wanted to.  We might as well try to repeal the laws of supply and demand.  The truth is that we were too reliant on residential development for too long but then experience is something one does not get until just after one needs it.</P>
        <P>There is no doubt the contraction has had severe and negative consequences for the public finances.  However, the change has not all been for the worse.  We need to embrace the opportunities presented to us to put the housing market &mdash; and I refer in this respect to all aspects of the housing market &mdash; and the structure of our wider economy on a more long-term sustainable level as we rightly welcome the very significant easing of affordability brought about by the market correction and lowering interest rates.  Equally, however, we need to be careful of over-correction.  Output of 90,000 in a year was too high.  However, given that projected sustainable demand levels point towards a required output of 50,000 to 60,000 units per annum, the level of output expected this year at 20,000 is unsustainably low over the medium term.  The great danger in over-correction is that we will simply store up future under-supply risking a repeat of the cycle of rapid price increases and affordability difficulties for first-time buyers.  There is, therefore, a fine balance to be struck but Government and the stakeholders involved now have the chance to achieve that equilibrium.</P>
        <P>As Minister of State with responsibility for housing, I believe strongly that a major starting point in that process lies in trying to match up carefully significant and growing social housing need with suitable available unsold housing units to achieve a very important alignment of social and economic objectives.  The task of restoring balance to the public finances has presented difficult decisions to the Government necessitating expenditure savings across all areas of public policy and in every Department.  It is accepted that we require flexibility and creativity and Departments are responding with fresh thinking and fresh approaches.  The same is happening in the private sector.  After all, necessity is the mother of invention.</P>
        <P>I announced in October last my intention that long-term leasing arrangements would play an increasingly prominent role in the delivery of social housing.  The further deterioration in the public finances since then and degree of readjustment required in the Government budget for this year means that role will have to be even more prominent.  However, I take heart from the fact we have at our disposal new and creative ways to respond to need that can help us do more with less.  Across Government, innovative solutions such as the long-term leasing initiative <Col N="1026"/>are being developed.  We have also seen the establishment of the National Asset Management Agency.  To strengthen the funding position of the banks and ensure the flow of credit to the real economy, the Government is conscious of the need to address the issue of impaired assets, in particular, specific asset classes currently perceived as carrying a higher than average risk in an Irish context which generally involve lending for land and property development.  Strengthening the banks&rsquo; balance sheets will considerably reduce uncertainty over bad debts and, as a consequence, ensure the flow of credit on a commercial basis to the real economy.</P>
        <P>This Government was formed on the basis of the programme for Government agreed between the coalition parties.  The Taoiseach has indicated we are now going to review the programme for Government on the basis that the whole economic world has changed.  He has also indicated he intends to include the concerns of the voters and if changes need to be made in the structures of Government or Departments to reflect the priorities of the revised programme for Government, they will be made.</P>
        <P>This Government is unwavering, we will continue to deal with the stark challenges presented to us.  We will make the hard choices.  I said earlier we are a small, open economy and, accordingly, we suffered the effects of the downturn in the international economy more quickly than other larger, more insulated economies but, equally, we will benefit more quickly from the recently reported green shoots and the expected long-term upturn in the international economy.  Led by the Taoiseach, and in partnership with our Government partners, we will stimulate growth again and lead this country out of recession.</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister of State for taking this debate.  I am disappointed the Leader failed to agree to a motion on which we could vote.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Twomey is always disappointed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>I am especially disappointed in that regard.  The Minister of State failed to admit the Government&rsquo;s mistakes in leading us into this crisis.  In 2007, when the then Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, and the current Taoiseach, Deputy Brian Cowen, were re-elected, the people were in debt to the tune of approximately &euro;100 billion, the Government debt was approximately &euro;40 billion and the deficit was running at approximately &euro;1 billion or &euro;2 billion, so the nation&rsquo;s debt was approximately &euro;140 billion.</P>
        <P>Fast forward two years when the property bubble has burst, there is an international crisis and public finances are clearly out of kilter with what is happening in Government, where do we stand?   The ordinary man and woman on the street are still in debt to the tune of approximately &euro;100 billion. Government debt is up to &euro;70 billion.  We have bailed out the banks at a cost of some &euro;10 billion.  We have purchased an array of junk bonds &mdash; essentially junk loans &mdash; for the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, which will cost between &euro;60 billion and &euro;70 billion.  In the two years since the previous general election, national debt has grown from &euro;140 billion to almost &euro;250 billion, an increase of more than &euro;100 billion.</P>
        <P>If that were the end of the story, we might be able to get the situation under control.  However, it is clear the Government needs to borrow &euro;20 billion per year to keep going for the foreseeable future.  The State is essentially bankrupt.  The situation is worse than it ever was in the 1980s.  An examination of changes in gross domestic product, GDP, make this clear.  GDP has contracted by 10% this year, which means the nation&rsquo;s debt is massive.</P>
        <P>Will the Minister of State provide information on how these debts are structured and how much it will cost to service them in the coming years?  There will be a significant impact on our ability to improve the economic situation if we are paying billions to manage debt we have <Col N="1027"/>taken on in recent years and will take on in the coming years at a time when our economy is contracting.  We must bring the situation under control quickly.</P>
        <P>The private sector is attempting to improve competitiveness by reducing its costs.  However, in the midst of the current financial crisis, day-to-day Government spending is increasing.  If this continues, we are destined to endure chronic long-term unemployment.  The failure of the Government to recognise or acknowledge that it has led us into this mess and its failure to change its policies to suit the new environment means we are destined to see the situation deteriorate.  The green shoots to which the Minister of State referred are relevant to other economies.  They will not affect our economy for the foreseeable future because we are not dealing with our problems.</P>
        <P>The question that arises after the local and European elections and by-elections is whether we need a general election.  I contend we do.  The senior Ministers in the current Government have been in power for most of the past 20 years.  They have neutered the Houses of the Oireachtas in their role as representative of the will of the people.  They have transferred all the power to themselves and have taken all the credit for every positive development in recent years.  When a Government takes that approach, it must take responsibility for failure.  The public is angry with the Government because it feels isolated and disconnected from politics.  Government Members have claimed since the weekend that they have incurred the wrath of the electorate because of the difficult decisions they had to make.  That is not the case.  They incurred the wrath of the people because they led them into this mess and seem set to prolong it into the future.</P>
        <P>The Government has effectively destroyed the economy in recent years.  In doing so, it has destroyed the future of many people.  Losing one&rsquo;s job is often a person&rsquo;s worst possible scenario.  Moreover, many such are also coping with substantial levels of personal indebtedness, thus making their quality of life even worse.  Many people are carrying large mortgages.  In County Wexford, for example, people who bought houses for &euro;250,000 or &euro;300,000 now find they are worth only &euro;150,000 to &euro;160,000, if they could manage to sell them.  Young people in this situation, who have lost their jobs or are paying increased taxes and levies, especially those working in the public service, are stuck with these properties.  There is no NAMA to bail young people out of the mess they are in.  Instead, the Government is binding them to their problems by extracting even more money from them.</P>
        <P>That is why voters throughout the commuter belt and in urban areas in particular, as well as those in County Wexford and elsewhere, expressed such anger towards the Government in the elections.  Its policies have made their homes almost worthless and damaged their standard of living.  There is no acknowledgement from the Government of the suffering endured by so many people as a consequence of the deterioration in their quality of life.  The Government talks about making difficult decisions but has yet to reach the point of accepting and apologising for its responsibility in all this.  That is why the public is so angry.</P>
        <P>Services are affected throughout the State by the reduction in Government funding.  Management at Waterford Regional Hospital has indicated it will be unable to provide cancer care services because of these cuts.  Attempts are being made to downgrade the local hospital in my constituency of Wexford, with the number of beds reduced and plans to close the accident and emergency department.  Who knows what other service reductions will be made in future?  People are suffering because of the inadequate provision of home help services and home care packages.  There will be great misery for those who require State services in the coming years.  Again, none of this has been acknowledged by the Government.</P>
        <P>Ordinary men and women believe this Government has been in power for too long.  The same people who were in power in 1997 are still wandering around Government Buildings.</P>

That is why this Government will be kicked out.</P>
        <P>The Government claims the establishment of NAMA is necessary.  It is necessary because the Government has brought us to the current financial and banking crisis.  How many billions of euro will it take to get credit flowing in the Irish credit market?  We have already paid billions of euro to Allied Irish Banks, Bank of Ireland and Anglo Irish Bank but credit is still not flowing within the market.  Anglo Irish Bank is a junk bank &mdash; complete rubbish.  The Taoiseach has claimed it would cost &euro;65 billion to let it fail at this stage.  Does he know how much it will cost to keep it going?  I predict the figure will run to &euro;40 billion or &euro;50 billion over time.</P>

	<P>There is no doubt but that the election campaign was difficult.  People were extremely angry as a result of the fact that the Government was obliged to make tough decisions.  Regardless of who might be in government, at times such as those we are experiencing, difficult decisions must be made and pain must be endured.  Fianna F&aacute;il is in government and naturally it has been blamed for what has happened.  If Fine Gael was in government, it would also be blamed for the tough decisions it might be obliged to make.  That is the reality of the situation and we must find the money from somewhere.  I do not know from where Fine Gael would produce the money required but we have put our proposals on the table in that regard.</P>
        <P>I accept that people might not like what we are doing.  If Fine Gael has a better option, it should put it forward.  However, who is to say that people would like that party any better than Fianna F&aacute;il?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government should give the people the option of deciding between the two parties.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Senator Ann Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>It all comes down to the money people have in their pockets.  I was involved in the election campaign in Dublin South and I have more experience than the Senator will ever obtain.  I can talk in clear terms and I am prepared to accept when I am wrong.  That is for sure.  Having listened to people&rsquo;s views and experienced their anger, I am aware that there is a need for us to reflect on what we have been told.  We will do so because that is the nature of our party.  Fianna F&aacute;il has been down before.  We are down now but we are not out.  Let there be no doubt about that.  When our backs are to the wall, that is the time at which people can count on us.</P>
        <P>Anyone who is aware of the history of my party will be aware that it has received kicks from time to time.  That is the nature of democracy.  I will reflect on what has happened and on what people are saying.  My party will review the programme for Government, based on what it has been told.  We will do our best to try to balance the books.</P>
        <P>Fine Gael reached rock bottom in 2002.  I congratulate it on its comeback, but no one has the right to dictate that there is only one way forward.  Fine Gael Members are entitled to put forward their views but they are not entitled to be nasty.  That is the bottom line.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Senator Ann Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>People must recognise that our economic circumstances have changed and that we are living in a different world.  We must be careful with how we shape our views in respect of the country&rsquo;s future.</P>
        <P>The nature of employment and the future of society are changing.  The world economy will dictate the kind of jobs that will be available.  We must examine our position with regard to the nature of employment.  Do people still want to operate on a nine-to-five basis?  The various Departments, particularly the Departments of Education and Science and Enterprise, Trade and Employment, will be obliged to consider how we might upskill employees and how we should deal with those making the transition from secondary school to work.  I would love to be involved in the work to be carried out in this regard.</P>
        <P>Young people are angry because they cannot obtain employment.  I am concerned about this, particularly because I was involved in the area of education and previously dealt with young people making the transition from school to work or from school to third level education.  Research must be carried out in respect of how we might shape the future of society.  We cannot base our models on those which obtained in the past whereby people pursued apprenticeships in various trades.  We must change our thinking.  I hope the Government will reflect on its programme and take into account the strong views expressed by the electorate during the campaign.</P>
        <P>I took part in the canvass in Dublin South and I spent a great deal of time talking to people on their doorsteps.  They put forward many fine ideas which I have since brought to the attention of my party.</P>
        <P>Fianna F&aacute;il had some fine young candidates who ran in the local elections.  These individuals will stand for election again because of their age and that they are vibrant and have already run the course.  They will be ready when the next local elections are held.</P>
        <P>Fianna F&aacute;il has three years to put matters right and I am confident that it will do so because it is the kind of party that reaches out to people.  I respect democracy, the decisions of the people and the performance of the Opposition.  I congratulate those in opposition on the great performance of their candidates.  I will always be gracious in that regard.  However, I do not want people to dictate to the House and state that there is only one way forward and that is their way.</P>
        <P>I hope the Departments with responsibility for creating employment and developing the education system will do what is necessary.  Modern technologies represent the way forward.  We may be obliged to consider the process of electioneering, particularly in the context of how it might be developed for the future.  Perhaps we might be obliged to move away from the old-fashioned pastime of knocking on people&rsquo;s doors.  I do not know whether it will be necessary to do so but the jury is out.  There is certainly a need for us to engage in a brainstorming exercise in respect of these matters.  I would be delighted to be involved in such an exercise.  I want to save Ireland and ensure that the people who live here have the best quality of life.  I want to make a positive contribution.  I do not wish to engage in nastiness.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State.  I am glad we are debating the results of the recent elections.  I wish to begin by congratulating all the Members of this House who contested the European and D&aacute;il by-elections.  In that context, I wish to single out my colleague, Alan Kelly, who had a spectacular victory in the Europe South constituency and who is now a Member of the European Parliament.  Irrespective of one&rsquo;s political beliefs, one must acknowledge that an election is an exercise in democracy and that the people have spoken.  Elections are difficult for candidates and their families.  In that regard, I pay tribute to those who were unsuccessful as well as those who were successful.</P><Col N="1032"/>
        <P>Senator Twomey stated that the Government is lame.  In view of the fact that he is a medical doctor, I take his comments seriously.  I am sure the Senator could spot a limp much quicker than the rest of us.</P>

	<P>People&rsquo;s frustration and anger manifested itself on Friday last.  It was a fantastic day, not least for the Labour Party but also for its Leader, Deputy Gilmore.  The Labour Party had three MEPs elected and won a record number of seats on local authorities throughout the country.</P>
        <P>Let us not forget the reason people voted against the Government.  People are literally on the edge and jobs are being lost at a terrifying rate.  For example, in February 28,000 jobs were lost.  In other words, 1,000 jobs were lost each day of that month.  There are those who are in employment who may be out of work by Christmas.  People are paying income and health levies.  There are homes in which low-paid public servants are paying these levies plus the pension levy.</P>
        <P>It is dishonest of the Government to use the term &ldquo;pension levy&rdquo;.  After the budget last year, I stated that the pension levy is a tax.  The only reason it is referred to as a levy is that it is not possible to introduce taxes between budgets.  There are part-time firefighters employed by the western division of Cork County Council who are paying a pension levy but who will never receive a pension.  There are cleaners who work in schools in my area and, I am sure, in those represented by Members on the Government benches who are paying the pension levy.  These people are paying money into a scheme which does not exist and are being levied in respect of a pension they will never receive.  There is a great deal of frustration regarding the unfairness at the heart of the pension levy scheme.</P>
        <P>Last year the Government tried to take medical cards away from those who are over 70 years of age.  The move to extend medical cards to everyone over 70 in the 2001 budget introduced by Mr. Charlie McCreevy was clearly designed to win popular support in the subsequent general election and, from a political point of view, that move was a success.  When the Government realised it had to make savings and cut costs, it went straight back to vulnerable people who existed on State pensions and small occupational pensions.  This caused a major amount of disquiet.  There was a rowback or a turnaround but if one was 70 years of age with a State pension and a small occupational pension there was real fear.  That affected all sections of the political classes, those who had been giving support to the Government for years.  That frightened people.  People had real fear when they sat down and figured out they would have to give &euro;50 of their weekly budget to the doctor.</P>
        <P>I refer to the manner in which the banks were recapitalised and bailed out, a measure my party opposed.  It was quite unfair.  There was a sense of unfairness at the heart of these decisions, that bankers could be bailed out and recapitalised irrespective of the merit in it at the time, when viewed by people who were losing money left, right and centre.  Families depending on the early child care supplement will no longer receive that.</P>
        <P>One of the more worrying aspects of the economic downturn, to which Senator Twomey referred, is the appalling vista of the long-term unemployed.  We do not want to return to the <Col N="1033"/>situation in the 1980s, where huge amounts of people were unemployed.  The only option for those leaving second and third level institutions was to emigrate.  That option no longer exists because of the global downturn.  We must ensure there are adequate structures to deal with the unemployment problem and that we do not return to the situation in the 1980s, where there were frightening levels of unemployment.  According to the economic indicators of the ESRI, we are likely to exceed those by the end of the year.</P>
        <P>I refer to the electoral register in the context of the local and European elections.  In Cork South-West it is very accurate because there is an extremely diligent franchise officer, who gives 100% to the position.  A candidate for Cork County Council, who has since been elected, presented himself to the polling station on polling day and was not on the register.  He was registered to vote in a different electoral area, at an address at which he never lived.  How can this happen?  This man was already a member of a town council.  In some context, such as the Joint Committee on the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, we need to approach this matter in a constructive manner to ensure the electoral register is accurate.  It is anti-democratic folly to have people removed from the electoral register.  I can accept it if someone changes address or turns 18 years of age soon before an election, but in this case an elected practitioner of local government presented at the local polling station.  What if that candidate had lost by one or two votes?  This is a serious situation.  We need a separate debate on the franchise of local government and the electoral register.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We need a response from the Minister for Education and Science on the supports that exist or do not for those recently unemployed and graduates who are well qualified but can find no positions for which they can apply.  Can the Government indicate the schemes it intends to roll out to provide some assistance to graduates who have already completed a primary qualification and need to go back to the workplace?  Perhaps they need to weather the economic storm by upskilling.  It makes economic sense to give financial assistance to someone who is adding to qualifications as opposed to giving social welfare payments, rent allowance and a medical card.  Surely the economic thinking must be black and white.  We should invest that support in someone who wants to get off the live register and go back to a third level institution.  Now is the time to do it.  We must reconfigure the back to education allowances and the schemes that provide someone with the financial means by which the person can upskill and return to the workforce when the upturn comes.  Hopefully, it will be sooner rather than later.</P>
        <P>A number of factors, national and local, affect why people were successful in these elections.  The issue of fisheries affects the coastal communities around the country.  I raised this matter on the Order of Business on Tuesday.  I and those in the fishing industry believe it is one of the areas of activity by which we can reboot coastal economies and create employment if the proper mechanisms are in place.  The fisheries legislation passed by the Houses was draconian and we must examine that area.  We must relax the harsh restrictions.</P>
        <P>Two weeks ago in west Cork, fishermen were out for ten days and when they came back they had failed to complete a log entry.  The sea fisheries protection officer boarded the vessel, seized the equipment and the catch and one individual must appear before a Circuit Court judge because of a missing entry in a log book.  That is preposterous.  Off the coast of Donegal, a trawler picked up drugs.  The crew contacted Killybegs and told the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na it would drop the drugs back if it could return to area 7 and fish, which was the intention in the first place.  The trawler returned and sea fisheries protection officers were there before the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Naval Service and boarded the vessel to check for log entries.  That is driving people out of the industry, which is one where we could create employment if the Government re-examined criminal sanctions for fishermen.</P><Col N="1034"/>
        <P Just="Left">I refer to some of the other issues, such as the decision by CIE to cut a bus route to Baltimore.  This affects those on the margins, those who do not have transport and are on lower incomes.  Other issues include the future of Bantry General Hospital.  We must be cognisant of the national climate but also of the local climate.  I ask the Minister of State to take these views back to Government to ensure it gets proactive about these issues.</P>

        <P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Finneran, who was a distinguished Member of the House as Front Bench spokesperson on finance.  I thank him for listening to the views of Senators following various elections.</P>
        <P>I pay tribute to the men and women of all political parties, particularly those in Fianna F&aacute;il and the Green Party, and particularly the party that I have been privileged to be a member of, Fianna F&aacute;il.  Some of the most outstanding men and women in the history of the party, through no fault of their own, lost their seats in this election.  It is a loss to the local authority system.  I hope they continue to represent their communities and parishes.  We look forward to the day they return to public life.  These people are of the highest integrity and ability.  They put themselves before the people and many have, unfortunately, been rejected.  They suffered because of a national situation and the worst recession in our lifetime and since the 1930s.  The Government had to take unpopular decisions because of this.  I compliment the chairman of the Green Party and the Deputy Leader of this House, who is in the Chamber, for the responsive role the party is playing in government, along with the Progressive Democrats.</P>

        <P>If Fine Gael or Labour were in power, they would have to face the same difficult choices we have had in governing and they would have faced the anger of voters if roles were reversed.  Whoever is in power must face the same difficult choices and make the same unpopular expenditure cuts.</P>
        <P>Just two years ago, in the only poll that is really relevant, the people gave this Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government a third time in office.  This is our mandate and anybody who suggests otherwise is being opportunistic and, in particular, undemocratic.  The Taoiseach received a majority vote in the Lower House last night for a vote of confidence in the Government, 85 votes to 79 votes.  Those of us here for the longest time know this is a substantial majority.  It is also a vote of confidence from the people&rsquo;s representatives, which include the two new Deputies who I had the opportunity to congratulate.</P>
        <P>The mandate given to the Taoiseach to govern was provided by the people two years ago and we will see it through for the five year programmes that we have come to know over the past ten years.  I welcome today&rsquo;s debate, which allows Members on all sides of the House the opportunity to outline and make our views known.  On this side of the House, we must put on the record the great work done by this Government over the past number of years.</P>
        <P>The crime issue is a serious challenge to our country currently but we have an excellent Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in Deputy Dermot Ahern.  He has brought about ten Bills on gangland crime alone, relating to surveillance and gun control, and all these have been published.  This week the Criminal Procedure Bill was before the House for our consideration.  It looks after the victims of crime and looks to rebalance our criminal justice system in the direction of victims.  This was a commitment we gave as a party, together with our partners, the Green Party.</P>
        <P>This Government has a very good record in the area of law, order and public services.  There have been an additional 3,500 garda&iacute; recruited in the past four years, along with an extra 7,000 teachers and 11,000 nurses and doctors.  We also provided the largest social welfare increases in the history of the State and the greatest increases in old age pensions.  There was no &euro;1 per week increase there.  We should give credit where it is due in this regard.</P>
        <P>We brought in the lowest tax wedge seen in the history of our country.  It is not just the Government which has made this argument; the OECD has made it over the past ten years and we have had the lowest tax rate here for that considerable time.  In other words, our people paid the lowest amount of taxes of any country in the OECD and we deserve credit for that.  It is a long way from the 65% top rate and 35% standard rate of tax which we had 20 years ago.</P>

	<P>The Minister of State with responsibility for housing is with us today.  A third of all homes built since the foundation of the State were built in the past ten years.  That is a record we can stand over and for which we deserve credit.  We spent a significant amount on infrastructure in the past ten years which was twice the EU average.  The money was spent on schools, roads, rail and health.  We restarted the prison building programme, and this summer we will open another 400 spaces.  Again we stand over our record and deserve credit in this area.</P>
        <P>These individual actions are aimed at improving quality of life, job retention and creation.  Until this year we had full employment and turned around the issue of emigration.  We deserve credit for that.  It is only through employment, enterprise and the income generated by these that we can fund so much else that this Government wants to achieve.  We want entrepreneurs, businesses, employees and those seeking to work to know this is our priority.</P><Col N="1036"/>
        <P>Leading from this, we have had initiatives such as the enterprise stabilisation fund to help protect jobs in our exporting companies hit by the current difficulties.  Due diligence is under way on a scheme for export credit insurance to further assist our exporting companies.  There is a commitment by the Government to pay its debts to businesses within 15 days of invoicing.  We have sought this on all sides of the House on the Order of Business on various mornings, and I commend the Government for it.</P>
        <P>A revamp is under way of our public procurement policy to make it more friendly to small and medium enterprises.  New tax changes were introduced to support job creation through the development of intellectual property assets in Ireland.  As those involved in the publishing industry know, we are the envy of the world in how strict and up to date the requirements are in our intellectual property rights regulation.</P>
        <P>We have spent much time here over the years in order to command the respect of the world.  Multinationals such as Hewlett Packard and Intel are giving us so many thousands of jobs because of the serious view which has always been taken by the Government in the protection of intellectual property rights.  That has stood us well with the significant number of jobs created in the sector.</P>
        <P>There has been an unprecedented level of training and activity measures put in place to assist those seeking employment again.  New initiatives have been established to keep people in jobs deemed vulnerable and to get graduates with work experience.  All this work has been undertaken at a time of unprecedented change in Ireland.  Everybody in the House knows that the stabilisation of our public finances and the resolution of problems in our banking system are key to economic recovery.  A combination of tax increases, expenditure reductions and efficiency gains were necessary and had to be put in place.</P>
        <P>In 1997, when our Opposition colleagues left office, we had 1.1 million working.  It is very regrettable that 400,000 people are currently unemployed but we still have 1.8 million employed today, 700,000 more than we had 12 years ago.  All fair-minded commentators and politicians would indicate that we have a great chance of recovery.  I understand figures to be released later this afternoon relating to the past two months will be very encouraging for us.</P>
        <P>I welcome the assistance of colleagues on all sides of the House in this and continuing debates on the economy and challenges facing the Department of Finance, the Taoiseach and the Government.  I welcome the Minister of State present who is listening to our views on the matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Finneran, to the House and the opportunity to speak in the debate.  After any election in which the people have spoken, it is important we reflect on the outcome.  It has been a good election for the Opposition, which has been listening closely to the electorate for the last number of years while the Government perhaps has not.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I congratulate all those people from every party who were elected.  I commiserate with those who were not elected as I know of people that may not have been of the same party colours who were good workers in their community but lost their seats.  Politics is a tough game and sacrifices must be made by an individual who partakes in it.  In saying that, such people joined the Government parties and benefited when the times were good; as the economy has turned around, they are the first casualties after the election.</P>
        <P Just="Left">With regard to the elections, some people have mentioned the accuracy of the register.  I agree it can be inaccurate and many people are missing from it who should have been on it.  The Joint Committee on the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has completed a <Col N="1037"/>report on how improvements can be made in this regard.  I ask the Minister of State to ask the Minister to consider that report again, as I am sure the accuracy and efficiency of the electoral register can be improved if the recommendations are implemented.</P>
        <P>As a democrat I am concerned about the national turnout as many people failed to vote.  If people do not use their vote and have their say, it is disappointing and we as politicians should take note.  There is also the issue of the number of spoilt ballot papers and ones unfranked by election officials.  The latter is unacceptable, particularly when a voter gives up his or her time to vote.</P>
        <P>While the elections were a good day for the Opposition, I know Government candidates would have been disappointed having suffered electoral defeats myself.  However, they were defeated for a reason and the Government must listen to the message from the voting public which holds us accountable.  Three out of four voters in the recent election voted against the Government.  While the Government may blame international economic turmoil, it must accept the national economy was exposed over many years.  The Government did not listen to the many commentators and politicians who warned that it was on the verge of collapse.</P>
        <P>Many of the Government&rsquo;s decisions, as I have said before, were based on propagating a property market bubble that was not sustainable, with over 60% of those employed involved in the construction industry.  Manufacturing industry, much of it indigenous, was neglected during these good times.  Ireland lost its competitiveness and took its eye off the ball regarding manufacturing exports, once our strength in the 1990s when the economy began to grow rapidly and when Fine Gael was last in power.  Waterford has lost many jobs in Waterford Crystal, Honeywell and Bausch &amp; Lomb which were indigenous manufacturing industries.  We need to refocus on this sector and become competitive again in it.  Unfortunately, as the property boom escalated, revenues from the construction sector were rolling in while the manufacturing sector was quietly suffering.</P>
        <P>My brother runs a small manufacturing company.  He tells me every day the serious pressures he is under at the coalface.  He, like many other small businesses, is adapting to meet the challenges ahead.  These businesses need to be assisted by the Government but it is neglecting them.  Overheads, such as energy costs, are crippling many small and medium-sized businesses.  While energy prices have been reduced lately, regulation still keeps them artificially high.  Opportunities to become more energy independent are available with renewable sources.  The Government should invest in the renewables area now to reduce our overdependence on imported oil and gas.</P>
        <P>The man on the street believes the Government&rsquo;s establishment of NAMA is the biggest gamble ever taken by a Government.  The values of the assets the agency will take on are not known.  People are aware these are inflated assets which the Government is buying back, placing a huge millstone around our necks and those of our children.  As a parent of three small children under five years of age, this move is of great concern to me and many of my generation.  Not only are many parents under pressure with their jobs and exposed to large mortgage repayments and higher costs of living but their children&rsquo;s futures have been exposed by NAMA.  People were angry and frustrated but are becoming more fearful of the economy&rsquo;s future.  They want real leadership in politics to turn the economy around.</P>
        <P>Fine Gael is offering positive options and alternatives to address these fears.  The Government has not been arrogant but has been in denial over the past two years.  It is tired, stale, out of ideas and out of time.  Fine Gael is proposing progressive and proactive economic ideas.  We have the energy, the vision and now the personnel to take this country to a new level and recover the economy.  I have always respected the Green Party for its good ideals.  However, the party&rsquo;s activists should now become members of Fine Gael which is putting green issues to <Col N="1038"/>the forefront in its proposals for renewing the economy.  That is where the Greens should be rather than propping up a Government that is now crippled.</P>

	<P Just="Left">There is no glossing over the fact this has been a difficult set of elections for the Green Party-Comhaontas Glas.  It is part of the maturing of any political party to experience election success and also deep failures.  It was the lot of Fine Gael in the 2002 general election and the Labour Party in the 1997 and 1987 general elections.  We live in an era of pendulum politics where a large number of votes shift easily given the time and context in which an election is held.  I have no doubt the electorate intended to give my party a kick in the shins; unfortunately, they amputated us from the knee down.  The situation we find ourselves in gives us cause for great reflection but I believe it will lead to the betterment of our party in the long run.</P>
        <P Just="Left">That said, the Opposition parties performed well in the elections.  They played on the obvious anger that exists.  They also played no little part in fomenting some of that anger.  That is, however, the way of politics.  When the dust settles, there will be a responsibility on the Opposition parties to answer themselves the questions they raised about several Government policies.  If the public service pension levy is unpopular, what is the Opposition&rsquo;s alternative of raising moneys?  If the income levy is unpopular, what is its alternative?  I accept some other decisions made by the Government have been short-sighted, wrong-minded and need to be re-examined.  However, would the Opposition parties, if they were in government, be able to deal with the current economic situation without making unpopular decisions?  All governments make unpopular decisions given the current economic times.</P>
        <P>I would go further to suggest the Opposition parties do not want to be in government.</P>

       <?oasys _cl14.5- ?><Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>The local elections were held on the same day as the European Parliament elections.  The Government party in Britain only got 15% of the national vote.  The Czech Green Party, which had been in government there until recently, also experienced a similar collapse in support by virtue of being in government during the most serious economic downturn experienced.  I have accepted both in and outside the Chamber that certain policy decisions, prior to my party entering into government, contributed to a worsening of the Irish economic situation, making it more than experienced elsewhere.  That said, it is my preference that my party stays in government to correct the effects of many of these decisions.</P>
        <P>The nature of being in politics and of being an honest and responsible politician is to meet challenges sincerely.  It is to try, when something is wrong, to admit it.  It is to use that platform, to the best of one&rsquo;s abilities, to correct it and make matters better.  I will never apologise for that even if that means a diminution of personal support or an inability to get elected at any time.  The essence of politics is to be in government, to try to effect change and to try to make things better.  However, when I hear of the games that are played on particular issues, it causes despair.</P>
        <P>In a personal sense, I admit this was a difficult election and I came across people who undoubtedly were angry.  Many people have many reasons to be angry.  I refer to people who have lost their jobs, who have difficulty in making mortgage payments or those whose pension entitlements have gone up in smoke because of the collapse of markets.  However, some of the anger I encountered came from people who are not affected by any of these factors and who have been caught up in a general feeling that one must be angry and that one must be angry at someone.  If this country is to recover, people must be focused in their anger.  One must ensure the right people take responsibility for what has gone wrong and for what needs to be corrected.</P>
        <P>I accept there have been political failings.  However, as for the issue of the banks being trotted out periodically, what is the alternative approach that the others claim will cost any less or will have a different effect?  Regardless of whether one nationalises, adopts a good bank and bad bank approach or takes a NAMA approach, it all will come down to the Irish taxpayer.  There is no way of avoiding what has happened and no other combination of parties or politicians will be able to effect a different result.  All one can do is to try to use the situation to ensure the impact is lessened.</P>
        <P>Unless people are sufficiently honest to admit this, our politics are suffering.  I believe the real effort to bring forward changes will require honesty.  This election really was about anyone but the Government.  It is quite obvious that this was the voters&rsquo; intention and those were the results that followed.  However, it is a sort of perversion of democracy when people get voted for on the basis of what they are not, rather than on what they are for.  They were not voted for because of what they stand for or because of their experiences or abilities.  While that criticism probably is too general, it was a factor in these elections.  People were elected who came from nowhere and did not have a particular background but who, because the mood of the moment was anyone but the Government, succeeded in being elected.  Those Members who are in the Chamber at present came through the political process in the traditional manner.  They contested local and national elections, were elected as councillors in the first instances and have gained experience of all that.  However, when the mood is so volatile that anything can happen, anyone can be elected and that is not safe for our democracy.  We need more&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>The danger at present is not so much that these results may and will translate into a future general election result.  That could be the case as trends are trends and sometimes momentums cannot be stopped.  However, there is a danger for the Opposition parties both in being honest with people by revealing fully who they are and what they are about and being complacent.  There is a risk of hubris because there have been mid-term results previously that did not translate into general election victories.  I make this point in particular to Fine Gael, a party that has not been directly elected into a Government in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann since 1982.</P>

	<P>I fully accept this verdict.  I understand from where it comes and I understand what must be done to address it.  However, as for where this leads this country, whoever is in government and whenever that election takes place, I hope the people will be spoken to directly and honestly during that general election campaign because the next few years are not going to get easier and will not be better for people.  We need a stable Government that is able to tell people what they need to hear and not what they want to hear.  In reality, that is what mid-term elections are.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sorry that Senator Boyle is leaving, as I enjoyed his speech and his lecture to Members.  My mother, may God rest her, had a great saying, which was that <Col N="1041"/>democracy is a great leveller and the ballot box never tells lies.  She was right.  The ballot box last Saturday unfurled a result that many Members never would have forecast two years ago and people want change.  I lament the loss of anyone&rsquo;s seat, be they members of Fine Gael, Fianna F&aacute;il or whatever, because I was that candidate two years ago in the last general election.  I will not express joy at the loss of anyone&rsquo;s seat because I support everyone who stands before the electorate.  Politics is a great and noble profession and Members should never forget that.</P>
        <P>However, the people are not fools.  They listen, watch and observe and have understood that the Government has refused to listen and has refrained from making the correct decisions, not over the past 18 months or two years, but over the past 12 years.  Today should not be about the past but about the future, about what people want and about how to get Ireland working.  It is about how to make banks more trustworthy and how to allow credit to flow toward small and medium enterprises.  It is about creating new jobs and about restoring the housing market of which the Minister of State, Deputy Finneran, is in charge.  The elections last week both were and were not about Europe and the local elections.  They were also about national issues that affected everyone.  Senator Coffey is correct that Members must never forget their business is about people.  The people have been let down and they took out their anger regarding national issues on the Government.  Senator Boyle referred to pendulum politics and while he might be correct up to a point, it is not simply about this as it also pertains to how one responds and directs policy.  It is about the future of every working person and everyone who has lost his or her job.</P>
        <P>Senator Boyle raised questions about the banks and about the alternative budget.  I wish to put on record that Fine Gael was the only party that had set out detailed and costed plans for rebuilding Ireland through the overhaul of its State companies and in the manner in which a new-era investment programme will be driven in respect of broadband, clean energy and water to create 100,000 new jobs.  This is the reason Fine Gael&rsquo;s pre-budget submission set out detailed reform plans to cut the cost of running the Government by 20% to pay for the targeted cuts in taxes such as VAT and PRSI.  This is the reason that, through its &ldquo;Fair Care&rdquo; health policy, Fine Gael has a clear vision and detailed plans for a fairer and more efficient health service that will cut waiting lists, take the burden away from our hospitals by making primary care free and provide everyone with affordable health insurance.  These measures are set out in black and white and I will provide them to any Member opposite who dares to criticise Fine Gael for having no policies, because we do.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarkDaly"><NameTxt>Senator Mark Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>Fine Gael does not.</P>
      </Speaker>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>I will take no lip from anyone in this regard.</P>
        <P>The fundamentals are quite simple.  In the words of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, in the D&aacute;il this week, &ldquo;People have lost jobs.  They have lost savings.  They have lost pensions.&rdquo;  The Minister failed to mention that the people have lost trust and have lost confidence in the ability of the Government to govern.  Fundamentally, the people believe it will require a different jockey on the horse to take us out of the political tsunami in which we find ourselves.  Fine Gael has the policies and I will happily debate policy with any Member present.  I have read some of Fine Gael&rsquo;s policies into the record.  However, Members should discuss a new direction.  I do not refer to a cosmetic change but to one that is real and meaningful because the Government has lost that vision.  I do not propose change for its own sake but because the people I met on the doorsteps are disillusioned about the withdrawal of the <Col N="1042"/>Christmas bonus.  I recently gave the House details of the case of a retired teacher whom I met some weeks ago.  The woman in question, who is a spinster, worked as a national school teacher for 35 years.  She bought shares in Bank of Ireland and Allied Irish Banks.  She intended to fall back on them if, in her day of distress and need, she needed to go into a nursing home.  That is now gone.  I also met a woman in Bishopstown whose child needs 24-hour care.  She told me her application for a housing adaptation grant had been refused.  In light of such cases, do Senators Daly and Butler continue to believe Ireland is an equitable and just country?  It is clear that it is not.  The ship of State, which has been run onto the rocks, requires a new captain with a new crew that can create an equitable and fair Ireland.  We need change because the Government has abdicated responsibility for matters like health, the banks and housing.</P>
        <P>I would like to speak about the manner in which elections are run.  Last Friday evening, I received a telephone call from a distressed gentleman whose wife had gone to their local polling station at 7.30 p.m., only to discover that her vote had already been used.  A line had been drawn through her name.  Although she had her passport and her polling card with her, she was not allowed to vote.  In modern Ireland, it is not good enough that personation continues to take place and that our register of electors is in rag order.  The proper procedures are not followed in many of our polling stations, which stay open from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m.  I do not criticise the returning officer in Cork, Mr. Martin Harvey, who does a fine job of running elections.  We need to examine how we run our electoral system, starting with a root and branch reform of the operation of the elections themselves.  I look forward to reading the Standards in Public Office Commission&rsquo;s report on levels of compliance with electoral law.  In the city of Cork, many posters and other forms of election literature are in breach of the Electoral Acts.  They do not specify who printed them, for example.  If we are serious about using our electoral law to create a fair and balanced electoral system, we must apply the full rigours of the law to those who breach it.  If we do not do so, the Electoral Acts will be seen as a farce and a joke.  We need to be serious about the running of elections.  I want a fair, balanced and equitable electoral system that gives a chance to everybody who wants to run for election.</P>
        <P>I congratulate those who won in the recent elections.  I thank those who were defeated for running and hope they will run again.  I take no pleasure in seeing people beaten in elections.  The people have spoken.  This Government has no mandate.  It has lost its moral authority to govern.  It is time for a general election because this country deserves a better Government than the one it has.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarkDaly"><NameTxt>Senator Mark Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>Winston Churchill once said that democracy seems like a bad form of Government until one considers the alternatives.  Senator Buttimer said that the people have spoken, but I remind him that the elections in which they spoke were local elections.  Tip O&rsquo;Neill&rsquo;s great quote, &ldquo;all politics is local&rdquo;, is often used during local election campaigns.  It is also used in general election campaigns.  In his great study of local democracy in Ireland, Dr. Liam Weeks of UCC found that 66% of those who voted in the 2004 local elections voted for the candidate, whereas 34% voted for the party.  Senator Buttimer has openly called for a general election, but we all know that his colleagues privately do not share that view.  In the corridors of this House, Fine Gael Deputies and Senators are looking for an election in the same way that a turkey looks for Christmas.  They are making big noises and shouting loudly, but the reality is that they do not want a general election.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MarkDaly"><NameTxt>Senator Mark Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>When the people spoke, they said they were not happy.  That is basically it.  What we have seen is a form of Americanisation of Irish politics, in some senses.  Those who are not happy decided to vote against Fianna F&aacute;il and the Government, rather than for the Opposition.  They have formed the view that the Government is not doing a great job.  In essence, mistakes have been made.  Se&aacute;n Lemass once said that anyone who never made a mistake never did anything.  In fairness to the Opposition and specifically my colleague, Senator Buttimer, Fine Gael has never made a mistake but then again it has never done anything.  Opposition Senators have said that Fianna F&aacute;il has been in power for 20 years, but I remind them that we have come a long way in that time.  We made hard decisions to ensure that Ireland is no longer the poor man of Europe.  Further hard decisions will have to be made in the future.</P>
        <P Just="Left">If one were to listen to the media, one would think that the end of the world is coming.  I would like to give the House two examples of that.  The stories in question appeared in the newspapers over the last month.  It is interesting to note that people are so busy nowadays that they scan newspapers rather than read them.  Headlines are important because approximately 80% of people do not go beyond them.  A newspaper used the headline, &ldquo;Hospital for the elderly turned off heating due to health cuts&rdquo;, above a story about a hospital in Killarney.  When I read the content of the article, however, I did not see any further mention of health cuts.  The article mentioned that extra blankets had to be brought into the hospital one night when the hospital&rsquo;s boiler broke down.  The boiler in question was repaired the following day.  The job was done.  The headline led to a discussion about health cutbacks on Radio Kerry that lasted the morning.  People were under the impression that such cutbacks led to the heating being switched off, but that was not the case.  The newspaper in question was reporting fiction rather than the truth.  Another newspaper suggested that a review that has yet to be published will recommend that one-person Garda stations in rural Ireland should be closed.  People in rural areas, such as Waterford, Cork and Kerry and along the west coast, decided that the recommendation was an abomination.  The fact is the Government is not considering the closure of one-person Garda stations.  That was not part of the review, which was about making sure such stations are up to standard.  There is no question of them being closed in any way, shape or form.  On a daily basis, one faces a barrage of such headlines, not only about local issues like Garda stations and the health service but also about national issues like the bailout of the banks.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The problem Senator Buttimer&rsquo;s party is facing is that Fine Gael&rsquo;s policies are not compatible with the Labour Party&rsquo;s policies.  Senator Buttimer is anxious for us to call a general election, but I suggest that if it were to happen, we would certainly have another election within nine months.  When two entirely incompatible groups go into government together, the honeymoon period might be great but those feelings of euphoria quickly subside when both parties realise that their respective theories on how the economy should be run are divergent.  We all remember what happened when this House sat late into the night last year to consider the Govern<Col N="1044"/>ment&rsquo;s bank guarantee scheme.  The Labour Party opposed the scheme.  It was not a question of bailing out the banks; it was a question of trying to safeguard everyone&rsquo;s deposits and prevent a run on the banks.  The Labour Party did not want it to happen, which did not look great.  Perception sometimes becomes reality.  If we had not guaranteed people&rsquo;s deposits, their hard-earned savings might have disappeared.  As a Government, the responsible thing for us to do was to ensure that such savings were safeguarded.  The reality is that we need to make our case to the Irish people.  We have to ensure they understand the difficult decisions that are being taken.  Any mistakes that have been made will be rectified.  The most vulnerable people will be protected.  I commend Fine Gael for supporting us when we took difficult decisions and needed support.  In the next three years, while still in government, we will try to ensure we restore the faith of the people in the Government and our party.</P>

	<P>I am happy to give an independent view on the inter-party rivalry that has been evident for the past hour or two.  Fine Gael and the Labour Party, given their position, are perfectly entitled and correct to call for an election.  Equally, the Government is correct to say there should be none.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P Just="Left">I have been here long enough to see changes.  I am sorry some of my friends in Fine Gael have not been present for this debate.  I could give examples of changes that occurred when there were changes of Government.  Senator Bradford was a Member of this House when we dealt with the road traffic legislation in the 1990s, which was introduced by former Minister Michael Smith.  We tabled amendments on this side of the House on all sorts of issues, including speed limits and licences.  We were very solid and committed regarding the legislation and we were all working together on it but then the Government fell over the Brendan Smyth case.  Next thing the Government changed without an election such that the people who were on this side of the House were then on the other.  I said we would at least effect some changes as a consequence.  When the legislation was considered under the new Government, Senator Ross and myself re-tabled all the Fine Gael amendments tabled before the change of Government in the belief we would have the full support of the other side of the House.  Did we receive it?  We did not.  We have learned the hard way over the years.  We listen to comments and know people are sincere in what they say when they say it.  This does not mean it will ultimately turn out to be what they want.  This is a lesson for all of us.</P>
        <?oasys _cl14.5- ?><P>The Labour Party and Fine Gael are correct to be hammering the Government at present.  I met the leader of the Green Party casually yesterday and said I was sorry his party did so badly in the elections.  Like Senator Buttimer, I congratulate those who put a name on the ballot paper and I feel sorry for anybody who did not get elected or lost a seat.  I am genuine in saying this and Members on both sides of the House, irrespective of party affiliations, share my view.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I said to the leader of the Green Party that I could list measures he could have adopted that would not have cost money, would have received widespread support and would have been good for Fianna F&aacute;il, bearing in mind that the Green Party was not able to convince Fianna F&aacute;il.  He asked what the measures were and I replied that the Joint Committee on Climate Change and Energy Security, of which I am a member, produced legislation called the foreshore Bill, which would be very important in terms of bringing energy resources ashore.  It was the first joint committee ever to produce a Bill.  I asked why the Government did not say it was a great idea and consider it.  The Government would have had a wide selection of people dealing with issues that Senator Butler has raised under another heading on various occasions, including <Col N="1045"/>the problems associated with developing renewable energy.  Senator Butler invited to Leinster House those responsible for the Spirit of Ireland proposal.  Spirit of Ireland brought many strands together but the first depends on this legislation.  I also mentioned to the leader of the Green Party the Climate Change Bill, which was produced by Members in the Opposition benches.  The concept was agreed by the Government and it said it would bring forward its own Bill.  There are many such measures that could have been considered.</P>
        <P>I referred yesterday to Seanad reform.  Perhaps the Government will consider Seanad reform with a slightly less jaundiced eye given that Fianna F&aacute;il has probably lost two quotas in every single panel.  I stated that, in my county, the naming of my home town cost the Government votes.  I spoke to a young Fianna F&aacute;il man who said residents were waiting for the Government to do something about the name of the town, which was changed by the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, but it did nothing.  These are the issues that arise.  I am picking small matters although I could go through list after list of those that arise all the time.  I sometimes wonder what programme managers are doing.</P>
        <P>Senator Daly referred to headlines.  I have been reading headlines and full, detailed commentary over the past year stating for a fact that Fianna F&aacute;il was at 20%, that the percentage associated with the Labour Party was mid 20s and that the percentage associated with Fine Gael was in the 30s.  We looked at the results of the local elections, in respect of which commentators say a different result is produced, and at the results of the European elections.  The European elections showed the Labour Party to be just under 14%, Fine Gael to be at 29% and Fianna F&aacute;il to have a percentage in the mid-20s.  The opinion polls were completely wrong in respect of the three main parties.  It is worth our while examining this.</P>
        <P>Everyone has the same interest in the register of electors.  We considered it some years ago and sorted it by sending guys out at the weekend from local authority offices to check where people live.  A statement was made by the Communication Workers Union &ndash; I believe it had the support of An Post &ndash; that the only people who can reliably compile a register of electors are the people knocking on doors every day delivering the post.  If I were tasked with saving money and achieving efficiency, I would remove responsibility for collecting television licence fees from An Post and impose an audiovisual charge on all households in the country, unless they opted out, such that the fee would be imposed through the taxation system.  I would also pay An Post to compile the register of electors.  The postman or postwoman knows who lives in each house and nobody could compile the register better and with more efficiency over time.</P>
        <P>Consider the issue of moral authority, the Government&rsquo;s mandate and the question of the incompatibility of Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael, the Labour Party and the other parties.  Senator Ross and I, and perhaps the Minister of State, Deputy Finneran, were told in 1989 by an important Fianna F&aacute;il backbencher on the plinth that under no circumstances would his party go beyond the final frontier and go into Government with the Progressive Democrats.  Four hours later he walked out of a meeting having established a commitment to a Fianna F&aacute;il-Progressive Democrats Government.  The same man is the Minister for Transport today, thus demonstrating how circumstances change.  The question of incompatibility does not arise in these issues and parties have their policies.  It is true that the Fine Gael and Labour Party policies are incompatible at present but they are incompatible only in so far as they do not change.  Politics is the art of compromise and there is no point in Fianna F&aacute;il saying the Opposition could never form a Government given that it and the Progressive Democrats set out what they wanted and agreed a common programme for Government.  This is how it is done.  Differences are not irreconcilable as one just works out the programme for Government.  The bigger party gets the most and one proceeds in that manner.</P><Col N="1046"/>
        <P>A proposal was made yesterday by Senator Hanafin, who said in respect of the banking crisis that all parties should spell out exactly what they mean in a question and answer session in the House.  I understand NAMA and believe it is a good idea.  I have questions about it and am not enthusiastic about it but believe it could work.  I like the idea that we will ultimately own the property in question.  I understand the first step of the Fine Gael policy but do not understand what would happen after setting up the toxic debt banks or what would happen if one decided not to meet the commitments on bonds sold internationally.  I will have worries about this until the system is explained to me.  That is not to say Fine Gael&rsquo;s proposal is wrong; I am just outlining how I see it as a person considering all the sides.</P>
        <P>The Labour Party speaks of part nationalisation.  This is fine and it is the first step.  I do not believe there is a great problem with it but I wonder what happens next.  What do we do with the toxic debt?  It is fine to say the people who took the risk should take the plunge.  I would have no problem with that either and am assured that NAMA will be going in this same direction but, when the transfers of assets are complete, there will be debts and a problem that will still need to be resolved.  I do not understand how the Labour Party would resolve the problem but that is not to say it has no solution; I am just saying I have not had it spelled out to me.</P>
        <P>My Fianna F&aacute;il colleagues have not boned up on these issues and do not fully understand them.  They are not speaking with conviction.  I say this because whenever they speak they always attack Members on this side of the House. If I were in the parliamentary party I would tell people that they should understand what they are doing and go out and argue for it.  They should forget about those on the other side of the House.  They should explain what they are doing and be committed to it.  The country needs a solid strong Opposition and we should congratulate Fine Gael and Labour in that respect.  The rest of us need to ensure we understand completely what everybody is proposing and move away from the practice of shooting across the aisle and get the facts down in front of us.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LarryButler"><NameTxt>Senator Larry Butler</NameTxt>
	<P>I will not go down the road taken by other speakers on this issue.  We know what the people have said in the election.  We must adjudicate on what people have said to us and decide how we will react and structure the direction of Government for the next three years.  Senator O&rsquo;Toole has touched briefly on one of the key issues for the running of the country for the next three years, the banking situation.  We know the Fine Gael plan.  What sort of message would that plan to let international bonds and pensions and so forth burn, send out internationally when we go back onto the bond market looking for investors?  We would not get anyone to invest in this country if that happened.</P>
        <P>When I was on the doorsteps people talked about how they swallowed hook, line and sinker the idea that the banks were a gilt-edged bet.  Now that they realise they were not gilt-edged they blame the Government, saying it was our job to ensure the Financial Regulator worked.  They are right.  We are not blameless.  We should have been more on top of our job.  The other problem was that we did not expect what happened.  The crisis in the property market came first, followed by the banking crisis and then the international crisis.  We have three problems and we have not yet solved the banking crisis.  That will take some time.</P>
        <P>I could not understand how a man of Deputy Richard Bruton&rsquo;s intelligence could say that &euro;40 billion to &euro;50 billion of his proposals should be allowed to welch on that bet.  We need a banking system that enables people to invest in the country.  Inward investment is one of the key factors on which we depend for job creation and for our financial services which are major <Col N="1047"/>employers.  We do not have a choice about bailing out the banks.  It would be great if we did have a choice in the matter and did not have to bail them out.  Without a banking system we would not have an economy.  We would lose a workforce of approximately 37,000 to 40,000 if we ran down the banking system.  We are helping the banks out because we have to.  The banking service is a people service involving investors, small deposit holders and people who invested in bank shares.  Funnily enough bank shares have risen somewhat, although they have a long way to go.  The paper value of the Government investment in the two main banks is over &euro;5 billion.  Nobody has mentioned that it has been a very good investment.  It is not a question of helping out the bankers or our friends but an investment.  I explained that to people on the doorsteps.</P>
        <P>I also explained to the garda, the nurse, the teacher who said that we were taking X,Y or Z out of their pockets that &euro;20 billion of that amount is being borrowed and we have to take corrective action to bridge the gap between what we spend and taxation.  That has to be done.  There will be pain for the next three years.  That is the message we will send out.  We are not sending the right message.  It must be clearer and we must say exactly why we are doing A, B and C.  We must be honest with the people.  Senator Boyle got it in one when he said we must be honest with the people and tell them exactly why we have to do this and explain that we have agreed a five year strategy with our international support in Europe which respects the fact that we must make that commitment.</P>
        <P>I thank the Minister of State for his explanation.  His thoughts on the situation and where he is going from here are very good.  We have the right man in the right job to deal with the housing situation.  I thank him for all the hard work he has done since taking office.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share time with Senator Ross. </P>
        <P>The result of the 2007 general election was unusual in that Fianna F&aacute;il and the Green Party were reluctantly elected and within months, if not weeks, of that decision the public decided that it had made the wrong decision.  It compares with the re-election in Britain in 1992 of the Tory Government against all the odds.  That was deemed a big surprise but within weeks the people decided they had made a mistake and it was only a question of when they would take their revenge on the Government.  The same has happened here.  I have been around this House long enough not to be too excited one way or the other about the ups and downs of politics.  I try to be realistic about election results.  The public has been waiting to get at Fianna F&aacute;il since 2007.  We cannot describe this as a surprise result.</P>
        <P>The result of the next general election was decided months ago, if not two years ago.  The Government will be defeated.  It is a question of when the election takes place and the scale of that defeat.  I am not concerned about the state of Fianna F&aacute;il but the state of the country.  The political challenge for us over the coming months, if the election is to be held late this year, or in 12 or 18 months&rsquo; time is to put in place policies and programmes to turn the economy around.  That is being demanded.  Fine Gael is pleased with the election of so many new councillors and that the public has shown faith in our leadership.  We must plan for the next general election.  That is the big challenge we face arising from the local elections.  The compilation of the electoral register must be reviewed.  Many canvassers and politicians found in recent weeks that dozens of people&rsquo;s names were missing from the register.  Even on polling day people who have been voting for 50 or 60 years found that their names were not on the register.  Senator O&rsquo;Toole expressed a view as to how the register could be improved.  The example he gave should be considered.  It is unacceptable that many people find their names are not on the register at the last moment when they go to vote.</P><Col N="1048"/>
        <P>I would like to address briefly our electoral system.  I accept this is a matter for another day and requires a much more substantial debate.  Is our electoral and political system, as currently construed, the type of system that can regenerate our country and economy and enable us plan for the years ahead?  The results of the local elections last week show that, even from a Fine Gael perspective, many of our outstanding councillors, long-term public representatives, including two in my area, former councillors Aileen Pyne and Tom Sheahan, lost their seats to party colleagues.  That is what happens in Irish politics.  Unfortunately, there is too much debate and argument within and not enough between the parties and people do not appear to consider there is any great need for political debate, political discourse or the putting forward of new ideas in terms of our electoral system as it is currently construed.  The Minister, Deputy Dempsey, the former Taoiseach, Garret FitzGerald, and many others have asked us to reflect on the need for a possible change to our electoral system.  Some people say if it is not broke why fix it.  However, I think it is broke.  We are in our current political and economic state because of the inability in terms of our political system.  Senators and Deputies should respond to the challenges posed and spend sufficient time in these Houses debating the real issues.  That is one of the great political challenges we will have to take up over the next number of years.  While turkeys should not be advised to vote for Christmas, if we want to put the future of this country and its people at the top of our political agenda, we have to accept that our present multi-seat PR system of electing politicians and Governments may not be the most appropriate for the Ireland of the new millennium.  It may have worked in the past but that is no guarantee it will work in the future.  We need a substantive non-party political debate on this subject.  I am sure we will return to it on another occasion.</P>
        <P>I congratulate all my new colleagues across the local authorities.  As Senators we have a close affinity with local authority members.  I empathise and sympathise with those across all parties who lost their council seats.  Democracy is difficult.  I wish all the new local authority members well in the years ahead.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Bradford for sharing time.</P>
        <P>I would like to wander around this topic the way everybody else has without being very specific about it.  The initial reaction to the election results is for one to be somewhat puzzled.  If anybody gives them any thought, he or she would come to the conclusion that the extraordinary rejection of the Government in these elections is not only a reflection on what has happened in the past few months.  We can understand, to some extent, the extremely penal measures that have been taken by the Government against virtually every taxpayer in the country and against people in receipt of social welfare benefits.  While we may not agree with these measures we can understand the reason they were taken, namely, because the budget deficit is wide and the economy is generally in a pretty perilous situation.  However, that is not the reason Fianna F&aacute;il and the Green Party got such an astoundingly bad vote.  That was because there was a verdict on what Senator Bradford touched on and on the years prior to the last general election also.</P>
        <P>What is depressing and also an eye-opener for the Government is that the people decided they had made a mistake in the last general election and that they had also been fooled.  People gave a fairly decisive mandate to Fianna F&aacute;il, although not so much to the Green Party, in the last general election on the basis &mdash; I do not believe this is in dispute &mdash; that Fianna F&aacute;il would be the people who would run the economy best.  That was the message its members sold, which gave them the resurgence they enjoyed in the last weeks of the polls.  They sold that message very successfully.  It was sold on the basis that they would run the economy extraordinarily successfully and they had injected people with prosperity during the previous four or five years. <Col N="1049"/> The problem with that was that within weeks of the general election and gradually over a period people began to realise that the message they were sold was a lie, that what had been happening was an extraordinary piece of economic deception.  Money was being pumped into people&rsquo;s pockets which was not theirs.  Developers were allowed to go bananas and borrow money like there was no tomorrow.  That was a feeling of false prosperity to which nobody was calling a halt.  That is something which people generally could not be expected to understand but understandably they were enjoying it.</P>
        <P>I do not believe for one moment that there were not people in government, among the regulators, as Senator Butler said, and in the Department of Finance who did not realise that Ireland was living an economic lie for many years, but they did nothing about it for purely political reasons.  What happened in this election was the people who had been waiting for the Government and who realised this took it out on the Government parties.  They voted against them in spades.  They realised not so much that they had made a mistake in the last general election, which they probably did, but that they had been deceived on a massive basis by the authorities, the oligarchs, the banks, the builders, the regulators, the politicians and the Department of Finance all during that period.  It was a vote not so much only on the harsh measures but on the lack of taking corrective action before now.  It was the first chance people got to do that and it was the first time they realised this.</P>
        <P>I suspect there was also an additional cry of pain in this because all of us began to realise we were worse off than anywhere else in Europe, that we, our Government, banks and oligarchies had behaved worse than those anywhere else in Europe.  Other countries&rsquo; governments in Europe, which had taken some measures that people did not like and which had to ride out a recession, did very well.  That is where Ireland is in such a strange situation.  Silvio Berlusconi, despite his extraordinary domestic difficulties, did very well.  Angela Merkel, despite the severe recession in Germany, did very well.  Nicholas Sarkozy did well in France.  I concede Gordon Brown did not do so well in the UK but, I suspect, much of that was to do with an immediate problem, of which everybody is aware, to do with parliamentary expenses, which has had a sensational effect.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Whereas in Europe the people appear to have moved or stayed with the kind of centre right parties, here there was undoubtedly a move to the left.  It is an extraordinary reflection on gut reaction.  Much of it was middle class reaction.  Joe Higgins &mdash; I personally welcome this &mdash; a member of the extreme left, put out a member of Fianna F&aacute;il in Dublin.  What are we to make of that, namely, that the largest party in the State and a man who represented a long dynasty in Fianna F&aacute;il were put out of action completely by a Marxist-Leninist, who does not even believe in the rights of private property?  What does that tell us about the people who voted for him?  What we saw here was not just a working class protest vote.  What has to have happened is that the middle classes came out to vote and the people in south Dublin, the people who voted for Deputy Lee, voted for Joe Higgins.  The people of D&uacute;n Laoghaire, the most middle class constituency in Ireland, voted for Joe Higgins.  What are we to tell from that?  A move to the left like that is a move, I suggest, more of real disillusionment than a move towards the ideology which Joe Higgins unashamedly espouses.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>I am impressed with the level of debate from all Senators who contributed today.  A wide range of issues were mentioned, some of which did not pertain directly to the results of the elections but may have been contributing factors.  There were also a number of interesting comments and suggestions from individual Senators.  It goes to show the amount of thought people put into debates such as this.  I spent nearly 14 years in this <Col N="1050"/>House and I found that people here, by and large, spoke with conviction and thought out what they were going to say.  This appears to have been the case today and I welcome it.</P>
        <P>I was especially impressed with the comments made by Senator McCarthy regarding job creation and how people with primary degrees could be assisted in raising their skill levels and adding to their qualifications.  That is the type of thinking that is required.  The area of fisheries was mentioned by some other Senators, including the Leader of the House, Senator Cassidy, who spoke about the opportunities for job creation in this regard, and Senator McCarthy, who spoke about the difficulties in this area.</P>
        <P>Senator Ormonde, who has worked in education, reflected on that area and on technology as well as on the need for a change in thinking regarding jobs.  She made the point that the Fianna F&aacute;il Party is resilient and is in a position to reorganise itself, get back into the debate on the national issues and get ready for the next general election in three years&rsquo; time.  This has happened in the past, including after the local elections in 2004.  As I said in my statement earlier, there were difficulties for Government parties in the last three local elections.</P>
        <P>The issue of bailing out the banks has been mentioned by a number of people.  It is worth mentioning that this is not the full story.  It is important we understand, as Senator Butler stated, that this is an investment that may have a pretty good return in the medium to long term.  Already the two main commercial banks have improved their share positions.  Bad debts are to be dealt with under the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA.  This is a totally new situation for this country.  I see that finance houses in America are interested in seeking opportunities among the bad assets in this country.</P>
        <P>I am not in a position to say with any certainty or based on any extra knowledge what the final outcome will be, but it is important we ensure lines of credit are open to businesses and individuals, whether to allow them to continue as self-employed or to provide a mortgage to buy a home.  It is important banks and financial institutions are in a position to lend, are stable, and that the public interact with them in a normal way as they did in the past.  Some of the interactions that went on were totally unacceptable.</P>
        <P>I take the point that Senator Butler made about regulation.  Shortly after the general election of 2007 I, as Chairman of the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service, went to New York and Washington along with a number of committee members.  At that stage headlines were appearing in the newspapers about the problem of sub-prime lending in that country.  On that visit we found out that 36,000 unregulated brokers had created most of the problems.  We found that extraordinary because we were of the opinion that we had set up a regulatory regime in this country that would not allow that to happen.  Of course, as it turned out, that was not the case.  The regulatory regime in this country turned out to have major faults and had indeed contributed to the situation.</P>
        <P>I understand what Senator Ross is saying but I do not think there was anyone who was not taken aback with the speed with which the crisis hit.  It is easy to see now that people should have been more alert, but people around the world were not.  Responses to the crisis have been slow around the world, particularly in Europe.  Members of the Oireachtas called many times for reductions in interest rates, yet the president of the European Central Bank resisted that for a long time.  As Chairman of the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service, I attended a meeting in Brussels at which he clearly stated that under no circumstances would he recommend the lowering of interest rates on the basis that his first priority was to control inflation.  Despite this, he and the board of the ECB had to change their minds later.  I am talking about the highest level of financial regulation in Europe.</P><Col N="1051"/>
        <P>Senator Coffey and a number of other Senators mentioned the voting register.  It is unfortunate, but this matter is raised after every election.  With all the expertise we have now, including franchise officers in many of our local authorities, I am amazed we still have those problems, but I will bring these comments back to the Department and contact will be made with the local authorities in this regard.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole mentioned the independent view, opinion polls and Seanad reform.  The issue of Seanad reform is under scrutiny at the moment and some meetings have been held in this regard.  Senator Bradford also raised the issue of the voting register and mentioned the electoral system, but that is a matter for a wider debate than we have had today.</P>
        <P>I thank Members for their contributions.  Elections are what they are: a poll of opinion which has reflected, in this case, that people are unhappy with the Government.  However, we must understand that the representatives elected by the people last night voted confidence in the Government by 85 votes to 79.  That is where we stand at this point in the life of the D&aacute;il and Seanad.</P>

	<P>I wish to raise the need for the Minister for Transport to instruct Dublin Bus to cease predatory activities against private operators in the Dublin region, as exemplified by the recent issues between Swords Express and Dublin Bus.  The Minister for Transport will be familiar with the issue of the Dublin Bus monopoly indulging in predatory pricing.  Circle Line has already claimed that it was forced to go into liquidation in June 2008 owing to unfair competition from Dublin Bus and because it was subject to route saturation from Dublin Bus immediately after it started.  This is a problem no Department or Minister should tolerate and it raises questions about the attitude of the Department of Transport to competition.</P>
        <P>I am specifically drawing attention to the situation in Swords in north Dublin because it is an especially bad case of Dublin Bus indulging in predatory pricing where it faces competition.  Swords, as the Minister knows, is Ireland&rsquo;s largest town, but many parts of it do not have a regular express bus service to the city centre.  The only choice people have is to take a circuitous route on Dublin Bus or to walk the whole way.  Some parts of Swords have no service outside peak times.  When a private operator offered to provide a service for the people and take on that risk, the people of Swords welcomed it.  It was no surprise that Dublin Bus suddenly decided, having inadequately provided for this route, to provide adequately for it.  In this case, when it saw a private operator working, it descended on the route and gave it saturation coverage.  That is empire building &mdash; putting the private operator out of business then removing the fleet and going back to square one.  It is unacceptable.</P>
        <P>In this case the private operator must compete with a State subsidised service which was commenced after Swords Express started its operations.  Swords Express wants to provide an all-day express bus service to north, south and west Swords but is being thwarted by the Department of Transport because for some mysterious reason the Department will not issue Swords Express with a licence.  It is now 16 months since the company applied for a licence and it <Col N="1052"/>wants to extend that service until much later in the evening.  It is not being allowed by the Department of Transport.  It is obvious the Department in the issuing of licences in this case and others is giving preferential treatment to Dublin Bus.</P>
        <P>This is not the way in the present circumstances, where small businesses are crying out for help, to assist a small business to give employment and I suspect there is more to this than just the semi-State monopoly ethos.  I guess there are trade unions behind this that oppose competition at all costs.  It is one example of the predatory pricing in which Dublin Bus has indulged.  I ask the Minister to act now before a crisis occurs for the company and to put an end to such practices by a semi-State body for which he has full responsibility.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator has raised concerns about Dublin Bus engaging in predatory behaviour in the operation of its network of services in Dublin and has referred specifically to the routes operated by Swords Express between Swords and the city centre and by Dublin Bus on the 41X service from Swords to the UCD campus at Belfield via the city centre.  Dublin Bus has operated for some years a range of services between Swords and the city centre and, in particular, operates six services a day on the 41X services between Swords and Belfield via the city centre.  These services are provided in the morning only.</P>
        <P>In October 2007, a licence was granted by the Department of Transport under the Road Transport Act 1932 to Swords Express to operate 91 services per day between Swords and the city centre via the Dublin Port Tunnel.  Subsequently, Dublin Bus notified the Department of its intention to re-route some of its existing services, including the 41X service from Swords, through the tunnel to provide customers with a faster journey time.</P>
        <P>In response, the Department advised Dublin Bus on 20 February 2008 and again on 20 March 2008 that its proposals in respect of the 41X services would give rise to competition with the licensed service by Swords Express.  The company was accordingly advised that should it wish to pursue the introduction of the proposed service changes, it must apply for the Minister&rsquo;s consent under section 25 of the Transport Act 1958.  Alternatively, the company was advised that it could review its proposals to avoid competition with the licensed operator.</P>
        <P>On 5 June 2008, Dublin Bus submitted a revised proposal for the rerouting of the 41X.  The Department considered the proposal and was satisfied that the changes proposed would not compete with the Swords Express service and concluded, therefore, that it did not require ministerial consent in accordance with section 25 of the Transport Act 1958.  Dublin Bus was advised on the 12 June 2008 that it could proceed with the proposed changes.</P>
        <P>That determination was the subject of a High Court challenge in October 2008 brought by the operators of the Swords Express bus service.  As part of the out of court settlement of the High Court proceedings, the Department undertook to carry out an investigation under section 25(2) of the Transport Act 1958 regarding the decision in respect of the 41X service and the parties were invited to make submissions as to whether the Minister should grant consent under section 25(1) of the 1958 Act to Dublin Bus to continue to operate the 41X service on its current route.</P>
        <P>Having considered those submissions, the Minister has confirmed that consent.  However, as consent under section 25(1) of the 1958 Act is based on the determination that the service is in competition with the Swords Express service, Dublin Bus has been informed that State funding cannot be allocated to the operation of the 41X service.  The company has, therefore, been requested to provide the Department with confirmation of compliance with that require<Col N="1053"/>ment.  It is open to Dublin Bus to present proposals to the Department for an altered service on the 41X route that would not compete with the licensed operation.  The operators of the Swords Express service are being advised of the position.</P>

      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>Dublin Bus has been told it cannot use public funds to run this service.  Does that mean it can no longer run the service or must it somehow prove it is not using public funds to run the service?  How does it do that?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>It must either present proposals showing it is not using public funds or it must not compete with the service.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>How does it demonstrate that it is not using public funds?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not in a position to say how it will be done but I will ask the Department to respond to the Senator.  Subsidies are paid to Dublin Bus and under section 25(1) in such circumstances it is not allowed to compete with another operator.  If it wishes to provide a service that is not subsidised, it must submit a proposal.  Otherwise, there is the alternative of not going into competition.  Those are the two options.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister of State ask the Department to provide me with a clarification of this matter?</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Finneran, for taking this Adjournment matter.  I raised the situation of Gaelscoil Bharra in Dublin 7 on the Adjournment on a previous occasion and today I propose briefly to outline how the situation has changed in the interim.  This gaelscoil, which is extremely successful and popular, has been located in temporary prefabricated buildings for 13 years.  Parents in the area it serves are enormously supportive of the school which does a fantastic job of teaching and supporting its pupils.</P>
        <P>The management committee of the school has made many efforts to progress its status and to secure its inclusion on the schools building list.  Since I last raised this issue in the House some months ago, the school has concluded discussions with Naomh Fionnbarra GAA club which owns the land upon which the prefabricated accommodation is located.  The club is supportive of the provision of permanent accommodation for the school on this site.  The school management is now in discussions with Dublin City Council on procedures to facilitate the rezoning of the land to allow for the provision of permanent accommodation.</P>
        <P>What is hindering the progression of this project is the most important ingredient, namely, approval and funding from the Department of Education and Science to facilitate the delivery of permanent accommodation for the school.  I will continue to raise this issue until such time as the Department offers a commitment that it will do all it can to provide a permanent school building on the current site in respect of which great progress has been made in terms of zoning and acquisition.  All the stakeholders are supportive of the work taking place.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>I am taking this Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe.  I thank the Senator for raising this matter as it provides me with the opportunity to outline to the House the Government&rsquo;s strategy for capital investment in education projects and the current position in regard to future plans for Gaelscoil Bharra, Cabra.</P><Col N="1054"/>
        <P>Efforts to modernise facilities in the existing building stock and to respond to emerging needs in areas of rapid population growth represent a significant challenge.  Such efforts are a priority for the Minister for Education and Science.  The Government has dramatically increased capital investment in the schools building programme to an unprecedented level which reflects its commitment to continue its programme of sustained investment in primary and post-primary schools.  This investment will underpin our particular emphasis on the delivery of additional school places in rapidly developing areas while continuing to facilitate our commitment to delivering improvements in the quality of existing primary and post-primary accommodation throughout the State.</P>
        <P>The Office of Public Works, which acts on behalf of the Department in regard to site acquisitions generally, was requested to source a greenfield site for this gaelscoil.  On foot of advertising, no proposals were received for such a site in the Cabra area.  As a result, the issue of providing a permanent school on the existing temporary site then came into focus.  To pursue this further, meetings have taken place between the Department and Dublin City Council regarding the potential availability of this site.  The Department wrote to the council with a proposal that a lease arrangement be put in place.  Officials from the Department met the city council and representatives of the GAA club to discuss the issue of entering into a lease arrangement with the council which in time will require the GAA club to surrender its interest on some of the lands required for a building project.</P>
         <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>In February 2009, Department officials met separately representatives of Naomh Fionnbarra GAA club to discuss three potential design options to allow for the provision of an eight-classroom school on the site.  The club responded by way of letter in March 2009 indicating its preferred design option based on the options presented by the Department and highlighting its concerns that car parking for its members and the school&rsquo;s teaching staff be addressed.  On foot of this, the Department wrote to Dublin City Council advising it of the design option favoured by the GAA club and requested the council to consider a technical assessment of the site incorporating the views of the GAA.  At the end of May 2009, the Department received Dublin City Council&rsquo;s observations on the proposed design and these are being examined.  The Department will contact Naomh Fionnbarra GAA club when this exercise is completed.</P>
        <P>The further progression of the acquisition of this site and the accompanying building project will be considered in the context of the capital budget available to the Department for school buildings generally.  I thank the Senator once again for affording me the opportunity to outline to the House the current position in regard to future plans for Gaelscoil Bharra in Cabra.</P>

However, it included the ominous phrase that progress will be dependent on the &ldquo;capital budget available to the Department for school buildings generally&rdquo;.  I will continue to raise this matter here and elsewhere to ensure the project is steered to a conclusion.</P>

      <sTitle>Health Services.</sTitle>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>The issue I am raising is a specific one but it arises in the context of a more general problem in the health service, namely, that hospital beds are being occupied by persons who do not require hospital care but rather nursing care or special assistance.  A gentleman whom I will not name who suffers from Parkinson&rsquo;s disease and is confined to a wheelchair has been cared for in an acute surgical ward in St. Columcille&rsquo;s Hospital, Loughlins<Col N="1055"/>town, for some time.  The medical advice and the advice of social workers is that it is inappropriate for him to remain thus as there is no specific medical need for him to be in hospital at this juncture.  It is intimated that 50% of hospital beds in St. Columcille&rsquo;s Hospital are inappropriately used.  In other words, beds are being allocated to people who do not require hospital treatment but instead require some type of home or nursing facility care.</P>
     
        <P>There is a vacancy available for the person in question in the Cheshire Home in Blackrock, which is the type of facility most suited to his condition.  However, the problem is that, although this unit can provide all the facilities he requires, funding is needed for a carer or personal assistant.  The cost of providing such assistance would be far less than the cost of keeping this person in hospital. The quality of life of the person would be immeasurably enhanced if he were cared for in a residential unit such as that provided at the Cheshire Home rather than in a hospital.  Serious costs are being incurred as a result of this individual&rsquo;s occupying a hospital bed.  I accept that it is the sympathy attracted by people who find themselves in this position which leads to the overall problem of their being kept in hospital when they should be cared for elsewhere.</P>
        <P>A solution could be provided in the case to which I refer by the person in question being offered a place in the Blackrock Cheshire Home.  The costs relating thereto would be far less than those incurred by his occupying a public bed in Loughlinstown Hospital.  When would funding be made available to employ a carer for this individual if we were given a place in the Blackrock Cheshire Home?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>I am replying to this matter on behalf of the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney.  The Health Service Executive will undertake a case review in respect of the person named by the Senator to establish how his needs can be met.  The accommodation at the Cheshire Home in Blackrock is not designed to meet the needs of the individual referred to by the Senator.  It is not, therefore, appropriate that this individual be transferred from Loughlinstown Hospital to the Cheshire Home in Blackrock.</P>
        <P>The HSE has a list of individuals who require personal assistant supports and will review this case in line with other competing priorities.  The Cheshire Home in Blackrock was developed to provide accommodation for a number of individuals with physical disabilities who require minimal or no additional supports.  At this time a vacancy exists at the Cheshire Home but the HSE, in discussion with those in charge at the home, have agreed that, in light of the greatest current need, this place should be utilised for respite because this will address the priority needs of a number of individuals.</P>
        <P>Where an individual requires the support of a personal assistant, the facility at Blackrock is not the appropriate place to meet his or her need.  The Government has invested heavily in health and personal social services for people with disabilities.  Additional funding and services have been provided under the Government&rsquo;s multi-annual investment programme.  For each additional personal assistant appointed in recent years, individuals with disabilities received the appropriate supports they require in their daily lives.  In this context, an additional 900,000 personal assistance-home support hours were provided between 2005 and 2008 for people with physical and sensory disabilities.  This year, the HSE plans to deliver 3.2 million hours of personal assistance-home support.  Despite the substantial increase in service provision, the Government acknowledges the significant demand for new services and recognises that there is a growing requirement to enhance existing services.  The Government has continued its commitment to develop public health services in line with its budgetary strategy in order to provide a sustainable and significant level of funding for public health services in line with economic circumstances.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his reply and I welcome the HSE&rsquo;s undertaking to engage in a case review in respect of the person in question.  I hope the statement to the effect that the Cheshire Home in Blackrock is not suitable is not an indication that the case review is being prejudged.  However, I again welcome the commitment to review the needs of the individual to whom I refer.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator may wish to take into account that the Cheshire Home is of the same opinion as the HSE in respect of this matter.</P>
