	<P>I have received notice from Senator David Norris that he proposes to raise the following matter on the Adjournment:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to review as a matter of urgency the changes to State funding for Protestant, voluntary and Jewish schools in budget 2009, as well as certain recommendations of the McCarthy report in so far as they affect the Protestant, voluntary and Jewish schools in order to avoid unintentional but serious discriminatory effects.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Cecilia Keaveney of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources to make a statement on how the future development of the River Foyle can be co-ordinated and maximised across all possible marine uses under one potential cross-Border agency.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I do not know if the work of the House can be done in a proper manner if the current crisis regarding politicians&rsquo; expenses is not dealt with quickly.  In eight weeks we will be presented with a budget which will probably be the worst in the history of the State.  Eight weeks is very little time to discuss issues such as the McCarthy report, the report of the Commission on Taxation and the cutbacks and increased taxes Ministers are proposing.  Until we have a clear and open discussion on expenses and deal with that issue the general public will not listen to what is debated in either House.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I ask the Leader to approach the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission with a view to putting Members&rsquo; expenses on the Oireachtas website in order that there would be no need for freedom of information requests and so called exposures in the media.  Let us make this information freely available to the public on the Oireachtas website and let them decide if our <Col N="260"/>expenses are extravagant.  There have been abuses of expenses at the top of the Government which are being drip-fed by the media, creating unbelievable anger.  A tsunami of anger against the Government is percolating down to every politician and public representative.  This is unfair on the majority of politicians who perform a public service, which we are proud to do.  There must be a clear and open debate on the issue soon.  If the media need more information, it should be put on the Oireachtas website in order that the people can decide.  If other Ministers have been extravagant with taxpayers&rsquo; money, let them do the honourable thing and resign.  This issue is having a detrimental effect on public debate of important issues.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with much of what the previous speaker said. We should have a debate on the question of Oireachtas expenses.  We have asked for such a debate before.  When I was a member of the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission more than two years ago, I proposed that every application for expenses by a Member of either House should be published in <i>Iris Oifigi&uacute;il </i>or on the Oireachtas website.  I can see no objection to this.  The people are getting incomplete information. There are issues which need to be put to the public.  Travel and subsistence regulations are not understood.  The travel and subsistence regime in both Houses was designed, not by parliamentarians but by the Department of Finance, to save the State money.  However, it is being completely misrepresented.  For instance, rural Deputies have an entitlement to claim for a number of trips to Leinster House in the course of a fortnight, while Dublin Deputies claim a number of daily allowances.  It is not explained to the people that Members, whether based in Dublin or elsewhere, can claim no other travel expenses of any type during the course of a fortnight.  They receive an allowance to cover certain constituency duties but there is no question of them going here and there and claiming payment.  That has not been explained.  If the public wants expenses to be published, that is what we have to do.  It would not save money, but it would bring transparency.  We need to look at the matter in that way.  There is a public culture which believes the political system is corrupt and in a comfort culture and that everyone else is suffering.  If that is the case, we must accept that we need to change things.  We must begin by publishing every expenses claim, whether from Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole or anyone else.  There should be a clear understanding of what expenses are for and where the money is going.  It must be understood that Members of the Houses, apart from senior Ministers, have no say in choosing hotels or flights.  They do not see that money.  What I am saying may sound defensive but it is merely an explanation which needs to be given.  There should be a clear understanding of every part of it.  </P>
        <P>There has been criticism of unvouched expenses.  These were originally estimated to be 80% of what the commission considered vouched expenses would cost.  The level was arrived at by Goodbody&rsquo;s which calculated that a Senator or Deputy would claim X amount in the course of a year.  It was decided that 80% of that amount should be given in unvouched expenses but that expenses one penny above that amount must be backed up with a receipt.  The idea was to save 20% of costs.  Time has passed and that system does not work any more.  We must now move to whatever system receives the greatest public reaction and ensures transparency.  We should debate this matter, not in a defensive way but in order that it can be explained to the people.  Our expenses should be published.  If Members think that is unfair, we should benchmark our expenses against those in the private sector.  However, no one in the private sector would be expected to live in Schull, be in Dublin three days a week and look after a constituency in Cork on the other days.  There is no real reference point in the private sector.  Nevertheless, there are issues at which we must look.  We must use private sector benchmarks to determine our expenses and what we are entitled to receive.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>I spoke yesterday about the need to reform the expenses system.  As can be seen in the media today, this issue will not go away.  We must deal with it.  The reputation of Parliament is under scrutiny.  The people do not believe the current system is transparent.  I ask the Leader to impress upon the Minister the need to act on the matter now.</P>
        <P>I welcome the news that University College Dublin and Dublin University are ranked in the top 100 universities in the world and that other Irish universities are also improving their rankings.  This is a tribute to the hard work of students and lecturers in both universities.  However, we should not take their performance for granted.  It is dependent on good primary and secondary education systems.  I am concerned, therefore, to see reports that up to half the school building budget for this year has not been spent.  This probably means that another 1,000 construction jobs could have been started in the country.  We must ask why the budget has not been spent.  My party has been pushing for this.  We are in the middle of a baby boom.  Ireland has the highest birth rate in Europe.  It is twice as high as that in Germany and Austria.  In 2008 there were 75,000 births in the country, an increase of 10,000 on the figure for the previous year.  That means another 300 to 400 classrooms will be needed in 2011 and 2012.  We need to start planning for this now.  If we fail to spend the money which is approved for schools building projects, we will have problems in two years time.  We need to know why this has happened.  I have seen the lack of school places in County Meath.  We must solve the problem now.  I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on the issue of budgetary provision in the primary school system.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the call for an open and transparent debate on the issue of expenses.  Senator Twomey is broadly correct in asking for such a debate.  It might clear some of the fog and cloud which surround issues such as this.  When I was a Deputy and ran a constituency office, my office running costs in 2003 were &euro;23,500, which were vouched.  I received an allowance of less than &euro;9,000.  My telephone expenses were three times the allowance.  I would like to see transparency in this matter.  Members of the public are angry.  They do not understand the system; broad global figures are published which paint an untrue picture of the work Senators and Deputies do.  We need transparency.  The House should debate the matter. </P>
        <P>For some time I have been asking for a debate on the fishing industry.  The Leader promised to give it priority when we returned in the autumn.  Without meaning to annoy him, will he arrange a debate on the Common Fisheries Policy which is being cobbled together?  As it is of considerable interest to our coastal communities, we should have an input in it.</P>
        <P>It is crazy that we must go to Brussels each year and negotiate the precise quota for each species.  It is not known from one year to the next.  Fishermen must plan ahead, but they are only told the herring, hake, mackerel or whitefish quota two or three days before Christmas.  It is an uncertain situation and the annual talks frustrate fishermen.  A debate on this topic is overdue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I agree with Senator Twomey and compliment Senator Hannigan whom I heard on radio this morning.  He fairly and accurately outlined the position <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> the commission and the Department of Finance.  There has been a delay and that logjam must be broken down and cleared.  I agree with Senator O&rsquo;Toole and others that no one would object to the figures being published monthly on the website or in <i>Iris Oifigi&uacute;il</i>.  No one is trying to hide anything.  When these figures appear in the press, they appear large because they cover a period of one or two years, as in the recent case.  However, they represent a reimbursement for the expenses incurred by Members.  As stated by Senator O&rsquo;Donovan and others, we must clear the fog.  I would welcome a debate in the House.</P>
<Col N="262"/>
        <P>Once again, I will make a plea regarding Killarney House, a great and historic landmark building in the heart of our national park.  It has been allowed to fall into rack and ruin.  Upon recent examination, not a single cent of the basic moneys allegedly provided to secure the fabric of the house seems to have been expended.  It is terrible to see the petty vandalism and so on that has befallen the vicinity.  It does not speak well for us.  The house is a beautiful building in a beautiful part of the world.  Visitors like to stroll casually down the cherry orchard drive close by.  I am making another plea.  This situation is injuring our tourism.  We are suffering as it is and we have not had a good season, as the Leader knows.  Will he use his influence with the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, as he did previously?  The house is attached to the national parks and wildlife service, which falls within the heritage remit of the Minister&rsquo;s Department.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not wish to enter the debate on expenses.  The country is facing so many situations that the debate is a distraction.  I would have no difficulty in having the information published on the web whenever it suited the commission instead of seeing the different directions being taken in freedom of information requests.  The next <i>Sunday Independent</i> and <i>Sunday Tribune</i> issues will show the travel arrangements of Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas, but none of the reasons for attending meetings abroad will be provided.  The expenses date back to 2005, but the amounts will be combined to undermine us as much as possible.  Whatever arrangement or regime is brought into place, it should not cost the Oireachtas more in terms of scrutinising expenses claims.</P>
        <P>Three of the Senators present are on the Council of Europe, of which Ireland was a founder member 60 years ago.  We sent representatives in 1949 and will send representatives this year to take our place in an important forum.  This costs, but Members&rsquo; airline tickets and accommodation expenses are not given to them.  They will not sleep in doorways in Strasbourg, but they are not worried about their accommodation as long as it is reasonable.  Ryanair has done a tremendous job in reducing the cost of flights for Members.  Michael O&rsquo;Leary deserves credit for his achievements in providing us with access to Europe.  No explanation for the expenses is given, as the media is not interested in the Council of Europe&rsquo;s work, but it is vital that Ireland be represented in all international forums.  We are an independent republic and we fought hard to be there.  Surely we should also continue our membership of the Inter-Parliamentary Union, IPU.</P>

	<P>I rose to ask the Leader a question.  I commend everyone involved in winning last Friday&rsquo;s referendum.  No single group or party was responsible for that success, since it was the choice of the people, in their wisdom, to vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; decisively.  Arising from the referendum, will the Leader arrange an early debate?  Poland will sign the treaty next Sunday and I am confident the Czech Republic will sign it shortly because they will not want to be isolated.  The House should discuss the Lisbon treaty&rsquo;s implications for Members of the Oireachtas.  There would be no better forum in which to discuss European legislation than Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  It comprises people of all qualifications and interests.</P>

	<P>I wanted to call for a debate on education in light of the unspent moneys at the Department of Education and Science and the wonderful news about Trinity College Dublin and UCD numbering among the world&rsquo;s first 50 and 100 universities, respectively, but I cannot.</P>
        <P>I am furious, given the way in which the House and its politicians are being treated.  I would be happy to sign up to making everything transparent.  I would like the people to know how often and for how long I am here.  I would like them to know that the ushers ask me at 10 p.m. when I will be leaving Leinster House.</P>
        <P>With fury, I listened to an item on RTE radio this morning.  It was headlined &ldquo;Corruption&rdquo;, but it was about the expenses of Senators and Deputies.  I feel sullied because we are all being tarred with the same brush.  I damn anyone who impugns my integrity in the public arena by name, as he or she will wind up in the courts.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>A couple of months ago, I was telephoned by a tabloid newspaper and asked how I could justify travelling expenses of &euro;6,000 or so.  I told the newspaper that I could not.  When I was asked whether I had anything else to say, I stated that I had never claimed a single penny because I walked every day, as I walked today.  I have never claimed travelling expenses.  It was a daily allowance, but it appeared in a newspaper article under the headline &ldquo;Politicians with snouts in their trough&rdquo; alongside my photograph.  The one thing that the newspaper did not mention was that my expenses were the second lowest in the entire House.</P>
        <P>Let us have a bit of responsible journalism and an historical review.  I would like the people to know our attendance levels because we all attend well.  I would like them to know my voting record, my attendance at committee meetings, my contributions, the legislation that I have tabled and the hours that I have worked.  Let them have the whole damn lot, but I will not have my honour and integrity impugned.  If newspapers go on like this, they will drive all the decent people out of politics, leaving only the dross.  It will be what they bloody well deserve.</P>

	<P>I am angry.  Before the war, I visited Baghdad in an attempt to secure the human rights of the unfortunate people of Iraq.  We got 43p per day because we were slavishly following the British instruction, but the British wanted to keep people like myself out of Iraq.</P>
        <P>What can we do?  We must be open.  I believed that the item on corruption was going to be about Berlusconi.  I remember the scandals in the Roman Catholic Church.  Although I was one of the most trenchant critics, I stood up every time and stated that, because there were decent people, we should not tar everyone with the same brush.  Let us have the facts and examine the real situation.  When I attended a meeting of the IPU in Australia, I was given a first class ticket but I traded it in and travelled third class, even to Beijing where, on my own initiative, I raised questions that led to a significant cultural exchange.  I was telephoned about the trip beforehand and asked whether I would enjoy myself on the so-called junket.  The tabloid wrote its article before the trip.</P>
        <P>I had a stand-up row with Mr. Gareth Evans about the situation in what was then East Timor and raised the matter of AIDS.  I had things forced through that were reported in the medical and British newspapers, but there was not a single bloody line in the Irish newspapers.</P>

	<P>I sincerely thank Senator Norris for the comments he has just made.  He is 100% correct.  I am extremely annoyed about this entire situation and for the Members of this House.  They are not getting a fair crack of the whip and have not for many years.  A number of Senators in this House, the Cathaoirleach included when he was not in his current position, run offices but what do they get towards the running of that office?  They get nothing.  Those of us who run a full-time office, as I do, must go out and fund-raise.  I do not get a cent.  I am paid by the taxpayer and I believe I am entitled to give a service.  I should not receive a salary and expenses and sit in the comfort of my own house or wherever and give nothing back to the people.  That is wrong, but what are the Members of this House getting towards that?  They get nothing.  When we pick up our phone to call our constituents we are liable to ring every STD code in the country because that is the diversity of our electorate yet we receive approximately 25% less towards that than Members of the other House, and more luck to the Members of the other House.  By all means let us have transparency and openness but we must see where the balance lies.  The Members of this House have been short-changed for a very long time.  I have no problem with whatever regime is put in place to verify my attendance.  I am always here.  I know many Members of both sides of the House who are always here.  By all means let us have this expos&eacute; or whatever it is.  I have no problem with it.</P>
        <P>On another matter, I again ask the Leader to exhort the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to come to the House for a debate on insurance premia.  Since I raised the matter previously I have been contacted by a number of people.  The hikes in insurance premia in recent times are not sustainable and as a House of Parliament we cannot stand idly by, let it happen and do nothing about it.  It is outrageous.</P>
        <P>The motor trade is on its knees.  A scrappage scheme for cars should be introduced.  I will not determine the age of the cars that should be included because it depends on the way people look after their cars.  I would welcome a debate on that issue too.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>We are talking here as if the barbarians are at the gate on this issue.  The reality is that we have problems in these Houses with allowances and expenses.  We must also acknowledge that the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission, in February of this year, put forward a proposal on the reform of allowances.  Senators on the Fianna F&aacute;il benches have explained what happens at parliamentary party meetings.  Will the Leader explain what happened at Fianna F&aacute;il parliamentary party meetings on the proposal from the Oireachtas commission?  Were objections not raised to the Oireachtas commission&rsquo;s proposal on allowances?  Is that not the reason the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, has not acted on that proposal?  The Minister, Deputy Lenihan, is being a Shylock on this issue because he is now suggesting that the Oireachtas commission&rsquo;s proposal does not go far enough when he has not responded in any shape or form to the initiative made by the Oireachtas commission.  It may not be a perfect proposal but it is a start in reforming the allowances regime.  Will the Leader clarify the reason there has been such an absence by the Minister?  Perhaps the Minister could be invited to come into the House to explain himself because it is very easy now to say it does not go far enough in responding to the recent incidents regarding the Ceann Comhairle.  The issue has lain with the Minister, he has not dealt with it and now he is changing his story in terms of the appropriate measures to be taken.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I raise the issue of education.  There was an excellent wide-ranging conference at Farmleigh involving the diaspora and successful business entrepreneurs, both Irish and others with strong Irish connections.  A heavy emphasis was laid on education and developing a new vision for education.  Could we have a debate with the Minister present who might outline to us some of the ideas and suggestions put forward at the conference with a view to determining what might be worked on and put into effect, given the constraints on public finances?</P>
        <P>With regard to the main topic this morning, the expenses issue, I am a member of the commission and also of the audit committee.  I fully accept the right and justification of <i>The Irish Times</i> to make a freedom of information request and in particular to deal with the resignation of the chairman of the audit committee.  His letter has been published in full in <i>The Irish Times</i>.  I thought it was somewhat unbalanced that the reply to the chairman of the audit committee from the Secretary General, who has no axe to grind as he is an independent member and the chief executive of the Houses of the Oireachtas, which was also part of the documents released to <i>The Irish Times</i>, was not also published in full to allow people to read both Mr. Higgins&rsquo;s point of view and the reply from the Secretary General.  That would have brought more balance to it, which is important in this media pursuit of Members&rsquo; expenses.  There is an entitlement for them to do that, and there should be probity in politics &mdash; most politicians I am aware of want that &mdash; but there is a need also to take a balanced view.</P>
        <P>The audit committee and the Oireachtas commission would have fully accepted the recommendations in the Goodbody report, an independent body, which was done on the commission prior to my involvement in it.  Senator O&rsquo;Toole has outlined that.  That report was independently done and it preferred a system of certain minimum allowances, which as the Senator said was pitched at about 80% of what they reckon might be the norm, and that anything in excess of that would be vouched.  That was passed in March 2008 by both the committee, signed off by the chairman of the audit committee, and the Oireachtas commission and sent to the Minister.  The Minister, in reviewing that, had some issues with regard to vouching which needed to be clarified and we were then overtaken by the economic downturn, which changed the remit of the expenses issue.  To be fair to the Minister, since then expenses have been reduced.  He has taken action in that area.  Little merit has been given to anybody in that regard.  We need a system that is fair and reasonable both to the Members and to the taxpayers.</P>

I share the concern expressed by others at the way in which all Members have been tarred with the same brush as a result of the revelations in <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> in particular but I urge caution about attacking the media.  <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> and others have done a public service in doing their job as investigative journalists in seeking&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;information on abuse.  We need to be clear about this.  Of course, the majority are not abusing the system of expenses but, where there are unjustifiable claims, overspending and lavish travel, there is real and justified public anger.  I disagree with Senator Leyden who said this was just a distraction.  We must consider the matter in the context of the real world, in which people are losing jobs and facing pay cuts and house repossessions for defaulting on mortgage repayments.  People are more angered in such circumstances than they would be at any other time by revelations of excessive spending in the Houses of the Oireachtas or Ministers&rsquo; expenses.  We should make it clear in a debate that a different regime applies to Ministers&rsquo; expenses.  They are not subject to the same scrutiny as those of Members of the Seanad.</P>
        <P>I ask the Leader for a debate on education.  I welcome, as others have done, the good news that both UCD and Trinity College are now ranked in the top 100 colleges in the world.  Trinity College has moved up to 43rd place and is now ranked 13th in Europe.  This is excellent news and tribute must be paid to all involved, both students and staff.  This ranking is in the face of very severe cutbacks in the education sector.</P>
        <P>I echo Senator Hannigan&rsquo;s call for a debate on overall funding, particularly in the light of the disturbing news that funds allocated for the schools building programme were not fully spent, despite the clear needs of so many primary schools nationally.  We need to address severe deficiencies in funding at third level.  Yesterday I attended a protest organised by the students&rsquo; union of Dublin Institute of Technology, DIT, at which protest the impact of cuts at the institute was very clearly outlined by the large numbers of students present.  The DIT which has 22,000 students is the largest third level institute in Ireland.  It makes a considerable commitment to facilitating disadvantaged and second-chance students.  The cutbacks have had a severe impact and the hours worked by both full-time and part-time staff have been cut.  The staff complement has decreased and laboratories and libraries have been closed.  Even rubbish disposal has been affected; we have seen rubbish piling up in DIT campuses because of the absence of sufficient funding.  We need to address this issue.  The DIT is ranked only 326th in the world and needs to raise its status.  However, it cannot do so in the present climate.</P>

	<P>I agree with Senator Norris on an issue I raised yesterday.  Bearing in mind the concept of natural justice, one should consider the need for fair and balanced reporting.  Senator Bacik should note that Members of the Seanad are only looking for fair play on the part of the media.  The media submit freedom of information requests to determine Members&rsquo; expenses and the information is presented in a manner that outlines, step by step, what Members received money for.  The information shows Senators do not receive an office allowance or many of the other allowances available.  However, the reasons for the payment of expenses are not explained in the newspapers and only the overall sum of money is referred to.</P>
        <P>Let us consider the announcement to be made this weekend and the circumstances that will obtain if Senator Leyden is correct.  Let me outline exactly what I am asking for.  I do not want a right of reply, nor do I want to be seen to be defending myself after the event.  However, the information made available under the freedom of information request outlined where we had gone and what we had done.  For five years I was Chairman of a very busy committee which produced 13 reports.  Not one media representative arrived at the launch of most of those reports.  I will probably have to explain myself after the event because I am assured, on the basis of performance, that the information sought in the second part of the freedom of information request will never be published in a newspaper at the same time as the part listing the overall sum of money.  All I ask for is natural justice.</P>
        <P>I can stand over the work I do.  I am present in the House and busy.  I work nationally, locally and internationally and I am proud of what I do.  I am told at the Council of Europe that I am doing a good job but I would like that to be reflected here.  When I was asked to explain my expenses recently on a local radio station, I said I had just had a report agreed by 47 states on teaching history in areas with a recent history of conflict.  Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bosnia, Croatia and the Greek and Turkish Cypriots voted in favour of my report, which was unheard of.  When I raised this issue, I was told it was not really of interest because the media in question receive press releases every day.  I refer to local media, not national media.  I ask for fair play.</P>
        <P>I commend the Minister for Education and Science on the significant savings of up to 30% made in the schools building programme.  I ask that more projects be front-loaded.  The circumstances are the same as those that obtain in local development companies and local development partnerships.  They are only allocating money for 2009, although they know their budgets for 2010 and 2011.  It takes time to draw down the money.  In so far as the Department can front-load to a greater degree, this must be done in respect of the local development companies and partnerships.</P>

	<P>On Monday afternoon two truckloads of TB-infected cattle were stolen in Keady and on the Castleblayney Road, just a few hundred metres inside the Border in Northern Ireland.  They were to be taken to a designated meat plant for destruction by the Northern Ireland Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs.  I mention this because it reminds us of what occurred last year in the pig industry.  This problem could devastate us.  We have been fighting a great battle for many years to eradicate the blight of TB in cattle.  Just when we hoped we were getting somewhere, we discovered the cattle stolen at two locations in Northern Ireland, in a very professional manner, were likely to end up on farms south of the Border.  This warrants considerable publicity.  It is not enough to notify the meat plants in order that they will be aware of the problem because the issue requires very heavy and strong publicity to ensure no farmer will be tempted to buy the cattle.</P>
        <P>Yesterday I raised the question of life expectancy because I was stunned by the figures I had seen.  I have since learned more.  The figures suggest we in the West, in Ireland, for example, have a life expectancy far beyond that of people in Africa.  Pneumococcal disease is preventable and money has been allocated for this purpose, yet two million children under the age of five <Col N="268"/>years die each year from it in the developing world.  There are vaccines available and they are being used in the western world.  A startling figure which puts numbers into perspective is that for each child who dies from pneumonia in an industrialised country, more than 2,000 children die from it in developing countries.  We have solved the problem in the western world but have not told the developing world what to do about it.  Will the Leader ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs whether Irish Aid is drawing attention to the fact that the disease can be prevented?  It should be impressed upon him that Ireland should play its part &mdash; it is only a little part and does not require money.  My attention has been drawn to the fact that &euro;1.5 billion is required to develop a sustainable supply of the vaccines required.  Of the 71 countries eligible to receive them, only 20 have applied to use them.  It is a question of publicity; this is what the Minister could be doing through Irish Aid.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Senator John Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>Economies around the world are slowly coming out of recession and it looks as if the long-term difficulty will be the long-term unemployed.  Will the Leader consider arranging a debate in which Senators could make suggestions to the Government on F&Aacute;S-sponsored job creation and other employment techniques that could be used to get people back to work quickly?  We could fast-track ideas that might help to stave of the loss of jobs.  I refer, in particular, to the retail sector, in respect of which we could work hand in hand with Northern Ireland to establish a tax regime such that there would be no benefit associated with travelling across the Border.  Criminal gangs exploit price differences on both sides of the Border, particularly with regard to fuels, and claim a political motive.  The Seanad would serve its time well by addressing this issue.</P>
        <P>With regard to the expenses controversy, will the Leader highlight the very real part of politics that the media refuse to consider?  It has been most unusual for Senators to have five-year terms.  In the early 1980s there were three elections one after another.  Certain individuals were elected in the first two and lost the third.  In today&rsquo;s terms, this cost a Member of the D&aacute;il &euro;100,000 in the year of an election and a Senator, &euro;30,000.  There is no security of employment.  We are not employees but Members.  We do not have the rights of an employee.  The reality is that we are self-employed and have real costs because we are in the public eye.  I heard one Member here say he gives up to a third of his salary in donations every year.  We should have a full debate on the matter.  The expenses regime exists to help with what was a very difficult position for politicians.  The media would be the first to complain if politics became a rich man&rsquo;s preserve.</P>

	<P>The Minister for Education and Science can cut classes and services but young children, like those in the Gallery behind us, in many schools across the country are being taught in dilapidated buildings with no gyms or libraries.  They are being taught in prefabs and rat-infested classrooms.  Is the Government going to preside over this?  I want the Minister to come before the House to account for the fact that only &euro;455 million from the &euro;841 million budget has been spent this year.  If the tenders are lower, why is that money not allocated to other projects?</P>
<Col N="269"/>
        <P>Every week in this House and the other House Members seek Adjournment debates, Private Members&rsquo; motions and parliamentary questions on school building programmes.  It is time for transparency and accountability in the Department of Education and Science on schools building projects.</P>
        <P>I join Senator Twomey in asking for details of our expenses to be put up on the Oireachtas website.  There is no need to hide because of shame; I have no problem with the details of what I get being published.  Will the Minister for Finance come before the House to explain what he will do with ministerial expenses?  What is the cost of the staff and advisers used by Ministers, their departmental credit cards, the State cars and the Government jet?</P>
        <P>We have spoken about transparency and the Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, has been on the radio today trying to earn kudos for himself.  When his Government colleagues were asked if they would publish their expenses, they said the Minister for Finance is introducing a new expenses regime and Ministers will comply with it.  If the Government is serious about reforming the Oireachtas expenses, let they who lead show the people and other Members what they cost the taxpayer.  They should lead by example and publish their costs in full.</P>
        <P>Our expenses have been published through freedom of information requests and I have no difficulty with that.  Like Senator Norris, I am not afraid to be held accountable for what I do and spend in my life in politics.  Ministers should act similarly.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Senator Michael McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">We have all at some level or another been involved with the discussion on reforming the expenses system.  It is my understanding that at the start of this year, a sensible proposal was put to the Minister for Finance by those on the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission.  That proposal is still just lying there.  In the interests of accountability, transparency and, most importantly, the body politic, it is most important that whatever scheme or reform is to take place is implemented immediately and everybody subscribes to it.</P>
        <P>I will mention two anomalies.  At the start of this year I and other people who served in this House over the last term and this term would have qualified for a long service increment.  That was quite rightly stopped in July this year and we did not get it.  The people who made the decision to stop it had already received a long service increment and did not forfeit it.  It is a gross insult to those who have lost their jobs that serving Members of the D&aacute;il and Seanad are in receipt of ministerial pensions.</P>
        <P>We should bring everything to the discussion and we should all subscribe to the decision made, draw a line and move on in the interests of democracy and the body politic in particular.  There is a strong anti-politics agenda being pursued by some elements of the media, and this should be avoided at all costs.</P>

There has been a 10% reduction in all expenses <Col N="271"/>other than travel available to Members of the D&aacute;il and Seanad.  That must be put into the public domain.  As I have stated, there have been reductions in Minister&rsquo;s salaries, travel expenses and all other expenses.  We are working on the issue and action has been taken.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There will be a level-headed debate in this House with participation from people who have invested all their lives in giving the best possible service as Members of the Oireachtas.  I know many Senators are concerned about this.  The current problems relating to transparency must be addressed but this process will save the taxpayer nothing; in my opinion it will cost the taxpayer much more.  That is from somebody with much experience of serving with many Members in this House on various committees, including those dealing with Members&rsquo; interests and the Committee on Procedures and Privilege, which deal with operations of the House.  I will propose such a debate within the next two weeks.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senators Hannigan, Norris, Twomey, Bacik, Keaveney, Buttimer and Walsh congratulated UCD and Trinity College on their world ranking.</P>
        <P>With regard to expenditure in the Department of Education and Science, the value for money which is being found by the Department and the Minister in the schools building programme is second to none.  There have been reductions of between 20% and 30% in the costs of the buildings, and the Minister is getting enormous value for money in this regard.  We wish him well on that.  Senator Walsh requested a debate on development in education with the Minister present in the House.  I have no difficulty in leaving time aside for that to take place.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Donovan again called for an urgent debate on the fishing industry. I indicated prior to the recess that such a debate would take place.  I am pleased to inform the House that the debate will be held on Wednesday next.  I look forward to the Minister coming before the House to discuss the serious challenges the fishing industry faces in the context of the Common Fisheries Policy, annual quotas etc.</P>
        <P>I will communicate to the relevant Minister the views and concerns of Senator Coghlan in respect of issues relating to Killarney House, the national parks in Kerry and the town of Killarney.</P>
        <P>Senator Leyden referred to the Council of Europe and the three Senators who represent the House so well on that body.  I agree with everything the Senator stated.  As an independent nation, Ireland should continue to be represented by the three Members to whom I refer.  I congratulate all concerned.  Senator Keaveney outlined what she has achieved at the Council, particularly with regard to the reports with which she has been associated and the support she has received worldwide in respect of those reports.</P>
        <P>Senator Leyden also referred to the Lisbon treaty and the implications of last Friday&rsquo;s vote.  I am pleased to inform the House that a debate on this matter will take place next week.</P>
        <P>Senator Glynn requested that the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment come before the House for an urgent debate on recent staggering and unsustainable increases in insurance premiums.  As stated yesterday, I will make time available for such a debate at the earliest possible opportunity.  I will also communicate to the Minister for Finance the Senator&rsquo;s strong views regarding the introduction of a scrappage scheme for the motor trade, which is experiencing major difficulties at present.</P>
        <P>Senator Quinn referred to the difficulties farmers in this jurisdiction might face if their herds were exposed to cattle from Northern Ireland infected with TB which are stolen and transported across the Border.  The Senator highlighted the great battle that has been fought over many years to eradicate the blight of this disease.  I will communicate his views in this regard to the Minister.</P>
<Col N="272"/>
        <P>Senator Quinn also referred to the question of life expectancy and what Ireland can do to help the underprivileged nations of the world.  In these countries, some 2 million children under the age of five lose their lives each year on foot of a lack of medicines and medical care.  The Senator&rsquo;s request for a debate in this regard is worthwhile.  Perhaps he might outline his views to the Minister for Foreign Affairs when he makes his regular monthly visit to the House to discuss Europe and Northern Ireland.  Such an occasion would present the ideal opportunity to discuss the matter in order to discover what might be done.</P>
        <P>Senator Hanafin called for a debate on the world economy, long-term unemployment, the challenges faced by F&Aacute;S in the areas of upskilling and training and the action that might be taken to assist the retail sector, which is under siege at present.</P>

        <P>I recently had a conversation with a friend who researches town planning and town developments throughout Europe.  He always has been fascinated by what happens in other countries, particularly Germany and the Netherlands, where towns are built on the basis that the infrastructure needed to service such towns is put in place first.  I recall seeing some photographs he had taken of a new town being built in Germany, that had been designed to accommodate 3,000 to 4,000 people, in which the streets, public transport system, lighting, sewerage and water all were in place before the erection of solitary apartment block anywhere in that town.  In Ireland, we have never subscribed to that particular method of planning and perhaps it now is somewhat too late to so do.  However, this is an instance in which we should try to take into account the best possible aspects of international practice when drafting this legislation.  As for the proposed inclusion in the 2000 Act of the new section 25(3B) in particular, I question why the legislation seeks to exclude the authorities within the greater Dublin area, GDA, from this process.  Although the GDA has had its own process up and running since the passage of the most recent legislation, given that Ireland is a country of only 4 million people, I wonder why the research process between the greater Dublin area and the rest of the country is not integrated.  The second amendment seeks to include in the drawing up of regional planning strategies both regional and local authorities, to include county, city and local area plans.  This is the thrust of the amendments that have been tabled and I look forward to the Minister of State&rsquo;s response.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>Clearly, it is highly important to have provision for the consideration of integration of transport in land use planning in any regional planning guidelines.  As Senator Cannon has noted, all Members support that concept.  However, there also is room within the development of such guidelines for provision for greater consultation with members of the <Col N="274"/>public and in particular for provision for a public right to participate.  I would be grateful for the Minister of State&rsquo;s assistance in ascertaining whether this is envisaged in this provision or in the original 2000 Act, which is to be amended.  Similarly, I seek to ascertain whether there is provision for a complaints procedure when a member of the public believes an issue has arisen, perhaps regarding health and safety, in the development of such guidelines.  I seek the Minister of State&rsquo;s assistance in this regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>The amendments under discussion propose that the national transport authority&rsquo;s involvement in the planning process should be the same in all areas of the country and would be based on the arrangements already in place under the 2008 Act for the greater Dublin area.  Implicit in these amendments is that the authority would produce a national transport strategy.  The Minister&rsquo;s view is that it would be premature at present to give the national transport authority, NTA, the full powers of a national strategic land use and transport body.  Members are aware that the Department of Transport publishes its own strategy statement every five years and produces other national policy documents such as Transport 21.  Consequently, there is no deficiency in this regard.  The NTA therefore will follow the policies of the Government in the implementation strategies.</P>
        <P>However, the transport strategy for the greater Dublin area is a different matter that addresses an issue that is specific to a single geographic region.  It is intended to be a highly practical document that sets out to solve the current transport issues there.  The approach offered in the 2008 Act of a transport strategy is specific to dealing with the transport issue within the greater Dublin area.  Amendments Nos. 22, 24 and 25 seek to have the NTA interact with all planning regions in the same way.  However, this one-size-fits-all approach is not possible, given the difference between the greater Dublin area and the rest of the country.  Section 43, as drafted, recognises the need for a slight difference of approach in respect of the NTA&rsquo;s involvement in the planning process outside the greater Dublin area.  Amendment No. 23 seeks to require all planning authorities to include in their development plans and local area plans a statement on steps to be taken to ensure integration of transport and land use planning.  However, the Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill 2009, which was presented to this House last May, makes provision in respect of these matters by requiring that development plans contain mandatory objectives for the promotion of sustainable settlement and transport strategies.  For these reasons, I ask the Senator to withdraw these amendments.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCannon"><NameTxt>Senator Ciaran Cannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his response.  From the general thrust of his comments and those of his ministerial colleagues when discussing this legislation, this national transport authority will be toothless and powerless and will not achieve what the legislation sets out to do.  I cannot understand the distinction that has been made between the greater Dublin area and the rest of the country.  Only 4 million people live here and it does not make sense to propose that the country&rsquo;s transport requirements change utterly when one reaches Leixlip.  As a small nation of 4 million people, this is our first opportunity to integrate fully all our public transport systems and to conduct the requisite research, right down to local area plan level, to establish what are these needs.  However, to set aside what is happening in the greater Dublin area on the grounds that it is unique and does not have an impact on what is happening elsewhere in the country is unwise and foolish.  As I can judge from the Minister of State&rsquo;s response that there will be no change of heart in this regard, that is all I have to say on this matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>A point I neglected to make was that under section 29(3) of the Bill before the House, it is envisaged that the intention of the amendment could be considered in the future.  Section 29(3) states &ldquo;Notwithstanding the provisions of section 63 of the Act of <Col N="275"/>2008, the National Transport Authority shall, at any time at the direction of the Minister, submit a report to the Minister setting out recommendations in relation to the expansion of its functions, functional area and remit&rdquo;.  Consequently, it contemplates the point being made by the Senator.  An incremental approach is being taken.  Obviously, the greater Dublin area has unique issues and it is intended to try to address these head-on first and then to deal with the wider national strategy at a later date.  On foot of the progress made last year through the passage of the 2008 Act, with this legislation we will be able to take advantage of what we have learned from the other experiences for the roll-out on a national basis.</P>
      </Speaker>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Senator Brendan Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>During the part of the debate on the 2008 Act that pertained to the consideration of the greater Dublin area and the desirability of looking at Dublin in isolation, I argued there was a problem with leaving out towns and localities such as Drogheda and County Louth, which were not included in the greater Dublin area.  Drogheda and its environs, as well as mid-Louth, are very much part of the greater Dublin area, albeit not strictly within the scope of the 2008 Act.  The Fine Gael amendments certainly would address this issue, which the Minister then refused to take up on my behalf.  Consequently, I support the Fine Gael amendments on the basis that they would address this anomaly.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>I repeat that under the Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill presented to this House by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government last May, Louth County Council, for example, must have regard to transport issues when drafting its development and local area plans.  As I noted in response to Senator Cannon&rsquo;s comments, it is envisaged that a wider national remit will be carried out at a later date.  Hopefully, this will address that issue in the short term.</P>

	<P>The changes proposed in section 45 on page 28, lines 24 to 30, to insert new provisions in section 38(9) of the Act of 1994, lead me to believe the authority constituted under this legislation will have some role in establishing speed limits on roads. Currently the power to impose speed limits on our national primary and national secondary roads rests with the NRA, while the power to impose speed limits on roads below that level remains with local authorities.  Is it the intention of this legislation to remove these powers from the NRA or local authorities and invest them in their national transport authority?</P>

	<P>The purpose of this amendment to section 64(3) of the Roads Act 1993 is to address a gap in the legislation.  It relates to the prosecution of toll offences.  By virtue of the way the legislation is worded, in the case of a leasing company that leases a vehicle to another company on a long-term lease, only the first company, which is the registered owner, and the driver of the vehicle can be pursued for non-payment of toll charges.  The second company is not specifically listed.  This creates a problem for the NRA and all leasing companies.  The amendment proposes to make a company that leases a vehicle from a leasing company liable for any unpaid tolls.  I hope Senators see the merit in this proposal.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Senator Brendan Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 27:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 33, line 31, after &ldquo;drivers&rdquo;, to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;and may, if the level of consumer demand so justifies it, make regulations limiting entry to the taxi market by reference to a particular number of new licences to be granted in any particular year, if it is satisfied that such a limit would not have any material adverse impact on the service to consumers&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This amendment seeks to give the commissioner for taxi regulation, in a qualified way, the power to limit the number of taxi licences.  The taxi regulator does not have such powers at present.  The following statement is on the website of the Commission for Taxi Regulation, <i>www.taxireg.ie</i>:</P>
        <P LI="1">The Commission for Taxi Regulation can confirm that it has received advice from the Advisory Council on a number of proposed further reforms for the industry, following the conclusion of a public consultation process on the recommendations of the Goodbody Economic Review.</P>
<Col N="277"/>
        <P LI="1">The Commission will reflect on the advice received and following the conclusion of legal considerations, regulatory impact assessments and administrative arrangements will publish details of new reforms and a timeline for the introduction of reforms later this year.  The reforms will cover a number of areas including vehicle and driver licensing, and enforcement.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Information received from the policy section of the Commission for Taxi Regulation is that the advisory council is still considering the review.  It is meeting next week and it is expected that it will issue its final recommendations to the regulator at that point.  The regulator will then consider the advice and make a decision.  What if the advice is to limit the number of taxi licences for a short period?  The Commission for Taxi Regulation does not have such powers at present and, if one felt it advisable that the Commission for Taxi Regulation should have such powers, it would require further legislation to do so whereas we could grant those powers today if the Minister of State accepts this amendment.  Providing such powers to the regulator is not a stipulation or a recommendation that they be used.  The Commission for Taxi Regulation may never wish to use the powers so bestowed.  There is a problem with oversupply of taxis in certain areas, particularly at peak times.  Some taxi licences are being used at peak times by people who also hold down full-time jobs elsewhere.  In any debate on the taxi industry there is always a reference to the bad old times when one could not get a taxi for love nor money.  Those days are long gone and they should not be used as a reason for doing nothing now to address the problems that exist.  I asked the Minister of State to accept our reasonable amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I support Senator Ryan&rsquo;s amendment.  Senator Ryan made reference to the bad old times and none of us wants to see a return to them, nor would this amendment lead to a return to that.  I refer to times when there was clearly an under supply of taxis, particularly in Dublin but also around the country.  No one can defend that but this does not aim to return to this.  Now we have the opposite situation, with an enormous oversupply of taxis, as anyone can see from walking around St. Stephen&rsquo;s Green.  There is a great deal of disquiet about this, not only among taxi drivers and their families.  It does not serve any purpose and is not particularly favourable to the consumer.  Once there are enough taxis so that people have a choice of taxis, it is unlike other areas where increased competition drives down prices.  That is not the issue here because taxi fares are regulated.  Consumers do not see a reduction in fares they pay for taxis because there are more taxis on the streets.  It is of no benefit to consumer to have masses of taxis queueing around St. Stephen&rsquo;s Green everyday.  This shows the difference between taxi supply and other areas.  I can anticipate a comparison may be made with retail trade&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Senator Fiona O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>I hate to be predictable.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;but there is a clear benefit to consumers in that case, not only in terms of offering choice, but offering choice in price.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Senator Fiona O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>I will not disappoint Senator Bacik.  I do not agree with this amendment.  The minute one introduces a cap on the amount of services provided, a monopoly exists.  Despite the gentle words, this would return us to the previous position.  The majority of the country was glad when the taxi service was deregulated.  The Minister of State has pointed out to me that there is an oversupply in many professions at the moment but taxi drivers are visible.  If this amendment was to be accepted, we are in danger of going back to where we were, with people trading a limited commodity.  It is not in the public interest to go back to this.</P>
        <P>Taxi licences are now cheaper and more available and a living can be made from it.  Perhaps far too many people have decided this and we must examine the situation but I do not agree with the idea of regulating the number of taxi plates.  The market will flush itself out because people cannot conduct business if they are not making money.  At least they did not make the <Col N="278"/>massive outlay that was required years ago when taxi plates were traded like pub licences for extortionate amounts.  This was completely wrong and I reject any notion of the Minister of State accepting an amendment that returns us to this scenario.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>The suggested amendment would, if accepted, empower the Commission for Taxi Regulation to set a quantitative limit on the number of taxi licences to be issued in a particular year.  While the amendment is an enabling provision, it clearly envisages quantitative control of taxi numbers.  Such an approach would be contrary to the policy principles underpinning the Taxi Regulation Act 2003, which followed the court judgment in 2000 finding that the limitation in licences in the interests of licence holders could not be sustained.  The current system is based on open market entry subject to high quality standards.  The amendment could also have the result of a return to the days when taxi licences were traded for high prices.  The number of taxis increased from approximately 3,000 in 2000 to approximately 27,500 in 2008.  The demand for a taxi service has also grown; the recent economic review of the sector reported that demand had grown by 25% since 2005.  The number of new licences is running at the lowest monthly level since liberalisation, with 78 being issued in August.</P>
      
        <?oasys _cl13.3- ?><P>It is considered that the optimal approach to regulation is quality based.  The CTR is finalising measures for the further development of the taxi industry and the standards to which it operates.  It is expected that the commission, taking account of all the submissions it has received in response to its public consultation and in consultation with its advisory council, will implement measures to further improve taxi services and strengthen the regulation of the industry.  Therefore, I do not propose to accept the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Senator Brendan Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State rightly states the amendment would empower the regulator to limit numbers if he or she so wished.  Surely the Government and the State can trust the regulator to live up to his or her obligations under the legislation under which the office was established to decide whether such power should be used.  The argument we heard against this was based on a return to the bad old days.  That is not what we are discussing.  This would give a power to the regulator which he or she may never wish to use.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>Reference was made to the Goodbody report.  I am assured no legal advice would call on the commission to do something which it was not empowered to do or which it would be illegal for it to do.  It would be very surprising if advice were given along those lines.  As a Dublin person, I walked along the N11 many nights in the bad old days and agree that nobody wants to go back.  I am sure some Senators also had that experience.</P>
        <P>One can consider this issue in the light of whether there are too many taxis or whether there are too few customers.  It says much about Senator Ryan&rsquo;s outlook that he thinks there are too many taxis.  Many consider there are not enough customers and that the question is how to provide more.  There is a regulation on the maximum fare that can be charged but there is no minimum fare.  Taxi drivers could charge various rates and perhaps consider a Michael O&rsquo;Leary approach to try to increase volume to create business and activity.  Certain taxi drivers are beginning to see the benefit of working together and are offering discounts, improving standards and providing additional services.  This is the way to go.  There are no limits on other parts of the economy, for instance, the number of hauliers carrying goods.  Senator O&rsquo;Malley made the point that it was psychologically irritating for other drivers to see so many empty taxis and I agree with her.  However, one must consider the number of carpenters, architects and, as Senator O&rsquo;Donovan stated, solicitors who are out of work and the order books that are empty.  Quality is the way to go and various business models must be examined.  We have not limited entry into other sections of the economy and it would be wrong to do so.  I am disinclined to accept the amendment.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Barry Andrews, but I am sorry that the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, is not present.</P>
        <P>This is an interesting situation and one that I take on with some delicacy because I do not like to take on any sectarian matter about the Catholic ethos or Protestant ethos.  There is, however, a worrying situation here.  I wish first to put it into its historical context.  A<?oasys _jy ?>mild-mannered man, the Anglican Archbishop, Dr. John Neill, has said that it is highly<?oasys _jy ?>discriminatory against members of minority religions.  This is infinitely regrettable.</P>
        <P>Speaking on 2 October 2003 in the other House, the then Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Noel Dempsey, said: &ldquo;There are 59 fee charging second level schools in the country, of which one is Jewish, 21 Protestant, two inter-denominational and the balance Catholic&rdquo;.  That is just about half the number of Protestant schools there were when the State came into existence so there has already been a steady erosion of these schools.  He added, &ldquo;The<?oasys _jy ?>Protestant and Jewish schools receive funding by way of a block grant which has its origins in the desire of the State to enable students of the Protestant and Jewish persuasion to attend schools that reflect their denominational ethoi.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>He continued to answer several of the points that the Department had put forward in defence of its swingeing cuts to these schools:</P>
        <P LI="1">[T]he vast majority of Church of Ireland schools are in rural areas and cater for a scattered Protestant population.  Their not receiving State support would cause them great difficulties.  These are the kinds of complex issues that are involved.</P>
<Col N="281"/>
        <P FLI="0">In other words, they are very different and cannot possibly be described as elitist because they often cater for poor people, those on social welfare who depend on the grant made out of the block grant and who now do not get the <i>per capita</i> grant.</P>
        <P>In 1967, introducing this situation, the late Donogh O&rsquo;Malley, then Minister for Education, said:</P>
        <P LI="1">In the matter of the free post-primary education scheme special consideration was given to the position of Protestant schools.  If the general scheme had been applied to these schools, practically no Protestant pupils would have benefited.  In order, therefore, to ensure that Protestants would be treated equitably in the matter of benefit under the scheme, a special arrangement was made whereby a Commission representing the schools under Protestant management is to be paid a lump sum which will be distributed by the Commission in grants towards the school fees of the pupils most in need of such assistance ... one of the main reasons being that the religious in the Catholic schools &mdash; priests, brothers and sisters &mdash; plough back their salaries while the Protestant schools have not such a source of income . . . It would just not be possible for my Department to distribute the grant in the same manner as we do to the Catholic schools . . . [The Secondary Education Commission for the Protestant Schools] came to the conclusion that the manner in which they were acting was the only manner in which they could act in order to ensure an equitable distribution, taking account of the varying circumstances of the pupils and their families.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Three Fianna F&aacute;il Ministers have outlined the reasons this provision was made and it has been unilaterally altered by this Government.  This is a serious matter because it will affect Protestant schools.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister of State has in his files briefing documents transmitted to Senator Bacik and to me which indicate a series of case histories both in the Dublin area and in the country which make it very clear that certain families who are on the margins would not be able to send their children to school if these measures went ahead and were sustained.  In the 2009 budget the Government singled out Protestant schools for discriminatory treatment.  The Minister, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, acknowledged this in the D&aacute;il last November, saying, &ldquo;I am well aware it will cause serious difficulty and I obviously have concerns about this&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>The former archdeacon, Reverend Gordon Linney, writing in <i>The Irish Times</i> last Monday stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">People might assume that this is an extra concessionary payment exclusive to Protestant schools.  It is not.  The same funding is given to Catholic schools on a <i>per capita</i> basis whereas the Protestant sector receives it in block form to be channelled to those most in need.</P>
        <P FLI="0">If these proposals are sustained there will be a charge on the Exchequer because at least 10% to 15% of pupils will be dislodged.  They will have to be taken into the State sector and there will be a higher cost to the State and several schools will close down completely.  This is not in anyone&rsquo;s interests.  It is not good educational practice.  Reverend Linney added:</P>
        <P LI="1">Catholic children have additional supports in their schools through various grants and a much better teacher-pupil ratio ... In one of our rural schools where many family incomes are less than what is available on social welfare, over half the pupils require significant financial assistance with their fees.  It is quite disgraceful to label these people as &ldquo;elitist&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">In other words, because of the dispersed nature of the Protestant population throughout the country there is not normally a school of their ethos within their immediately neighbouring area so they are forced into a situation such that they have to attend boarding schools.  They are not boarding for reasons of snobbery but because it is the only way in which they can get this kind of education.</P>
<Col N="282"/>
        <P>I would like the Minister to think again for several reasons.  First, there is an historic precedent.  Nothing could be clearer than the arguments advanced by no fewer than three successive Fianna F&aacute;il Ministers which exactly parallel the arguments now being made by the representatives of the minority religions, including the Jewish faith.  Second, the whole matter is seen as discriminatory and is regarded as such by the leaders of the minority faiths.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Norris who, as always, puts his case with great eloquence.  I echo his words and share his disquiet about speaking on behalf of this sector in the first place because I have a fundamental disagreement with the basis of our education system and the sectarian basis on which it is divided.  I have criticised very strongly and will continue to do so the fact that children may be discriminated against in seeking admission to both primary and secondary schools on the basis of the religious affiliation of their parents.  That is a rotten basis for our schooling system.  I favour a system in which all schools would be multidenominational and welcome children of all creeds and none simply on the basis of geographic catchment areas.  However, that is not the system in which we work.  Given that we work with a system in which the Equal Status Act allows schools to opt-out, thereby allowing them to discriminate on religious grounds, it is important there should be a choice available to parents, not only to Protestant parents but also to parents like me.  I am an atheist and would like my children to attend an Educate Together secondary school but that is not possible because there are no multidenominational Educate Together secondary schools in the State.  For parents in my position, therefore, who do not wish their children to be educated within the Catholic ethos there must a choice of schools with a different ethos, whether it be Protestant or, ideally, multidenominational.  Currently, Protestant schools offer less inculcation in religious doctrine than most Catholic schools.  </P>
        <P>The other point is that for Catholic parents there are choices between fee paying and non fee paying Catholic schools.  In many areas there are multiple choices which are not available to parents of the Protestant or minority religions or none, given the small numbers of schools which are not Catholic at secondary level.  In this context, I am happy to support Senator Norris.  It is important that the ethos of the schools be maintained, as I would be fearful that the change in status proposed would affect it.</P>
        <P>I should declare my own interest as somebody who went to a fee paying Protestant school but as a Catholic girl on a full scholarship to Alexandra College.  Senator Norris said&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>That was my mother&rsquo;s old school.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I am proud to say it was also Senator Norris&rsquo;s mother&rsquo;s school.  As Senator Norris said, in many Protestant schools there is a wider diversity of class backgrounds than in their Catholic fee paying counterparts.  For that reason too, there is a case to be made for treating them differently from Catholic schools.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>On behalf of the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, I am pleased to be given the opportunity to clarify for the House the position on the funding arrangements for fee-charging Protestant schools.  I reassure Senator Norris that I, with my colleagues in government, recognise the importance of ensuring students from a Protestant background can attend a school which reflects their denominational status.  The Senator will be aware that the Minister for Education and Science has met representatives of both the Church of Ireland and the Grand Orange Lodge of Ireland to discuss the funding position of Protestant schools and the background to the decision in the October budget to remove certain grants from such schools.  The Minister emphasises that no changes have been made to the block grant which is expected to be &euro;6.5 million in this school year.  It covers capitation, tuition and boarding costs&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and is distributed through the Secondary Education Committee, SEC, established by the churches concerned.  This fund ensures necessitous Protestant children can attend a school of their choice.  I advise the Senator that officials from the Department of Education and Science have met representatives from the SEC to discuss future funding arrangements for Protestant schools.  In this context, the Minister has expressed his willingness to consider any proposals that might be made to the Department that would enable the available funding to be focused and adjusted to meet more effectively the twin objectives of access for individuals and sustaining the schools they wish to attend, particularly those in rural areas. </P>
        <P>The October budget implemented changes in how all fee charging schools are treated in respect of the number of publicly funded teaching posts allocated to them.  With effect from 1 January this year, teachers in fee charging schools are allocated at a pupil teacher ratio of 20:1, a point higher than allocations in non fee charging post-primary schools.  In view of the challenging economic circumstances we are facing, the Minister is not in a position to reverse this decision.  The decision is justified on the basis that schools which have access to fees as an income source are in a better position to maintain services at a time when the public finances are under such severe pressure.  Fee charging schools can continue to employ additional teachers that they fund from their fee income.  The Minister will continue to work with representatives of the Protestant education sector to ensure State funding made available to the Protestant community is targeted in the fairest way possible to meet the needs of their children and their schools.</P>
        <P>Planned expenditure levels for the Department of Education and Science will be considered as part of the Estimates and budgetary process for 2010.  This will include consideration of the report of the special group on public service numbers and expenditure programmes, SGPSNEP.  The decisions on all the issues arising will be a matter for the Government.  It would not be appropriate for me to comment further at this stage, pending the outcome of that deliberative process.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>Does the Senator have a supplementary question?</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>That is one of the most disgraceful responses I have ever heard.  It is blatantly sectarian and a tissue of lies.  I am beginning to wonder if there is not an agenda at certain levels within the Department among those who have the same view as Senator Bacik and I that sectarian education is not a good idea, who would like, by stealth and imposing their policy on a weak Minister, to extinguish the Protestant schools.  I would like the Minister of State to pass this information &mdash; some of the figures &mdash; to the Minister.  The total number of pupils in 21 Protestant voluntary schools is 9,500; the estimated total number of Protestant pupils attending is 6,600; the total number on a grant from the SEC is 2,850&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>Does the Senator have a question?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P><b>&mdash;&mdash;</b>and the total on a full SEC grant is 1,000.  How can the Minister square these figures?  More than half of the Protestant pupils attending are getting grants because they are poor.  This is getting worse.  The action of the Government has got rid of secretarial and maintenance grants.  Any objective independent analysis will show that this is discriminatory and that as a result of the Government&rsquo;s actions, the Protestant schools are worse off.  That is fine, if the State decides it will move in the direction of non-denominational, non-sectarian education throughout the State.  I will support it.  It is the duty of the parents, not the schools, to produce the ethos.  I remind the Minister of State of Article 42.3.1&deg; of the <Col N="284"/>Constitution which states: &ldquo;The State shall not oblige parents in violation of their conscience and lawful preference to send their children to schools established by the State or to any particular type of school designated by the State&rdquo;.  This is what the Department of Education and Science is doing to my community and I object to it.  I will support and hope the record of the Adjournment debate in this House will be used to support any constitutional action undertaken to overcome this vicious and discriminatory policy of the Department.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>I have met Eleanor Petrie and many representatives of the fee paying Protestant schools and this is the first time I have heard wild allegations about conspiracies and sectarianism in the Department of Education and Science.  </P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not say that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>On the contrary, they have engaged in a very constructive way with the Department and Members of this House in informing and explaining to Members the distinction with regard to Protestant schools in the areas in which they are involved and particularly the demands met in rural areas.  The campaign will be part of the deliberative process in the budgetary process.  They have also accepted the fact that everybody has to take a hit in the current climate and are being constructive in the proposals they are putting to the Minister.  Far from being weak, he will endeavour to the best of his abilities to ensure the constitutional imperatives to which the Senator referred are discharged fully for the protection of those students who wish to follow a specific spiritual ethos and those parents who wish to access that spiritual ethos in their children&rsquo;s education.</P>

    <Title>Foyle River Development. </Title>
      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I assume the Minister of State, Deputy Andrews, is also taking the second Adjournment matter.  With due respect to him, I was anxious that the relevant Minister would be present because this is a particularly difficult but very important issue in my area.  </P>
        <P>I declare an interest.  I live beside the River Foyle which I can see when I look out any window in any room in our house.  For that reason, I am very anxious about its development.  It is a jewel in our crown which is underdeveloped.  A great difficulty lies ahead of us unless we face this issue head-on.</P>
        <P>I am concerned about the overall management of the Foyle and its tributaries.  The Loughs Agency of the Foyle, Carlingford and Irish Lights Commission are in charge of salmon fishing in Lough Foyle.  Recent legislation also gave the agency control of aquaculture licensing.</P>
        <P>When the Good Friday Agreement was implemented the issue of ownership of the bed of the lough was not dealt with.  A Member of the Welsh Assembly brought this matter to my attention and asked me to raise it in Ireland.  For example, if I were granted an aquaculture <Col N="285"/>licence by the Loughs Agency, which is a cross-Border agency, the Crown Estates Commission would have the right to object to my being granted the licence.  When I raised this issue in the media the Crown Estate responded by saying it makes no claim to the Foyle, its bed or its tributaries until the two Governments clarify the legal standing of the waters.</P>
        <P>I hope this Adjournment debate will be brought to the notice of the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Minister with responsibility for the marine.  The Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Conor Lenihan, has met a number of people on the subject of the Loughs Agency.  I ask not only that I be kept informed of these discussions but that I be asked to contribute to them.  The Honourable the Irish Society, the Crown Estates Commission, the Duke of Abercorn and a number of other people lay claim to elements of the Foyle.  I challenge these claims.  The Irish Free State was originally designated as all of the island, its tributaries, its coastline and all aspects.  When the Six Counties were retained in the United Kingdom there was no mention of lakes, tributaries or coastline.  I will not wrap a flag around myself on this issue.  However, Lough Foyle has massive potential for aquaculture, fishing and beyond into marine leisure and recreation.  There are other economic opportunities which have not yet been realised.</P>
        <P>The review mechanism of the St. Andrews Agreement should examine the role and composition of the Loughs Agency of the Foyle, Carlingford and Irish Lights Commission.  More power should be given to the agency and it should be expanded and, perhaps, fundamentally reformed.  A single agency should look after all the interests of the Foyle and give it a massive opportunity for development.  I ask for this because the agency is currently a cross-Border body.  If a cross-Border body is given the right to manage all aspects of the Foyle we will have the best chance of co-ordination and the agency will be able to deliver.  The third parties might then withdraw their claims.  The Crown Estate appears to make claims but, when the claims are challenged, says it does not make claims.  The review mechanism of the St. Andrews Agreement could address this issue once and for all and put all management of the Foyle and its tributaries under a single agency.</P>
        <P>I could give details of the various organisations which are deeply unhappy at the third party interventions to which they are exposed.  This issue is a dangerous boil which needs to be lanced.  I have been speaking to other parties from various backgrounds in Northern Ireland.  People of persuasions different from my own and far from my own background are equally upset and want to see this issue dealt with.  I hope this will give comfort to officials of the Department of Foreign Affairs and reassure them that this is the right time to deal with the issue of the overall development of the bed of Lough Foyle.</P>
        <P>We are an island and must exploit our resources.  We are in an economic crisis.  One way out of it is to maximise the treasures we have.  We have a treasure in Lough Foyle.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>The Department of Communications Energy and Natural Resources along with the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development in Northern Ireland are the co-sponsoring Departments for the Loughs Agency of the Foyle, Carlingford and Irish Lights Commission.  The Loughs Agency, as set out in the British-Irish Agreement Act 1999 and the Foyle Fisheries Act 1952, as amended by the Foyle and Carlingford Fisheries Act 2007, and corresponding Northern Ireland legislation is responsible for the promotion of the development of Lough Foyle and Carlingford Lough for commercial and recreational purposes in respect of marine, fishery and aquaculture matters; for the management, conservation, protection, improvement and development of the inland fisheries of the Foyle and Carlingford areas; and for the development and licensing of aquaculture and the development of marine tourism.</P>
        <P>The agency was set up in 1999 and took over the functions of the Foyle Fisheries Commission established in 1952 to provide only for the management and conservation of the fisheries in the Lough Foyle area.  The Act of 1952 was amended in 2007 through the Foyle and Carlingford Fisheries Act and its Northern Ireland equivalent.  This, in addition to the functions of the <Col N="286"/>Foyle Fisheries Commission, empowered the Loughs Agency to conserve, protect, develop and manage shellfisheries and aquaculture in the loughs areas.  This enabled, for the first time, the introduction of an agreed regulatory aquaculture and shellfisheries regime in Lough Foyle. It also extended the agency&rsquo;s fisheries conservation and protection role to Carlingford Lough.</P>
        <P>The agency is in the process of introducing secondary legislation in relation to aquaculture which will facilitate the introduction of a structured management system for aquaculture in the loughs areas.  The relevant secondary legislation in relation to aquaculture, when introduced, will enable the agency to manage the sector.  It is necessary for the agency, <i>inter alia</i>, to secure a long-term licence of the cross-Border foreshore areas under its responsibility in Lough Foyle and Carlingford Lough.  This will be done by way of a formal foreshore management agreement between the Loughs Agency, the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the Crown Estates Commission, which are the responsible bodies for the management of foreshore in both jurisdictions.</P>
        <P>My understanding is that work is proceeding on the preparation of an appropriate management agreement and that the approach being adopted, when completed, will be entirely adequate to allow the Loughs Agency to undertake the regulation of aquaculture in Lough Foyle.  The Loughs Agency&rsquo;s objective is to achieve sustainable development for the social, economic and environmental benefit of the communities who influence, enjoy and depend on the resource.  There are no plans at present to expand the functions of the Loughs Agency, although the function and operations of all North-South bodies are under consideration by the North-South Ministerial Council in the context of the review of the St. Andrews Agreement.  Any changes to the existing arrangements would require the specific endorsement of the Northern Ireland Assembly and the Oireachtas.  I would consider that the agency should be afforded the full opportunity to come to terms with its aquaculture and sea fisheries brief before taking on any additional functions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I fundamentally disagree with the answer.  I ask the Minister of State to ask for an answer to this matter.  I will continue to ask it.  I have asked it of the Department of Foreign Affairs and I have not received an answer.  Under what regulation, law or interpretation has the Crown Estates Commission responsibility for the management of the foreshore in both jurisdictions?  This is a fundamental problem with regard to the co-management of the Foyle.  We send a Minister with responsibility for agricultural or marine issues to meet whom I would expect to be his or her UK counterpart, but what we get is the Crown Estate Commission in the middle of it.  Will I be given an answer to my one question as soon as possible, namely, within what remit and under what law or regulation has the commission been given responsibility for the foreshore on the River Foyle?  I do not expect the Minister of State to be able to answer it.  His father was involved in the Foyle Fisheries Commission at some point.  Many years ago Baroness Denton and his father attended a meeting at Redcastle.  That we are continuing negotiations with an agency, the remit of which I have not been informed, is a serious issue for me and I will continue to raise it until I receive a satisfactory answer.  The talks should not be completed until I am given that answer.</P>
