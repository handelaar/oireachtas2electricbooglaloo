	<P>I have received notice from Senator Frances Fitzgerald that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to outline the progress regarding a future site for Scoil na Cam&oacute;ige, Clondalkin, Dublin 22; and where third and fourth class children will be accommodated next September.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Fidelma Healy Eames of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to advise whether the major capital programme or the devolved scheme is the preferred option for the delivery of the preferred building option for a school (details supplied) in County Galway.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Cecilia Keaveney of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Health and Children to give an update on the area of music therapy, its recognition and its use in relation to mental health, autism and other health areas.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

	<P>The first meeting of a cross-party Oireachtas group on mental health takes place at 2 p.m. today in the AVC room.  I ask colleagues to support this initiative.  Cross-party groups are common in other parliaments and this is a worthwhile initiative.  I know Senators have a great interest in mental health and I ask colleagues to support this if they can.</P>
        <P>This is the first day of the new independent inspections of nursing homes.  This is very welcome.  It is long overdue.  The independent inspection of nursing homes will be carried out by the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA.  When will there be independent inspections of residential services for children who are intellectually disabled?  Yesterday, the Ombudsman for Children was before the health committee and she highlighted her ongoing concerns about the lack of monitoring of residential services for children with intellectual disabilities.  For two years there have been meetings between the Department of Health and Children, HIQA and the Minister of State with responsibility for children to consider such an independent mechanism and how it will be put in place.  In this post-Ryan report era, during which we have been examining the implications of residential care when it goes wrong, is it not about time we had an independent inspection regime for residential homes where children are living now?  Many members of the committee yesterday were horrified to hear this from the Ombudsman for Children.  Senator Mary White was at the meeting and she was extremely concerned about children who are in care where there is not the independent monitoring that is required.  I ask the Leader to take up this matter with the Minister of State with responsibility for children and ask him to report to the House.  The Seanad is in a position to discuss issues such as the protection of children, keeping children&rsquo;s needs to the fore and protecting and developing front-line services for children, something the Government has said it will do and it has asked the Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews, to report to the Houses by the end of July in that regard.  We should prioritise putting this inspectorate in place.  I do not know how much it will cost but the cost of not doing it, in terms of children&rsquo;s lives, will be truly horrific, with a repeat of some of the abuses that took place historically.  We must not allow this situation to continue.  I ask the Leader to seek a response from the Minister of State with responsibility for children and to get a timeframe from him for changing this situation.</P>
        <P>Incidentally, Ireland is one of the few countries that still does not have a child death review mechanism.  Children in care have died, some accidentally.  I am not suggesting that all such deaths are questionable but no independent investigation takes place when a child dies in care.  That cannot continue.  These are not just historical issues, they are current.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I have raised the Ryan report with the Leader on a number of occasions.  It is far more important for the House to reconvene to deal with that than some of the issues that are being dealt with on 14 and 15 July.  The Leader is organising business in his own way and I do not object to that but this is a crucial matter.  I do not know if people realise what is happening on this issue.  People whose relatives were the victims described in the Ryan report still cannot get information.  I was talking to people recently who sought further information from an order of nuns about their sister, who was a victim.  All they received was a solicitor&rsquo;s letter.</P>
        <P>It was great to hear the Sisters of Charity apologise on the record yesterday.  One felt a sense of relief that it was done; it was very welcome.  However, that is the exception.  Other orders are still pursuing a closed door policy and will not share information or deal with people who are still trying to cope with grief, and the victims and their families who are seeking further information about what happened.  They are not being supportive.  We need to deal with this.  I know people whose sibling died in one of these institutions.  They do not know how to seek justice or how to deal with issues such as exhumation.  They do not know where they need to go for information, who has the records or whether they can get access to them.  There are <Col N="481"/>groups of people who had no contact with the Ryan commission, and that is no reflection on the commission, who are in the same situation.  I ask the Leader to arrange a discussion on deaths in institutions.  As I pointed out yesterday, children in Goldenbridge died but there is no reference in the Ryan report to them.  This is an example of how this issue must be taken further.</P>
        <P>With regard to the Lisbon treaty, the Minister should come to the House and outline the initiative the Government has in place to explain and sell the treaty to the people of Ireland.  I would like to contribute my tuppence worth somewhere along the way.  I am a member of a trade union group that is supportive of the treaty, and other groups in favour of the Lisbon treaty have been formed.  That is the way democracy should work but the Government should outline in detail how it will sell the treaty, the process it will follow, what is involved in the initiative, what type of campaign it has in mind and where we can fit into it.</P>
        <P>I acknowledge the good work the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs did in Europe.  When this argument was taking place last year the big problem was what the treaty meant.  People felt that it meant something that worried them considerably.  They were entitled to feel that.  They now have a legal explanation of what it means, and that is as it should be.  In responding to people who say there is no change in the treaty the Government should point out there is no change and that there will not, should not and cannot be any change.  It has said that all along.  The only issue is what it means.  If people are reassured by that, fine; if not, they will have to vote against it.  However, it is important this fact is recognised.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>It appears from reports yesterday that decisions relating to the budget and the economy generally are being postponed to the autumn and no decisions will be made by the Government until after the referendum on the Lisbon treaty in early October.  The Taoiseach indicated in the D&aacute;il yesterday that the Minister for Finance is only beginning the budgetary process at this stage.  On that basis, it will take some months.  I presume that the calls by a number of colleagues for detailed debate and the presentation by Opposition parties of their budgetary priorities will go off the agenda of the House given that the Government is only beginning the budgetary process and will not be in a position to present any of its proposals to either House until well into autumn.  The calls by colleagues such as Senator John Hanafin and others, therefore, presumably cannot be met in those circumstances.  If the Government is only getting going on its proposals, one can hardly expect the Opposition to put forward proposals until the Government at least indicates what it intends to do.</P>
        <P>It would assist all the Opposition parties and the general public if the Government would come clean and publish all the information available to it regarding the budgetary position and proposals that have been made by expert groups retained by the Government for that purpose.  What basis can there be for a delay in the publication by the Government of the documents prepared by Professor McCarthy&rsquo;s committee?  Why should there be a delay?  They are public property.  They are not the property of either the committee, because the Government has been given the report, or the Minister or Government.  These are grave matters.  One newspaper today describes our economy as being in an &ldquo;historic slump&rdquo; while others report the economy being in the &ldquo;worst ever state&rdquo;.  What excuse can there be for the public and the Opposition parties not to be told or given all the information available to the Government?  I have always believed this with regard to the banking situation as well, notwithstanding that some arguments can be made from time to time about confidentiality.  However, those arguments have faded, particularly in the case of nationalised banks.</P>
        <P>All of the information that is available to the Government is public property; it is the property of the people.  The Government only holds that information in trust for the people and it should be published for the people.  If the Government Senators seek any measure of consensus <Col N="482"/>or co-operation from Opposition parties, they will have to come clean on the basic information that is known to the Government.  If that detailed information is shared with us, we can have the type of meaningful debate the Irish public expects in this and the other House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Leader find a slot for a debate on the Middle East before the end of the session?  Yesterday Israelis boarded a boat carrying pro-Palestinian supporters, including Mairead Maguire, the Irish Nobel Prize winner for her work in Northern Ireland, David Graham, an Irish electrician, and Cynthia McKinney, a former US Congresswoman &mdash; this is public knowledge &mdash; and they are now being brought into an Israeli port.  They were bringing humanitarian aid to the 1.5 million people trapped in despair in Gaza.</P>
        <P>This story was removed from the headlines because of the sudden and tragic death of Michael Jackson, which has taken over all the airwaves from CNN to Sky Television.  Nobody is interested in what is happening in Gaza at the moment and we should send a protest through the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin.  I intend to raise this and other matters in respect of the Middle East later today with the British Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, David Miliband, who is to visit Leinster House.  I commend the joint committees on European affairs and foreign affairs, which propose to visit the region in Gaza.  However bad things are here, they are a lot worse in Gaza and people are not giving this the consideration it deserves.  Gaza is an open prison, maintained by the Israeli Government against the wishes of the Palestinian people.  It is about time people shouted &ldquo;Stop&rdquo;.  I shall make the case today to the Minister, Deputy Martin, who is extremely good on the entire issue.  Ireland has a great record as far as Palestine is concerned.  We were the first country, and the late Brian Lenihan was the first Minister in Europe, to recognise the two-state solution.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s remarks on the need for an immediate and proactive debate on the Lisbon treaty.  This House is an ideal forum for the Government to maximise political involvement and discourse on the subject matter.  As Senator O&rsquo;Toole rightly noted, the treaty is being clarified, not changed, and it is important we inform the public on that.  The question before us, in October or November, is the same one that was before us in June 2008.  One hopes that as a result of the debate and discourse and the process over the past 12 months, the public will have a greater understanding of the matter.  The Government and the body politic have a very important role to play in clarifying the questions which remain in respect of the Lisbon treaty.  It would be very helpful, not only for the Government but for the country, if Seanad &Eacute;ireann were to become a serious forum of debate on the treaty and its importance.</P>
        <P>Regarding European matters, at a time when we are swamped in a sea of economic doubt, there was one small piece of good news this morning concerning telephone charges.  There is a European dimension to this because, as a result of work at European Union level, telephone roaming charges are now being dropped, in some cases significantly, and that is to be welcomed.  It also causes us to ask about the level of telecom and telephone charges across the European Union and at home.  Our economy faces great challenges in competitiveness.  Whatever way we can, we need to reduce costs and telephone charges to business and the domestic consumer.  I welcome what has been done at EU level but we must have a debate in this House on communication costs to try to bring about further reductions in that regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the sentiment about the decrease in roaming charges.  It is very important, particularly for those of us in the Border region.  We have struggled along for some time to try to have an all-island approach to mobile telephone call and text charges.  I welcome the fact that roaming charges are being reduced.  Internationally, it will have an <Col N="483"/>importance, not only for business people who have to travel and for holidaymakers.  However, there is still more to do.  I am obliged to change my telephone over to the Northern coverage network when I travel from here to my home.  I have no choice.  Nonetheless, if I buy a package with my current operator that gives me 200, 500 or 750 minutes, or 200 texts, and if I use my telephone during the time  I am in the North such use is not included as part of the package.  There are still issues in respect of all-island approaches to telephones and mobile telephones that must be addressed.  I challenge the telecom operators to be the first to lead the way rather than continue what they have been doing, namely, trying to maximise the fact that the Irish use their telephones without questioning this situation.  It links into the issue raised yesterday about consumer advice.  We must challenge the operators and move to the cheaper provider.</P>
        <P>I welcome the introduction of the ban on tobacco advertising.  I was convenor of the Joint Committee on Health and Children when we produced the report that led to the ban on smoking in public places.  This new ban will not affect current smokers but is intended to try to stop the subliminal messages that are passed on to young people.  Every day 15 people would have to begin smoking to replace the 15 who die from smoking-related illnesses in Ireland.  This is a great initiative and I welcome it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the call by Senator Leyden for a debate on the Middle East.  At this hour, as we speak, my  former partner of many years, Ezra Yitzrak Nawi, is being sentenced in a court in Jerusalem.  His crime is that he took part in a non-violent demonstration against the demolition of the home of two elderly Palestinians.  Film clearly shows him removing stones from the hands of some of the more aggressive Palestinians, telling them it was a non-violent demonstration.  He disappears from the frame and emerges some minutes later, dishevelled, with the soldiers smiling.  He has been charged and convicted of attacking the soldiers.  The judge in the case said there was a conflict of evidence but she chose to believe the police and the soldiers.</P>
        <P>This is the Denning judgment, the appalling vista, and it is a moral disgrace.  I express my gratitude to this House, the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and, most particularly, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, who has been directly and courageously engaged in detail with our representatives in the Middle East.  I thank him for it.</P>
        <P>Senator Leyden was correct concerning the act of piracy conducted yesterday by the Israeli navy against the appropriately named <i>Spirit of Humanity, </i>24 nautical miles off the coast of Gaza.  The Israelis have no legal interest in this.  It was an act of piracy.  The name of the ship is significant and important.  The cargo was toys, medicines and food for a people that have been described by the International Red Cross as being in despair after the blitzkrieg visited upon them illegally by the Israeli Government, which is in betrayal of the noble spirit of Judaism.  The Israelis previously sank another boat in which one of the passengers was an 84 year old Jewish Holocaust survivor.  Therefore, let nobody say this is anti-Semitism.  It is an attempt, in difficult circumstances, to keep alive the spirit of humanity.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I remind the House that on all proposals regarding Seanad reform, emphasis was placed on a greater role for the House regarding European Union affairs.  Therefore, the call for a debate on the Lisbon treaty is very appropriate.  It is a moot point as to whether we should have the debate now &mdash; if we have the time in the schedule before the recess &mdash; or very early after we resume in mid-September, but it is important that we have it.  I would like to think the House will give a lead in this regard.</P>
        <P>I support the call by Senator Leyden for a debate on Gaza.  What is happening there is appalling.  I commend the Senator on his continuing interest in this area.  The issue should be debated.</P><Col N="484"/>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>I bring to the attention of the House yesterday&rsquo;s report by the VHI which indicated the organisation is seeking a reduction in fees of 5% from the medical profession, from both consultants and general practitioners.  It indicated that the average pay to a consultant was &euro;127,000 for 2006.  Obviously some got more, some less.  Medical inflation needs to be tackled and addressed.  In the past few months, I noted that consultants within the medical profession were increasing their fees by double-digit percentages at a time when there is deflation of 4% or 5%.  That is unacceptable and an abuse of privilege.  It will lead to a situation where the cost of health insurance will become prohibitive for an increasing number of the population.  In turn, those people will become dependent on the State for their health care.  Given the reduction in the revenues that will be available in the next five to ten years at least, fees are going in the wrong direction.  I ask for an urgent debate with the Minister so we can consider seriously what can be done to ensure that people who can apply whatever cost increases they wish are not allowed to do so.</P>
        <P>In this regard, I remind the House of a motion before it on the legal profession wherein the same abuses apply.  Will the Leader allow time for it at the first opportunity?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilPrendergast"><NameTxt>Senator Phil Prendergast</NameTxt>
	<P>Dr. Conor Farren, a consultant psychiatrist who spoke at the opening of St. Patrick&rsquo;s University Hospital&rsquo;s new addiction and mental health centre, stated: &ldquo;It is only now, in the post boom period, that we are recognising some of the negative consequences of the boom&rdquo;.  He added that of the 250,000 people registered with addiction problems, including alcoholism, only 20% are engaged in any form of treatment.</P>
        <P>It is with regret that I will be slightly parochial again, in that I wish to discuss the report on St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital in Clonmel.  There are so many problems within the service that Professor Brendan Drumm decided to allow a capital plan worth &euro;20 million to facilitate the hospital&rsquo;s closure.  Addiction services at Clonmel have been cut by 50%.  This does not add up and is an indication of what has gone wrong with the HSE.  At the Leader&rsquo;s earliest convenience, will he arrange a debate that will have meaning for front line services?  The Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, has repeatedly stated that she will not make cuts.  At the same time, the facts on the ground do not support her ideology.</P>
        <P>F&aacute;ilte Ireland&rsquo;s listed catering properties are officially classified as tourism businesses.  Will they be subject to the charge of &euro;200 or will they be treated separately?  This matter is important, as they are not private residences and they comprise the only economy that can grow in this significant economic downturn.  These buildings and businesses are dispersed across the country, so I am not being parochial.  Tourism is the one area in which we could achieve growth.  The issue requires an amazing amount of clarity.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The expenditure review committee under the chairmanship of Dr. Colm McCarthy has concluded its work and a report exists.  Amazingly, the latter&rsquo;s delivery to the Government is to be postponed.  Further, the Government will not consider it until some indefinite time in the future, presumably after Ministers have read it whenever they get it.  Are there divisions and disagreements within the Government regarding the matter?  For whatever reason or reasons, is the Government trying to induce the delay?  I ask the Leader because he is the conduit between the Government and the House.  We deserve to know the answer because of the serious state of the economy, as has been outlined&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <P>Perhaps there are tactical considerations, although I am not aware of them, but the Lisbon treaty has been mentioned and, as Senator O&rsquo;Toole and others have stated, it is important that we get an early opportunity to discuss the clarifications.  We should not be left in the dark.  We are depending on the Leader to outline the programme in respect of the expenditure review committee&rsquo;s report, that is, when we will see it, when it will be debated in the House and when it will be published, and the programme in respect of the Lisbon treaty referendum, namely, if a date has been set and when the House will get an opportunity to address the matter.  Not only do I wish to know the Government&rsquo;s programme, but have the leaders of the other political parties been consulted?</P>

	<P>One of the millennium development goals set in 2000 was to ensure that all of the world&rsquo;s children would have access to primary school education by 2015.  We are half way to that time, but we are falling short.  Some 75 million children are still without access to primary education, 20 times the population of our country.  This morning, Archbishop Desmond Tutu and former President Mary Robinson wrote to the leaders of the G8 nations, who will meet in Italy next week, to ask them to set up a global fund for education.  It is something that President Obama promised during his election campaign, but he has not done it yet.  The fund would be a great idea, as it would increase access for the world&rsquo;s children to education.  Will the Leader ask the Minister to make a statement on the matter expressing his support for such a fund?</P>

	<P>Two compelling presentations were made at yesterday&rsquo;s meeting of the Joint Committee on Health and Children.  The first, given by the Ombudsman for Children, has been mentioned by Senator Fitzgerald.  In this regard, the Seanad should be recalled when the Minister of State with responsibility for children deals with the report of the Ryan commission.  It is not good enough that the House would be in recess.  How will we deal with that important document and what is the Minister of State&rsquo;s implementation plan to help the thousands of people who have been abused by the religious orders?  Can the recall be arranged?  It does not seem like it would be a big deal for us to discuss the report in the Chamber.  It will be the most important report dealt with by the House this year.</P>
        <P>The name of our country has been sullied.  Around the world, Ireland is identified in a way contrary to the beautiful image of kind, friendly, charming and sociable people.  Our religious orders abused thousands of children.  Every country in the world knows about us.  I am asking for an emergency recall of the Seanad for when the Ryan report is being dealt with by the Minister of State.</P>
        <P>Yesterday, the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, ISPCC, made a compelling statement calling for 24-hour social services for children.  It raised this point often.  Since becoming a Member, how often have I asked for a 24-hour service for children?</P>

	<P>Yesterday&rsquo;s publication by the Central Statistics Office of national income figures must be debated in the House.  They indicate that national income shrunk earlier this year by between 7% of 10%.  If this trend continues for the year, it will shatter the country.</P>
        <P>The figures emphasise two crucial points, the first of which is on economics.  When other economies are showing signs of bottoming out or small shoots of growth, our economy is going in the opposite direction.  The second point is that the responsibility for this difference sits with the Government.  This slump is definitively and markedly worse than the slumps being experienced by other European economies.</P>

	<P>It is not so long since we had a debate on the Middle East during which we pointed to the change in direction of the new Administration in the United States, exemplified by the appointment of an envoy to the Middle East.  Since the appointment of President Obama, the US Administration has taken a stronger line on Israel but it is quite evident that the Israeli Administration does not take any notice whatever of any international pressure.</P>

	<P>It responds with absolute impunity.  It seems to hold the view that one can starve a population into subjection and deny it necessary medicines and yet in some way succeed in achieving a solution for the future.  We know from Irish history that this has never worked.  What is occurring is that the Israelis are creating a new generation of Palestinians who will realise that dialogue does not bring any results, thereby leading them to believe military action is necessary.  Worse again, it is grist to the mill of countries on the sideline, which seem to be at variance with the West at present, when they see what Israel is doing to the Palestinians.  This will have an impact globally.</P>
        <P>It is vital we have another debate urgently on the Middle East, especially because of the recent incidents.  We should place it on the record that we, as representatives of the Irish people, are unhappy with what we now regard as official terrorism.  I refer to the starvation of a people, the denial of medicines, the creation of a ghetto that is an open prison in itself and the total disregard for international opinion.  It is vital we press this message home.  I accept <Col N="487"/>the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Martin, has been very proactive in this regard.  We should supply him with all the support necessary to reinforce the stand he has taken.</P>

	<P>I take it the Seanad debate on that Bill will take place on the basis of the amendment.  Perhaps the Leader will clarify that.  The Enforcement of Court Orders Bill is listed for 2009.  It has not been made available yet, which leaves much to be desired in terms of the procedure of this House.</P>
        <P>I am rather shocked there may not be a debate in this House on the Lisbon treaty before the summer recess.  This would mean there will be none until a couple of weeks before the referendum.  The date on which the last Lisbon treaty referendum was announced was the same date on which the former Fianna F&aacute;il Taoiseach resigned.  Must we wait for the resignation of the current Taoiseach before we hear the date for the second Lisbon treaty referendum?</P>
        <P>We need to debate the treaty because there were diverging views in the House on the very issues that have been clarified by the European Council, namely, the issues pertaining to neutrality, tax, the right to life and family.  It would now be interesting to hold a debate in the House to determine whether there is consensus on the treaty.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Senator John Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the call for a debate on the Middle East.  In the North of Ireland, it took the two extremes to sit down and talk before we saw any real progress.  The reality is that the Israeli Prime Minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, has indicated for the first time the possibility of a two-state solution.  This is very positive and is to be well promoted.  In this regard, Israel has received from the European Union favoured-nation trading status.  In the debate, I would like to determine whether we could support the extension of this status to <Col N="488"/>Gaza and the West Bank, thereby providing the whole region with access to a larger market such that the West Bank and Gaza economies might improve.  This would serve as a carrot and stick to ensure they comply with international best practice and UN standards.</P>
        <P>I call for a debate on the economy.  There were calls this morning for the report of an bord snip nua to be published in the belief that people are somehow being kept in the dark.  It is as nothing compared with the reality that the Opposition has never produced a breakdown of how it would deal with the deficit of &euro;20 billion.</P>

	<P>I wish to raise a very important statistic, namely, the live register figure announced by the Central Statistics Office this morning.  Unemployment increased by 197,781 since June 2008, which represents an increase of 90%.  Rather than having crossfire regarding &euro;20 billion deficits and all kinds of other accusations about this side of the House, it would be more in line for Senators on the Government side and the Government itself to concentrate on that figure.  Everyone who constitutes the statistic is a person with a family.</P>
        <P>Last week I spoke about job losses at ABB in Waterford.  This morning, 120 job losses were announced by Bausch &amp; Lomb, a leading-edge technology manufacturing business in the south east.  Over the next few months, it will have halved its total workforce.  Waterford and the south east in particular are suffering badly because of the loss of good manufacturing jobs.  It is exposed more because of the presence of manufacturing in that part of the country.   I ask the Leader to invite the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Mary Coughlan, to the House so we can debate job losses and the creation and protection of jobs and hear her outline what her Department proposes to do to assist in this regard.</P>
        <P>We must offer hope to small and medium-sized enterprises.  Last week I was talking to some people involved in small businesses employing eight to ten people.  One said people such as he needed to see some hope and to be motivated to keep working because they are being knocked back continually.  Whether because of the decline in demand for products that such companies are producing, the cutting back of the working week to three days or other factors, such companies are being knocked back regularly.  They need to hear messages from the political establishment that there is light at the end of the tunnel, hope and a roadmap to help them try to emerge from the economic crisis.  It is all about jobs at this stage and that is where the focus should be.</P>

	<P>On Senator Coffey&rsquo;s point, I ask the Leader for an urgent debate on the Government&rsquo;s approach to tackling unemployment.  It is somewhat nauseating to listen to Senator Hanafin talking every day about whatever he talks about.  The bottom line is that this morning 140 people lost their jobs in Togher.  Senator Coffey said that numbers on the live register have gone up.  Yesterday in the D&aacute;il Deputy Kenny offered a cross-party approach to tackling the issue.  This morning we on this side of the House will offer the hand of bipartisanship and a cross-party approach to tackling the deficits in the economy, provided the Government listens.</P>

	<P>Yesterday Report Stage of the Broadcasting Bill lasted for two hours in this House and ended without a division.  The Broadcasting Bill was initiated in this House and was subject to many amendments, many of which came from the Opposition and were accepted.  Amendments were made in both Houses.  It proved an excellent example of how the Oireachtas should work.  Any Bill that comes to these Houses should be taken on that basis.  A Bill is a draft of legislation subject to amendment and the Government listens as all Members of both Houses respond.</P>

	<P>Questions to the Leader.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>The Central Statistics Office, CSO, report released today shows that national income is down by &euro;5.5 billion, partly because of the cuts and levies but mostly because of the fear of spending.  Underlying that is people&rsquo;s fear of losing their homes.  That is why they are holding on to their money.  Foreclosures are on the up.  I and Senator MacSharry asked for the Minister for Finance to come into the House to debate how he will intervene with the banks and request them to come up with creative solutions to help people to hold on to their homes.  This is critical.  One&rsquo;s home is one&rsquo;s castle.  It is one&rsquo;s dignity.  If one does not have a home, one has nothing.  As people lose their jobs their homes are at risk.  I would have liked to have had this debate before the summer recess.</P>
        <P>Yesterday I asked the Leader whether the Minister for Education and Science agrees that schools should levy parents to hire extra teachers because of the cutbacks.  I did not ask for a debate on this but for an answer to that question.  There are huge pitfalls in this proposal.  Our education system will become like our failed health system if we go down the road of paying for education within the public system.  It is a very serious move and I want an answer from the Leader, not a debate, before the summer recess.</P>

	<P>Senators Fitzgerald, O&rsquo;Toole and Coghlan expressed the urgency of dealing with mental health issues and spoke about the important meeting taking place today.  I wish everyone well.  We will give it our full support.  Many of our Seanad colleagues on all sides of the House want to make their mark by doing something substantial to address the challenges facing mental health.  The new Minister of State with responsibility for mental health, Deputy Moloney, also wants to make a huge change and massive difference in this area.  Having served on a health board with him for quite a long time, I know he has a great deal of experience.  We will do everything we can to keep mental health centre stage and to support the efforts of the Minister of State, the committee which meets today and of our colleagues in the House for whom this is a priority during their membership of the House, especially for the next three years, the remaining lifetime of this Government.</P>
        <P>The same Senators spoke about the protection of children, particularly those with intellectual disabilities, and the need for independent monitoring.  They asked for the Minister of State with responsibility for children to come back to the House to discuss this issue.  We all know that he is out of the country this week and we wish him well in his deliberations in Vietnam.  I will put this request to him personally on his return next weekend.</P><Col N="492"/>
        <P>Senators O&rsquo;Toole and Mary White asked for time to be allocated to the Ryan report in the House.  I have given a commitment on many Orders of Business to doing anything I can to discuss it further in the House, keep it centre stage and help those trying to find out what happened to their next of kin.  That is the least we can do on a humanitarian basis.  I fully support the call of Senators O&rsquo;Toole and Mary White.  The example Senator O&rsquo;Toole gave the House yesterday is a shocking and appalling example of something that we cannot stand over in any circumstances.  We will do everything we possibly can to ensure this does not happen again.  I commend Sister Stanislaus Kennedy&rsquo;s utterances yesterday.  We need more of these.  We will do anything we can in discussions with the leaders of the various groups in the House to allocate further time to this issue.</P>
        <P>Senators O&rsquo;Toole, Bradford, Walsh, Coghlan and Regan want time to discuss the Lisbon treaty referendum.  The Taoiseach will be in the House on 9 July at 11.45 a.m. for the Bill and colleagues can avail of the opportunity.  I will provide as much time as required by colleagues on that day to allow them to discuss and make known their views when the Taoiseach and various Ministers who will assist him will be in the House.</P>
        <P>Senators Alex White, Coghlan and Hanafin raised the Government&rsquo;s decision to publish the report of Colm McCarthy and an bord snip nua, as it is known.  I agreed with Senator Leyden yesterday when he called for it to be made public but we must await the Government&rsquo;s decision on it.  We must also bear in mind the various examples given here this morning.  We had 5% growth in April and no other country in Europe had growth for that month, and neither had China nor Japan.

	<P>Senators Leyden, Norris, &Oacute; Murch&uacute; and Hannigan all expressed their abhorrence at what is happening in the Middle East and I will certainly endeavour to allocate a small portion of time prior to the recess to allow colleagues to make their views known and to support the Minister for Foreign Affairs who is doing an incredible job expressing the views of the Irish people and their abhorrence at what is happening in Gaza.  I fully support the sentiments expressed this morning by Senators Leyden, Norris, &Oacute; Murch&uacute; and Hannigan.</P>
        <P>Senators Bradford and Keaveney welcomed the massive reduction in roaming charges for telephone calls and I also welcome it.  It will help everyone.</P>
        <P>Senator Walsh raised voluntary health insurance and gave an example with regard to seeking a reduction.  Health legislation will be before the House next Tuesday and I strongly suggest that the quite correct views outlined to the House by the Senator can be taken at that time.  With regard to legal fees, which I understand the Senator was discussing, I will consider it and come back to the House next week.  Senator Prendergast raised and outlined to the House the cutting of services, particularly in Clonmel.  The Senator can take this up with the Minister next Tuesday when the health legislation is before the House.</P>
        <P>I fully support Senators&rsquo; expressions of support for anything we can do for the tourism industry at this time.  We all know and we can see that many people will holiday in Ireland this year and will not go abroad.  This is to be welcomed in support of the home tourism industry.  Please God we will have fine weather to let them enjoy their holiday in their home country and support those working in the tourism sector.</P>
        <P>Senator Hannigan raised the matter of global funding for education and I will pass his views on to the Minister.</P>
        <P>Senator Mary White called for a 24-hour service for child care and quoted the example of 414,000 calls to Childline with the highest percentage being received between 5 p.m. and 9 a.m.  I fully support Senators Mary White and Fitzgerald in their call for us to do everything we can to support children.</P>
        <P>Senator Donohoe raised the matter of income decline.  I suppose that is something that is happening all over the world but I notice that consumer confidence in our country has increased for the first time in many months.</P>

        <P>Senator Regan raised local government charges and the Bill will go ahead as outlined.  Senators Coffey, Buttimer and Healy Eames raised the unemployment figures.  As we often stated in the House the biggest challenge facing the country is jobs, and competitiveness is the root of the evil.  If we look at the graphs for the past 20 years, the one failure, if we had a failure, was the high cost of labour.</P>

	<P>Whether we like it or not, the high costs of labour and energy have taken away our competitiveness and we must seriously examine this through social partnership.  I applauded the social partnership achievements since 1987 when the country was last in a massive downturn.  All of us on all sides of the House face a serious challenge in this area; if we can get Ireland back to be competitive, jobs will be created, but if we do not jobs will be very difficult to recreate.  We all know that and I do not care what part of the country one is from.  I sympathise with our friends in Cork and Waterford and with anyone who is losing a job.  It is a dreadful thing to happen, particularly when there is a downturn with no outlet to go to the United States, Australia or the UK as our friends did during the previous two occasions when there was a downturn.</P>
        <P>There is nothing as good as being able to get out of bed in the morning and have a job to go to and to do some work during the day.  The spirit of the person is being challenged and I agree with the sentiments expressed on all sides of the House.  I know colleagues are genuinely concerned for friends and relations who are losing their jobs through no fault of their own.  I will discuss with the leaders of the groups having an all-day debate at the earliest possible time with not one but perhaps two or three Ministers present to see how to come up with some formula of proposals to assist the Government and the Minister who holds the portfolio.</P>
        <P>Senator Boyle made quite correct remarks on the Broadcasting Bill.  I compliment the Minister for accepting amendments and I compliment all colleagues for not dividing the House on the matters before them for their consideration yesterday.</P>
        <P>Senator Healy Eames raised the matter of charging levies on parents with regard to school-going children.  I certainly will make inquiries and come back to the Senator directly.</P>

        <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to open the debate in the Seanad on the Local Government (Charges) Bill 2009.  The purpose of the Bill is to give effect to the Government&rsquo;s budgetary decision to introduce <Col N="495"/>an annual charge on non-principal private residences.  The Bill sets the charge at a level of &euro;200 and it will be payable, in the main, by owners of rental, holiday and vacant properties.</P>
        <P>It represents a significant broadening of the revenue base of local authorities.  The proceeds of the charge will be paid to, and retained by, local authorities, and it will apply in 2009 and subsequent years.  This is the first time in more than 30 years that a new source of local funding has been made available to local authorities.  This measure is significant because it recognises that local authorities should not be disproportionately dependent on central government funding and, to this extent, its importance outweighs the level of revenue which it will generate  The existing revenue base of local authorities is narrow by international standards.</P>
        <P>It is now generally accepted that our economy, especially our tax revenue, has been overly reliant on activity in the construction sector.  The decline in the yield from transaction taxes such as stamp duty, capital gains tax and value added tax on property generally has been a major factor in the imbalance in our public finances which the Government has had to address.  The correction has been sharp and painful and more needs to be done.  The &euro;200 charge on non-principal residences is one of the measures taken to close the gap between expenditure and revenue.  However, it should be seen as more than simply a measure to raise additional revenue.  It is a new form of revenue stream that will not be subject to the volatility associated with the transaction-based property taxes to which I referred earlier.</P>
        <P>The Bill is a relatively short and straightforward legislative measure.  Essentially, owners of non-principal private residences will be liable to pay to the city or county council in which a relevant property is located an annual charge of &euro;200.  Liability arises each year on a point in time basis.  Ownership of a relevant residential property on a specified day, known in the Bill as a liability date, gives rise to the requirement to pay the charge.  I intend to designate 31 July as the liability date for 2009.  In subsequent years the liability date will be 31 March and this earlier date will fit better with the overall annual financial cycle of local authorities.</P>
        <P>The charge can be viewed as a type of self-assessment measure because it is for the owners of residential property, in the first instance, to assess whether they are liable to pay the charge.  Given the relatively modest level at which the charge is set, I consider it important to minimise the costs associated with its collection.  Accordingly, city and county councils will not be required to issue bills or invoices to those persons who own property liable for the charge.  None the less, the charge is a relatively simple and straightforward measure and is easy to understand and administer.  I do not anticipate that those persons who are liable to pay it will be under any confusion on this point, and my Department and local authorities will mount an information campaign to advise people of their responsibilities in this regard.  In addition to the normal sanctions involving a fine on conviction of an offence, the Bill incorporates a late payment fee which should act as a real incentive to pay the charge when it falls due.</P>
        <P>From a drafting perspective, the Bill starts from a position where all residential property is liable for the charge.  It goes on to exempt certain buildings and owners from this liability.  To put it another way, it identifies what is not liable within the totality of residential buildings, rather than taking as a starting point buildings and owners that are liable.</P>
        <P>By far the most important exemption relates to principal private residences.  Owner-occupied residences account for some 70% of the entire housing stock.  The more important of the other exemptions include property which is let directly or indirectly by local authorities or voluntary housing bodies for social housing, property that is the subject of shared ownership arrangements with local authorities and certain heritage properties.  Other exemptions to the charge are provided for, including persons who, in the process of changing house, own two residential properties for a short period, residential properties owned by charities and certain discretionary <Col N="496"/>trusts and a spouse having an interest in a property after a divorce or separation agreement but who does not reside there but the other spouse does.</P>
        <P>Following publication of the Bill, the point was made to me that mobile homes are a special case and should not be subject to the &euro;200 charge.  There are arguments for and against requiring a charge to be paid in respect of these properties.  Some mobile homes are sited in very desirable locations and are traded on the market for significant sums of money.  However, on balance and on reflection, I am disposed to accept the arguments that most mobile homes are a relatively modest form of accommodation and that, in many cases, those who own them do not also own the land on which they are situated.  I am therefore tabling an amendment to exempt mobile homes from the charge.</P>
        <P>The Bill provides that the charge shall be paid to county and city councils with an estimated annual yield of some &euro;40 million.  However, census and other data suggest that there may be some 400,000 properties in the State liable for the charge.  The annual potential yield therefore could be higher than estimated at present.  Like any new taxation measure, however, knowledge of the actual yield will only come with experience of its operation in practice.  Given the data sources available, it is likely that, initially at least, collection levels from rental properties, of which there are about 200,000, may be higher than from holiday homes and vacant residential properties.</P>
        <P>For reasons of efficiency, the smaller urban authorities that are rating authorities &mdash; those that levy and collect commercial rates &mdash; will not be involved in this exercise.  They will, however, receive a payment from their parent county council based on the yield from the charge related to properties located in the town area.  Provision is also made for the costs of collection of these charges to be retained by the parent local authority.  This ensures all local authorities who have revenue-raising powers will benefit from the introduction of the charge.</P>
        <P>In the event of non-payment of a charge for which a person is liable by a certain date, a late payment fee of &euro;20 will apply for each month or part of a month for which the charge remains unpaid.  An unpaid charge and any associated late payment fee will be a charge against the property in respect of which the liability arises.</P>
        <P>The rolled up amount of a late payment fee should not be underestimated and non-payment of a charge for a period of five years will result in a liability of almost &euro;5,000 when account is taken both of the charges and the late payment fees.  I want the message to go out clearly to those who are liable to pay the charge that it will be simpler and a lot less expensive to pay the charge when it falls due than to attempt to evade it, especially in terms of the resale of the property concerned.  Local authorities will also have power to take prosecutions against owners who fail to discharge their liability to pay the charge.  Prosecution will be by way of summary jurisdiction and a court may impose a fine of up to &euro;2,000.</P>
        <P>Where a property liable for the charge is sold, the Bill provides that the new owner of the property will be liable for unpaid charges and late payment fees, and that these will remain a charge against the property for a period of 12 years from the date that they were incurred.  This should prove a strong incentive for a purchaser&rsquo;s solicitor to ensure that all outstanding charges are paid before a contract to sell the property is executed.</P>
        <P>Local authorities can delegate functions to the Local Government Computer Services Board or the Local Government Management Services board, or both.  In practice, the computer services board will design and operate a website facilitating electronic payment of the charge and a database to record payments.  It is likely that local authorities will delegate functions to the local government computer services board with regard to overall operation and manage<Col N="497"/>ment of a website through which the charge can be paid and a database recording payment of the charge.</P>
        <P>Provision is made for data exchange between local authorities and the Private Residential Tenancies Board, PRTB, the Electricity Supply Board and the Revenue Commissioners.  This data should assist local authorities to identify properties liable for the charge.  The PRTB holds data on rental properties and the ESB&rsquo;s systems can generate data on residential properties where a relatively low quantum of electricity is used, something which may indicate the possibility of a holiday or a vacant residential property.  The Revenue Commissioners hold data on certain property transactions, such as stamp duty, VAT and capital gains taxes.</P>
        <P>Payment will be accepted on behalf of any local authority through a website that has been designed and constructed by the Local Government Computer Services Board and which is broadly similar to the motor tax on-line system.  The revenue accruing will be relayed automatically and at intervals to the bank account of the city or county council in whose area the property is situated.  While payment will also be accepted locally in local authority offices, I ask those concerned to use the website for their own convenience.  This will minimise costs associated with the administration and collection of the charge.</P>
        <P>Senators will be aware of the significant role which the local government fund has played in the financing of local government since it was established in 1999.  The fund is financed from a combination of an Exchequer contribution and the full proceeds of motor taxation.  Total funding for 2009 amounts to some &euro;1.46 billion, which represents approximately 30% of local authority current funding.  The fund comprises an Exchequer contribution of &euro;417 million and the proceeds of motor tax, which is projected at &euro;1.04 billion this year.  In addition, local authorities will retain the full proceeds of the new pension-related deduction, estimated at &euro;80 million in 2009, and the Exchequer contribution to the fund has been reduced to take account of the deduction.  The new pension related deduction has, therefore, a neutral impact on local authority finances in 2009.</P>
        <P>Local authority current expenditure amounted to &euro;1.8 billion in 1997.  This year, current expenditure by local government will be in the order of &euro;5 billion.  Local authorities were advised of their 2009 general purpose grant allocations in October 2008, which indicated an average reduction of 6.4% over the corresponding 2008 allocations.  The general purpose grant allocation from the fund to local authorities for 2009 amounts to &euro;935 million.  These allocations have been reviewed in light of the estimated income from motor tax in 2009 and the Exchequer contribution to the fund for 2009 as set out in the supplementary budget.  This has necessitated a further reduction in individual allocations of 3% and I have notified local authorities on the matter.  The &euro;200 charge is estimated to provide some &euro;40 million in income to local authorities.  This will more than ameliorate the impact of the reduction of &euro;30 million in general purpose grants to which I have referred.</P>
        <P>A properly resourced local government sector is vital to local democracy.  I take this opportunity, however, to refer briefly to another issue that is equally important to the well-being of the local government sector.  As Senators will be aware, I have published a Green Paper on Local Government Reform and will publish a White Paper after the Government has had an opportunity to consider the report of the Commission on Taxation.  The Green Paper addresses a number of issues, including, a proper balance of power at local levels between the managers and elected representatives, directly elected mayors, establishing town councils in towns that have displayed significant population growth, quality customer service and expenditure limits at local elections.</P>
        <P>I refer briefly to my recent announcement that the first election for a mayor for Dublin with a regional mandate will be held during the summer of next year.  The election of the Dublin <Col N="498"/>mayor in 2010 will fulfil, one year ahead of target, a key commitment of the Government&rsquo;s programme.  In introducing a directly elected Mayor for the region, the Government will be making the most significant change to local democratic leadership in Dublin since the foundation of our current system of local government in the 19th century.  Dublin is both a city and a region.  A strong, dynamic and sustainable capital is essential to the well-being of the whole nation, not just to the people of the city itself.  Experience has shown that strong political leadership can bring a new dynamic to cities and their regions.</P>
        <P>The mayor will be elected by the people of the city and the three surrounding Dublin county councils, that is, the area which constitutes the existing Dublin Regional Authority, and will have the powers to set strategic policy for the region, co-ordinate across institutional boundaries and ensure that local activity is in tune with a coherent set of strategic regional policies and plans.  A strengthened Dublin Regional Authority, chaired by the mayor, will support and complement the mayor&rsquo;s activities.  The introduction of a democratically accountable mayor for Dublin, a position which personifies local government and thereby forges a new connection with the public, will capture the imagination of the people of this city.  Among the consequences will be improved strategic planning for the region, better services, greater integration and coherence, enhanced use of resources and stronger local democracy.</P>
        <P>Quality customer service is another issue that is addressed in the Green Paper.  The efficient and effective performance of local government is of real importance to our citizens and to the welfare of our local communities.  In that context, the transforming public services agenda will build on the local government modernisation programme which has taken place over the past decade, but will also represent a step change in regard to progress in this area. The report on transforming public services recommends that local government structures should be drawn on to enhance public service delivery.  The democratic legitimacy of elected councils is also recognised and should be maximised as a focus for consultation on the delivery of national services locally.  The local government sector is a willing and able partner in this agenda and recognises that public sector transformation is an integral part of the solution to Ireland&rsquo;s current economic difficulties.</P>
        <P>In this context, greater coherence and synergy between different levels of Government and the public service are fundamental to more efficient and effective operation.  My Department and the local government sector are working closely together to advance broad public service initiatives for a more integrated public service which can achieve better value for money and enhanced customer service.</P>

        <P Just="Left">The Local Government (Charges) Bill is a short and straightforward legislative instrument.  The revenue stream to which it will give rise is significant, at &euro;40 million annually, but could not be described as large in the context of overall local government spending.  Nonetheless, its importance cannot be measured simply in these terms.  The Bill establishes a new funding source for local authorities, one that is genuinely local in that it derives from revenue raised locally and that will be expended for local purposes.  By broadening the revenue base of local authorities, it can properly be described as a ground-breaking initiative and I hope it will receive a general welcome for that reason.  Arguably, it would serve the interests of local democracy still better if local authority members themselves determined, perhaps within certain limits, the level of the charge, as is the case in regard to commercial rates.  There may be scope to devolve other aspects of the charge to local authorities also.  These are issues that I may well revisit at a future date, and I would very much welcome the views of Senators in this respect.</P>
        <P>I thank Senators for their co-operation in facilitating early consideration of the Bill and I commend it to the House.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="499"/>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister and his officials to the House for the debate.  The Fine Gael Party in principle supports the general tenor and thrust of the Bill, in which the Minister proposes to broaden the revenue base for local authorities.  It is a widely debated issue, not only in this Chamber and the Lower House but also in many local authority chambers throughout the country.  Indeed, it has been the subject of many conferences and I know my colleague, Senator Glynn, has attended many conferences and has made contributions on the whole area of local government funding.</P>
        <P>This Bill breaks new ground in providing a way in which local authorities can raise and broaden their revenue base.  However, there are implications for the implementation of the Bill that need further analysis and clarification from the Minister.  He briefly referred to the charges for mobile homes, which has already been widely debated by the public, including on public radio shows, as the Minister will know &mdash; one Senator referred this morning to this sudden Government U-turn on the mobile charge as &ldquo;the Joe Duffy amendment&rdquo;.  The U-turn is welcome.  Many people have mobile homes in holiday parks which they do not own and they pay an annual charge for the use of that holiday park.  While they may have owned the mobile home for decades, this new charge would have been additional and, therefore, the Government amendment to remove the section that applies a charge is welcome.</P>
        <P>In a way, this amendment tells us that the Bill has been rushed, despite its general thrust having been announced in the budget of October 2008, where it was indicated that a &euro;200 charge would apply to non-principal residences in this country.  Why has there been a delay and why is the Bill suddenly going through all Stages in the House on one of the last sitting days of the session?  If Opposition parties want to table amendments on Report Stage, we would be entitled to time to do so, which would mean the business of the Seanad would have to be rescheduled to facilitate the debate.  Any reasonable person would acknowledge that this is not the best way to introduce legislation.  The Minister needs to take account of this point and he should not try to rush legislation through the House in this manner.</P>
        <P>I wish to address some of the measures contained in the Bill.  To broaden the revenue base for local authorities is certainly a welcome element and is the main thrust of the Bill.  It is estimated it will yield in excess of &euro;40 million per annum for local authorities, although this will vary from one local authority area to another.  Obviously, much building has taken place in the commuter belt around Dublin and the local authorities in that area stand to gain much more than those in other areas, where there is not as many second residences.  Some areas will, therefore, have a slight imbalance with regard to fund raising.</P>
        <P>In addition, it needs to be acknowledged that this is not additional funding for local authorities.  As the Minister said, he has cut local authority general purpose grants by almost 10% in this year&rsquo;s allocation compared to the allocation for 2008.  The Bill is really trying to fill the gap caused by huge deficits in local authority budgets and we are not sure it will succeed because we do not know the full amount of income that will be yielded from this source.  Many issues remain to be examined in the coming months and years to ensure local authorities are properly funded.  The Bill will not answer all the questions, although it will go some way towards doing that.</P>
        <P>With regard to administration, most of the Opposition amendments which will be discussed later focus on the administration and collection of these charges by local authorities, which are already overstretched with regard to their mandate to carry out many obligations under the various Local Government Acts.  Local authorities are pressed in their effort to deliver services on the ground and this is an additional workload we are asking them to take on.  I am not sure if the means by which local authorities will collect this charge has been fully thought out.  While <Col N="500"/>the Minister stated that an online system will be used and an effort will be made to centralise the collection system, enforcement and the administration of the system will require resources.</P>
        <P>Fine Gael makes the reasonable request that the Minister consider a role for the Revenue Commissioners in the collection of this charge as they have the best resources and ICT systems to analyse and ensure its full and proper collection.  It is a new area for local authorities to step into.  I understand they are involved in the motor tax system but this system is quite different and, as it concerns property ownership and the many legal issues around that, it is more complex.  Fine Gael believes the Revenue Commissioners could play a greater role in regard to the collection system, although we will come back to this point at a later stage.</P>
        <P>We also have concerns with regard to exemptions.  For example, the HSE might have contracted with private landlords for emergency accommodation or otherwise, or local authorities might have contracted accommodation through the rental accommodation scheme.  If my understanding is correct, these accommodations are exempt although they are similar.  The question that arises is what is deemed to be the difference between one house which is in the RAS and another on the opposite terrace.  Although it is the same type of house with the same builder, one house will be charged while the house in the RAS will not be charged.  We need clarification on this because, if it is the case, it seems quite unfair that just because a private landlord enters a contract with a local authority for long-term accommodation, he should be exempted while a person living across the road is not.</P>
        <P>I referred briefly to the implications for local authority resources.  The motor tax system is working very well, which I have always acknowledged in the House.  It is an excellent system that should be expanded to more areas if at all possible.  In this case, the Minister is proposing such an expansion but I have some concerns.  The Minister referred to the Private Residential Tenancies Board, which gives rise to a serious issue.  The PRTB was before the joint committee yesterday and we heard horrifying evidence of how its business operates.  It seems to be one of the main planks of information and data exchange that the Minister is depending on for this scheme but, if that is what it is, I assure the Minister it is a very shaky and vulnerable plank.</P>
        <P>Did the Minister know there is over &euro;10 million sitting in the bank accounts of the PRTB that has not yet transferred to local authorities, to which it should have transferred long ago to assist them in inspections and enforcement?  The PRTB claims this is not its fault and that it is carrying out the registrations and collecting the money.  When questioned by Opposition committee members, it quite squarely blamed the Department and the Minister.  It was claimed that the local authorities are not drawing down this money and that there is a role for the Department and the Minister in ensuring this will happen.  For every registration of private rented accommodation, &euro;70 is collected.  Four sevenths of this is retained by the PRTB and three sevenths is meant to go to local authorities.  In the current economic climate, it is a disgrace if &euro;10 million is sitting in a bank account of a State body that has not been moved to where it should have gone.  I draw the Minister&rsquo;s attention to this issue.</P>
        <P>With regard to ICT systems, the PRTB is dealing with all registrations manually.  It is all hard paperwork because, the board claims, legislation does not allow it to use an online system similar to the motor tax system.  This means it must employ more than the core 40 staff.  It employes a further 25 agency staff to manually input every registration of a private accommodation and the system has resulted in a significant backlog.  There is no information technology system to manage the registration database or to case manage all the registrations and this is causing significant backlogs and disarray in the board.</P>
        <P>Dispute resolution takes between 12 to 18 months but in its corporate plan the board set down a target of between five and six months for dealing with disputes.  This is totally inefficient <Col N="501"/>and unacceptable and any reasonable person would agree with me.  It is taking almost three times longer than it should to deal with disputes related to private rented accommodation, largely due to inefficiencies and excessive bureaucracy within the structure.  I was informed that adjudicators in disputed cases are paid more than &euro;600 per day, which is amazing.  Up to now they have been dealing only with one case per day but now they are being asked to deal with more than three cases per day.  A sum of &euro;600 per day paid by the Private Residential Tenancies Board, PRTB, is a very good payment for any individual for the completion of such work.  There is no on-line payment system or IT system within the PRTB and I am unsure how the Minister intends to share data with the board as set out in the Bill.  The board is struggling to deal manually with much of the workload as it stands.  A great deal of attention is required in this area.</P>
        <P>The Minister referred to data sharing between the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social and Family Affairs, especially the sharing of personal public service numbers.  The Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, of which I am a member, examined the idea of sharing PPSNs as part of an effort to update the electoral registration system.  There are issues with the Data Protection Act and sharing certain personal information.  Clarification is required in this area if the Minister expects to acquire information from those Departments for the purposes of this Bill.  This could be a problem which the Minister and his officials have not foreseen.</P>
        <P>The Minister also referred to the ESB and electricity usage.  I worked in the ESB and there are data protection issues with regard to any information on accounts or usage it issues to any third party.  This is also an issue and it would not only involve the ESB.  There are several other suppliers in the electricity industry, including Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann, Airtricity and many others, but they are not mentioned anywhere in the Bill.  Such organisations keep account of electricity supply issues.  While the principle of data sharing contained in the Bill is good, the matter has not been fully thought out.  The PRTB is a disaster at present yet it is one of the main planks of the Bill with regard to sharing information and support for local authorities in this area.</P>
        <P>I refer to the implications on the tourism industry.  Fine Gael welcomes that this charge will not be applied to mobile homes.  However, there are many areas where there are holiday homes owned by small businesses or tourism companies.  Such firms have considerable concerns because they already pay rates to local authorities for these homes and they will now be asked to pay an additional charge of &euro;200 per home.  These homes are not owned by individuals but by small tourism companies.  If the charge were levied the companies would pass it on to the holidaymaker, automatically increasing the cost of holidaying in Ireland.  This has negative implications for tourism in Ireland.  We are trying to promote holidaying at home and to create incentives for people to holiday in Ireland.  The Minister should examine this area and he may be able to clarify the matter later.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Another area requiring clarification relates to exemptions.  If a person owns a house and provides it to his or her parent, it can attract mortgage interest relief because there is no revenue income from such a house.  By the same principle, is it not reasonable to call for such a house to qualify for an exemption to the charge as well?  The Revenue may grant mortgage interest relief if it can be demonstrated with evidence that a son or daughter provides a house for a parent from which there is no rental income.  This is part of the reason the Revenue Commissioners provides a better collection system.  It is reasonable to request that such houses would not be subject to the charge also and I seek clarification on this matter.</P>
        <P>The Minister called for the views of Senators with regard to whether councillors or local elected representatives should determine the charge within certain limits.  I would welcome such a measure because we must give autonomy to local authorities and real power to elected <Col N="502"/>local representatives.  We have recently emerged from local elections in which excellent councillors have been elected throughout the country.  They have the ability and capability to run their local authorities if the correct funding is provided.  The Minister could allocate power to set the charge in this area and I welcome any further moves to give more autonomy to local elected representatives.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Ba mhaith liom f&aacute;ilte a chur roimh an Aire go dt&iacute; an Teach.  I welcome the Bill which gives effect to a budgetary measure announced by the Government last October.  Any legislation or measure which devolves the power to local authority members to raise additional finance by way of reserve function is welcome.  I have long advocated this measure and I have not changed my mind on the matter.  Many local authority members, local authorities and associated organisations, including my nominating body, the Association of Municipal Authorities of Ireland, the Association of County and City Councils and the Local Authority Members Association have long advocated devolving more power to local authority members and local government.  However, it must be borne in mind if one is dependent on the Minister to allocate more money, one is depending on a broken stick because the Minister has much to do with money.  I say as much with due respect to the Minister, Deputy Gormley.  If local government is to be able to stand alone then it must stand on its own two feet in so far as it is possible.</P>
        <P>We have seen the erosion of the funding base of local authorities throughout the years.  I recall the early 1970s, during which the coalition of the Labour Party and Fine Gael started the abolition of rates, followed by the Fianna F&aacute;il Government of 1977 which abolished them totally, an outrageous and bad decision all around for which we are still paying.  This is the first real opportunity for local authorities to raise money apart from the Local Government (Financial Provisions) (No. 2) Act 1983 which introduced local charges.  This is another way for local authorities and local authority members to get money to spend on functions.  The Local Government (Charges) Bill 2009 has been introduced to give legal effect to the measures in the budget.  The &euro;200 charge will apply to the owners of residential rental property, holiday homes and vacant properties unless the vacant property is newly constructed but unsold.  Let us pause here for a moment.  I do not regard the Minister&rsquo;s decision to row back on the charge for mobile homes as a U-turn.  Any legislation published will always be subject to scrutiny.  This is one of the reasons legislation is first published and the process then involves five stages to ensure mistakes are identified and corrected.  Perhaps the mistake this time is a mistake with a small &ldquo;m&rdquo; or a large &ldquo;M&rdquo;.  It depends from where one is coming.</P>
        <P>One of my pet aversions is derelict properties.  If one travels down the main street of any town or city one will see properties vacant for the longest time.  When a local authority applies pressure under the Derelict Sites Act, lo and behold a planning application is made.  Is such a planning application given effect in many cases?  The answer is &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  I welcome this measure.  In the case of vacant properties which have been allowed to become derelict by their owners a fine of &euro;200 is not sufficient.  These properties are a blight and an eyesore on the streetscapes of many villages, towns and cities and it is wrong that this is allowed happen.  This provision is a small step forward in resolving that problem but in my view the measure should be stronger.  I suggest there should be stronger legislative measures to eliminate this type of disregard practised by many property owners in our towns, cities and villages and even in the countryside.</P>
        <P>The law is the law, whether we like it or not.  It should be mandatory for property owners to register, just as we are all obliged to pay car tax in the motor taxation offices or any other service charges payable in the finance office of the relevant local authority.  I do not see any <Col N="503"/>reason why this cannot be done.  This provision will give members more money to spend under reserved functions.</P>
        <P>I refer to the Minister&rsquo;s contribution in which he states, &ldquo;For reasons of efficiency, the smaller urban authorities that are rating authorities &mdash; those that levy and collect commercial rates &mdash; will not be involved in this exercise.&rdquo;  I say to the Minister that they should be.  I could cite many examples of small town councils but I will not name them as I would leave out too many.  It was the very same when the policing committees were initiated and it was decided that town councils were not to be involved.  I remind the Minister that most crime is committed in towns and cities.  The Minister show row back on his decision and he should devolve to the town councils that are rating authorities the power to collect this levy.</P>
        <P>I refer, for example, to Bray which has a larger population than at least two counties.  Tralee has a 12-seat town council as has Dundalk.  Does the Minister propose that these towns will not be involved in this process?  I consider that to be wrong and I ask the Minister to look again at this proposal with a view to correcting it.</P>
        <P>The Minister referred in his speech to the Green Paper and I welcome his statement:</P>
        <P LI="1">The Green Paper addressed a number of issues, including a proper balance of power at local levels between the managers and elected representatives, directly elected mayors, establishing town councils in towns that have displayed significant population growth, quality customer service and expenditure limits at local elections.</P>
        <P FLI="0">In my view the creation of new town councils is a must.  While the non-rating town councils might not have a lot of powers &mdash; I ask the Minister to address this point in whatever way he can &mdash; nevertheless, they have an elected voice, an elected forum and they identify many issues that need to be identified.  Some Members of this House would say that town councils should be abolished.  If this is the case, it is amazing and we have come a long way.  We fought hard for democracy and now there are people in elected positions advocating its abolition.  This is hard to credit but it is true.</P>
        <P>The Minister will be aware that many county councillors work full-time as councillors because it is a full-time job.  Not only county borough councillors but also even some town councillors work full-time.  In one local electoral area of County Westmeath, one councillor out of five works full-time in another job and all the others work full-time as councillors because they realise and appreciate that it takes all of their time and not just part of it.  In that context, I feel obliged to relate to the Minister the concerns of councillors.  In this time of shortage and recession we all know that everybody has to do his or her bit but many councillors depend on their income from the local authority.  I ask the Minister to stay his hand from being too hard on them with regard to their income and training seminars and I make no apology for saying so.  Local government membership is ever-evolving and the knowledge required is also ever-evolving.  The real learning process for any representative is the interaction with other locally elected members.  The only means of doing this is by attending training seminars.</P>
        <P>I welcome this measure which has been long awaited and I hope it will be successful for the Minister.  I ask him to reconsider the decision not to include the rating town councils in this process as there are very practical reasons they should be included.  From my knowledge of small local authorities and urban authorities, they are extremely efficient and they do a marvellous job.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire.  Ba mhaith liom f&aacute;ilte a chur roimh an mBille.  Seo ceist at&aacute; t&oacute;gtha agam sa Seanad go minic.  T&aacute;im ag d&eacute;anamh gur th&oacute;g m&eacute; an cheist tr&iacute; huaire &oacute; d&eacute;aneadh na f&oacute;gra&iacute; sa ch&aacute;inaisn&eacute;is dheireanach anuraidh.  Ach roimhe seo, bh&iacute; s&eacute; <Col N="504"/>t&oacute;gtha agam ag iarraidh ar an Aire Airgeadais Bille mar seo a chur chun tosaigh.  Os as T&iacute;r Chonaill i nD&uacute;n na nGall m&eacute;, t&aacute; a fhios agam go bhfuil an chomhairle contae ansin iontach gn&iacute;omhach ag iarraidh go dtabharfa&iacute; isteach an levy seo.  T&aacute; siad ag obair chuige sin ar feadh go leor blianta.  T&aacute; a fhios agam go raibh mall air go dt&iacute; seo, c&eacute; gur d&uacute;radh san Indecon report i 1992 go mbeadh a leith&eacute;id de rud ann. I welcome this Bill and I commend the Minister for bringing it forward.  I have raised the issue on many occasions in the House since the announcement was made in the budget that the Bill should be brought forward.  I was dissatisfied that it had taken so long to bring this legislation before the House.</P>
        <P>I refer the Minister to the legislative programme for the Seanad this week which is absolutely crazy.  We have gone through weeks with no legislation and instead have had statements on this, that and the other, and we are now rushing through with nine pieces of legislation this week.  This does not make any sense but that is a debate for another day.  This Bill is good legislation although I would like to see it amended.  I will discuss amendments on Committee Stage and I will raise some of them with the Minister today.</P>
        <P>I raised this issue before the Government ever made the announcement because I have strong views on the matter.  Holiday homes in particular should pay a rate towards the contribution made to them by local authorities such as the provision of water, roads, sewerage and all the other amenities they use.  I raised this issue with the Minister for Finance and he was not disposed at the time but I am pleased that the Minister and his Department have seen the need to introduce this charge.  One of the key areas of concern to me was that local authorities would be able to retain the revenue collected within their administrative area.  When I raised this matter in the House as a matter on the Adjournment it was clear that this was not the first option which would be considered.  I am glad the Minister has decided on the right course of action for which he is to be commended.</P>
        <P>I am pleased the Minister will introduce an amendment to exempt caravans as that makes sense.</P>
        <P>Regarding some of the other issues in the Bill, as a Donegal Senator, and probably from a selfish point of view, I have raised on a number of occasions the amount of money Donegal could accrue from this scheme.  Last year I calculated that just over 23,000 properties in Donegal would come under this scheme.  We have the highest number of holiday homes in the country, at 8,275, and that is the ones that are built.  Planning permission has been granted for approximately another 1,000 that have not yet been constructed.  We have the sixth highest number of occupied rental properties in the State, at 4,232, and 10,768 non-principal private residences, or second houses, which is the largest number in the State after the cities of Cork, Dublin and Galway.  That is a total of over 23,000, which would bring in &euro;4.655 million to the local authority if all those properties were levied.</P>
        <P>In the budget it was announced that &euro;40 million would be accrued from this levy.  I thought that was a lazy calculation because I presume what was looked at were the rental properties in the State and that figure was multiplied by &euro;200, but it did not take account of the vacant houses and holiday homes.  I am glad the Oireachtas Library and Research Service has confirmed the figures I was using, which is that it would bring in over &euro;90 million if all properties were levied and &euro;4.6 million for Donegal County Council.  That will go some way to meeting the needs of the county.</P>
        <P>The Minister will be aware that many people were made redundant in Donegal County Council.  We are facing major challenges and I am very disappointed that a Government decision did not come from the Cabinet yesterday on the &euro;1 million bill from the council to deal with the flooding that occurred in Gweedore.  That is a separate issue which I, my col<Col N="505"/>league, Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill, and others will continue to raise in trying to ensure that money is forthcoming.</P>
        <P>I want to make a number of points about the advertising campaign.  The Minister said that the date set is 31 July.  I presumed it would be September or a later date because 30 days is a short period of time.  I am not sure if the computer programme has been built.  Are there plans afoot to have the advertising campaign rolled out?  How will that advertising campaign be rolled out?  In particular I would like information on where that advertising campaign will be rolled out.  I gave the Minister statistics in terms of Donegal.  Many of the holiday homes in Donegal are owned by people who reside in the Six Counties.  Will there be a concentrated focus on advertising in that area to bring to people&rsquo;s attention that this levy is now in place?</P>
        <P>Senator Coffey raised the other problem, namely, who should collect the money?  I believe it should be the local authorities but that calls into question difficulties being experienced by local authorities.  I spoke to someone in the manager&rsquo;s office earlier today who said that people are being moved left, right and centre.  People are now doing two jobs and covering many bases because of the difficulties being experienced by local authorities in laying off temporary workers.  There is a recruitment ban in place but the local authority may need to recruit somebody to oversee the collection of these charges.  That is something that must be dealt with by the Minister&rsquo;s Department to allow local authorities recruit somebody on a permanent basis from the moneys they collect.  I cannot see how they can do it under their current complement and it would be wrong, because it is a big job in terms of following up on these charges, that no one person would be responsible for it.  From my experience in Donegal and listening to members of local authorities in other counties, I am aware there is no more meat on the bones, so to speak, in local authorities.  They are pared down to the bone and we must ensure they have that staff complement to assist them in the collection of these charges.</P>
        <P>I have a number of concerns about the exemptions in the Bill, which I will outline.  For example, many people have houses with built on granny flats, as they are known, to house an elderly parent.  Under this legislation owners of houses with built on self-contained flats, which are usually sons or daughters, must pay &euro;200.  That is wrong and I would like to see that exempt.</P>
        <P>To give another example, in my area of Donegal 10,000 people have lost their jobs in the past year but there has always been a tradition of people working away from home.  Under this legislation somebody who owns a house in Gweedore, The Rosses or wherever and is married with children but who works five days a week in the construction industry in Dublin or Galway must pay &euro;200 on the family home where his wife and children live.  I see some people are nodding their heads but on my reading of the legislation if one is the owner of the property one is subject to this charge, unless one resides in that property.  If there is co-ownership the charge is divided equally between the two co-owners.  I refer to an owner living away from home and it is not his or her main residence.  If he or she is working in Phibsboro, Cabra or wherever and renting a property five or six days a week while his home lays empty, he or she is subject to that charge.  If that is not the case I would welcome that but I suspect it is the case.</P>
        <P>I also have a problem with the family home issue.  There is a deep attachment in rural Ireland to the family home.  It is the house where the siblings were born.  The mother and father have passed away and the family home is left usually to all the children.  The home is not occupied or used but there is an attachment to it on the part of the family members.  One can see them throughout rural Ireland.  They are kept in good order but no one no longer resides in them.  I am concerned that the family home would be subject to this charge as well.  We need to examine the provision of an exemption to ensure that family homes, if they are not used as a holiday home or for rental purposes, are not levied with this charge.  We all know the small houses in rural Ireland.  They have electricity connected to them.  Nobody lives in them but the sons and <Col N="506"/>daughters paint the houses and keep them in good order because they have an emotional attachment to them.  If they are levied &euro;200 per year over the next 20 years, those family members will have to make a choice and I do not want to see them knock down these houses because they are part of the fabric of rural Ireland.  There must be some provision we can put into the legislation to ensure that anomaly is dealt with.</P>
        <P>The other issue concerns elderly persons living on their own who move to a nursing home as a result of a long-term illness and their houses are then subject to this levy.  We must consider bringing forward an amendment to deal with that issue because if the owner of the house is in a nursing home on a permanent basis he or she is subject to this levy.</P>
        <P>I commend the Minister on bringing forward his own amendment on the carbons issue.</P>
        <P>I will seek to bring forward another amendment, and I am glad the Minister mentioned it in his contribution because it is a missed opportunity.  I believe that local authorities should set this rate.  It is within the Minister&rsquo;s gift and it is proper that initially the Government sets the rate at &euro;200, but we should give local authorities the power to decide the rate from now on, and we should do that now.  There should not be a need to come back, as the Minister announced, to re-examine this issue.  We allow local authorities decide the rates for small and medium enterprises, corner shops, barbers, restaurants and multinational companies, and we should trust them enough to allow them to set the rate, whether it is increases or decreases, on holiday homes, second homes and rental properties.  If that power was given to them it would be welcomed by local authorities throughout the State.  I hope to hear from the Minister that he is disposed to that idea, although perhaps not now.  Is there something we can write into the legislation that would allow the Minister to do that by way of ministerial order?  There should be a stronger commitment to doing that.</P>
        <P>I welcome the legislation, which will help struggling local authorities.  There will be many challenges in terms of collecting the rates.  It will be easier to collect from the rental sector but challenges will be faced in terms of the holiday home and the vacant house sector, and we will need to keep a close eye on that.  I am also concerned about the cost of collecting the charges.  A review mechanism should be built into the legislation to ensure that local authorities do not spend 25% of the income from charges on administration.  Best practice should be shared among local authorities.  Collection methods will vary because the types of dwellings will vary in different areas.</P>
        <P>I thank the Minister for the legislation.  I will bring forward amendments on Committee Stage.</P>

	<P>Any move to increase the local government funding base is to be welcomed.  We await the report of the Commission on Taxation as to how this might be done on a more long-term basis.  This is a modest charge but it will help make the local government funding base more diffuse and diverse.  It also gives it a property element, which the Irish taxation system has lacked.</P>
        <P>May I cite the example of our nearest jurisdiction?  My wife and daughter are engaged in further education in Coventry, where they live in rented accommodation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>Did the Senator send them there?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not send them to Coventry, although I have been sent there by them on several occasions.</P>
        <P>They have received a council tax demand from the local authority.  They are resident but they do not own a property, are not UK nationals and do not have independent income. <Col N="507"/> Nevertheless, the council tax demand is &pound;1,300 each for local government services.  When one compares and contrasts the local government funding systems in the two neighbouring jurisdictions, one sees that local government in Ireland has been a poor relation, both in funding and compared to other local government systems.  On that basis, there should be a more generous welcome for this legislation and fewer demands for the types of qualifications which have been mentioned on certain radio programmes and by Members during the debate to date.</P>
        <P>To own one property in Ireland requires a level of wealth, to own two requires a level of wealth to which many in this country cannot aspire.  In his opening contribution, the Minister stated that 70% of Irish residences are primary domestic residences.  Much of the remaining 30% consists of rental properties which are designed to earn an income for their owners.  The number of people who own a second house and use it for a purpose other than income or as a primary domestic residence is small.</P>
        <P>I do not accept the qualifications cited regarding people whose work takes them elsewhere and whose families could almost be said to live in two jurisdictions.  There is other legislation on joint ownership of the family home and this is adequately covered by the exemptions to couples in divorce and separation agreements, which the Minister mentioned in his opening contribution.  This has been thought through.  Second Stage debate is an opportunity to seek clarification and to consider suitable amendments.  The Minister is in the process of introducing an amendment on mobile homes, which are a different type of second residence.  They can be moved and are smaller than other second homes.  Even in accepting those arguments, other questions have been unleashed regarding other more fixed holiday-type home arrangements for which special exemptions are already being sought.  I am thinking of chalets and the like.  Lines must be drawn.  A fixed building which is a secondary residence should be covered by the legislation.  The charge is set at a very modest level.</P>
        <P>The Minister also referred to local government reform and the imminent publication of a White Paper when the Government has considered the report of the Commission on Taxation.  There has been speculation about what the commission might recommend regarding wider local government finance.  I would not like to see a return to the old system of imposing rates on domestic residences and built property.  Rates were a negative tax because they discouraged local economic activity.  Householders who improved their homes, putting money into a local economy by employing local people, were penalised for doing so by being given a higher rateable valuation and having to pay more to the local authority.  The essence of local government reform lies in site value taxation, which is more constant than property prices.  We know how inconstant property prices have been in the past 20 years.  When the report of the Commission on Taxation is published, there should be a debate on this issue.  To return to what did not work in the past would not be in the interest of the country or of local government.</P>
        <P>The Minister also welcomed the bringing forward by one year of the direct election of a mayor of Dublin.  This will be one of the most significant reforms in the history of local government.  I would like to see this measure followed by the extension of the concept to other metropolitan areas such as Cork, Limerick and Waterford, perhaps in time for the next local elections.  As and when the election of the mayor of Dublin is seen to be a success I hope that will happen.  To encourage the direct election of mayors to large metropolitan centres and to the dozen or so large towns which have a population of more than 7,500, we should hold local referendums to ask the people in those areas if they want a directly elected mayor or to achieve town council status.  These are the ideas which we should discuss when the White Paper on local government is published.</P>
        <P>The Minister also detailed the effects of changes in Government spending on local government.  Like many Members, I am not aware of the content of the report of an bord snip nua <Col N="508"/>or how it will impact on local government.  It is clear that while excellent public services are delivered through our local authorities, the need to examine where money is being used applies as much to local authorities as to any Department or State agency.  The straitened circumstances in which the country finds itself afford an opportunity to reform local government in more ways than one.  We can consider new structures, new powers for elected members and new offices, such as the elected mayor of Dublin.  We must examine how local government services can be introduced most efficiently and local government&rsquo;s ability to do so through independent and separate funding, such as that contained in the Bill.  That is why we should welcome the Bill.  I fully endorse its being put to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister.  I am glad to hear his commitment to holding mayoral elections in Dublin next year, a year ahead of schedule.  I look forward to elections in other city and town councils and the introduction of new town councils and urban district councils as soon as possible.</P>
        <P>If the proposed charge is a new source of local government funding and not merely a replacement of existing Government funding it may be a step forward.  I am glad the Government no longer proposes to apply the charge to mobile homes &mdash; the Labour Party had tabled an amendment to that effect.  Having spent many holidays in mobile homes, I see this as a sign that the Government appreciates that mobile homes are not owned by the rich but by ordinary people who cannot afford an expensive second home.  Mobile homes fill a gap in the market and it would not be right to include them in the legislation.  I am glad the Government will not impose the charge on them.</P>
        <P>I am concerned that self-catering homes are included.  I have received much correspondence from people involved in the self-catering holiday industry, who are very concerned by this charge.  The chairperson of the Irish Self-Catering Federation, Ms Helen Cousins, says that exempting registered and listed self-catering homes would cost the Government less than &euro;2 million per annum.  That is a very small amount compared to the estimated income from the tourism industry.  The self-catering sector is worth almost &euro;1 billion to the Irish economy.  In addition, a constituent of mine from Laytown has pointed out that if registered and listed self-catering homes are not exempt, the local authority charge might mean that many self-catering operators will not be able to continue in business.  Driving anybody out of business is a retrograde step.  I urge the Minister to re-examine the issue of taxing self-catering properties.  The Oireachtas Library and Research Service offers the information that one company has 750 self-catering properties in Ireland.  This company alone will face an annual charge of &euro;150,000 with the introduction of this levy.  It will undoubtedly have a significant impact and could lead to a reduction in employment.</P>
        <P>I agree with Senator Pearse Doherty&rsquo;s comments about rural homes and family homes in the countryside which have been kept, perhaps vacant, for many years.  If elderly parents or grandparents die, people might not wish to sell these houses.  They might not fetch a great deal on the open market anyway but they have a value in terms of the links people have to their family home.  We should try to find a way to ensure these homes are not subject to this tax.</P>
        <P>The &euro;200 charge will be applied equally to all properties, regardless of their value.  It is similar to a poll tax.  Senator Dan Boyle mentioned that his relations in the UK are paying approximately &euro;1,600 per annum in charges, but the charges in the UK vary according to the size and value of the property.  I am not sure it is fair that somebody who owns a cottage in Annagassan or Clogher Head in County Louth, for example, should pay &euro;200 while somebody who owns a second home worth &euro;8 million or &euro;10 million in Dalkey or Glenageary pays the same amount.  There are equity issues here.  Should there not be some sliding scale?</P><Col N="509"/>
        <P>Payment of the levy can be made over the Internet or in local authority offices.  Can Fingal County Council offices accept payment for a property in County Donegal or must somebody who does not wish to pay on-line go to the office in Donegal?  Can they make the payment by post?  Clarification about the payment mechanism would be helpful.  I also have questions about tax issues in respect of the levy.  Will the Minister confirm if businesses that operate self-catering homes or a rental scheme be able to get tax back when they pay the levy?  Will they be able to claim this charge against their operating costs?</P>
        <P>The Government is expecting to use the electoral register to help administer the levy.  Everybody is aware of the problems this might cause.  The electoral register in many counties leaves much to be desired.  This will be compounded by the fact that additional work will be generated in local authorities.  There is a recruitment ban in many local authorities so I am concerned about the impact this additional charge will have in terms of the administrative burden.</P>
        <P>Research which we have seen suggests a significant amount of money will be raised by the charge.  There are potentially 500,000 properties that will be subject to the charge.  In Meath, it is estimated there will be an increase of &euro;2 million in revenue and in Louth the increase is also estimated to be &euro;2 million.  How will that money be spent?  It is important that this should be seen as additional revenue.  It should not mean the Government will reduce payments to local authorities equivalent to what the authorities will gain from this tax.  The revenue should be hypothecated towards, for example, the roads fund, which has been cut back in many councils and has suffered due to lack of funding.  Sums of the &euro;2 million to &euro;3 million per annum would significantly assist the condition of local roads.  What advice and guidance will the Minister give to local authorities regarding how this money should be spent?  Will it just be put into a general operating costs pot or will it be hypothecated towards specific expenditure items?</P>
        <P>The main issue is that we ensure the revenue generated as a result of this Bill will be seen as new revenue for local authorities, not as an excuse to cut back central funds provided by the Government to the authorities.  The Labour Party will table amendments to the Bill.  We are glad the Minister accepted our amendment relating to the charge on mobile homes but we will table a further amendment to provide that married couples who have separated or entered into an agreement to separate will also be exempt from the charge.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to this discussion on the Local Government (Charges) Bill.  Members have offered their views on the legislation and the generic view appears to be that everybody welcomes the Bill.  It is an important Bill, particularly for local authorities that have large numbers of second homes.  A table provided by the Oireachtas Library and Research Service indicates where the largest numbers of second homes are located.  Obviously, Dublin has the largest number while Donegal is third on the list, with between 22,500 and 23,000 second homes.  They would yield, as Senator Pearse Doherty mentioned, over &euro;4.5 million.  That is a substantial amount of money coming into the revenue base of a local authority.</P>
        <P>This is the first property tax, if one can call it that, to be imposed in Ireland since 1978, when local authority rates were abolished.  I generally welcome the legislation.  When I was a member of the local authority in Donegal in 2004 and 2005 I sought the introduction of a charge on holiday homes.  It was one of the recommendations in the Indecon report on local government financing.  I was delighted the Government reacted to that report in the budget last October with its announcement of the &euro;200 levy on second homes.</P><Col N="510"/>
        <P>To clarify the figures being used, it appears the Department&rsquo;s estimate of &euro;40 million income from the levy is based on figures from the Private Residential Tenancies Board.  It does not take account of the census 2006 figures.  Data compiled by the Oireachtas Library and Research Service suggest there are 487,000 properties eligible for payment under the Bill, which would generate substantially more than &euro;40 million.  It could be double that amount.  Perhaps we will be given clarification of the figures.</P>
        <P>There has been discussion of exemptions under the legislation.  I wholeheartedly support the exemption for mobile homes proposed by the Minister.  While I have not said anything publicly to date on the matter, in recent days I have been in consultation with mobile home site owners and the owners of mobile homes.  In Donegal, families own mobile home sites and rent them to individuals who own mobile homes.  It was unclear whether the mobile home owner or the site owner would pay the &euro;200.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>I received information from mobile home owners concerning the value of a mobile home.  Depending on the standard, it costs &euro;30,000 to &euro;40,000 to buy a mobile home whereas a holiday home will cost perhaps ten times that amount.  There can be no comparison between paying &euro;200 for a mobile home and paying the same for a holiday home.  The depreciation of a mobile home is even more rapid than that of a car, and regarding holiday homes in general, the price of property tends to increase rather than fall.  I am glad the Minister is bringing forward the exemption.  I know it will be welcomed across the board.</P>
        <P>I wish to refer to the other exemptions.  I agree with other speakers regarding the self-catering sector.  Those involved tend to pay a registration fee of approximately &euro;200 for their property to F&aacute;ilte Ireland and are now being asked to pay an additional &euro;200 per year.  Some of the self-catering businesses act as businesses, filing their returns to the Revenue Commissioners and these also pay commercial rates for their properties.  When a self-catering operation pays commercial rates perhaps there should be a mechanism whereby it does not have to pay this fee which is, effectively, a double charge.</P>
        <P>The Minister referred to situations in which an exemption can be made for certain heritage properties.  I am not sure what is the definition of a heritage property.  A number of individuals have been in touch with me who have what they describe as heritage properties, namely, properties with thatched roofs.  Perhaps nobody lives in the properties but the cost of their upkeep is quite substantial.  I ask the Minister to consider whether properties of this nature might be included under the category of heritage properties so they could be deemed exempt.  I am sure there are only some dozens of such properties around the country.  The postcard picture of Ireland in the United States always depicted as the thatched cottage and we should not attack it by imposing this charge.  I spoke to two such property owners in County Donegal today who said that if the charge were imposed they would probably knock down the property which, in any case, is almost valueless.  The only value is in the thatched roof and there is a grant available from the Department towards that.  We should be careful not to attack that very important piece of heritage and should protect it.</P>
        <P>Another issue to which I wish to refer is that of collection and administration of this charge.  According to the legislation, this will be a matter for the local authorities and the Bill emphasises that collection and enforcement will come from the local authorities.  I welcome that because it is probably more beneficial to have the collection locally.  We must ensure there is liaison between the Department and the local authorities so that there is a collaborative response in terms of whether additional resources are required..  Perhaps the additional <Col N="511"/>resources may come from the actual revenue stream but this should be teased out with the Department.</P>
        <P>I do not agree with using the electoral register as a basis for collecting moneys or gaining access to information on properties until such time as the electoral register is linked to the PPS numbers.  At such a time it can be guaranteed.</P>
        <P>I come from a Border county where there is an issue regarding the collection of moneys from individuals resident in the North of Ireland who have holiday homes in Border counties.  How will we ensure there is a legislative footing to collect those moneys?  It is important this should happen because if we do not have such a legislative mechanism, there will be a kick-back from people who live in this State.  I am sure this was thought out prior to the drafting of the legislation.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House and am glad of the opportunity to speak about this Bill.  Some questions have been raised regarding the electoral register used for the recent elections.  The situation was a disgrace.  A number of years ago when he was Minister, Deputy Dick Roche, spent a considerable sum of money nationally on compiling and updating the register but it has fallen back again.  There is an opportunity here for local authorities to integrate this into a revenue-collecting mechanism and use it as a way of upgrading the local electoral register.</P>
        <P>A number of issues were raised concerning the status of people who may live two or three days a week at home and three or four away in Dublin, Cork, Galway, or wherever.  The Minister has not been clear and specific on this point in the Bill.  He should spell it out.</P>
        <P>What will be the position of derelict houses?  There are a considerable number of these without sanitary facilities or electricity.  Nobody lives in them but they are houses and are part and parcel of the fabric of rural Ireland.  Before Committee Stage, I wish to know the position in respect of such houses.  In many cases, they are and can be used as a tool to get planning permission for a house in a rural area.  Nobody will demolish them overnight but we would like to know the situation.  Severe fines are being put in place for the non-payment of the annual &euro;200 and it is very important the Minister should spell out this matter.</P>
        <P>Some counties will benefit enormously from the collection of these revenues and more will not.  What will be the position regarding those counties that will not benefit so greatly?  My own county, Mayo, will benefit by perhaps &euro;4 or &euro;4.5 million.  Does this mean that the rate support grant as we know it, which has diminished over recent years, will decrease further to allow for the moneys collected by this charge?  The Minister should tell the House.  From my reading of the Bill and from the language used by the Minister, it would seem that will be the case because otherwise those counties that will not benefit will be at a disadvantage.</P>
        <P>I am surprised about the mechanisms to be put in place for the collection of the charges..  Every local authority has revenue collectors who know their local areas.  In some cases they collect water and refuse charges and commercial rates.  There are local authorities that collect planning fees and enforce road closings.  In many cases, the revenue collectors collect all these charges and the councils have all the data regarding planning permissions granted and those refused.  Builders must issue commencement notices to local authorities when they start buildings and the local authorities have all the relevant information.  I am amazed a local authority which has revenue collectors in local areas cannot provide a mechanism for collecting this money.</P><Col N="512"/>
        <P>The Minister alluded to the directly elected mayor.  It seems that in a very short space of time we will have a directly elected mayor for the greater Dublin region.  There is now a newly elected lord mayor of Dublin and I am sure that mayor will stay in place for the next five years.  However, judging by what the Minister said in the House today, the new directly elected mayor for the greater Dublin region will be a glorified mayor of the Dublin regional authority.  We need further legislation on this matter as soon as possible.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank my colleague for sharing time.  I welcome the opportunity to comment on the Bill.  The legislation is like a little trip switch because it allows us, if the Cathaoirleach will excuse the pun, to shed light on the broader local government debate and the issues facing local government.</P>
        <P>In 1999, a constitutional amendment was passed to provide constitutional recognition of local government.  It seemed like a major step forward at the time, but lip service has been paid to local government since.  That has been the case for the past 30 years or so since the 1977 political decision to remove rates from domestic properties.  In a sense, all political parties have failed to bell the cat in terms of local government reform and funding.</P>
        <P>The Bill is viewed as a positive step.  According to the Minister, it will broaden local authorities&rsquo; revenue base.  He stated: &ldquo;This is the first time in more than 30 years that a new source of local funding has been made available to local authorities.&rdquo;  As I told the Minister, this is probably incorrect as a decision was made four or five years ago whereby development charges on individual house constructions in rural and urban areas would be directly paid to local government.  It was the first significant source of funding.  Unfortunately, as soon as this type of funding was introduced, the Government cut back significantly on the grant for local authorities.  It robbed Peter to pay Paul.  If we are all fair &mdash; as Senators, we have close contact with local government &mdash; we must recognise the reality that new sources of funding are urgently required to provide for the future development and expansion of local government.</P>
        <P>A fee of &euro;200 per house cannot be sensibly opposed, but the question is for how long will the fee be at that level as all sorts of hard cases and exemptions will be sought.  In principle, a tiny property tax is being introduced via the back door.  The broader debate that is required on the issue of property tax might stem from the Commission on Taxation&rsquo;s report.  I welcome the fee in so far as it will give some funding to local government and as long as we are guaranteed that it will be additional funding and that this direct injection of &euro;40 million or &euro;50 million will not be met by a reduction in the Government grant.</P>
        <P>In the short time available to me, I express my interest in the Minister&rsquo;s statement regarding a directly elected mayor for Dublin.  He seems to view the project as his personal input into the direction that local government will take.  Where directly elected mayors are concerned, there are pluses and minuses.  That the mayor of any town or city would have the appropriate powers and funding is of most importance.  We must wait to see what the Minister will do in respect of the powers of Dublin&rsquo;s directly elected mayor before casting our final judgment.  Where Dublin will lead, the other cities and larger counties will be expected to follow.</P>
        <P>If we want real local government, it will need new powers, including the power to raise revenue and set local taxes.  This is a difficult debate, but it must be tackled.  The Bill opens a small door for us in that regard.  I look forward to Committee Stage as a few issues must be teased out.  In so far as the Bill gives local authorities some income discretion, it is welcome.  From the largest county to the smallest town, every local authority is in grave financial crisis.  They need new sources of financial input and the Bill may provide one.  Some weeks ago, hotel bed taxes were mentioned in the Chamber.  These seem to be the norm in a number of European countries.  All this will serve to provide a broad agenda for future discussion.  I have no <Col N="513"/>fundamental issue with the Bill, but we will ask questions on Committee Stage and later regarding the funding of local government.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy &Aacute;ine Brady, to the House and congratulate her on her exemplary ministerial work to date.  I wish her continued success.</P>
        <P>I will not welcome any Bill that imposes a tax, but it is a necessary evil at this time and is inventive in terms of taxation.  It is basically a voluntary declaration, which is always risky, given that people are not known to indicate voluntarily that they are liable for a charge.  The fee is &euro;200, but some people will be caught for &euro;600 per year.  It is important that people are aware that if they do not pay the initial charge, they will be liable for the charges on an ongoing basis.</P>
        <P>The Bill does not provide for freezing of the charge.  Section 14 will allow the Minister to propose an increase in the House.  I welcome my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Finneran, to the House and wish him continued success in the Department.  I am glad he is present for the debate on this section because I would like to discuss a few matters that relate to his portfolio.  I request that the charges be held at a particular rate for as long as possible.  We do not want to impose more charges and costs on the public.</P>
        <P>On the renting of properties &mdash; this is the responsibility of the Minister of State, Deputy Finneran &mdash; under the Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) Regulations,  local councils make greater demands of people who have registered as owning rental properties, although not everyone has registered, than they do of the Minister and the councils themselves.  I know of a property that is in excellent condition, but Roscommon County Council has decided that the landlord must cut the grass.  I do not know whether the Minister is liable for cutting the grass of the Department or local councils are liable for cutting the grass of rented council houses.  I do not think they are.  It is a nanny state that would impose such a requirement.  It is pathetic, to say the least, and it contravenes a certain article, although I do not know which one.</P>
        <P>The landlords who have declared their properties and registered under the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 have had their houses inspected.  Senator Coffey referred to the money being held by the Private Residential Tenancies Board.  Seemingly, councils have many members of staff who have nothing to do other than examine those properties, which is fine, but councils are imposing requirements on the landlords of properties that are of better quality than the properties being rented out by those same councils, yet they do not impose those requirements on themselves.  They should get their house in order before making others liable.  Surely a tenant should be liable to cut the grass around his or her house.  It is a small point, but I wanted to make it.</P>
        <P>There should be a &ldquo;sale of the century&rdquo; of local authority houses.  Such a scheme was introduced in the 1980s, which was very attractive.  The council should dispose of as many properties as possible under the best possible deal and in that way responsibility for maintenance of houses would lie with the owners rather than the councils.  As the Minister of State and I know from our experience on Roscommon County Council, house maintenance was always a problem and it was very difficult to find the staff to do so.  I suggest that such a scheme be introduced.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister of State to influence the Minister, Deputy Gormley, regarding councillors&rsquo; attendance at seminars and conferences, as referred to by Senator Glynn.  Through the Minister of State and his officials, I appeal to the Minister in this regard.  The allowance given by various councils has been reduced due to cutbacks.  It allows councillors to attend seminars of great importance.  As a former councillor of 22 years, I learned more from going to conferences than I did at any council meeting.  I had the opportunity to meet other councillors and to learn of what was occurring in their local authority areas.  The Minister&rsquo;s proposal to review this allow<Col N="514"/>ance is small and petty in the context of the hard working, committed and dedicated people who devote their time and energy to the betterment of their electoral areas.</P>
        <P>I will circulate to my council voters information on the best selection of conferences and seminars &mdash; I am dealing with those for July 2009 at present.  The list includes the seminar on the management, protection and development of public lands and buildings, which is a very useful seminar, the inaugural Percy French summer school, which will be held in Castlecoote in Roscommon and which, I am sure, the Minister will attend, is also a very useful exercise.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I have just one other point.  A seminar on planning and building energy regulations will be held.  All these seminars, including one on the economy, what went wrong and how to fix it, are very useful.  I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Finneran, to use his influence with the Minister, Deputy Gormley, in respect of this matter.</P>
        <P>It would be counter-productive and would affect the education of councillors, especially those who were only recently elected for the first time, if they were prevented from attending educational and other seminars.  These seminars can be extremely beneficial, from both a tourism and economic point of view, to the areas in which they are held, particularly if they are not normally hosted in such areas.</P>
        <P>I am glad the Minister of State, Deputy Finneran, who is a very practical man, is present.  In light of his great experience of local authorities and the fact that he previously served as president of the Local Authority Members Association, he is in a strong position to encourage the Minister to leave responsibility for making decisions regarding seminars and the charges relating thereto with local authority members and their executive bodies.  I would be satisfied with such an approach.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State.  I listened with interest to the contribution of the Minister, Deputy Gormley, and I note he intends the charge to relate not just to rental and holiday homes but also to vacant properties.  That is a good development because it will provide an incentive for the charge to be passed on.</P>
        <P>It is critical the Minister should make clear that the most important exemption relates to principal private residences and that this is not a full-scale property tax.  Such a tax appears to be on the Government&rsquo;s agenda and if that is the case, so be it.  However, the Minister should beware of recreating the old-style rating system which employed a measurement system involving square or cubic footage.  I must declare an interest in respect of this matter.  People such as I who renovated slum properties in the inner city because of their heritage value would be taxed out of existence were such a system to come into place.  A number of members of the North Great George&rsquo;s Street Preservation Society have already stated that if such a system were introduced, it would sound the death knell in respect of everything the society has done.  If the Government is contemplating the introduction of a residential property tax in respect of people&rsquo;s homes, it should be aware it may have a negative impact such as that which I have outlined.</P>
        <P>Those who drafted the Bill were careful to take cognisance of the situation of people who, because they are moving house, may for a short period possess two residential homes.  Such <Col N="515"/>people will be exempted, which is perfectly appropriate.  I also welcome the position with regard to people in the aftermath of a divorce.  It is interesting that the Minister has yielded to the lobby in respect of mobile homes.  This move may well be appropriate.</P>
        <P>I commend Senator Boyle on making clear his respect for the House.  Although the Senator was invited to appear on a very popular and important radio programme yesterday, he did not do so because he is of the view that the House is the correct forum in which to discuss this issue.  I have no doubt the Senator put forward an effective case in respect of the legislation during his contribution.</P>
        <P>That Minister indicated that, having been advised of the difficulty in respect of mobile homes, he is preparing an amendment.  That amendment has not yet been presented to the House.  We will all examine it with interest when it emerges.  I heard a number of people state on radio that while they possess what are classified as mobile homes, these type of homes are quite static, have steps built up to their entryways, are connected to sewerage and water systems, etc.  Therefore, questions arise in this regard.</P>
        <P>Had a decision been made to tax mobile homes, it would have been intriguing to discover whether the Traveller community would have come within the remit of the legislation.  There is a case to be put to the effect that some very wealthy Travellers might very well be able to afford to pay such a tax.  I say this as a great admirer of the Traveller community.  I just received a copy of a wonderful magazine, <i>Voice of the Traveller</i>, and I wish to state that all Travellers can be very proud of the contribution their community has made.</P>
        <P>I welcome that the Minister has reconsidered the position with regard to mobile homes.  I received representations from a person who is a graduate in the area of tourism and economics who informed me he bought a second-hand mobile home in a beautiful seaside area of County Wicklow.  He did so because he wanted his children to be able to live in a safe and healthy environment while on their holidays and also, rather patriotically, because he wanted the family to holiday at home in Ireland.  Such behaviour has important environmental and economic aspects because families who take this route do not travel abroad, their carbon footprints are subsequently reduced and they contribute to the local economy by purchasing mobile homes, a large number of which are manufactured in this country.  In addition, families who holiday here in their mobile homes contribute to local economies by frequenting shops, accessing services etc.  The individual to whom I spoke made an interesting calculation to the effect that tens of millions of euro have been gained as a result of the purchase of mobile homes.  If a disincentive is introduced to the equation, such gains would be lost.</P>

However, I am concerned with regard to the tourism business.  I have experience of the latter because my father built Red Island holiday camp in 1947.  What was interesting about it was that the 500 guests who stayed there each week travelled over from England.  Irish people only took holidays in two places in 1947, namely, they stayed with their relatives on farms in the countryside or they stayed in what were called holiday homes.  The latter were usually wooden structures located on or adjacent to the beach.  Such holiday homes were extremely popular and common and it was difficult to regard them as second residences.  In the interim, extremely substantial holiday homes have been constructed.  We are not, therefore, referring to the type of structures that existed in 1947.</P>
        <P>As already stated, however, a concern exists with regard to the tourism business.  In light of the fact that Irish people who possess second holiday homes might be placed at a disadvantaged and almost encouraged to go elsewhere as a result of the imposition of the charge, we must ensure a balance is maintained.  The criterion for applying a charge in respect of these homes is that they appear to be fixed to the ground.  Senator Norris stated that the amendment has not yet been published.  However, I have a copy of it and it refers to &ldquo;part of a building&rdquo; and &ldquo;a structure or erection of any kind and of any materials, or any part of that structure or erection ... but does not include a vehicle or mobile home&rdquo;.  Will the Minister of State indicate what is meant by the term &ldquo;mobile home&rdquo;?  If it refers to something that is capable of being moved or attached to a vehicle, that is fine.  If a mobile home is fixed to the ground, will its owner be liable for this particular tax?</P>
        <P>There is a need to broaden the tax base.  The Commission on Taxation is due to report at the end of July and is widely expected to recommend the introduction of some form of property tax on principal residences.  Will the tax we are discussing at present raise anywhere in the region of the &euro;40 million to which reference has been made?  Perhaps the Minister of State will indicate from where that figure originates.  Reference has been made to some 200,000 holiday homes but I understand this figure may also include mobile homes.</P>
        <P>Like Senator Norris and others, I have been approached by people who are extremely concerned with regard to the reference to mobile homes.  Will the tax be applied in respect of mobile homes which have become fixed to the ground?  If the answer is in the affirmative, will this represent a temptation for people to unfix such homes from the ground to ensure they avoid the tax?</P>
        <P>I welcome what the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is trying to achieve.  However, I must sound a note of caution with regard to the effect this might have on the tourism industry in this country, especially in the context of people wishing to holiday at home.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State.  It is important to provide additional funding for local authorities.  They are somewhat cash-strapped and that is why I welcome this aspect of the Bill.  Nobody welcomes a new tax of any sort.  A friend, Michael Pat Murphy Jr., who died rather untimely, advocated as a young Independent councillor the imposition of a levy or tax on second or holiday homes.  In my area, south-west Cork, there are many such homes.  His point was that it would generate extra revenue for the local authority.  If this tax had been imposed during the past ten or 12 years of boom when there was unprecedented wealth in the country the pain would be much less acute because money was flowing freely and so on.  The sum of &euro;200 seems small but I have no doubt that over the next few years it will be increased.</P>
        <P>I am glad to note the exemptions.  In nearly every village and town there are scores or even hundreds of unoccupied houses in housing estates but the houses that cannot be sold are exempt.  I hope that in their interpretation of what is a habitable dwelling the local authority or agencies concerned will take a practical or pragmatic view and deem a house in disrepair to be uninhabitable.  I do not want to see the old situation that prevailed when I was a young lad in the 1960s and earlier whereby a person who had a second house would knock the chimney off the house to avoid rates because if there was no fireplace the rates were not imposed.  Some relatively good houses were turned into houses for pigs or cattle.  I hope the people in charge today will take a more pragmatic view.</P>
        <P>I hope that administrative costs do not outweigh the benefit of the tax imposed.  A sum of &euro;200 is small in this day and age for anybody who is fortunate enough to have a second home.  There is a fear that the next budget may include some form of property tax.  I do not want to see administrative difficulties.  I had an experience with the Private Residential Tenancies Board, PRTB, which made me think that the administrative difficulties nearly outweighed the cost of registering.  The board is a good system.  Not so long ago a daughter of mine was in college and her landlord had several properties in a city that I will not name and insisted that she pay the rent in cash.  I objected to this.  The conditions in the flat were atrocious.  I would like to see better quality rental properties in Dublin, Cork or Galway, that provide basic facilities.  There should not be wallpaper falling off the walls because of the damp and lack of heating and atrocious sanitary facilities.  The time has come when anybody who has any kind of property should be registered.  Does the Minister of State know if any survey has been done to establish how many student or rental properties around the State are registered?  Probably up to 40% are not registered with the PRTB.</P>
        <P>I did not intend to contribute but wanted to mention those few points.  I welcome the Minister of State and congratulate him on the work he is doing.  I hope this levy will be of benefit to the local authorities because they badly need a few extra euro in their kitties.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senators for their constructive and thoughtful contributions to the Bill.  Rather than attempt to respond to each point on Second Stage I can do this in response to Senators&rsquo; amendments on Committee Stage.  I will respond, however, to a few points.  Senator Leyden spoke about the sale of local authority properties.  Later this afternoon I will be leading Report and Final Stages of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2008 in this House.  I initiated the legislation here and it has been through the D&aacute;il.  There have been several attempts over the past 20 or 25 years to introduce a scheme for the sale of local authority flats and apartments.  That will be introduced when this Bill is passed this afternoon.  It gives people an opportunity to buy the flats or apartments they occupy or those they will occupy.</P><Col N="518"/>
        <P>That Bill also includes a new provision called the incremental purchase scheme.  For the first time people will be able to buy a council house on the day they enter it.  I have always thought that instead of waiting three or five years to sell a council house to a tenant we should give that person the opportunity of becoming the owner on day one and give him or her responsibility for insurance and maintenance and so on.  That will be introduced as a pilot scheme straightaway.  The tenant purchase scheme administered through the local authority systems will continue.</P>
        <P>Senator Norris spoke about heritage houses.  There is an exemption in the legislation for those who are deemed exempt under the relevant legislation.  He also spoke about mobile homes.  There will be an amendment dealing with them.  The Senator asked how this would affect the Travelling community.  That would not arise because the mobile home is a Traveller&rsquo;s primary residence.</P>
        <P>I take Senator Quinn&rsquo;s point about tourism which is a vital component of revenue.  The more people holiday at home and use the facilities we have here the less money leaves the country and more comes into the Exchequer.  He asked whether timber homes were different from mobile homes.  Those on fixed foundations will be deemed to be homes.  Anything that can be moved by crane or whatever will be deemed a mobile home.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Donovan asked what deems a house habitable.  Some of the greatest destruction in the 1950s and 1960s occurred when people removed not only chimneys but also roofs in order to avoid paying rates.  The roofs of some fine buildings were removed allowing rain to damage the structure.  I hope local authorities will take a practical view of this provision.</P>
        <P>With regard to private rental accommodation, earlier in the year I brought forward new regulations on standards for rented houses.  These apply to all private rental accommodation and most of them are now law.  Those not yet in place require structural work to be completed.  One part, which will take four years to implement, deals with my intention that bedsits in cities, particularly Dublin, will no longer be part of the housing structure.  I could not introduce their exclusion immediately because too much cost was involved.  I have provided for a four year lead-in period for people to carry out the important structural work involved.</P>
        <P>The Bill is relatively direct, and straight forward legislative measures will apply, broadly speaking, to the owners of non-principal private residences.  In my view, those of us fortunate enough to own a second property should not find the obligation to pay &euro;200 per year towards services provided by local authorities unduly burdensome.  The Bill is estimated to generate approximately &euro;40 million annually for the local government sector.  Its importance is not adequately reflected in the amount of revenue to which it will give rise, rather it represents a new genuinely local source of funding for local authorities and reduces their dependence on central Government.  This is a very important principle which we should welcome.</P>
        <P>It has been said that the ideal taxation measure is equitable, simple and flexible.  The Local Government (Charges) Bill scores well under the criteria of simplicity and flexibility.  It is simple and cost effective to administer and it will be simple to understand and comply with.  It will generate revenue on a continuing basis and will not be subject to the volatility we have come to associate with transactions based on property taxes.  In this sense, it has the flexibility to cope with the varying economic conditions while maintaining a stable yield.  It must be acknowledged that the Bill does not include a valuation-based component, something which would make the system far more complex and difficult to administer and comply with.  Against this, the amount of the charge is relatively modest at &euro;200.  At least it can hardly be described as inequitable given the amount of the charge involved.</P>
        <P>I look forward to a high compliance rate with the obligation to pay the charge.  This is in everybody&rsquo;s interest.  The point was made that it is simple common sense to pay it when it falls <Col N="519"/>due.  Evasion will incur significant late payment fees which will have to be paid at some point.  The longer the delay in paying the charge, the more expensive the late payment fees will become and the resale of the property is likely to prove exceptionally difficult if the charges and late payment fees are left outstanding.</P>
        <P>I thank Senators for their contributions to the debate.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Labour Party for tabling amendment No. 2 and Senator Pearse Doherty for tabling amendment No. 2<i>a</i>.  While I accept the principles behind amendments Nos. 2 and 2<i>a</i>, I am satisfied amendment No. 1 achieves the same purpose but in a more definitive manner.  Both amendments seek to exclude mobile homes from the scope of the new change to which the Bill generally gives effect.  Amendments Nos. 2 and 2<i>a</i> simply delete all references to mobile homes from the definition of building in section 1.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 1 goes marginally further in that it achieves all that amendment Nos. 2 and 2<i>a </i>do, but goes on to state that vehicles and mobile homes are specifically excluded from the definition of building.  To this extent, it is slightly more specific and definitive and is to be preferred for that reason.  There are arguments for and against levying the &euro;200 charge on mobile homes.</P>
        <P>Clearly, most mobile homes are used as a type of holiday home and constitute a second residence for that reason.  Some mobile homes are located in sought-after locations and command significant prices on the open market.  Such mobile homes can be more valuable than some holiday homes and are made of bricks and mortar.  Local authorities provide services including, in many cases, water and waste water facilities and road access to facilitate the use of mobile homes, just like all other second homes.</P>
        <P>I acknowledge there are arguments against bringing mobile homes within the remit of the charge.  The point was made to me when the Bill was published that usually mobile homes are less valuable than a standard holiday home.  Furthermore, many mobile homes are located in <Col N="520"/>caravan or camping parks where the owner of the mobile home does not own the land on which they are located.  There is also the fact that the owners of mobile homes normally pay an annual charge to the owner of the caravan or camping park in circumstances where commercial rates are levied on the park.  Arguably, the commercial rates are a contribution for the other services provided by the local authority and the owner of the mobile home should not be asked to pay twice for the same service.</P>
        <P>These are the arguments that were put to me when the Bill was published.  I have listened carefully to all these points and have decided, on balance, to exempt mobile homes from the charge.  In taking this decision, I was mindful of the fact that the revenue forgone by local authorities will be relatively small in the context of the overall revenue to which the charge will give rise.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>We support the Government amendment on mobile homes.  However, some questions and queries were raised on Second Stage regarding the definition of mobile home.  I presume a mobile home is a home that is mobile and is something with wheels on it, but in many cases mobile homes are installed in a semi-permanent manner on a foundation with access to services such as electricity, sewerage and water.  Can the Minister clarify that mobile homes installed in such a way will not be subject to this local government charge?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>This amendment provides certainty.  We examined all the definitions.  We examined the phrase &ldquo;de-mountable&rdquo; and other issues.  The Senator is quite right.  There are instances, which I referred to in my contribution, where there are so-called mobile homes where wheels, etc. have been removed.  We are examining situations where mobile homes are in caravan parks and it is quite clear they are there with other mobile homes.  Such parks are very often paying service charges.  We have been as clear as we possibly can on this matter.  The idea is that we give certainty.  We are saying clearly that mobile homes are excluded and that is at the heart of what Senator Doherty and the Labour Party proposed.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 4, to delete lines 20 to 24.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I will try to clarify our thinking on this.  We are trying to be helpful with regard to the administration of the scheme and how moneys can be collected without putting a further burden on local authorities.  Some Members suggested earlier they would prefer local authorities to collect the moneys.  I understand that view, but that is only possible where the local authorities have the necessary resources and IT systems and all that goes with that.  Unfortunately, as those of us with close connections with our local authorities realise, they are already overburdened by their workloads in this area and may not have the capacity to collect the moneys in the current circumstances.  I have not seen anything in the Bill that provides extra capacity or resources to deal with the administration and collection of moneys in this scheme.</P>
        <P>For that reason, Fine Gael has proposed these amendments.  We identify the Revenue Commissioners as the appropriate authority or body to collect moneys.  They already have the necessary capacity within their structures, both administrative IT support and otherwise, to <Col N="521"/>properly and fully encompass all those who should pay this charge once implemented by law.  That is the thinking behind our amendments.  We did not put them forward to undermine the Bill but to strengthen the capacity to collect the funds that should accrue to local authorities.  There is no ulterior motive behind them.  We are being up-front on the matter.</P>
        <P>Earlier, I outlined our concerns with regard to the Private Residential Tenancies Board&rsquo;s registration system.  We are concerned about the backlog, the fact the system has not been updated and the fact the IT system is not up and running.  I gather from reading the Bill that it is intended data and information will be shared between local authorities and bodies such as the PRTB.  However, the PRTB&rsquo;s systems are not up to date and do not have the capacity for this.  That is a further reason we suggest the Revenue Commissioners, who have the required infrastructure, are the appropriate authority to deal with the collection of these charges.  If it is proven down the road that local authorities have the capacity and systems to do it, that will be acceptable.  However, they do not have that capacity currently.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Coffey for his amendments and appreciate the sincerity of his motives.  I acknowledge a number of the points made by Senator Glynn on the collection of moneys.  He suggested town councils should be allowed to collect the moneys.  The local authorities have assured us they have the capacity to collect the moneys and that they will distribute those moneys to the town councils appropriately.  I am aware of the concerns expressed by Senator Coffey.  The issue concerns the body or organisation within the public service that is best suited to administer the &euro;200 charge.  I assume Fine Gael&rsquo;s opposition to sections 9 to 11, inclusive, and section 15 follows on from the thrust of the amendments generally, which is to substitute the Revenue Commissioners for local authorities in administering the collection of the charge.</P>
        <P>I fully accept that we must administer our public services as well as we can.  I also accept the Revenue Commission is a very efficient organisation that has made major strides in recent years in facilitating compliant taxpayers to discharge their liabilities with the minimum of fuss and red tape.  I have no doubt that had this function been assigned to the Revenue Commissioners, the organisation would have put in place effective management and arrangements to implement the charge.  Equally, I am in no doubt that local authorities will do a very efficient job in carrying the legislation into effect.</P>
        <P>The local authorities set up a project board after the 2009 budget to plan for the introduction of the charge.  The Local Government Computer Services Board was asked to design a website, similar in concept to the motor tax on-line website, to accept Internet payments.  This site will be up and running in time for the liability date of 31 July 2009.  Other arrangements continue to be put in place in local authorities to facilitate the smooth and effective implementation of the new charge.  I again encourage all concerned to use the website to discharge liabilities to pay the charge.  This is in everybody&rsquo;s interest, especially those obliged to pay it.  The website is efficient and user friendly and will make life easier and simpler for those who avail of it.  For those who cannot or will not use this facility, local authorities will accept payments at their local offices.</P>
        <P>There is also an inherent logic in paying the charge to local authorities given that these bodies will retain and deploy the revenue stream arising from it.  This is a crucial point.  Senators Coffey and Doherty said they would like to see the local authorities have more discretion on the matter because they are ideally suited to collecting the fee.  In my meetings with the managers, they stressed that they wanted to do this job.  As far as I am concerned, if they want to do it, they should be allowed do so.  This is a major step forward for local authorities towards securing a genuinely local source of revenue that will reduce their dependence on central government funding, which is the thrust of the Green Paper and forthcoming White Paper.</P><Col N="522"/>
        <P>I await with interest the report of the Commission on Taxation.  Part of its terms of reference require the commission to consider options for the future funding of local government.  I have every confidence the commission will do its work thoroughly.  It will be very interesting to see what conclusions and recommendations it reaches.  For now, the approach taken in the Bill that the proceeds of the charge will be collected and retained by local authorities makes sense for the reasons I have outlined.  I am not, therefore, disposed to accept the amendments under discussion.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn"><NameTxt>Senator Camillus Glynn</NameTxt>
	<P>I am disappointed it has not been possible to accede to my request, but I suppose one does not get everything one wants.  What guarantees are there in the Bill to ensure the moneys due to town councils will be passed on?  Is there an appropriate statutory basis for this?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>Section 15 will deal with this.  It states clearly a county council shall make a payment each year to each town council within the county and such payment shall be calculated having regard to various matters.  I do not want to go through the entire Bill but it is clear.  Also, in discussions with the managers we made it clear we want to see the moneys distributed proportionately and fairly.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn"><NameTxt>Senator Camillus Glynn</NameTxt>
	<P>The reason I ask is that there seems to be an intention on the part of certain local authorities to take to themselves powers that would normally be devolved under law to the town councils.  I am a strong defender of town councils, even though I come from a country area.  However, I live in a town and see how effective town local government is.  I exhort the Minister to use every opportunity he has to devolve more powers to town councils, not alone the rating authorities but also some of the former town commissions in sizeable towns such as Mullingar, Portlaoise, Greystones and Newbridge.  These are large urban areas and should get what they are entitled to under the Act.  If there is a statutory entitlement to the moneys, as suggested in section 15, there should be a statutory obligation on the county council to devolve the relevant portion of the charges normally due to it to the town councils within its administrative area.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Senator Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not support Senator Coffey&rsquo;s amendments, although I know he addresses the same issues I raised in terms of the ability of the local authorities in their current configuration to collect this charge.  On Second Stage, I made the point that local authorities may find it difficult to collect this charge bearing in mind it will be much easier to collect it for rental properties than for holiday homes, particularly if the owners are outside the jurisdiction.</P>
        <P>If there is a need for employment of additional personnel, will this be granted by the Department or is there a mechanism in place given the embargo on public sector employment?  I gave the figure of 8,000 holiday homes in Donegal.  I am sure there will be a problem in terms of collection and the local authority may need to employ additional staff to do this.  While it is not specified in the Bill, is the Minister disposed to this suggestion?  It would alleviate some of my concerns.</P>
        <P>The Minister referred to central administration and the website, which is a great idea, but it runs counter to what I want to see, namely, that local authorities would be able to raise their own funding.  A standard flat rate is very easy to administer centrally and people should use the website to make their payment.  The legislation allows for the reimbursement of town councils, which Senator Glynn raised, but there is also the issue of the expenses accrued by <Col N="523"/>local authorities in the collection of the charge.  In terms of the central administration of the website, how will the expenses incurred in collecting that money&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>It is referred to in the legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Senator Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>Perhaps the Minister will point it out to me in the Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>To deal with the Senator&rsquo;s point, it would be wrong of me, as Minister, to give him a commitment that the local authorities will be allowed to employ more people &mdash; I cannot do that.  In these very difficult economic circumstances local authorities are redeploying their staff in different ways to try to achieve efficiencies.  Given that there is an incentive for them to raise this money, they will do everything they can to do that.  I insisted that the money would be retained by local authorities and would not go into central Exchequer funding because that would immediately incentivise the local authorities to do this.  We need to incentivise the local authorities and we need to regenerate local government in this country and not just have local administration.  I see this as the initial step in that regard.</P>
        <P>On the administration, section 13 states: &ldquo;The expenses incurred by the Minister in the administration of this Act shall, to such extent as may be sanctioned by the Minister for Finance, be paid out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas.&rdquo;  However, on the Senator&rsquo;s specific point, the Local Government Computer Services Board is the body which will administer this on behalf of local authorities and it will pay for this itself.</P>
        <P>The Senator raises an interesting point, however.  If we give discretion to local authorities to vary the rates as they see fit, there will of course be different rates for local authorities.  This is fine and in other jurisdictions where there is real local government, one will find that rates vary from state to state.  However, it raises difficulties in the administration, which is an issue for the local authorities to consider.  As Senator Coffey noted, local councillors have been voted in and it is up to these elected representatives, not the management, to make these decisions.  They have to take into account all the pros and cons, and consider what it costs to administer the system.  There is no point in burdening themselves with red tape.  They should try to make this as simple as possible to collect, which is the whole point of the legislation, so they can collect as much money as possible.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>I re-emphasise Fine Gael&rsquo;s concerns.  The Minister has confirmed he cannot give an undertaking that local authorities can take on additional staff to deal with this extra workload despite the burden it will create.  The Bill states that the Department estimates that in excess of &euro;40 million can be raised through this local authority charging system.  However, the Oireachtas Library and Research Service produced a very interesting digest on this Bill, which is very helpful to Members, and according to its calculations the system could raise in excess of &euro;97 million.  There is a difference between the two figures.</P>
        <P>We are concerned this issue has not been analysed thoroughly enough to identify that local authorities have the capacity to deal with this workload, which is the focus of the amendments.  I have outlined the problems in the other areas where the Minister is hoping to get information and data.  We heard evidence from the PRTB in committee yesterday that until mid-2010 at the earliest it will not have a suitable ICT system which would allow it to have a proper, managed registration system that can transfer information to local authorities and others.  I keep emphasising this point because I can foresee problems if this Bill is implemented as proposed.  We feel the Revenue Commissioners have the better capacity, systems and resources to deal with this.  While I would rather see local authorities collect the charge, I am not convinced they have the capacity to do so.  For that reason, we stand by our amendments.</P>

	<P>I am sure the Minister and all of the 34 local authorities involved would be delighted if the outturn from this Bill is in the order stated by Senator Coffey, and I would be delighted for local government in its fullest sense, but the Minister must err on the side of caution.  What may contribute to the nature of Senator Coffey&rsquo;s prognosis is the number of unregistered facilities.  Given there is now a basis for having a charge on the type of residential units that are outlined in the Bill, it becomes financially beneficial to the local authorities covered under the Bill to ensure that all units are registered, so there is an incentive in that regard.  If that is the case, perhaps the forecast of Senator Coffey would prove true but, as of now, the Minister, who is capable of speaking for himself, is basing his predictions on what is known to be the number of units throughout the country.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Senator Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>I am disappointed with the Minister&rsquo;s response.  While I can understand why he cannot take a <i>carte blanche</i> approach to the employment of additional staff, I had hoped that in the future he might be disposed to particular requests if they arise.</P>
        <P>On the amendment, the Minister&rsquo;s point with regard to the incentive for the local authority to collect its own rates is very important, which is why I do not agree with the Fine Gael amendment.  Local authorities collect their own rates but in Donegal, for example, a huge amount of outstanding rates remain to be collected.  As a member of a local authority, I was able to approach the county manager and his executives and inquire why the rates were not being collected.  Local authority members would not have the opportunity to sit in front of a board of the Revenue Commissioners to inquire why it has not collected rates on their behalf.  Accountability is at issue here and, God help us, there would be an outcry in Donegal if the Revenue Commissioners in Dublin began to collect the rates and Donegal was left at the end of the pile again.  It is an executive function but at least there is some accountability and at budget time it is possible to discuss the matter with the manager, housing officials and the local team.  This is why it is important to leave the incentive in place and ensure there is democratic accountability in the collection of these rates.  I oppose the amendment although I understand that it comes from the same line of thought which I raised, that is, the concern that local authorities may not have the capacity to collect the rates if there is an insufficient number of staff and there is a need to employ additional people.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Doherty has given some very coherent arguments against the amendment and I understand fully the thinking behind it.  It is seen to improve the efficiency of the collection system but I assure the Senator that local authorities have assured me very clearly that they wish to collect the rates themselves.  As Senator Doherty stated, a centralised collection system in Dublin would not go down especially well in local authority areas.  Local authorities have the knowledge and the incentive to collect.</P>
        <P>In many ways this is a work in progress, which is also one of the reasons we were prudent enough to give a conservative estimate of the amount of money that could be collected.  I recognise the library service has come back on this and this morning Senator Doherty referred to a sum of &euro;97 million.  If a comparable sum were involved it would be fine and we would have exceeded our expectations.  The Senator will appreciate that, as Minister, if I came to the House and stated that I expected to collect a certain amount, of which we fell short subsequently, the Opposition would have a field day.  Therefore, it is better to err on the side of caution in these matters, which we have done.  I have no doubt that as the local authorities improve their collection systems and as computerisation systems improve, they will become very efficient in the collection of the &euro;200 charge.</P>
        <P>Computer services are improving.  This morning I launched a new system of e-planning for Dublin City Council.  It is fantastic and it can do everything necessary for that process.  One can enter objections with all documentation and all one requires is a credit card to do so.  This <Col N="525"/>will significantly cut down costs.  In any revenue raising exercise the idea is to make the process efficient, increase competitiveness and cut down on costs and red tape.  Most individuals are very computer literate now.  Everyone logs on to the Ryanair website now to book a flight and there is no problem or difficulty.  Likewise they will have no difficulty paying the &euro;200 charge.  They may not wish to pay it but the incentive is there for them to do so, of that there is no question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>I fully agree with the Minister&rsquo;s comments on information technology, IT, systems and that we should encourage all opportunities to improve efficiency and registration.  I simply pointed out that local authorities will be very dependent on agencies such as the Private Residential Tenancies Board, PRTB, for its database of registered properties which are not principal residences.  Despite the establishment of the board four years ago it still does not have an IT system, database or registration system and it will not have such a system for another two years.  The relevant section of the Bill specifically states that local authorities will depend on such agencies for data exchange and interface.  My point is that that system is not available at present and until such time as it is, the Fine Gael position is that the agency, Government body or arm with the necessary capacity, authority and infrastructure is the Revenue Commissioners.  I fully understand the point made and I would prefer local authorities to collect the charge, but my genuine and sincere belief is that they do not have the capacity.  They would run into untold problems in trying to collect it, there would be a great number of allegations of people not disclosing second properties and there would be too many referrals to the Private Residential Tenancies Board, which is already overburdened with substantial backlogs.  The board would not be able to confirm whether people are registered because its lists are already so high and they must be manually input.  This is a genuine concern on this side of the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to clarify the matter for the Senator.  I accept the PRTB system requires updating but it will work in transferring data, which is important.  Any difficulties with that system would also apply to the Revenue Commissioners.  I do not see how the amendment&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>The PRTB has a system, which requires updating, the Revenue Commissioners has a system and the local authorities have a system.  This is the point.  I do not understand how the amendment would deal with the matter in a conclusive and fully coherent way.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I am trying to explain that I do not understand how the amendment would deal with this issue.  The PRTB seems to be the problem.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>The PRTB is a problem but if the Revenue Commissioners does not have the information, it should have it and it is an offence if people do not declare a second property to the Revenue.  There is a mechanism for penalties and everything else in that regard.  The legislation puts the cart before the horse.  We should get it right from the beginning and there is no point falling into these pitfalls now.  We should try to get the legislation right, otherwise we may have to revert to the House later to deal with the loopholes.</P>
      </Speaker>

      <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn"><NameTxt>Senator Camillus Glynn</NameTxt>
	<P>I come down on the side of the local authorities for one simple reason.  A local authority will grant planning permission &mdash; some constructions may be built without planning permission but these are the exception to the rule &mdash; and it is always a condition of planning to outline usage of the facility.  Therefore, using this argument, the local authority is best placed to know exactly what is taking place.  I am not saying they do or they would, but local knowledge will play a pivotal role in this matter and it will complement the legislation.</P>
        <P>Let us consider the ideal situation &mdash; idealism is a wonderful concept but practicality and application are very different matters.  As of now, I do not know of any better authority to administer the legislation than the local authority for the reasons given.  The Revenue Commissioners is the same as every other entity in the country.  It knows what it is told but if it is not aware of what is taking place it can do nothing about it.  It is that simple.</P>

        <P Just="Center">SECTION 2.</P>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 3<i>a</i>:</P><Col N="527"/>
        <P LI="1">In page 5, subsection (1), between lines 10 and 11, to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="1">&ldquo;(<i>i</i>) a building which is occupied as a dwelling by a parent or both parents of the owner,</P>
        <P LI="1">(<i>j</i>) a mobile home,</P>
        <P LI="1">(<i>k</i>) a building which is the subject of a dispute in relation to probate for a period of five years or more.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">We propose this amendment to section 2 regarding the meaning of &ldquo;residential property&rdquo;.  In my Second Stage contribution I said this area needs clarification, and that is the reason we propose this amendment.  If somebody is living in a granny flat beside an existing dwelling, according to the Bill that granny flat is considered to be a second dwelling and is possibly subject to the charge.</P>
        <P>Also, if a family home transferred to a son or a daughter who may have got married and moved on but the house remains in their name, with the parent of that son or daughter remaining in the house, there would be no rental income from the house yet under the terms of the Bill that house would be liable for the charge.  That is inconsistent with another area in Revenue in that where a house is inhabited by the parent of the owner and there is no income from that house, it qualifies for mortgage interest relief.  The general principle should apply in this Bill as well where there is an acknowledgement that the parent is living in a house provided for by a son or a daughter, which is reasonable to expect in any circumstances.  It is not an investment property nor is it rented out at any stage.  Should the parent move on or whatever and the house was then used for rental purposes, I would have no problem with it coming back into the other category where a charge would be liable, but where the parent is still living in the house Fine Gael believes the charge should not be levied in that instance.  There are many instances of parents living in accommodation provided by their children in good faith in recognition of the upbringing and care they received.  It is not an investment and I would ask the Minister to consider the amendment favourably in that regard.</P>
        <P>This is a relatively short Bill of which we are generally supportive because it will support local authorities in the work they do, but it could prove troublesome if issues such as this one are not fully thought out.  What we do not want, as Senator Cummins said earlier, is to have to come back to this House with new Bills and new amendments in a relatively short period because of difficulties such as those I have pointed out.</P>
        <P>In regard to mobile homes, which the Minister dealt with in his earlier amendment, Fine Gael asked that they not be considered a residence but a holiday home, which is what they are, and that they would not come under the category of the charge.</P>
        <P>We also refer in our amendment to &ldquo;a building which is the subject of a dispute in relation to probate for a period of five years or more&rdquo;.  The reasoning behind that is that in many cases throughout the country disputes arise with regard to property in probate.  Those disputes can run on for a number of years and we would consider it reasonable that until such disputes are resolved and there is a clear outcome as to the owner of the particular houses, they would be considered outside the category for charge.  I would be interested to hear the Minister&rsquo;s views on that or if he has a better suggestion.</P>
        <P>This amendment was rushed.  To be honest, this legislation appears to be rushed.  We would like more time to consider all sections fully and reflect on and propose amendments that can work.  I would be happy to hear the Minister&rsquo;s views on the issues I have raised, specifically the one with regard to parents.  He might clarify the position on granny flats which are individual dwellings.  They have their own electricity accounts.  The Minister will refer later to applying to the ESB and so on for information.  They have all their own services and electricity and they <Col N="528"/>are stand-alone.  I would like clarification from the Minister that they will not be charged this levy.  He might also deal with the question of exempting from the charge the houses where the parents of the owners live and from which there is no income.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Paddy Burke</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I support Senator Coffey&rsquo;s amendment.  In some countries people live in barges on rivers or lakes, and quite a number of people in this country live in barges.  In some cases they use them as second homes or whatever.  What is the position on those?  The Minister has qualified the position on some dwellings, including caravans in caravan parks, but he might qualify the position on barges.</P>
        <P>I support Senator Coffey in regard to paragraph (<i>k</i>) of the amendment to section 2.  He made the case where probate has taken place.  Disputes over houses or properties that arise among family members can take a considerable time to settle.  The fines the Minister has put in place are hefty and a situation might arise where the person who gets the home following settlement of a dispute could be liable for a considerable charge.  The Minister has spelt out in the Bill that it is the person who buys the house who pays.  The obligation should be on the person who sells the house to ensure the property is clean of debts and charges.  For cases of dispute or where probate takes a considerable time, Senator Coffey&rsquo;s amendment is sensible.  An exemption of at least five years should be allowed in the case of probate.  I support Senator Coffey&rsquo;s amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister clarify the status of second homes following the enactment of the NAMA legislation?  I know that legislation will not come to the House for some time but it I presume it will result in NAMA owing a significant number of finished, unfinished or partially finished housing estates, some of which may be let to third parties.  If NAMA, as a corporate body, has ownership of such properties, will it come within the remit of the legislation?  Will the legislation extend to banks which have repossessed houses?  What will be the status of a financial institution which, having repossessed a house, enters into an arrangement to allow a family to remain in a house as tenants or tenant purchasers?  Will such a bank be liable for the &euro;200 charge?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Senator Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Coffey&rsquo;s amendment.  The Senator said the amendment was rushed.  I have placed amendments which are similarly rushed.  The legislation clearly needs to be changed.</P>
        <P>I have personal experience of people whose houses will be subject to the levy in circumstances which the spirit of the Bill never intended.  Senator Coffey&rsquo;s amendment refers to a house owned by the son or daughter of the occupant.  Such a house should not be subject to the levy.  I do not believe it was the intention of the Bill to make such people pay &euro;200.</P>
        <P>In other situations a mother or father may have passed away, left a house to an eldest son and another sibling may continue to reside in the house.  This is another anomaly.  Such a house would also be subject to the levy.  Several small issues need to be tidied up before the Bill is passed by the Seanad and D&aacute;il.  I hope the Minister is disposed to consider them.  I support the amendment.  I believe it may need to go a little further.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>

	<P>The Bill refers to homes and not buildings.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I suppose barges are at sea on occasion.  Senator Bradford raised the prospect of the NAMA legislation.  That legislation has not been published.  This Bill states clearly that properties which are newly constructed but unsold are exempt.  NAMA will be concerned with precisely those types of properties.  They would not fall within the remit of the Bill.  Nevertheless, I will take Senator Bradford&rsquo;s concerns to the Minister for Finance who is currently working on the NAMA legislation.</P>
        <P>I thank Senator Coffey for his amendment which seeks an exemption from the charge for three instances.  I also received the amendment quite late because Senator Coffey was also under pressure.  I have had to look at the various categories he has outlined: property in which a parent of the owner resides, mobile homes, and properties which are the subject of probate difficulties.  My amendment has dealt with the mobile home issue.  No charge will apply to properties before probate has been taken out.  When and if probate is finally granted, someone will own the dwelling and I can see no reason the normal provisions of the Bill should not apply.</P>
        <P>It is a core principle of the Bill that owners of residential property are, in the normal course of events, liable for the charge.  This will apply to owners of property irrespective of whether a family member lives in it.  The colloquial expression for the instance to which Senator Doherty referred is &ldquo;granny flat&rdquo;.  Under normal circumstances, this would not be liable to the charge if it is part of the dwelling concerned.  It is more difficult if the home is a stand-alone building.  That is a different situation.  A stand-alone building is liable.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>What is the definition of a stand-alone building?  In many cases, a second home may have its own electricity connection and the parent or sibling may pay his or her own ESB bill.  Would such a home qualify as a stand-alone building even though it is part of an original dwelling?</P>
        <P>There are several anomalies in the Bill.  We are only scratching the surface.  We need more time to consider the Bill.  I hope we are not forced to complete Committee Stage later tonight or tomorrow afternoon.  We need another week to digest the Bill and to examine the amendments which have been submitted by various parties.  The Minister himself has mentioned that the Bill is rushed.</P>
      </Speaker>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>The Opposition also submitted them at the last minute because we received the Bill so late.  That is another reason more time should be given to digest the Bill.  It will be challenged every step of the way, not in the Houses but outside, where they are queuing up with their legal advisers ready to pounce on the Bill and pick out loopholes.  It is important that we dot all the i&rsquo;s and cross all the t&rsquo;s before the Bill becomes law.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Paddy Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister should spell out his intention more clearly.  There are many cases in rural Ireland where a son or daughter applied for planning permission to build an extension so that two families can live under one roof but in two separate living quarters.  The reason they do this is so the offspring can look after their parents.  We have been advocating this for many years, so people can be kept out of hospitals and be looked after by their families.  That policy has been promoted by everybody.  In this case, there could be two separate electricity bills to ensure the pensioner gets their entitlement to free electricity, fuel and so forth.  What the Minister has said leads me to believe that there would be a charge for the type of development where there are two houses within a single structure, with the parents living in <Col N="530"/>one and a son or daughter with their family living in the other.  The Minister should explain this in more detail.</P>
        <P>The other issue is who will be the final arbiter.  Will the county manager make the final decision as to whether it is just one house or two houses?  Somebody has to decide whether the &euro;200 fee applies.  Who will be the final arbiter in these cases?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Senator Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>I believe we all have the same perspective on this Bill, although our interpretation of it might be different from the Minister&rsquo;s.  Senator Coffey&rsquo;s amendment deals with parents and any house, not just a granny flat.  Over 400,000 houses will be subject to this levy.  A number of people will be in the situation of having a granny flat or where the son or daughter owns the house where the parents are living.  It is not a huge number; it will not be in the tens of thousands.  If this legislation passes and local authorities charge &euro;200 on a granny flat or a family home in the possession of a son or daughter where the parents who might be in their 80s or 90s are residing, it will cause uproar in local areas.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There should be a simple amendment to the legislation.  I have dealt with the granny flat issue in amendment No. 6<i>b</i>.  I cannot see in the legislation where a granny flat, which is a self-contained flat adjoining the house, would be exempt from the levy.  I agree with Senator Paddy Burke.  These amendments might not be the best, given that all of this was rushed, but time should be allocated to examine some of the issues that have been raised.  A number of exemptions are necessary.  They will not change the spirit of the Bill but will clarify what everybody wants to achieve.  They will also deal with the outrage that will occur in rural areas, particularly if county managers, under the letter of the law, start to impose these levies on houses to which it is neither my nor the Minister&rsquo;s intention that they should be applied.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Senator Ann Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the concept of the levy.  However, I have listened to the debate and many problems appear to be arising.  I received a telephone call last night during which the caller asked about the situation of a landlord who has a second house in which there are three or four flats.  Does the landlord pay just one levy on the second house or is there a levy for every flat?  I could not answer that question.  There is much confusion about this.  Senator Paddy Burke has raised some interesting points.  It will create havoc in the local council area.  I am curious to know how the county manager will implement it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>Having listened to Senators from all sides of the House, it is down to interpretation.  We must be clear about how the legislation should be interpreted by those in authority, be it a county manager or the final arbitrator on whether a building is liable for this charge.  The Minister&rsquo;s assessment is too vague.  I can offer another example that is widespread throughout the country.  Consider the cottage acre on which a family was reared.  After securing planning permission for a house on the same cottage acre, the younger people in the family move into it and the entire property is transferred into that person&rsquo;s name.  However, the parents still reside in the old dwelling.  The charge will apply to that dwelling under the terms of this legislation.  That is the issue.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I accept that the wording of the amendment might not be good enough or acceptable but if we could be given an undertaking in good faith from the Minister that he will address this area of exemption with wording from the Parliamentary Counsel, I would accept that.  Until we get such an undertaking, however, this is all that is available to protect the elderly parents in those dwellings who will be levied with the charge.  It is unfair.  In paragraph (j) the Minister has dealt with mobile homes, which is fine.  Perhaps he would also clarify if the charge applies where the ownership of properties is in dispute.</P><Col N="531"/>
        <P>This measure was announced in mid-October 2008 but the legislation is only before the House now.  We are expected to pass it through all Stages today.  This is rushing the analysis of the Bill.  If we put time into it now, it will prevent problems down the road.  Fine Gael is generally supportive of the principle of the Bill, but it is too vague and open to interpretation.  There must be clearer definition in many areas.  The time allocated for the various Stages will not allow us to analyse properly and digest even the information the Minister is providing.  I ask the Minister to consider that.  We will try to be helpful but the Minister must take our amendments seriously.  Otherwise there will be many problems when the Bill is being implemented.  In the case of the cottage acre and an old person living in the original house, they will be levied because of the person living at the back or the side of the house.  The matter must be clarified further.</P>

	<P>With regard to the exclusion of a building that forms part of a trading stock, in the current climate many builders are entering into short-term leases under lease to buy schemes, in the hope that in a few years the apartments or dwellings will be purchased.  My reading of the Bill is that the levy applies to those short-term leases.  What lease term would be excluded from the levy?  I live in a town where the old colonial landlord still owns a considerable part of the town&rsquo;s residential area.  People have their homes on long leases.  What is the situation there?  The leases could be 30, 50 or 100 years in some instances.  In the case of apartments, the owners of the apartments do not hold the freehold.  That is held by a management company.  The apartment owners have a 999 year lease in most instances.  How is the provision applied in that situation?  Although the &euro;200 is not a significant figure, if it were to increase it might be an impediment to builders participating in the innovative lease to buy concept, given the current difficulties in the construction sector.</P>

	<P>With regard to the house on the cottage acre where the son or daughter gets planning permission and builds a house which becomes their normal residence, the old house is the normal residence of the parents so, clearly, the levy would not apply in that situation.  That is my view.  However, if the situation changes with the demise of the parent or parents and the house was rented, the situation might change.  There is also the case of a house with a number of bed-sits.  These are not self-contained units so they could not be described as apartments in the established sense.  Invariably, they share services so I do not believe they come under the remit of the Bill.  However, if they were self-contained units, that is, with cooking, shower and bathroom facilities, they would be liable to the levy.</P>

	<P>Many thousands of people receive rent allowance from the HSE.  To the best of my knowledge, they must know their landlords but because of the Data Protection Act are not obliged to inform local authorities about them.  Is it intended to amend the Data Protection Act so this type of information might be shared by the various agencies?  That was one of our reasons for tabling the amendment in the first place because under that Act the Revenue Commissioners are exempted from obtaining that type of information.  That is another area that must be addressed in greater detail in this Bill.  If he does not have the information, perhaps the Minister might get back to us on this matter.  The whole area of data protection and the sharing of information concerning two landlords, whether the PRTB, the local authority, or whoever, must be addressed on Report Stage.  Currently the HSE is not obliged to give landlords&rsquo; names to local authorities.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I shall deal with Senator Cummins&rsquo;s last point.  Section 11 deals with it clearly, stating:</P><Col N="532"/>
        <P LI="1">Notwithstanding any enactment or rule of law, a relevant person shall, upon a request from a local authority, provide the local authority with information in the possession or control of the relevant person or its subsidiary as the local authority may reasonably require for the purpose of enabling the local authority perform its functions under this Act and a local authority shall, at such intervals as the Revenue Commissioners may specify, provide the Revenue Commissioners with such information obtained by the local authority pursuant to this Act.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I apologise for interrupting the Minister.  Does this mean the HSE, which provides rent allowances, is obliged to give the names of the landlords to the local authorities?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>That is stated very clearly in the legislation.  It is dealt with in section 11, on data sharing and exchange, and is clear.</P>
        <P>I must disagree with some of the comments made by Senator Coffey.  I tried to be as clear as I could and we tried to offer clarity.  The Senator raised the issue of the granny flat and I stated very clearly in my reply that it would not be liable for the charge if it is part of the dwelling in question.</P>
        <P>I return to the other questions.  Senator Ormonde raised a similar issue and I draw attention to section 2(2) of the legislation which states:</P>
        <P LI="1">For the purpose of this Act, a bedroom forming part of a residential property that is let under a letting arrangement whereby the individual occupying that bedroom is entitled to share with any other individual any other accommodation, amenity or facility in the property, is not a residential property but the building of which it is a part, is.</P>
        <P FLI="0">That section deals with a situation in which a number of people are in a place together in separate rooms.  However, if there are separate apartments, clearly those apartments are subject to the charge and again, that is very clear.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I appreciate that Senators have raised legitimate points.  I wish to examine all of them and as we go through the various Stages of the Bill, I shall continue to do so.</P>
        <P>I forgot the issues raised by Senator Walsh.  He raised a number of points about leasing arrangements.  If a property is being leased it is subject to this charge and there is no question about that.  Regardless of whether the arrangement is what the Senator referred to as a long-term lease or, as in some cases, a short-term lease, the property is still subject to this &euro;200 charge.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CiaranCannon"><NameTxt>Senator Ciaran Cannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the Minister.  He is trying to be clear, giving Members as much clarity as he can with regard to our questions.  However, this legislation does not allow him to provide us with any clarity and that is the issue.</P>
        <P>Concerning the exemption of a bedroom which forms part of a building, that is specifically referred to in the legislation.  However, the great majority of what we describe as granny flats consist of much more than a bedroom and usually contain a kitchenette or dining area and perhaps even a living room.  My interpretation of the legislation is that once the accommodation occupied by an elderly relative, perhaps a mother or father, exceeds the definition of a simple bedroom, the owner is automatically liable for the charge.  As Senator Coffey outlined, the person may be paying a separate ESB bill.  If the Minister is making the argument that the building forms part of the main principal residence he must equally make the same argument in respect of apartments that are a component of a larger overall block of apartments.</P>
        <P>Senator Glynn referred to &ldquo;normal residence&rdquo;.  If the elderly people occupying the cottage-house of which we spoke consider it to be their normal residence they would not be liable for the charge.  As far as I can judge, the phrase &ldquo;normal residence&rdquo; does not occur anywhere in the legislation which simply states that the owner of a property, as defined, is liable to pay this charge and other than that is exempt from the charge if the property is occupied by the owner.  If it is occupied by somebody other than the owner the charge automatically applies.  Therefore, if I own two properties, one of which is my principal residence, the other the property next door where my parents live, I am liable for the charge.  It is quite explicit and easily gleaned from the legislation.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Paddy Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>In the case of leasehold and leases, is it the likes of Lord Lucan who must pay this charge or to whom does it apply?  Ground rent is being paid for some of these dwellings.  In this case, the person living in the house should not have to pay the &euro;200 &mdash; Lord Lucan should pay it.  I do not know how one finds out where he is.  Does this throw the entire legislation up in arms?</P>
        <P>I understand what the Minister said about the courts being the final arbiter.  Will the county manager make the decision and say that the &euro;200 must be collected, that the person will be followed for it and if there is a dispute that it will go to the courts?  In those cases where there is a derogation concerning collection, is it the county manager who will make those decisions?</P>
        <P>I shall do my best to find Lord Lucan&rsquo;s address for the Minister but I can see some difficulties down the road.</P>

	<P>I return to a point I raised earlier.  Unfortunately, I will not be present to discuss some of the other amendments because I have an essential appointment.</P>
        <P>I realise the Minister has given clarification regarding the situation of granny flats.  I have read the legislation and I know the granny flats in my area, which are self-contained flats adjoining an existing house.  They are not an extension to a house creating additional rooms, <Col N="534"/>perhaps a dining room, a bedroom or a kitchenette.  It is not a matter of walking through one door into another couple of rooms.  They abut but are separate flats.  They are like houses in the country that used to be single but are now&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Senator Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>People enter via a separate entrance and have their independence, but they are next door to their sons or daughters.  This type of security is the beauty of the granny flat.  From my reading of the legislation, granny flats are subject to the &euro;200 fee.  The Minister&rsquo;s interpretation of the matter we are discussing might relate to a number of additional rooms in a house to give a mother or father a quarter of the house.  Obviously, such an arrangement would not be subject to the levy.</P>
        <P>My amendment No. 6<i>a</i> deals with this issue effectively, but not with all of the other issues.  It is not just a question of parents but about sons and daughters.  There are many anomalies because nothing is black and white when it comes to housing, leaving houses to sons, daughters, brothers or sisters and different people residing in houses.  The problem with the legislation is that we needed to define &ldquo;ownership&rdquo; as belonging to the owners of the house, which was the only possible definition.  However, it means that we must deal with many anomalies, some of which we have not identified.  I gave an example, but I could name people from my home town of Gweedore who leave home every Monday morning and return Saturday while renting houses in Dublin.  Their homes will be subject to the levy because their houses&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>My question on leases raised an important issue.  Will the Minister examine it for Report Stage?  Leases beyond a certain time limit are generally regarded by the occupants of premises as being tantamount to freeholds.  It is only for technical reasons that they do not hold those freeholds.  I suggest that the Minister consider a period of 21 or 35 years so that if someone has a lease of that duration, it would fall outside the scope of the levy.  From the point of view of equality in the application of the levy, it is important that this matter be considered.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Will the Minister clarify another issue for me, although I believe I am probably clear on it?  Recently, I answered someone&rsquo;s question and, in light of this debate, I want to ensure the answer was the right one.  The issue in question is the meaning of &ldquo;residential property&rdquo;, which the Bill defines as a building situated in the State that is &ldquo;used, or suitable for use&rdquo; as a dwelling.  A person in the farming community built a house separate from the family home.  The original farmhouse, probably unoccupied and unserviced by water or sanitary facilities, which would have been normal in the old days, would not be a suitable dwelling without major refurbishment and significant expenditure.  I am assuming that &ldquo;suitable for use&rdquo; means that the building is suitable for use in its present condition.  If it is not suitable for habitation without investment in, for example, sanitary facilities, refurbishments and repairs, it does not fall within the scope of the levy.  Is my understanding correct?  These buildings, such as old farmhouses, are unoccupied.</P>

	<P>They might not all be derelict.</P>

	<P>They might not be fully derelict, but it might not take much money to make them liveable accommodation.  What is the position in this regard?</P>
        <P>The explanatory memorandum states: &ldquo;A &lsquo;dwelling&rsquo; is defined as a building used, or suitable for use as, a separate dwelling whether or not certain facilities are shared.&rdquo;  This definition must be removed from the memorandum if what the Minister has stated is&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn"><NameTxt>Senator Camillus Glynn</NameTxt>
	<P>Regarding a comment made by Senator Cannon, while I accept that the term &ldquo;normal resident&rdquo; is not contained in the legislation, section 4 states: &ldquo;his or her sole or main residence&rdquo;.  Reverting to the example of a house built by a son or daughter in a cottage garden, the old house is the main residence of the parent or parents while the new house is the main residence of the son, daughter or so on.  When the parents pass on and the son, daughter or so on becomes the owner of the old residence, does that residence become liable for the charge?  I believe this to be the point.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCannon"><NameTxt>Senator Ciaran Cannon</NameTxt>

We will not push the amendment on Committee Stage, but we reserve the right to resubmit it on Report Stage pending further clarification.  An important matter is that of the granny flat.  Even the ESB has separate meters for granny flats where they are annexes that used to be part of the original dwelling.</P>
        <P>Senator Glynn has alluded to the issue that our amendment tries to address, albeit from a different perspective.  A family farm, including the old dwelling, could be handed over to a son or daughter and he or she could build a new house on the farm, which occurs in 90% of cases.  While the parent remains in the old farm dwelling, it is owned by the son or daughter.  Under the legislation, it will be liable to the charge.  We believe it should be exempted.  Will the Minister clarify this matter?  May I speak to section 2 or just to the amendment?</P>

	<P>I will be more than happy to provide the clarification the Senator seeks.  I appreciate his offer to decide on whether to table amendments for Report Stage pending the clarification he receives.  However, we should distinguish between clarification and wanting to seek further exemptions, as the Senator does.  I will give the Senator all the clarification he wants but it does not mean the legislation will necessarily change.  It is important to bear this in mind.  I want to be as co-operative as possible, not only with Senators on the Opposition side but also with those on this side who were seeking clarification.  I intend to compile as comprehensive a list of answers as possible to all the points raised.</P>

	<P>While I accept where the Minister is coming from and while we will try to co-operate as much as possible on this side of the House, it seems obvious that there is a clear requirement for a Schedule of interpretations, including definitions of buildings.  Could this be considered?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>There are definitions given at the beginning of the legislation.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CiaranCannon"><NameTxt>Senator Ciaran Cannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for offering to seek clarification.  During his deliberations with his officials&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>The deliberations will include the Opposition.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCannon"><NameTxt>Senator Ciaran Cannon</NameTxt>
	<P>What is the overall intent of this legislation?  I do not believe it is to penalise people, predominantly those living in rural Ireland, who happen to have their elderly parents living in houses next to them.  Is this what the Minister and his officials intended when they began drafting this Bill?  There is a mechanism whereby we can exempt people in such circumstances from the charge.  I do not believe for a moment the Minister believes we should proceed as the Bill proposes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I would be concerned if the message went out from this session that this is an anti-elderly tax of some sort; that is not what it is.  The intent is to ensure those who own second properties, who are largely reasonably well off, pay a levy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCannon"><NameTxt>Senator Ciaran Cannon</NameTxt>
	<P>&ldquo;Largely&rdquo; is the operative word.  One must draft good law.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>In no way can this be considered a very onerous levy.  The sum of &euro;200 is quite modest.  The reason behind it, which has been applauded on the Senator&rsquo;s side of the House, is to find a revenue stream for local authorities.  We can all agree on that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not have a problem with that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I will be very happy to accommodate Senators on the Opposition and Government sides by examining all the issues they raised.  It is not just a case of my talking to my officials because I invite the various Senators who raised issues to submit to me their concerns in detail such that, by the time we reach Report Stage, they can be clarified and adequate answers can be provided.  I am taking up the offer of Senator Coffey on this matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister clarify whether he will be coming back before Report Stage to answer the questions asked?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Coffey has made very clear that his resubmission of amendments depends on the information he receives.  I suggest that we go through the various amendments tabled on Committee Stage.  There seem to be some concerns.  I ask the Leader of the House whether the proposals I made are in order.  If not, I should be let know.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek information because I have just re-entered the House.  This has been a very interesting debate and many colleagues are very interested in this very important legislation.  Is it proposed by the Minister that we adjourn Committee Stage until 7 p.m. to allow him and Senators to discuss in the ante-room their various concerns and continue with the other two Bills listed for consideration this afternoon?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>My understanding is that we deal with Committee Stage in full and that, before Report Stage, the Minister will clarify most of the points raised by the Senators.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>That was my understanding.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>As long as clarification will be sufficient, I am very satisfied with that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>That is what Senator Coffey has suggested.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I made a point on co-operation to the Minister.  Given the time constraints now being imposed by the Leader, I ask that we return to this legislation.  We will have to do so next week on Report Stage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I believed we had made some progress and that we were just about to make more by accepting the proposal made by Senator Coffey, that is, that we complete Committee Stage, after which there will be a meeting to go through the various concerns raised before we proceed to Report Stage.  That was my clear understanding.</P>

	<P>Let me raise a point of information, because we are always learning.  If there are no amendments for Report Stage, will no printing take place?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>That is correct.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>If there is progress involving the Minister and colleagues after Committee Stage, we can conclude the Bill by midnight or some such time.  There is no guillotine.  This House does not guillotine any Bill in any shape or form; that is the big advantage of being a Senator.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>To clarify, we will proceed with Committee Stage.  As I take it, Senator Coffey reserves the right to table amendments for Report Stage if he so wishes.  There will be a break between Committee Stage and Report Stage.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
        <P>Question proposed &ldquo;That section 2 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>Under section 2(1):</P>
        <P LI="1">In this Act, &ldquo;residential property&rdquo; means a building situated in the State used, or suitable for use, as a dwelling, including any house, maisonette, flat or apartment (including a bedsit) but does not include&mdash;</P>
        
        <P LI="2">(<i>c</i>) a building let by a Minister of the Government, a housing authority or the Health Service Executive established by the Health Act 2004.</P><Col N="540"/>
        <P FLI="0">My point applies equally to subsections (<i>f</i>) and (<i>g</i>).  If the HSE engages a private landlord for emergency accommodation, will that landlord be exempt from this charge?</P>
        <P>Does this apply also to a housing authority which has a contract with a private landlord for the rental accommodation scheme, RAS?  This is a dual contract held by the local authority and the private landlord with the tenant.  Will the Minister clarify whether such landlords are also exempt from the scheme?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>It was clarified this morning that the owners of property in the RAS scheme are exempt.  I was distracted and did not hear the Senator&rsquo;s other point. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>I referred to the HSE in respect of emergency accommodation. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>That is also exempt.  If the Senator wants further clarification I can get that.  I have said very clearly that these people are exempt.   </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>I flagged this point on Second Stage this morning to give the Minister time to get further clarification if required.  A terrace of privately owned houses on one side of a road might be part of RAS while the same type of house on the other side of the road, owned by the same or other landlords, might not be part of RAS.  I cannot understand why those in RAS should be exempt.  What is the rationale for that?  They are investment properties.  The only difference is that those landlords have a secure contract with the State, through the local authority, whereas those on the other side of the road have no security of contract but will be levied.</P>
        <P>This needs to be clarified.  It is an anomaly.  The problems will not arise here but with the local authorities when people seek clarification.  Solicitors will line up to challenge the rule.  While the charge is only &euro;200 that will be multiplied by the many thousands of houses we think will come under the scheme.  There will be challenges if landlords on one side of a road are exempt because they are part of RAS while those on the other side are not.  It is not fully thought through.  I will be interested in the Minister&rsquo;s comments on that point.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I acknowledged this morning, and have just told the Senator again, that RAS is exempt.  It is a fundamental part of how we accommodate people on our housing lists.  It works extremely well.  That is why they have got this exemption.  We are not speaking now to an amendment.  The Senator is seeking further information. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>We are speaking on the section.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I cannot give the Senator any further information.  It is an exemption and that is all there is to it. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>I am speaking on the section on an area in which I see a problem.  There is nothing to stop the Minister amending that section in the remaining stages.  I am pointing out an area in which I see a further anomaly and inequality.  The Minister cannot simply disregard all the private landlords who are not part of RAS because they have supported many of the social housing initiatives when the local authorities and the State could not support people who required housing.  We will charge the ones who are not in RAS while their peers across the road, who are in the scheme, will not be charged.  Those landlords have taken on the same liabilities and made the same investments as the landlords who will be charged.  The only difference is that those who have security of contract with the local authority will be exempt.  There will be challenges and problems in this area.  It will increase pressure on local <Col N="541"/>authorities because landlords will try to force themselves into RAS and there will be accusations of favouritism in local authorities where housing officers decide who can be in RAS.  This is not thought through.  That is the reality I foresee based on my experience of dealing with local authorities.  I bring this to the Minister&rsquo;s attention only to be helpful.  We have not tabled an amendment on this point but I suggest that the Minister consider re-drafting it in some way.  That is why I suggested a schedule of exemptions where any housing officer, county manager or director of service can see who is in the scheme because it is not very clear. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Senator Coffey on this point.  If I was a landlord with two similar houses, one of which was in RAS and I was charged for the one that was not, it would be an anomaly.  Lawyers will drive a coach and four through the provision.  It is a recipe for disaster.  The Minister has spoken several times about clarity but there is no clarity on this issue.  It has not been fully thought through.  I respect the Minister&rsquo;s comment that he is prepared to try to clarify several items with us but he will not be clarifying them with us but with the solicitors and others who will examine and drive a coach and four through this legislation because it is not thought out. </P>
        <P>I cannot understand why landlords in RAS are exempt while others not in it will pay the tax for a similar property, perhaps in the same street for which they receive the same rent.  There must be some kind of legal or constitutional bar against such legislation coming in.  That will be challenged.  People will try to get on RAS but they will probably not be allowed to do so.  One or two people on a local authority deal with RAS.  We spoke earlier about the need to employ more people to collect the money but we will need more people to deal with the RAS applications.</P>
        <P>This legislation has not been fully thought out.  We have been here for only an hour or 90 minutes but look at the number of problems we have found while thinking on our feet.  What will happen in the cold light of day when barristers and everybody else look for anomalies and loopholes?  We can complete Committee Stage now but we need a week or two to digest this because there is much more in this Bill than meets the eye.  We are only scratching its surface.  We are here to tease out any anomalies and loopholes there may be in it.  That is our job and we do not want to be rushed.  I am not suggesting the Minister is rushing it.  The Leader told us we could have it finished by midnight which is preposterous.  I ask that this be teased out and that we get the clarification the Minister has mentioned, but we need a great deal of clarification because the longer we go on, the more we need.  Committee Stage is where these items should be clarified and that should be done now.  With all due respect to the Minister, I respect the fact he is offering to try to clarify it outside the House but it should be done here.  This is where clarification should be given; this is Committee Stage of a Bill going through the Houses of the Oireachtas and we should have all the clarification we need here and now.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>With respect to the Senator, this is extremely clear.  The situation is spelled out exactly in sections 2(<i>f</i>), 2(<i>g</i>) and 2(<i>h</i>).  Senator Cummins is stating that it is unfair and that a builder could have houses in the RAS scheme on one side of the road and dwellings not in the RAS scheme on the other side of the road and he feels that this is an anomaly.  It is not because it has been spelled out that there is an exception being made, with an exemption for those in the RAS scheme.  We already dealt with a certain exemption that the Opposition sought with regard to mobile homes.  Others seek other exemptions.  It is the nature of legislation that when one examines it one will look for certain areas that are exempt and other areas that are part of the legislation and that is extremely clear.  It is equally clear that Senator Cummins finds it unacceptable and that is a different point.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="542"/>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not the point I was making.  Everything seems to be clear to the Minister but it is not clear to this side of the House.  He is speaking about providing us with clarification on a number of items.  I cannot see from where he is plucking out of the air that everything is clear when he must give us clarification.</P>

	<P>I thank the Senators for the amendment.  I have some sympathy for the purpose underlying the Senator&rsquo;s amendment, but I am convinced there are good reasons it would cause some practical difficulties if I accepted it.  In the first instance, it is not at all clear what is meant by a &ldquo;family&rdquo;.  One can take a narrow or wide view of how this might be construed.  Once owners or co-owners become entitled to possession of a property and are entitled to receive the rental income which it would generate, then the co-owners are jointly and severally liable for the change, unless they can avail of one of the exemptions in the Bill.</P>
        <P>Until such time as probate is taken out, the new owners will not become liable for the charge.  When the new owners become entitled to possession they will also be entitled to rent out the property for some or all of the time and should be able to derive a sufficient income stream to more than cover the &euro;200 required to defray the charge.  As I understand it, the property concerned is normally let when someone needs to be accommodated in a nursing home and the rental income is used to meet, in part, the costs of the care accommodation.  In the circumstances, therefore, I cannot accede to the proposed amendment.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 7, subsection (4)(<i>a</i>)(iii), line 14, after &ldquo;granted&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or separation agreement entered into&rdquo;.</P><Col N="544"/>
        <P FLI="0">The Bill as it stands allows for a person to be exempt from the charge if a decree of divorce or judicial separation was granted in respect of that marriage on or before that date.  Our amendment seeks to extend that provision so that if a couple has entered into a separation agreement the person would also be exempt.  The separation agreement may not have gone through the courts and a legal separation may not have been yet granted.  Our amendment seeks an exemption in the case of a separation agreement also.  I would appreciate a comment from the Minister on whether he will consider allowing this amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senator for putting forward this amendment.  Section 4 provides that where a decree of divorce or of judicial separation has been granted in respect of a marriage, a residential property in which a spouse retains an interest, but which is occupied by the other spouse as his or her sole or main residence, will not attract a liability for the charge in respect of the spouse who does not reside there.  This provision is inserted to cater for the relatively common outcome of a divorce or separation agreement where one party continues to reside in the family home, but the other, although retaining a financial interest in the property, does not.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 8 appears to give the same status to a separation agreement as is given to a decree granted by a court.  Although I have some sympathy for the objective of the amendment, I regret I cannot accede to it.  The amendment does not define adequately what a separation agreement is, whether it applies in the case of a marriage or otherwise or, more generally, what standing it has in law.  Neither is it clear whether either or both of the parties to the marriage had the benefit of legal advice in arriving at that agreement.  It would not be known whether any element of duress was present in respect of one of the parties to the agreement when it was entered into.</P>
        <P>The drafting of section 4(4) of the Bill is grounded in precedent.  I refer the Senator to section 13 of the Finance (No. 2) Act 2000 which deals with broadly similar circumstances, but which confines itself to actual decrees of divorce and separation granted under the same statutes as referred to in section 4(4)(<i>b</i>).  Bearing this in mind and taking account of the points I have made with regard to the uncertainty surrounding a separation agreement, I regret that I cannot accede to the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not have a copy of that Finance Act with me so I cannot comment on that point.  I understand the Minister&rsquo;s argument to some degree.  However, if at the time of paying the charge, a person lodged a copy of his or her separation agreement and subsequently when this was legalised returned to the local authority, would the Minister sanction a rebate for the fee paid?  That would cover the issue of the legality of the agreement.  Would the Minister accept that?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>The Bill is very clear on this.  If a person owns the property, he or she is liable for the charge.  However, I will contact my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, to advise him of the Senator&rsquo;s view on this matter as this branch of the law is primarily a matter for his Department to address.  As I pointed out, the provision included in the Local Government (Charges) Bill follows precedent in other legislation.  Depending on my colleague&rsquo;s advice, I would be happy to address the Senator&rsquo;s concerns in the future in a suitable legislative vehicle, if appropriate.</P>
        <P>The legislation we are discussing is clear on the issue.  If we are talking about the owner of the property, he or she is liable.  It creates a nebulous situation where a county manager must <Col N="545"/>decide on whether someone is liable for a fee on the basis of a piece of paper.  I would prefer to have clarity on the issue.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senators Doherty and Cummins for bringing forward this amendment.  I accept the Senators&rsquo; point that it would not be reasonable to require someone to pay the &euro;200 charge where they are away working for part of the time in circumstances where the remainder of their family resides in the family home.  Senator Doherty made this same point this morning.  I intend to issue guidance to local authorities following the enactment of the Bill.  I intend to make it very clear to local authorities that someone who is temporarily away from home for the purposes of work should, nonetheless, be able to nominate the family home as their sole or main residence.  I assume the Senator has a case in mind where someone is not permanently away from the family home.</P>
        <P>In the circumstances as outlined by Senator Doherty, liability to pay the charge should not arise.  I would caution, however, that if the person concerned owned another property which he or she used to live in at their place of work, he or she cannot avail of the exemption for a sole or main residence in respect of two different properties.  I clarified this issue for Senator Doherty already and I hope this further explanation provides the clarification he requires.</P>

If payment is made late and people have not paid up within a week or a month of the payment date, when will the late payment charge apply?

      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>This section refers to the amendments dealing with the whole area of administration and collection of charges.  Fine Gael believes the Revenue Commissioners have the infrastructure, capacity and IT systems to ensure a more efficient collection of the charges than can currently be administered owing to the problems with databases and administration within the PRTB and also the lack of resources that might be available to local authorities in the current environment.  For that reason, we oppose the section.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn"><NameTxt>Senator Camillus Glynn</NameTxt>
	<P>While I have a lot of respect for Senator Coffey, I am one of those who believes implicitly in the concept of local autonomy.  This is clearly an area where the local authority can shine.  With all due respect to the Revenue Commissioners, they are far removed from the local scene, regardless of whether we believe it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not true.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn"><NameTxt>Senator Camillus Glynn</NameTxt>
	<P>The entity that is best placed to collect these charges in the most efficient way possible is the local authority.  We must bear in mind that in the case of the town council, there is something in it for the nine members if it is a rating authority, and there is definitely something in it for the county council.  Therefore, they will make certain this system works.  The more money available to the locally elected members, the more work they can get done for the people who elected them.  I would side strongly with the Minister in this regard and I commend him on devolving power to the local authority, which is best placed to collect these charges owing to its local knowledge.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I see this as the beginning of a process.  It is a broadening of the revenue-raising base for local authorities.  We must have a certain trust in our local authorities.  There are areas where they can be criticised but I would be very surprised if they did not rise to this challenge.  They will rise to the challenge and they will go out there and collect for all they worth because they want to do so.  They know we are living in difficult economic circumstances, they need to get their hands on every last cent available and I have no doubt they will do it.  Regardless of whether we like it, money incentivises people.  I have no doubt they will do an excellent job.</P>
        <P>It will be a test and this is, if one likes, the first test.  I intend to devolve more powers to the local authorities in the context of the forthcoming White Paper.  I referred earlier to the office of the Dublin mayor which will also need to have fund-raising powers.  I see this as the beginning of a new era for real local government in this country.  That is why I have given the task to the local authorities.</P>

        <P>Section 10 agreed to.</P>
        <P Just="Center">SECTION 11.</P>
        <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 11 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>This section refers specifically to data sharing and exchange.  I have outlined my concerns and those of the Fine Gael Party with this element of the Bill given that, following its enactment, the local authority will have the authority to share information and data with relevant bodies.  The Bill refers to the Private Residential Tenancies Board as a relevant body.  I outlined earlier my concerns and those of the joint committee with regard to the operation of the PRTB.  Ultimately, it is the State body charged with the important function of registration of rental accommodation in the private sector.  With the information gleaned from the members of that board and the other bodies at yesterday&rsquo;s meeting of the joint committee, it is clear this board is not working in the most efficient manner possible.  The opposite is the case.</P>
        <P>I seek clarification from the Minister on this point.  The committee meeting yesterday was told that more than &euro;10 million which has been accumulated from private accommodation registrations by the PRTB is sitting in a bank account waiting to be transferred to local authorities.  We spoke about empowering local authorities.  Local authorities are empowered and have the obligation to inspect private rented accommodation and, where standards are not kept, they have enforcement powers in that regard.  If &euro;10 million is sitting in the PRTB bank account, and the Minister might enlighten me as to how long it has been there, it is a clear breakdown in how our State bodies should operate.</P>
        <P>Local authorities are not getting the funding that has already been allocated and collected for them.  As I said earlier, four sevenths of the &euro;70 registration charge is retained by the PRTB for its own administration and running costs and three sevenths is ring-fenced and allocated for local authorities.  This is an area that needs to be examined.  Under the Bill, we will depend on the information coming from agencies such as the PRTB.  The breakdowns are already happening and the required efficiencies are not in place.  The PRTB has been in operation for more than four years and while one would always allow for teething and functional problems to work themselves out initially, after four years one would think they would not cause barriers to the functioning of the board.  Has the Minister been notified that this amount of money is sitting in a bank account?  What action does he and his Department intend to take in this regard?</P>
        <P>A more serious problem with regard to the Bill concerns the data and information collected by the PRTB with regard to private rental accommodation.  Local authorities will depend greatly on the initial set-up of that database of information.  The Minister said earlier the PRTB has this information but the point is that it is processing it manually.  When it was first set up, the PRTB had just eight staff but this has risen to 40 and it has taken on an additional 26 staff from agencies to manually go through the registration forms because the law precludes it from using the on-line system the Minister intends to use under this Bill.  The PRTB cannot use a system similar to the motor tax system, where a person can register on-line, because it needs a change in legislation to allow it to do this.</P>
        <P>Clearly, there is a lack of efficiency and certain areas need urgent attention.  My concern is that there is already a backlog of people trying to register with the PRTB, yet we are now to require local authorities to contact the PRTB and to have them transfer information from it to them, which will add to existing problems.</P><Col N="548"/>
        <P>I was amazed to find that after four years in existence, the PRTB does not have a modern IT system to manage its registration system and database and does not have an IT system to case manage the many disputes and complaints it receives.  The earliest it can deliver such a system, I am told, is mid-2010 and a strategy for this was only adopted in October 2008.  Therefore, it will take two years to deliver the computer system and by the time it matches up with the local authorities&rsquo; system in an effort to support this collection system, there will be more backlogs and more problems in the operations of these two arms of the State.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>It is a shame we have a State body in that predicament.  If the Minister is looking for efficiencies, this is one area he could certainly try to improve.  It is Fine Gael policy to try to wind down the PRTB and merge it with other bodies in an effort to make it more efficient and help it address the problems it is experiencing.  The PRTB is taken up in dealing with dispute resolution of private rental accommodation cases which will often apply to the people on this register.  It is taking up to 18 months to resolve disputes.  In its corporate plan the board set a target of between five and six months such that the time it takes is three times that estimated for resolving disputes.  The people appointed to adjudicate on disputes are selected from a panel.  Until recently they dealt with only one case per day but they are now being asked to deal with three cases per day.  I understand they are co-operating with this request which I consider a very good thing given that they receive more than &euro;600 per day for their services.

    <Title>Unemployment Levels: Motion. </Title>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Calleary, on his first appearance in the Seanad.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I move:</P>
        <P LI="1">That Seanad &Eacute;ireann supports measures aimed at slowing and ultimately reversing the increases in the rate of unemployment, measures such as preventing job losses, redirecting the unemployed towards reskilling and further education and stemming long-term unemployment through subsidy measures to help with reintegrating them into the workforce.  The economic indicators during an economic downturn are subject to scrutiny more than in any other period.  Every time a set of indicators are released, and we have seen several in the past few days, most particularly yesterday with those from the Central Statistics Office, we look at aspects such as the rate of inflation, gross domestic product, gross national product, the level of debt in the country and the bank lending rate but I argue that the statistic to which we should pay most attention, particularly in this period of economic readjustment, is the rate of unemployment.  We have come through a period in which employment numbers have increased markedly.  The workforce increased from approximately 1.2 million to over 2 million, and has seen a decrease in recent months.  There are several factors in regard to that, many of which relate to collapses in the economy, particularly in the amount of employment provided by the construction sector, on which we have learned we were far too reliant in our most recent period of economic prosperity.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This motion is an attempt to encourage all sides in the House to recognise the nature of this problem and discuss the methods needed to counteract it.  I welcome the statement by the Leader of the Opposition in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann yesterday about his willingness to act in a collegiate way on it but I do not see much evidence of that in the amendment to the motion, which is more partisan than I would have liked but I will address that later.</P>
        <P>My fear in regard to unemployment is that as a country we must avoid the mistakes of the 1980s in particular.  The 1980s were the time of my generation.  I finished full-time education in 1983.  I subsequently went back to education part-time to do another course but for me the period between 1983 and 1989, when I got my first full-time job at the age of 26, consisted of periods of unemployment and, more particularly, employment schemes administered by a number of agencies.  In the middle of that decade there were no less than four bodies responsible for redeployment and training of the workforce.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The first job placement I received was from the then National Manpower Service for which I received IR&pound;30 a week, having come off unemployment assistance at IR&pound;33 a week.  Other <Col N="550"/>agencies subsequently were involved in a myriad of schemes including teamwork, the social employment scheme, the community employment scheme with bodies like the Youth Employment Agency, what was then AnCO, the three bodies that merged into F&Aacute;S and a fourth body which I did not have personal experience of but for which I ended up working subsequently, namely, the National Rehabilitation Board, which also merged with F&Aacute;S subsequently.  That merger was a mistake because there is always a need for a particular employment response for people with disabilities.  The nature of those schemes had two effects, namely, to help with the unemployment figures but, more important, to give the participants a sense of self-worth and a curriculum vitae that would allow them compete in a more competitive workforce when the time came to do so.</P>
        <P>We are at such a time again and the first rule of thumb should be that where jobs exist they should be protected.  Whether they should be protected in all circumstances is a matter for legitimate political debate.  When I was entering my early 20s there was a State agency called Foir Teoranta which existed to provide capital for companies to allow them continue in operation and keep their workforces employed.  Its rule of thumb was to provide such capital always, regardless of whether such companies were viable or had long-term sustainability.  That was the wrong approach but we are in a period where many viable companies are experiencing cash flow difficulties and the problems with the banks are adding to that.  There is a need for various measures, whether it is direct Government subvention or funds available through the European Union to make such capital available now to protect existing jobs in the future.  That must be done for several reasons, not only to stop the increase in the numbers of unemployed but to keep the value of the experience that exists in such companies experiencing difficulties.  My colleague will refer to approaches in other European Union member states and how we can learn from that experience.</P>
        <P>The other aspect is to provide money for retraining and redeployment.  The Government&rsquo;s efforts in that regard are starting to take effect.  The announcement last week about 2,500 places for long-term unemployed people to re-enter the education system is welcome.  It could be argued that it is too small-scale, that it is just a start and that we must do this on a far larger scale but we are not only entering a period where the economy is experiencing a massive readjustment but where the new economy we will enter into subsequently will require a whole different skills set.  That will require a degree of investment that we must address collectively in the political system.</P>
        <P>The final element in terms of maintaining jobs is that we must redefine work.  My recollection of the 1980s is the soullessness of unemployment, going to the unemployment exchange and later having the money paid through a local post office and while that diminished a person&rsquo;s worth as an individual, it did not offer any incentive to engage in other activity that did not have a direct economic value but had a value for society.</P>
        <P>In addition to an economic approach we also need a social approach to give incentives to people either by way of particular incentives or additional payments through the social welfare system for work being done in the local community in the voluntary sense in particular, whether in providing particular types of social work or working with sporting organisations because there is an unacceptably large mass of people who are capable of providing great worth in our society and whose values as individuals are not being utilised to the fullest extent.</P>
        <P>We must also recognise where we stand as an economy with other countries in terms of unemployment.  The most obvious example of a more troubled country is Spain.  Its economic collapse is similar to ours in that it had a huge reliance on property also but its level of unemployment is now over 4 million, which is 20% of its workforce.</P><Col N="551"/>
        <P>We can even look at those countries that have a more strategic approach towards protecting work such as Germany.  The statistics mentioned this week alone show an increase in unemployment in Germany to<b> </b>8.3%.  That country already has strong social protection measures in place which encourage its workers in difficulty to have tripartite arrangements among unions, employers and government to keep jobs in place, either by way of less work time or reduced wages until economic difficulties are overcome.</P>
        <P>The purpose of the motion is to try to get across the message that we must first recognise the scale of our problem, work in a collective way to deal with it and use the potential, which is a difficult word to use in the context of such a large group of people, in making sure the mistakes made previously, particularly in the 1980s, are not repeated.  It is a clich&eacute; that history is repeated and we never seem to learn from it but we are in a better position now in that we have achieved higher levels of economic wealth and even though that wealth has been markedly reduced in the past 18 months it is still a level of prosperity that as a country we have never experienced previously and which is still far higher than our previous periods of economic downfall.  I hope the statement made by the Leader of the Opposition in the D&aacute;il yesterday was made on those terms.</P>
        <P>To return to the amendment, I would like to hear from those who will speak to the motion shortly the reason they framed an amendment that seems to mirror their own jobs document.  The magic figure of 100,000 jobs is repeated like a mantra as if by doing that it will happen.  The seriousness of the current position means we must offer people real prospects in terms of what needs to be done, how it can be done and when it will be done.  Simply repeating the figure of 100,000 jobs does not mean it will happen.  I would be more encouraged if political parties published documents relating to employment potential promising 63,594 jobs.  The whole idea of magic numbers adds to people&rsquo;s cynicism about politics and public life and politics&rsquo; ability to tackle real problems.</P>
        <P>The statement made by the Leader of the Opposition yesterday contained a realisation that our current difficulties cannot be dealt with by the normal mechanisms.  If the Green approach to economics and politics is different from that of other political parties it is because it is based on a consensual model.  Others may, cynically, ask what we are doing in Government and why we divide this House on a regular basis.  The people voted as they did in the 2007 election in an era of full employment when all political parties promised continuing economic growth.  We are now in a totally different position.  We recognise and acknowledge this problem and seek common approaches to it.  That is the level of honesty which people expect of all of us in public life.</P>
        <P>Because I was born in the United States, I had an opportunity in the 1980s to emigrate.  I chose not to take that opportunity although most of my generation did so.  These days, others do not have that option because we live in an international recession where such opportunities do not exist.  We cannot expect other people to solve our social, economic and political problems.  This is a problem we can only solve now, here and with our own resources.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DeirdredeBurca"><NameTxt>Senator D&eacute;irdre de B&uacute;rca</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State and second the motion proposed by my colleague, Senator Dan Boyle.</P>
        <P>This motion addresses the growing challenge of unemployment facing the country.  We are all aware that the global community is grappling with an economic and financial crisis but that we have our own domestic strain of that crisis.  We face an uncertain future and it is clear that growing levels of unemployment will be one of the major challenges for this and future Governments.  If the unemployment trend continues we will see greater pressure on welfare systems and growing levels of social unrest throughout the European Union.  That is unde<Col N="552"/>niable.  It is imperative that, as policy makers and as members of Government, we give the growing unemployment levels top political priority.</P>
        <P>I propose to look at initiatives taken by the governments of five other member states, Spain, France, Germany, Austria and Denmark, to see what we can learn and rapidly implement in Ireland.</P>
        <P>In Spain there has been the same kind of collapse in the construction industry as we have experienced.  This downturn has been responded to through increasing public building programmes, initiating energy efficiency programmes such as retrofitting housing and providing land for public building purposes.  Some 80 measures were introduced to improve employment between 2008 and 2009 and there have been different extensions to unemployment benefit.  A local investment fund worth &euro;8 billion and a special fund for the promotion of the economy and employment worth &euro;3 billion have been established.  Of them, &euro;500 million is dedicated to environmental projects, &euro;500 million for research and development and &euro;400 million to upgrade police and civil guard stations.  The Spanish Government has also allowed local governments to increase their permitted budget deficits from 0.05% of GDP to 0.5% of GDP, thus facilitating the injecting of a further &euro;5.8 billion into the economy.  A royal decree extended benefits to workers in special situations.  Those temporarily laid off will be able to collect unemployment benefit, subsidies will be provided for companies which hire an unemployed person, as well as lower social security payments for companies which reduce employees&rsquo; working hours instead of dismissing employees.  Incentives will also be provided by the Spanish Government to companies which hire workers on a part-time basis, as the incidence of part-time work is still low in Spain.</P>
        <P>In France, &euro;11.4 billion has been allocated to reimburse companies in order to improve their capital and cash situation and to give them the resources they need to invest.  This includes the early reimbursement of the research tax credit or value added tax from the start of 2009.  The State will invest an additional &euro;11.1 billion in a public investment programme which will include support for housing, with a two-fold increase in zero interest rate loan amounts, in addition to welfare support.  A total of &euro;4 billion will be invested by large public companies to modernise and develop the railway and energy infrastructure and the postal services.  In addition, President Sarkozy has taken up a trade union proposal and announced the creation of a social investment fund which could allocate up to &euro;3 billion for employment and vocational training.</P>
        <P>In Germany, among the new policy measures adopted is the Pact for Employment and Stability in Germany: Safeguarding Jobs, Strengthening the Forces of Growth and Modernising the Country.  A supplementary budget was also adopted to implement the pact.  The focus is on safeguarding jobs and businesses&rsquo; capacity to invest.  The measures will markedly increase investment in future oriented sectors, with educational infrastructure at the forefront.  It is also intended to supply credit to healthy competitive companies and further empower the workforce to gain qualifications.  The total volume of the package of measures in the German public sector budgets in 2009 and 2010 will be almost &euro;50 billion.  Together with steps adopted in 2008, this represents total funding of approximately &euro;80 billion to support the economy.  Financial assistance has been provided by the L&auml;nder with particular focus on educational infrastructure, especially nurseries, schools and universities which make up two thirds of overall planned expenditure, and other infrastructure, particularly hospitals, urban development and information technology.  A &euro;100 billion programme of loans and credit guarantees will be implemented by expanding existing measures directed at small and medium enterprises and introducing a comparable loan programme for larger companies.  The funding available to support small and medium enterprises and research and development projects will be extended in 2009 and 2010 with about &euro;450 million in additional funding being provided per annum.  The <Col N="553"/>spread of broadband networks will be accelerated, guided by a comprehensive broadband strategy.  Extra funds of approximately &euro;2.5 billion will be provided by the German Government for activation, support and training measures for jobseekers, as well as short-time and agency workers, and 5,000 additional posts will be created at federal employment agency offices to improve placement of and provision of support to jobseekers.  Income tax will be reduced.  The statutory health insurance contributions paid in equal parts by employers and employees will be lowered.  At the same time, a sustainable fiscal policy and a budget rule to put consolidation back on track has been adopted by the German Government, which will mean that new legislation on the lines of the EU Stability and Growth Pact will be adopted to impose a constitutional limit on net borrowing.</P>
        <P>In Austria, the short-time working rules have been amended.  In 2009, the Austrian Parliament endorsed an amendment to the short-time working rules with the aim of making them more flexible.  This is due to a continuously growing demand by employers for short-term working arrangements to cope with the current economic downturn.  Employers and trade unions have largely welcomed the decision.  Under short-time working arrangements, working hours may range from at least 10% to a maximum of 90% of normal working hours.  The introduction of a new short-time working scheme in combination with further training allows employers to receive a special training subsidy if they offer their employees, during the hours not worked, training course intended to improve workers&rsquo; future employability in the labour market.</P>
        <P>In Denmark, the practice of work sharing is growing extensively to help to mitigate the significant increase in redundancy during 2009 arising from the economic recession.  The priorities for the Danish Government are enabling faster access to further training by increasing the funds available, establishing a national alert system to offer support as early as possible, increasing the monitoring of the labour market&rsquo;s development and introducing more flexible rules regarding work sharing arrangements.</P>
        <P>The challenge at European Union level is to start examining how the European economy can be strengthened in a way that will increase job creation across all the member states.  It is a little misleading to speak about a European economy at present because what we have is a Single Market with a collection of individual, national economies.  The concentration at political level now must be on European-wide measures that will stimulate infrastructural projects of a scale that will have job creation benefits for all member states.  My colleagues in the European Parliament have called for an EU-wide stimulus programme, a green new deal, to make &euro;500 billion available over a period of five to ten years from both public and private sources.  They have large, ambitious infrastructural projects in mind such as an EU-wide electricity grid and an offshore wind farm stretching from the North Sea to the Iberian peninsula.  This is the way we should be thinking but political will across all member states is required, particularly in the member states whose economies are stronger and who will probably have to carry some of the weaker economies.  We should be working at European level to promote that type of approach so a genuinely stronger European economy can emerge that will deliver much greater benefits to European citizens in terms of addressing the challenge of unemployment.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CiaranCannon"><NameTxt>Senator Ciaran Cannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
        <P LI="1">To delete all words after &ldquo;Seanad &Eacute;ireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
        <P LI="1">&ldquo;notes the limited job subsidy proposal put forward by Government will have little impact on Ireland&rsquo;s labour force and recommends a suite of job creation and protection packages such as PRSI breaks for new employees, a lower rate of VAT, the abolition of the damaging <Col N="554"/>travel tax and the implementation of a modern infrastructure investment stimulus package to create 100,000 jobs over the next four years.&rdquo;</P>
        <P FLI="0">I thank my colleagues in the Green Party for putting forward this motion.  It gives Members a valuable opportunity to debate and discuss what is undoubtedly the biggest challenge ever faced in this country.  Senator Dan Boyle asked that we approach this in a collegiate manner, but I challenge him to cite a single instance in the past year where the Government has taken on even one suggestion made by the Opposition and implemented it.</P>
        <P>Unemployment is a terrible blight on our society.  It saps morale and erodes the dignity of our people.  However, Ireland has managed to cultivate a unique version of this blight and it will be extremely difficult to eradicate.  There are now almost 420,000 people unemployed and that rate of almost 12% compares quite badly with other countries.  Senator Dan Boyle referred to Spain and Germany as being slightly worse off than this country but in the UK unemployment is heading towards 8% while in New Zealand, a country with similar circumstances to Ireland&rsquo;s, it is hovering between 5% and 6%.  The CSO figures produced today show that the number of people signing on in June was almost 90% higher than in the same month last year, the biggest increase since records began in 1965.</P>
        <P>Of course, every reasonable person would have to agree with the central tenet of the Green Party motion, the urgent need to implement measures aimed at slowing and reversing unemployment.  Our economy is in freefall but where is the urgency in the Government&rsquo;s efforts to stem the jobs haemorrhage?  The alarm bells were ringing loud and clear in March last year when unemployment reached levels not seen since September 1999.  However, it was 15 months before there was any concrete proposal from the Government to intervene in the crisis.  Two budgets were introduced and a panicking Government could only offer unimaginative tax hikes and a new VAT rate that drove shoppers north of the Border, wiped out even more jobs and left us down &euro;700 million in VAT revenue.</P>
        <P>Senator Dan Boyle referred to the 1980s and spoke of how he does not wish to revisit them &mdash; none of us does.  My mother is a teacher and I recall her coming home from work, opening her pay and being utterly distraught and, at times, moved to tears by the punitive tax rates.  We are beginning to head in that direction again and we must be careful in that regard.</P>
        <P>On 24 June the penny finally dropped and, with much fanfare, we heard the half-hearted proposal to perhaps spend up to &euro;1 billion on a jobs protection scheme.  A week later, another 800 jobs are gone and there are no further details of the proposal, no specifics of any kind and certainly no mechanism in place to assist employers in retaining workers.  Contrast this inaction and paucity of ideas on the part of the Government with the many initiatives suggested by Fine Gael in recent months.  Fine Gael recognises, for example, the immense difficulties being faced by our small to medium sized enterprises, the backbone of our economy, which employ 800,000 people.  These businesses need real and tangible support measures that can be implemented immediately.</P>
        <P>Last year, Fine Gael proposed that employers who take on additional employees should be exempt from paying employer&rsquo;s PRSI for at least two years.  With job losses set to continue, we now suggest that an employer who takes somebody off the dole and into a new job be able to claim a wage subsidy.  This would be worth &euro;6,000 and would be paid over two years.  The wage subsidy would work in the same way as a PRSI exemption but would give employers more flexibility by allowing them to front-load the benefit.</P>
        <P>It has long been recognised that the Government is the main culprit in driving up business costs.  Central Government, local authorities, Government agencies and regulators have increased the administrative burden and increased charges, levies and taxes much faster than <Col N="555"/>the rate of inflation.  Businesses have been hit hard by rising fuel and utility costs, rising labour costs, increased local authority rates and charges for refuse and water.  For decades, local authorities used the rate of inflation as a benchmark for increases in local authority rates.  Ireland is now experiencing deflation, yet no local authority has cut rates.  Fine Gael proposes to freeze all Government charges that apply to business and to freeze local authority rates for five years.</P>
        <P>The cost of electricity to Irish businesses is the second highest in Europe, according to EUROSTAT, and gas costs considerably more here than it does in the United Kingdom, the place from where we purchase most of our gas.  These high operating costs deter energy intensive companies from investing in Ireland.  Last year, an IDA Ireland business attitude survey reported that businesses in Ireland found energy costs a significant negative in operating in this country.  With all this knowledge available, the Government has dragged its heels in reducing energy costs and its regulatory system for energy is deeply flawed.  The time has come to radically reform this system.  First, there should be an immediate review of electricity and gas prices.  The Commission for Energy Regulation has indicated that energy prices will be reduced in October.  We will be haemorrhaging jobs from now until then at the rate of between 800 and 1,000 per week.  If that is the position, why can energy prices not be reduced now?  By October it might be too late for many businesses.  Instead of fixing prices, the commission should set a price ceiling and let real and healthy competition occur in our energy market.</P>
        <P>On Friday, 13 March, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, finally admitted that the recent VAT increase was a major mistake and that it had cost this country &euro;700 million in lost revenue.  Some weeks earlier his colleague, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Mary Coughlan, had described the increase as &ldquo;a total disaster&rdquo;.  While this newfound honesty from Fianna F&aacute;il is to be welcomed, it still remains a mystery why the Government has refused to reverse that VAT increase.  In our recent pre-budget document, Fine Gael proposed to reduce the higher rate of VAT from 21.5% to 21% and the lower rate from 13.5% to 10%.  Was there a two-way street or collegiate approach?  No, that measure was not taken on board.</P>
        <P>Tourism in Ireland is worth approximately 4% of GNP per annum.  Receipts from overseas visitors now top over &euro;4 billion per annum.  In January this year the CSO published new statistics on tourism numbers.  They were very stark reading.  In the year to November 2008, 156,000 fewer British visitors came to Ireland and 63,000 fewer visitors came from the US and Canada.  There were 12% fewer trips to Ireland in November 2008 compared to the same month in 2007.  How did the Government confront the challenge of dwindling tourist numbers?  It imposed a &euro;10 travel tax on everybody visiting the country.  How did other countries react to decreasing tourist numbers?  Belgium scrapped its travel tax, Greece reduced its regional airport charges to zero, Holland repealed its &euro;12 per head tax and Spain announced a zero rate of airport tax for every airline that maintained its current level of traffic.</P>
        <P>This is an enormous opportunity and challenge for Ireland.  Growth in electronically delivered services across advanced telecommunications networks will dramatically outstrip growth in traditional trade in manufactured goods and agriculture.  Every goal that Fine Gael has outlined in recent months is achievable.  This country needs a long-term vision, a vision the Government seems to be incapable of producing.  The Irish people will only react to real movement on the part of the Government.  Life happens at the level of events, not of words, and the time for talking is over.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment.  In many of his contributions Senator Boyle asks for co-operation from this side of the House as if, in some way, we had the solution for the Government.  The problem with the Government is that it clearly has not accepted the damage it has done to the economy or people&rsquo;s lives or that the solutions lie within itself.</P><Col N="556"/>
        <P>We might consider a standard family income of &euro;50,000 to &euro;60,000 and the changes such a family has seen and will see with increased taxes, income and pension levies.  If its members work in the public service they have had a public service levy.  They will see increased VAT and there will even be levies on their VHI payments when legislation now going through the House is passed tomorrow.  In the future there will be property taxes and changes to the children&rsquo;s allowance, a significant matter for middle class families who pay large mortgages, car loans and possibly credit card loans.  They may have been living beyond their means just as this Government did but they have to do something serious about it.  The Government, on the other hand, is doing nothing about it.</P>
        <P>These conditions apply to everybody but it is among the middle class that the majority of floating voters are found and Fianna F&aacute;il constantly looks to its vote.  The middle class feels it has been crucified by the toxic trio of Government policy, exuberant bankers and developers who were looking to make the fastest possible buck.  It is all gone now and the economy is in a mess.</P>
        <P>Senator Boyle should stop lecturing us about what we will do and what policies we will come up with because it is becoming repetitive.  The Government is failing to do its job.  I shall spell it out for the Senator and have said as much before.  He and his party are partners in Government.  The local elections showed that the Green Party and Fianna F&aacute;il are damned if they do and damned if they do not.  They are damned if they make hard decisions and damned if they make no such decisions.  Up to how, however, they have not made any decisions of any consequence and the country is not improving.</P>
        <P>The Senator knows the deficit in public finances is in a mess.  He knows many of the problems which need to be corrected have only been touched upon.  He spoke about an bord snip nua which even Ministers have said they will think about over the summer.  However, they will not have any discussion with members of the Opposition on whether these decisions are good or bad.  The Government has run the country for the past couple of decades almost in secret.  It decides that everything that happens is its responsibility and must fall to its decision.  When matters were going well it was happy enough to take all the credit.  Matters are not going well any longer and are in a complete mess.  Look at the figures.  Unemployment has reached 420,000.  Subtracting what the multinationals take from it, our gross national product has contracted by 12%.  Senator Boyle understands what that means.  It is a disaster.  All the time, our national debt increases by billions.</P>
        <P>We have no sense, however, that the Government sees this as being the kind of crisis Members on this side of the House see it to be.  Members of Government always want us to say what we would do but that is not our job.  When the Government voted to elect Deputy Bertie Ahern as Taoiseach two years ago, it chose as its job to run the country for five years.  It constantly claims this is its mandate but clearly refuses to accept that mandate.  In the way politics is set up in this country, that mandate is such that the Green Party, Fianna F&aacute;il and the few Independent Members they have tagged along with them will be the ones who make these decisions.  They are not making them.</P>
        <P>If it wishes, the Green Party can share that information with us and we will offer our opinion on it but it should stop treating the people stupidly by claiming we are the ones who must come up with the proposals.  If the Government were to call a general election the people would weigh it up in the same way it weighed up the Green Party, Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and the Labour Party prior to the previous general election.  We increased our number of seats by 20.  The Green Party held its own and Fianna F&aacute;il lost seats.  That was an indication that change was coming.  That will matter.</P><Col N="557"/>
        <P>When the Green Party tables motions and when its Members make speeches in this House it should point out clearly what it wants to do in the coming years.  It should encourage its Ministers and coalition partners to publish what is intended to be done with the information from an bord snip nua and then talk to us about the kinds of changes it wishes to make.  All we will see now from Fianna F&aacute;il and the Green Party, apart from a few leaks that will happen over the summer to try to soften up the public, is what will happen on budget day.  That will be like any other budget, kept quiet until the last minute.  All the Members will come into the D&aacute;il Chamber and the budget announcements will be made.  No co-operation will be asked for or expected from the Opposition.  That is the way the country is being run now.</P>
        <P>The Government should focus less on what my party will do or what the Labour Party will do and focus on what it should be doing.  That it does nothing is making an unbelievable difference.  I am sure Senator Boyle understands exactly where this country is going.  He was a Member of the Lower House when I was and he has a fairly good grasp of economic and social policy.  He has a fairly good grasp that every day, with every moment of prevarication and time wasted talking and avoiding making decisions, matters are getting worse.  The reality is we are borrowing &euro;1.5 billion every month.  We will borrow another &euro;3 billion over the summer recess merely to keep the country going as well as watching the tax take continue to decline over the same period.   We will watch people losing their jobs in addition to the 420,000 who have already lost theirs.</P>
        <P>The Government is damned in any case so let it make the decisions.  There is no point in expecting to be thanked politically for making hard decisions.  That never happens.  The Senator knows the history books and knows this never happens when tough decisions are made.  No Government has ever been thanked for making hard decisions, and Fine Gael has been part of five Governments that made tough decisions.  That is a fact of life.  This Government will not be thanked either.  However,  it will be remembered for what it does to the country and if it destroys our economy further.  It may take another ten or 15 years to come out of this recession while Green Party members sit on their hands and look for somebody to blame or to make decisions for them.  That will be the worst legacy for a junior coalition partner to have as it takes the pain for the sins of its senior partners.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Calleary, to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DaraCalleary"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dara Calleary</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for his good wishes and, in his absence, I thank the Leas-Chathaoirleach for his.  I thank Senators Boyle and de B&uacute;rca for giving me the opportunity to speak to the House about the Government&rsquo;s labour market activation policies, which we have adopted and initiated in light of the present very difficult economic circumstances.</P>
        <P>Everybody agrees that the present economic challenge is probably the greatest since the early 1980s. However, we should also acknowledge that the present crisis is being replicated throughout the entire world. We are not the only country to be suffering from the effects already outlined by Senators.  If we look to our neighbours in the European Union  and the United States, we can see that many countries are struggling in the same way as we are.  To overcome our present circumstances, it is vital we continue to pursue appropriate policies to position Ireland and its economy to benefit from the global recovery when it eventually emerges.</P>
        <P Just="Left">One of the key competitive advantages we retain and should talk up is the skills and education level of our labour force which continues to be highly skilled and flexible.  As a Government, we continue to invest in education and training at all levels to ensure we have the skills demanded by our increasingly knowledge-intensive and flexible world economy.</P><Col N="558"/>
        <P>The decisions taken by the Government in the supplementary budget are evidence of our continued commitment to supporting businesses and maintaining and creating a pro-business environment.  The establishment of the enterprise stabilisation fund, which will provide &euro;100 million to support viable but vulnerable firms over this particularly difficult economic period, is one of the central planks of that policy.  Leaving our relatively low tax rates on businesses unchanged and continuing to adopt policies that enable companies to develop in these difficult circumstances are the remaining planks.  I shall outline others later.</P>
        <P>The Government has repeatedly proven itself capable of taking the necessary steps to safeguard our economy.  We will continue to act in the national interest and take decisive action to secure our future prosperity, as we did in the budget and the supplementary budget.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>While we retain many areas of competitive advantage, I acknowledge that the global economic downturn has significant implications for our economy.  This is most evident from the sharp rise in unemployment.  The figures published today show that the numbers on the live register are continuing to increase, with 418,600 persons on the register.  As a public representative, I am aware that people, families and personal stories are being affected.  On examination, however, 16,500 people left the live register in May because they found work.  In the past 12 months, almost 145,000 people left it for this reason.  While we are aware of the negative impacts of unemployment, it is important that we reflect on these figures to show that jobs are still being created in the economy.  The spectre of unemployment, as Senator Boyle mentioned, and the human story are the reasons the Government is determined to do everything in its power to enable those who find themselves unemployed to re-enter employment as soon as possible by providing them with the necessary supports to overcome their present difficulties.</P>
        <P>Given the increasing numbers of people on the register, the Ministers for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Education and Science and Social and Family Affairs are working closely to ensure that appropriate and shared responses are developed and activated.  This has led to the introduction of several new initiatives, including the development of the part-time third level education programme for the unemployed mentioned by Senator Boyle.  Under this programme, 2,500 places will be available.  Another example of a new cross-departmental programme is the work placement programme under F&Aacute;S, to which I will refer later.</P>
        <P>The Government has invested substantial resources in addressing the unemployment problem.  The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment alone is investing &euro;1 billion in the provision of a range of labour force measures that will provide training and work experience opportunities to assist those who have lost their jobs.  This has allowed our Department almost to double the provision of job search, training and work experience activation places available to the unemployed.  In particular, the Department and F&Aacute;S have put in place measures to double the capacity to cater for the rise in live register referrals from the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  The implementation of these measures has increased the annual referral capacity to 147,000 persons this year.  These measures and others represent a significant step in meeting the considerable challenge of supporting the unemployed.</P>
        <P>In a difficult climate such as that which we face, the importance of training and education is vital for everyone.  The impact such opportunities can have for those who are out of work and are seeking to rejoin the labour market cannot be overstated.  To assist individuals through the provision of education and training opportunities, our Department has almost doubled the number of activation training and work experience places provided by F&Aacute;S to 128,000 this year.  This represents a substantial increase on the 66,000 places available at the end of 2008.</P><Col N="559"/>
        <P Just="Left">In the supplementary budget, the Government announced its intention to establish a programme that will provide valuable work experience to individuals who are unemployed and who have had limited experience to date.  The T&aacute;naiste and the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Hanafin, jointly launched the work placement programme.  It will provide 2,000 individuals who have been unemployed with a six-month work experience placement.  Two streams each consist of 1,000 places.  The first stream is for graduates who before this year have attained a full award at level seven or above on the national framework of qualifications and who have been receiving jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance for the past six months.  The second stream is open to all other individuals who have been receiving jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance for the past six months.  Under this stream, 250 places are being ring-fenced for those under 25 years of age.</P>
        <P>As a result of the co-operation and dialogue between the two Departments, the scheme has been innovatively designed to allow participants on both streams to continue to receive their existing social welfare entitlements for their duration on the programme.  F&Aacute;S is administering the programme and is now taking applications from providers and individuals who may be interested in participating.</P>
        <P>Another cohort of the unemployed who require specific support are redundant apprentices.  I am fully aware of the difficult situation in which they find themselves.  Without placements, they would not previously have been able to complete their apprenticeships.  Our Department has introduced a number of specific initiatives to assist up to 3,600 redundant apprentices to complete their studies.  For example, 2,000 apprentices who have been made redundant can progress to the next off-the-job training phase in the education sector without completing their placements.  F&Aacute;S has introduced an employer-based redundant apprentice rotation scheme to provide support for employers to provide on-the-job training to 500 redundant apprentices.  ESB Networks has agreed a programme with F&Aacute;S to provide on-the-job training to 400 eligible redundant electrical apprentices at phases five and seven.  The institutes of technology are also providing an 11-week certified training programme for up to 700 redundant apprentices who have completed their phase four training but where another training opportunity is not currently available to them.</P>
        <P>Support for jobs and those who have lost their jobs must be at the centre of our collective effort.  For this reason, we need to be imaginative and break new ground in intervening to sustain jobs.  Last week, the Government presented proposals to the social partners that focused on measures to prevent job losses.  These included the introduction of a temporary employment subsidy scheme, which aims to help employees retain their jobs and employers to maintain their skilled workforces.  It is proposed that the scheme will be for manufacturing or internationally traded service companies that were not in difficulty on 1 July 2008.  In addition, companies that are to receive the temporary employment subsidy must be judged to be viable entities and capable of growth in the global upturn.  It is proposed that &euro;250 million will be allocated towards this scheme, which should provide support for up to 30,000 employees who would be in danger of losing their jobs without this intervention.</P>
        <P>The Government intends to engage further with the social partners to develop other innovative approaches to maintaining employment, creating new employment and early and active engagement with those out of work, including any lessons arising from implementation of this and the other schemes on which I have given details.  We will continue to explore the possibility of further expanding the range of programmes that are currently available, including those that have existed for a number of years but that I have not mentioned, to ensure we are able to meet the needs of the increasing number of people who are unemployed.  As an economy and a nation, we are in an unprecedented time.  Overcoming our difficult economic problems will require all Members of the House and everyone in society to make a positive contribution so <Col N="560"/>we can determine how best to assist our economic recovery bid in getting those who are on the live register back to work.</P>
        <P>I regret that Senator Twomey has left the Chamber.  Senator Cannon proposed ideas, but Senator Twomey&rsquo;s personal attack on Senator Boyle was not the kind of response that will assist anyone in getting a new job.  The Government will make the necessary difficult decisions over the next few weeks and months and will provide the leadership and example that is necessary to place us firmly on the path to recovery.  During recent campaigns, the other side of the Chamber politically exploited our tough decisions to date.  Nevertheless, we will continue to take those decisions in the best interests of the country and the people.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I will join the debate from a specific angle because it could be a wide debate.  The Minister of State has honourably and honestly put on the record of the House a serious situation, namely, the more than 400,000 people who are unemployed.  It is a catastrophic situation that we would not have contemplated some years ago.  What will our response be?  I will not savage the Government and there will be no personal attacks from me.  I have the greatest regard for Members on the other side, particularly Senator Boyle, who is constructive.</P>
        <P>I want to examine the debate from the point of view of tourism, as it is all I will be able to address in my time.  I will highlight a number of matters that the Minister of State should take up.  Will he do so?  I will start with something that is close to my heart, namely, the College of Catering at Cathal Brugha Street.  I am an admirer of the Dublin Institute of Technology, DIT, and the Cathal Brugha Street college in particular.  We always had the best ingredients &mdash; fish, fowl and meat &mdash; and a wonderful environment, but we made a comprehensive hash out of them because our cooking was so rotten until the college came on the scene.</P>
        <P>There is a degree of academic snobbery in the proposal to reorganise the college.  It is being reorganised to downgrade tourism and split it between other Departments as part of the process of DIT looking for university status.  While I agree that it should have that status, particularly by the time it arrives at the Grangegorman site, what it is doing is dangerous.  The Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism and the Minister for Education and Science should be contacted to ask the governing body of DIT, at a meeting to take place on 15 July, to reconsider the fragmentation of the faculty of tourism and food.  It is proposed to split up the three schools that constitute the faculty of tourism and food, including the school of hospitality, and they are to be moved into different sections.  There will be no coherence or co-ordination.  This looks like the disastrous policy of decentralisation but it is a policy of disintegration.  It is a recipe for incoherence and it will definitely threaten the impact of this remarkable institution on tourism.</P>
        <P>Why is tourism important?  If one considers the World Travel &amp; Tourism Council facts about Ireland, in a report dated March 2009, one will note the contribution of travel and tourism to Irish GDP is expected to rise, even in these difficult circumstances, from 6.5% in 2009 to 6.9% in 2019.  In these awful times, that is significant.  The contribution of tourism to employment in Ireland is expected to rise.  The number employed is anticipated to rise from 122,000 in 2009 to 159,000 in 2019, a ten-year period.  That is a lot of jobs.  The contribution of tourism to economic growth should be considered.</P>
        <P>There is no financial imperative for the fragmentation, nor is there a coherent academic argument therefor.  It will just cause a split.  It would be very good for the Minister to ask that this proposal be reconsidered.  I will be supported in this regard by my valued friend and colleague, Senator Coghlan.  We tabled a motion on this side of the House asking for this to be discussed in detail but I had to raise tourism this evening because it is crucial to employment.  I want the matter examined before the meeting on 15 July.</P><Col N="561"/>
        <P>The Minister should consider a letter in <i>The Irish Times</i> on Bloomsday, 16 June 2009, signed by Darina Allen, Derry Clarke, Richard Corrigan and others.  They know what they are talking about in respect of food and tourism.</P>
        <P>I love the Abbey Theatre and I have ideas on its relocation that I will not elaborate on now but I will refer to an interesting development that concerns it.  Is the Government aware that there is a proposal to close the set design and scenery construction workshops in the theatre and outsource them to the Untied Kingdom?  That is extraordinary.  Thirty jobs are to be lost at our national theatre and handed over to the United Kingdom.  Three reports have been commissioned on this by three professional assessment consultant companies, the first of which is Long Road Productions.  The first line of its report states the theatre should maintain and develop its own scenery workshops.  While there may be some difficulties associated with this and while it would be cheaper to have the work done in the United Kingdom, from where one would obtain superb product, we must ask whether we have no pride in our own talent.  Should we not develop it rather than close the workshops and cause redundancies in a period of so much unemployment?  Closing the workshops puts the Abbey at the mercy of current scenery suppliers and outsourcers in Britain.  This is disastrous.  Why not develop the young talent?  There should be an in-house set building and scenic design workshop of the highest standard.  One way of achieving this is to revisit the idea of apprenticeships.  This is where one can give hope to young people in this area of the arts.</P>
        <P>I was downstairs earlier this afternoon listening to very remarkable people, including former ambassador Ms Mary Whelan from the Department of Foreign Affairs.  She was talking about the impact culture can have on exporting.  If one considers branding, one will realise the Abbey Theatre is known all over the world, as are James Joyce, U2 and Sin&eacute;ad O&rsquo;Connor.  They give us an identification and personality in terms of selling material.  We should concentrate on making the Abbey Theatre an institution that is really iconic, recognised all over the world, and that fosters our own native talent.</P>
        <P>I totally support Fiach MacConghail, the director of the Abbey Theatre.  We are extraordinarily lucky to have a man of such unbounded talent and ideas.  He has, within a limited budget, reorganised the theatre.  He turned it from a barn into a real theatre by way of the wonderful raked auditorium.  I welcome the fact that the Abbey is increasing the number of productions.  That may lead to some difficulties with getting the scenery in on time but, in spite of that, apprenticeships should be reintroduced and endorsed.  We could start designing for other groups, including RTE and independent television production companies.</P>
        <P>When walking down Grafton Street yesterday I was handed a piece of green paper by some workers outside Thomas Cook.  The company is being closed down, yet it just announced profits of &euro;400 million.  Why is it closing down?  Many jobs will be lost and families will be put under strain.  At the same time, the CEO of Thomas Cook, Mr. Manny Fontenla-Novoa, has just given himself a 34% pay rise and a bonus of &euro;7 million.  This is the reward he gives to workers for boosting the company&rsquo;s profits.  He will make 2,000 low-paid workers redundant throughout these islands.  What the company will have to pay to sack the workers is less than one tenth of the CEO&rsquo;s bonus.  It is pulling out of the Republic of Ireland after 120 years.  It would be good if we could contact the company and state it was once reputable and honoured and respected by its customers but that it does not deserve respect for the way it is treating Irish workers.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Kelleher.  I am sorry my constituency colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Calleary, left some moments ago.  I would have been delighted to have the opportunity to welcome him to the House this evening.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I welcome the tabling of this motion by Senators Boyle and de B&uacute;rca because it is very important at this time.  As we all know, due to global recession, there has been a huge rise in the number of people unemployed.  According to the quarterly national household survey, the number of people in employment has fallen to 1,965,600, which represents an annual decrease of 158,000.  This is the first time since 2005 that the number of people in employment has fallen below 2 million.  The sectors of the economy that have experienced the sharpest decline in full-time employment in the past year are the construction industry, which has seen a fall in the order of 77,000, the wholesale and retail trade, the motor vehicle repair sector and industrial sectors.  However, each of these sectors experienced a small increase in the number in part-time employment.</P>
        <P>I am delighted that the Minister of State, Deputy Calleary, stated the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the Department of Education and Science and the Department of Social and Family Affairs are working closely together to ensure appropriate responses to meet the up-skilling needs of those who are losing their jobs or facing uncertain employment prospects.  In his speech, the Minister of State mentioned quite a number of measures the various Departments are adopting.  He referred to training, the employer-based redundant apprentice rotation scheme and new institutes of technology training programmes for 700 redundant apprentices.  An additional 400 places provided in the April budget will increase the number of places on community employment schemes to 22,700 this year.</P>
        <P>The Green Party Senators will be delighted to hear that a company called BioSpark, a newly formed joint venture between Imperative Energy and Sustainable BioPolymers, has announced its intention to invest &euro;40 million in the development of a next-generation bio-processing research, innovation and manufacturing centre in Claremorris, County Mayo.  It will create 180 new high value jobs within the local and regional economy with the realistic potential to grow to 300 jobs within three years.</P>
        <P>Yesterday I attended a meeting of the Oireachtas Sub-committee on Job Creation through the Use of Renewable Energy Resources where Joe O&rsquo;Carroll and Peter Doyle of Imperative Energy gave a very good presentation on how to create employment through renewable energy.  A most interesting debate took place.  I welcome those people coming to do that kind of work because it shows there are initiatives and that the Government is prepared to facilitate and help them.</P>
        <P>The company will have a 20,000 tonne per annum bioprocessing facility in Claremorris, state-of-the-art laboratory facilities for bioprocessing research and innovation and 17 commercial units to house a cluster of related business centres.  This will be of great benefit to south Mayo and east Galway.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Senator Ann Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Kelleher.  I thank the Green Party for tabling this motion.  I am interested in how to deal with the unemployed, address the problem and reverse the trend and prevent job losses.  I will concentrate on the areas in which we can help to re-train, upskill and perhaps send people back to education in the short term while we await the global recovery.  If there are no jobs we do not want people walking around the country, as it were.  We must facilitate them in some way.  I am glad to see that efforts are being made to launch programmes and courses that might fill that gap by training and upskilling people, making them ready for jobs that become available in the next few months.</P><Col N="563"/>
        <P>Many of these young and not so young people are highly skilled and educated.  Very few in the world of work do not have a leaving certificate or have finished education at the age of 14 or 15 with a group certificate or vocational training.  They are all highly educated to cope with job loss.  Therefore, we must help and co-ordinate with them to find a way to match what they have at the moment and how we can re-think their futures.</P>
        <P>I am glad to see that F&Aacute;S has come forward with some plans such as the pilot training schemes for workers on a three-day week.  They have two days off and therefore need some upskilling.  It is a great opportunity for those who have two free days to go into F&Aacute;S.  The programme runs for 52 weeks and will help them to improve their job opportunities, move from one area to another and perhaps change their job style.</P>
        <P>I am also interested in the new programme which the Ministers for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and Social and Family Affairs have launched.  I am glad that they are co-operating on the work placement programme which deals with graduates and those under 25 years of age.  It facilitates those who are highly trained and educated and those under 25 who need to top up their skills.  That is a very important course.</P>

I am glad that day is over and that F&Aacute;S is working with the Irish Vocational Education Association, IVEA, and there will not be duplication.  F&Aacute;S will not in any way complement or duplicate the back-to-education, post-leaving certificate and vocational training opportunities scheme, VTOS, courses.  I am glad to see that opportunities are available.  We have a long way to go but at least we have started and we will reverse the trend so that we will be ready when the global recovery comes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the motion and the amendment and I welcome the Minister of State to the House for the debate.  Holding jobs in the appalling circumstances we are in is vital.  We need a suite of measures such as this amendment recommends and PRSI breaks to enable employers to keep employees and increase their numbers.  The amendment is timely.</P>
        <P>Several tourism interests have been in contact with me and my dear friend and colleague, Senator Norris.  Coming from Killarney I am vitally concerned about the integration of food and tourism.  These are highly important areas for us.  The connection between food and tourism is crucial to employment.  I do not see any sense in fragmenting the faculty of tourism at the Dublin Institute of Technology, DIT, as proposed.  It is important for retaining jobs and, one hopes, creating new ones that we are seen to do everything possible to assist and encourage the industry.  Hoteliers in my part of the world are very concerned and believe this proposal will impact negatively on the area and sector.</P>
        <P>I support Senator Norris&rsquo; proposal that the Ministers for Arts, Sport and Tourism and Education and Science request the governing authority of DIT at its meeting on 15 July to revisit and reconsider the proposed fragmentation of the faculty of tourism and food.  This is a proposal to split up the three schools that constitute the faculty.  The school of hospitality management and tourism will be moved to the business faculty while the schools of culinary arts, food technology, food science and environmental health will be moved to the science faculty.  In <Col N="564"/>doing this the word &ldquo;tourism&rdquo; will be removed from the title of the DIT faculty.  That would be a retrograde step.  This demotes the position of tourism at institute level when global projections state that tourism is one of the sectors with greatest potential for recovery in recessionary times.</P>
        <P>Senator Norris cited the World Travel and Tourism Council facts about Ireland from a report dated March 2009.  I support what he said in that regard.  We believe that the restructuring of DIT is being undertaken in a rushed and poorly considered fashion.  The main objective of the project appears to be the reduction of faculties from six to four by merging engineering and built environment and by fragmenting and eliminating the faculty of tourism and food.  I wish to take the strongest stand I can on this project and I hope the Minister of State will be able to intercede with his colleagues on it.  All we are asking is that the institute would consider the views of experts and organisations in the broad tourism and food sectors and to do so in light of the Government&rsquo;s drive to reinforce the tourism and food sectors.  We believe that the recent decision of the governing authority to ratify the restructuring is contrary to any tourism and hospitality industry view and ignores economic, employment and development facilities policies for Ireland.</P>
        <P>Senator Norris went into greater detail on some aspects and I will not repeat what he stated.  However, it is acknowledged that the tourism industry is well positioned to be at the vanguard of recovery once there is an upturn in the global economy.  Tourism is one of our few indigenous industries and with its quick recovery potential we have no doubt that the currently aligned faculty is well placed to benefit from a future recovery and even to assist the country to plan and prepare for such a recovery.  However, it is felt that the restructuring proposal will seriously hamper the development of a holistic tourism and food industry and in the strongest way possible I put forward those points for consideration.  The Ministers involved can have the desirable effect if they put forward this view, which should be put forward, in the national interest to protect our tourism and food sectors.  This proposal is in conflict with Government policy and it should be reversed to be in line with what is the proper national approach.</P>
        <P>Hoteliers involved in tourism in Killarney and throughout the country feel very strongly about the great training in Cathal Brugha Street and believe that the proposal to fragment it is ludicrous and needs to be reversed.  I urge the Minister of State to use his good influence in this regard.  We are concerned about job protection and job creation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Paddy Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Billy Kelleher.  I thank the Green Party for providing us with the opportunity to say a few words on this topic.  Unemployment represents a serious situation for the entire country as we see the number of people affected rising every week, albeit at a lower level now than was the case a number of months ago.  It is still of concern to the country as we are heading towards 500,000 people on the unemployment register.</P>
        <P>There are a number of areas which we could examine to generate employment.  The Government should further examine the tourism and catering industries as significant jobs could be created in these areas.  The VAT rate on food is particularly high and should be reduced.  The 21.5% VAT rate should also be reduced and this would generate a certain amount of activity in the economy and kick-start it for people to generate jobs.  We also have a concern with regard to the 50,000 to 60,000 graduates leaving college now with nowhere to go and no employment.  Years ago, there was a safety valve in that they could go to England or the United States.  At present, a significant number of students is going to Australia on a backpacker&rsquo;s visa but it seems to be the only safety valve for our people.</P><Col N="565"/>
        <P>Much can be done in the tourism industry in particular.  Deep-sea fishing has not been developed in this country.  We have a significant number of small ports dotted around our coastline and we could have an industry to create and generate a significant number of jobs.</P>
        <P>Quite recently, we saw the hotel industry drop its rates and this is due to pressure from the industry and to a lack of disposable income.  We have also seen a reduction in golfing green fees throughout the country.  The country could become more competitive but the tourist boards and the Government must get together to package the country as a destination for holidaying, not just for golfing but also for activities such as deep-sea fishing.</P>
        <P>Walking represents another possibility.  Northern Spain has particular walks where one can get on and off the trail.  This could be developed around our coastline whereby one could get on the trail in Mayo, Donegal, Galway, Clare or anywhere on the coast.  However, it needs to be pulled together.  A former member of Mayo County Council, Paddy McGuinness, had a provision included in the estimates for Mayo County Council to provide funding for a development officer to develop walks in the county and it is working very well.  A number of walks have been developed in the county.</P>
        <P>Throughout Europe, the walking industry is a big growth area but if anything is being done in this country it is on a very small scale.  We could develop that here.  We have a great climate for walking as it is not too hot.  One may get wet but when walkers are slogging it out the rain does not seem to play a big part for them.  Services must be provided along such routes and we do not have them in place.  We do not have catering facilities all around the coast and we do not have accommodation in some of the remote areas.  The Government, with the tourist boards and local authorities, could develop this and it could be a real growth area.  People could come here for golfing, walking and fishing, and a significant number of jobs could be delivered through this.</P>
        <P>In the short term, the Government should examine the VAT rate.  While the VAT rate on food does not seem very high at 13.5%, it accounts for 13.5% of every euro taken in by the catering industry and it must be considered with the high wages and all the other costs the catering industry has to pay, such as rates, water charges and refuse charges.  On another occasion, we discussed the fact that the industry must pay out to 14 different agencies.  This amounts to an enormous sum and at the heel of the hunt, it is why we are uncompetitive.  We have too many costs.  VAT is the direct responsibility of the Government and it could intervene and help promote and generate growth in the economy.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Billy Kelleher, to the House and wish him well in the Department.  I was there and it is a demanding role, particularly at present.  I commend our colleagues in the Green Party on tabling the motion to highlight the situation.  The timing is very appropriate given the unfortunate announcements today and the number of people who are unemployed.  It is a frightening statistic and we should all do our utmost in a united approach to try to resolve the issue.</P>
        <P>The commitment given by the proposed coalition of Fine Gael and the Labour Party in 2007 stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">Our manifesto commitments are fully costed and affordable in the context of the prudent budgetary assumptions drawn from the most authoritative economic sources.  The Economic and Budgetary Framework agreed with Labour provides for continued government surpluses, and a reduction in net debt to below 7% of GDP by 2012.  Can someone tell me when it discovered things would go as bad as they have gone?  This is the type of myth that has been painted for some time.</P><Col N="566"/>
        <P>I want to put this on the record.  I get tired of statements from Fine Gael that it could foresee the future and knew that there would be such a downturn in the economy.  It went on the basis of the facts and figures we had available to us, no more and no less.  It had the assumptions and proposals and I got the manifesto.  I had a job getting it because it is becoming a very difficult document to find.  It would be easier to get <i>The Da Vinci Code</i>.  It is gone from the Fine Gael website and I am not surprised.  It has been left aside because there is a lot of information in it which Fine Gael would not be able to stand over now.</P>
        <P>I want to be clear that we are all in this together.  In 2007 we were all looking forward to continued growth and development.  I can quote the manifesto line for line and section by section.  It was not far away from the Fianna F&aacute;il and Progressive Democrats manifestos at the time.  Most of the promises are very agreeable because they are all about growth and more money.  It states Fine Gael would cut the standard rate of tax by 2%, from 20% to 18%.  That was definitely an indication that it could foresee the future.  It states Fine Gael would abolish stamp duty for first-time buyers of homes up to &euro;450,000, there would be no stamp duty on homes up to &euro;100,000, a 5% rate on the next &euro;350,000 and a 9% rate on the balance.  I can discuss all of the manifesto and the figures projected at the time of the general election.  They were very attractive.  The amount of money available to spend on day-to-day commitments in 2009 is mentioned.</P>
        <P>The reality is that nobody could see the future at that time.  We are where we are now and we have to try to work our way out of this situation.  I believe in a united approach.  We took hard decisions in 1987.  I was a Minister then and it cost me my seat in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, but we had to pay the price of those  decisions.  At the time Charles Haughey was Taoiseach and Ray MacSharry was Minister for Finance.  We worked together and I have to commend Alan Dukes on the Tallaght strategy.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>We let him down because we did not agree to the Private Members&rsquo; motion in the D&aacute;il at the time on providing funding of &pound;400,000 for haemophilia sufferers.  We should have agreed to it but we did not.  Alan Dukes was very courageous in his approach in that regard and gave us an opportunity to continue with very hard decisions.</P>
        <P>There was a 10% cut across all Departments, including the then Department of Health.  It was very difficult to sustain it.  Now we are where we are.  We need to look at this, not from the point of view of the blame game, but from the realisation that nobody was in a position to foresee what would happen in 2009 and the downturn in the world economy.  We must start with the American situation.  When America gets a cold, we get the flu.  That is a reality of life.  It is a very important trading partner and player in the world economy.  The whole banking industry has fallen apart as a result of that.</P>
        <P>What the Government is doing, as far as banking is concerned, is the only action it could have taken and has taken.  We are very fortunate we had set aside the National Pensions Reserve Fund because only for it we would be in greater difficulty.  That was very prudent and perhaps we should have put more savings into it and set aside more money for a rainy day such as we did not foresee.  That money has kept the banks open and without it we would not be in a position to keep them open.</P>
        <P>We now have to look at the different opportunities we have.  We had more than 2 million people employed, which was a marvellous achievement.  Employment doubled over the past ten years the Government was in power.  We now have to maintain the jobs we have and to try to improve and increase further production.  Enterprise Ireland, the IDA and the Minister <Col N="567"/>of State&rsquo;s Department have a very important role in this regard.  They must ensure we maintain the jobs in the economy.  We have some tremendous employers and multinational and domestic industries in the country that are working very hard and are surviving the recession.</P>
        <P>Boston Scientific in Galway is a massive employer.  Intel and other companies are playing a very important role in Ireland and we have attracted and retained multinational companies as far as we can.  We have to continue the policy of bringing in industry to the country.  We need that support from abroad.  We are located at the gateway to Europe and have a very solid political system which attracts investment.  We have a guaranteed political system with a democratic approach and whatever Government is in power will continue it.  That gives great stability to investors from abroad.</P>
        <P>We must ensure our costs are reduced dramatically.  We have outpriced ourselves and have the highest minimum wage in Europe.  We are not competing with our neighbours in the UK because its structure is completely different and we have overpaid ourselves in every area.  Action is now being taken by the Government to try to reduce national expenditure.</P>
        <P>The Green Party is a tremendous boost because it was looking ahead and could see the future as far as renewables are concerned.  The emphasis on wind and solar energy and a reduction in the imports of fuel are all part of what we can do to build a new economy.  I complement the Green Party on its support and involvement in Government, and also former members of the Progressive Democrats who are part of this Government as well.  One appeal I make to all sides of the House is to come up with constructive proposals on maintaining and creating jobs for the future.  We can and we will work ourselves out of this situation.</P>
        <P>Last week I spoke to the president of the European Bank for Reconstruction.  In 1987, interest rates were 18%, inflation was 18% and unemployment was about 18%.  We worked ourselves out of that situation.  Inflation is nil and interest rates are very low.  Unemployment, unfortunately, is rising.  We have to work together in the Oireachtas for the people of this country to ensure we have a future.  I believe we will have a great future and will work as a team in that regard.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire.  Taca&iacute;m go m&oacute;r leis an r&uacute;n seo &oacute;n gComhaontas Glas mar a thac&oacute;inn le h-aon r&uacute;n agus laghd&uacute; sa r&aacute;ta d&iacute;fhosta&iacute;ochta mar aidhm aige.</P>
        <P>It is very easy to say, and we hear many people saying, that the Government is not doing enough to slow and reverse the increases in the rate of unemployment.  Regardless of whether it is doing enough, it is clear the response to the national economic collapse and the consequent job crisis must be seen to have urgency, focus and a clear sense of direction.  It is one area where style matters almost as much as substance.  It is one thing to have a plan, but it is vital to communicate properly the sense that there is understanding at the highest level of the scale of the crisis, that there is a clear plan to address the challenges we, as a nation, face and that the conviction and the skills to implement the plans exist.</P>
        <P>We need to understand what we are facing.  Ireland, like everywhere else, has been a victim of the global credit crunch.  However, the Irish case has been exacerbated by a property market bubble and reckless lending policies which have brought the banks to the verge of ruin.  The bursting of the property bubble has led, as we all know, to the collapse of employment, not only in the building trade but across the professions, especially those which had become dangerously dependent on the sector.  When one factors in the severe depreciation of sterling <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> the euro, which has made Irish exports to the UK far more expensive, and the obvious unpleasant reality that this hit small, indigenous Irish exporters who are still dependent on the UK as their major market very hard, in short, the Irish economy has been hit by the perfect economic storm.</P><Col N="568"/>
        <P>It is important to grasp not just the sheer size and force of the storm but the speed at which it hit.  All the indications are that the Irish economy fell off a cliff in or around April 2008.  The speed is important because it has meant it has been very difficult for companies to adjust to the rapidly changing business environment and many, as we know, have failed to do so and have gone to the wall.</P>
        <P>The speed with which the crisis came about demands a similar speed in the response of the Government, but it is a political argument as to whether there has been a sufficiently speedy response to date.</P>
        <P>To be fair to the Government, when it has not been back-pedalling following some hastily thought out initiative, it has taken some worthwhile measures.  I welcome recent announcements that the Government will spend &euro;250 million on job protection on a &ldquo;temporary employment subsidy scheme&rdquo;.  However, the job subsidy will only apply to 30,000 workers in the first instance, giving them &euro;200 per week for 15 months.  I also welcome the announcement by the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, that unemployed workers will have access to 2,500 new places on part-time undergraduate and postgraduate courses from September, as part of the Government&rsquo;s efforts to retrain and upskill the labour force.</P>
        <P>I respectfully point out, however, that we are only talking about 2,500 places, at a time when a record 372,800 people are signing on for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit.  While &euro;250 million may sound like a lot of money, when one recalls that the Government spent &euro;220 million on the ill-fated PPARs project, we see it in a different perspective.  One cannot help thinking the Government is applying a sticking plaster to what is a gaping wound.  I do not wish to be mealy-mouthed about it and I commend the Green Party on the focus on education and reskilling in the motion before the House.</P>
        <P>Most commentators have been struck by the fact that the recession is hitting the professions and the middle classes very hard, but what is most remarkable is the impact of the recession on youth unemployment, specifically among young men.  Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Riain, the NUI Maynooth sociologist, recently pointed out that in the latest quarterly national household survey the major trend that stands out is the disastrous collapse in working class employment, with growing differences between the position of those with third level education and those without it.  While employment for those with third level education has remained stable over the past year, the collapse for all others has been in the range of 10% to 20%.  Unemployment has increased for those with third level education, but employment has largely held up.  In plain English, it still pays to have a degree.  While the pain is being felt all around, the sectoral, occupational and educational data point to the particularly disastrous short-term and long-term effects of the recession on those in manual and service occupations.</P>
        <P>In 2008 Tom Boland, the CEO of the HEA, urged young people working in the construction sector, many of whom had left school without a qualification, to think seriously about returning to full-time education.  It is now obvious the issue he identified as a problem has come to pass.  The jobs in construction have indeed disappeared and are very unlikely to return.  Therefore, we need as a matter of urgency to put in place a major scheme to attract and facilitate young people back into full-time education to ensure they have the skills for future employment.  That means a lot more than 2,500 places.  We are talking about multiples of that number if we are to have a realistic impact on the problem.</P>
        <P>Some time ago, Dr. Ronnie O&rsquo;Toole stated that he believed that the downturn in the construction sector would have a far more negative impact on rural Ireland because in many cases the construction sector was the only major employer in the regions.  There is plenty of anecdotal evidence to support this view.  For that reason, we must look not only at providing more edu<Col N="569"/>cational places, but also at putting in some structured form of distance education because one of the major disincentives to taking up full-time education is the cost of renting and living away from home.  If we are really serious about getting large numbers of people to go back to full-time education, we should be looking at new and innovative ways of delivering education to the people where they need it rather than delivering the people to the educational system.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Cuirim f&aacute;ile roimh an Aire St&aacute;it go dt&iacute; an tSeanaid chun an obair th&aacute;bhachtach seo a phl&eacute;.  Molaim P&aacute;irt&iacute; an Chomhaontais Ghlais as an r&uacute;n seo a ard&uacute;.  T&aacute; s&eacute; oiri&uacute;nach an t-&aacute;bhar a ard&uacute; ar an gcl&aacute;r mar is &aacute;bhar t&aacute;bhachtach &eacute;.</P>
        <P>I compliment the Green Party, particularly Senators Dan Boyle and D&eacute;irdre de B&uacute;rca, on putting forward this motion.  It is essential that the Oireachtas, the Government and society generally focus on the issue of unemployment, which is the human downside to the current economic recession.  It is shattering for people who have spent their lives working and who are at a stage in life where they have commitments to their families to find themselves without the resources to meet their commitments.  Like many others here, I am lucky to have gone through life so far without experiencing the blight of unemployment.  In the earlier years of my political life, in the 1970s, I worked at local government level during a period of high unemployment which people found soul-destroying.  The problem was even more acute in the 1980s when we had a very high unemployment rate.  The effect on the unemployed and their families was devastating.</P>
        <P>The Government has been seriously challenged by the rapidity of the global economic downturn and its effects on Ireland.  The downturn is multifaceted in that there is a serious fiscal deficit which commands the attention of Government and a banking crisis which could lead to a total collapse of the economy.  The economy generally and unemployment specifically need increasing attention while we also try to get to grips with the other areas.  As we have learned from past experience, when people become unemployed and are in that position for two or three years, a dependency mentality takes over and people become unemployable.  We must be mindful of that.</P>
        <P>In that regard, I welcome a number of the initiatives taken by the Government in this area, particularly the improved F&Aacute;S employment services.  Hopefully, F&Aacute;S will measure up to the challenge that confronts it and provide job search assistance and training places.  The number of training places has been doubled by the Government.  I understand the number of places has been increased to 128,000 under the F&Aacute;S training initiatives.</P><Col N="570"/>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>The employer-based redundant apprentice rotation was essential.  Many Members would have had representations from people nearing the end of their apprenticeships who were finding it difficult to hold their employment.  It was essential that those who had put in a number of years to pursue a career would be given the opportunity to finish that training.  The training programmes within the institutes and the employment schemes through which we now provide 400 additional places are an important stopgap measure but they also provide the completion of very worthwhile projects to communities.  I know of people who were on such schemes in the past and wished to remain on them when their term finished because it gave them a certain dignity &mdash; the dignity that comes from working and earning one&rsquo;s living.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There are also the placement programmes and the employment retention scheme which was recently announced and which is under discussion with the social partners.  This is important but it is a complicated area.  It is imperative that the application of the scheme, when it is finalised, does not give rise to displacement and that we do not end up creating unfair competition for employers who are struggling at present and who obviously need to operate on a level playing field.  That is not to say I am opposed to this scheme.  There are merits to it but we need to be very careful about how we implement it and, perhaps more important, how we monitor it, particularly how we monitor any downside effects that might arise from it.</P>
        <P>There are other areas to which the Government needs to turn its attention.  In that regard, I am glad the Minister of State, Deputy Kelleher, is present because he is familiar with much of this area, particularly the area of employment regulation.  Over the years, much has been introduced and perhaps imposed in the area of employment regulation, with much of this coming from social partnership.  I would be the first to recognise that we owe much to social partnership.  Particularly in the late 1980s when it was established and when we were in serious economic distress, it was very much a forum for assisting the process of coming through that and laying the foundations for a better economy during the 1990s and particularly in this decade, from which we have benefitted.</P>
        <P>I ask that areas such as the regulatory authorities be examined.  I attended a comhairle ceantair meeting on Monday last.  The Minister of State might be interested to know the proprietor of the premises we were in had received a visit from health and safety officials that day.  While it is right they are doing their job, he told me it was the first time in 30 years he had been visited by anyone from the Health and Safety Authority, which raises some questions.</P>
        <P>The minimum wage will have to be examined.  I am of the view that it is an impediment to employment.  Generally, wages and salaries in our economy are too high and I understand some economists now advising the Government suggest they are too high by a third.  A survey carried out by the University of Glasgow last year also indicated that this is the case.  We need to look at this area because if we do not, the downstream effect will be increased unemployment.  It is better that people have the dignity of work, even if they are working at a lower rate, than that they are unemployed with a notional figure of a minimum wage which is no longer applicable to them simply because employers can not afford to pay it.  We need to be pragmatic in the way we approach this issue.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Social welfare levels are being cited to me as an issue.  I know of employers who are prepared to take on staff but they cannot get them because they would only be marginally better off than they were on social welfare.  We encountered this issue previously and needs to be carefully considered because we do not want abuses to arise.</P>
        <P>All Government policies in the economic area should be proofed against their effects on employment or unemployment, depending on which way one wants to look at it.  This should <Col N="571"/>be the priority in everything we do because the worst possible effect of the economic downturn is unemployment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State and I welcome the motion.  It is only fair to point out that were it not for the fact this side of the House provided two speakers in succession at 6.20 p.m., this debate would have collapsed.  This shows what the Government thinks of the unemployed and unemployment in its dealings in this and the other House.  While we could have played a cynical game and not provided a second speaker at that time, we did not do so.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I come from Waterford city and am one of those in that city who are becoming despondent with the number of job losses we have witnessed.  Only today, Bausch &amp; Lomb, which is still a wonderful company, thank God, has let go another 120 people in addition to those let go earlier this year.  Last week, ABB Transformers let go 178 people and, prior to that, our flagship industry, Waterford Crystal, let go over 600 people.  What policies has the Government implemented to protect the jobs of the people in these industries, in particular in Waterford Crystal?  There was no effort to purchase the brand name and protect manufacturing of this flagship industry in Waterford.  There was no effort to protect the showroom which attracted over 300,000 visitors to Waterford and the south east, and which gave so much employment in the tourism area, including in hotels and many other areas of the hospitality industry.  Cruise ships came to Waterford but many of them have cancelled since the closure of Waterford Crystal&rsquo;s showroom and because of the loss of the expertise.</P>
        <P>This is what is happening in Waterford but the Government is still refusing to upgrade Waterford Institute of Technology to university status, something that all the economic commentators in the region state would be the catalyst to create more jobs within the region.  The Government is stumbling from report to report, saying &ldquo;we will, we won&rsquo;t&rdquo; in regard to having a university in Waterford.  The day before the last general election, a letter from the former Taoiseach was plastered over the local newspapers stating &ldquo;we will upgrade Waterford Institute of Technology to university status&rdquo;.  Where has the promise gone?  A new Minister, another report, more disappointment for the people of Waterford and the south-east region and thousands of jobs gone in the meantime &mdash; that is the legacy of this Government and the last Government.  This Government is probably the worst in the history of the State, although it would be run close by the previous Government, led by the last Taoiseach and the then Minister for Finance, now the Taoiseach.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The limited job proposals that have come out in drip form in the past month are a paltry response to the unemployment we face.  We have an economic and unemployment crisis yet we have a response from the Government that might provide some part-time jobs and 2,500 extra places in education.  That is typical of the response.  Last week, the Minister for Finance said we &ldquo;now&rdquo; have a serious situation with unemployment.  Today, we have 413,000 people on the dole queues.  That is an indictment of the Government and it is absolutely disgraceful.  As someone who spent time in the dole queue at one stage I fully understand how each of these people feels at present and it not only affects these people because their families are affected as well.  However, the Government seems to be in slumber, waking up like Rip Van Winkle and taking the view that only now is there a crisis.  There has been no response.</P>
        <P>Fine Gael has advocated measures for more than one year, including proposed job creation and protection packages such as PRSI breaks for new employees.  However, there has been no response.  This idea would protect in some way some of the employees who have been let go in recent months.  We were asked to produce ideas on this side of the House and we have done so, but they were accepted only months afterwards by which time the damage was done, a greater number of people were in the dole queues and more families were hit by unemploy<Col N="572"/>ment.  Some people concerned about educating their children and sending them to college no longer have that option.  People are concerned about such issues when they are unemployed.  In addition they are concerned about how to pay the mortgage and the loans for the car and whatever else.</P>
        <P>I could say a good deal more on the subject because I was unemployed at one time and only one who has been unemployed at some time can understand the depth of feeling of those on the dole, or those who suddenly find out they have no job, such as the Bausch &amp; Lomb workers this morning.  It is devastating and such people seem to be treated as a number.  However, they are people with feelings, families and commitments, and we should treat them as such and do a great deal more than we are doing at present.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The debate comes at a poignant time given the current economic situation, not only in Ireland but in other parts of the world where jobs are being lost.  I agree with some of the sentiments of Senator Cummins regarding those who are losing their jobs and the difficulties that presents to individuals and families, to which I can relate.  The same situation is occurring in other parts of the country, including Donegal.  In 2001 and 2002 large numbers of jobs were lost in my area.  However, up to 800 of the jobs in the Gaoth Dobhair industrial estate were regained as a result of direct interventions by Government and State agencies.  I believe that Government assistance can help, as I have seen since 2002.</P>
        <P>I wish to lay out several points.  While the Minister of State is in the House I refer to the issue of people becoming redundant and losing their jobs.  Many people seek access to community employment schemes and rural social schemes but are unable to take up those schemes because the numbers are capped.  I understand an additional 400 places are now available under the rural social scheme but we must examine a new scheme to get people off the live register and to allow them to work for the community.  The net cost to the Exchequer would be minimal and I call on this possibility to be considered.</P>
        <P>An issue that causes widespread mayhem to small and medium sized enterprises is banking and the unavailability of access to credit.</P>

	<P>We must tackle this issue.  I recognise the Minister for Finance is doing his utmost to establish NAMA but many SMEs which apply to the local bank manager are told the decision has been removed from the locality and is made in Dublin.  This is not an easy issue with which to deal but if it is not dealt with soon many more SMEs will lay off employees.  We must get tough with the banks in that regard, although they are held to ransom to some extent as well.</P>

	<P>There are two immutable rules in politics, one is that the Opposition will invariably seek to portray things as worse than they are and the other is that the Government, however it is composed, will always seek to claim that things are far better than they are.  Tonight&rsquo;s debate has contained many such examples.  I thank the main Opposition party for its contribution and its provision of five speakers to the debate.  Half way through the <Col N="573"/>debate I was concerned that the time allocated would not be used appropriately, which would have been very surprising given the constant requests on the Order of Business for debates of an economic nature.  While moving the motion my colleague and I were especially conscious this was an opportunity to address a very serious issue and an opportunity to do so in a way in which we hoped would be consensually based and as collegial as possible.  The Government side has contributed seven speakers to the debate, two of whom shared a slot, and the time has been used appropriately.</P>

	<P>I refer to the meat of the contributions made today.  I am especially thankful for the contribution of Senator Mullen who showed himself to be an Seanad&oacute;r&iacute; neamhsple&aacute;ch by giving a very rounded contribution on the nature of unemployment in the country at present and the particular risks of youth unemployment.  He provided appropriate <Col N="574"/>criticisms of Government but also recognised the very difficult economic situation in which we find ourselves.  I found the contribution of Senator Norris equally important in the sense that he identified particular areas of concern, which were also identified by other speakers, including the Leas-Chathaoirleach who, when he had an opportunity to speak, referred to particular sectors such as food and tourism.  Senator Norris mentioned the arts sector in particular and, although it is a small employer, in the times in which we find ourselves it is very important, for the future and to bring about a new economy, to be creative and to bring about creative thinking.</P>
        <P>I thank Senator Cannon for his contribution.  He referred to specific items which must be examined in terms of incentives, whether PRSI holidays for employers or job subsidies, or perhaps going so far as to make the jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit or allowance available to prospective employers for a given time because there would be no cost to the State.  These are points we need to consider in the serious times in which we find ourselves.</P>
        <P>I am also thankful for the contributions made by several of the speakers on the Government side in recognising that we are in a crisis.  The contribution of the Minister of State, Deputy Kelleher, was especially important.  He referred to the contribution of Senator Twomey which I do not think was as personalised as it may read in the record of the House and I would have agreed with him on some points.  However, I am unable to accept the amendment to the motion for the reasons I stated in my earlier contribution and I ask the main Opposition party to consider that.</P>

    <Title>Local Government (Charges) Bill 2009: Committee Stage (Resumed). </Title>
        <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That section 11 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>Before the break I was outlining to the Minister my concerns and those of the Fine Gael Party about the Private Residential Tenancies Board.  I requested clarification from the Minister, if possible, on the &euro;10 million sitting in the bank accounts of the Private Residential Tenancies Board that has not yet been transferred to local authorities to fund their inspections and enforcements.  I raised also the issue of the lack of adequate IT systems to manage registrations and new registrations coming in to the Private Residential Tenancies Board.  That will play a large part in the information on which local authorities will depend to set up their own databases for the administration of charges that will apply under this legislation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In section 11(2)(<i>b</i>) and (<i>c</i>), &ldquo;relevant person&rdquo; means the Electricity Supply Board and the Revenue Commissioners.  My understanding is that under this legislation local authorities can require those agencies to transfer any data or information they may have on their databases that will assist in compiling the database for the administration of these local government charges.  The Minister can correct me if I am wrong but I understand difficulties could arise in this area and that it could be open to legal challenge because as far as I understand it every agency must comply with the Data Protection Acts.  I ask the Minister specifically if his Department has consulted the data protection office regarding this element of the Bill.  If a requirement under this legislation is made of local authorities and a request is made either to the Revenue Commissioners or the ESB for information personal to a householder, I am not sure if that agency will be in a position to give that information but it is stated explicitly in the Bill that they possibly can.</P>
        <P>I point out also that the Electricity Supply Board has been sub-divided as regards supply.  I note from the explanatory memorandum that the reason the Electricity Supply Board is listed as a relevant person is that the Minister can look for usage trends in electricity in regard to its supply but the Electricity Supply Board is sub-divided into various departments and divisions.  I am sure the area the Minister is referring to is ESB Customer Supply, which is responsible for metering, monitoring and registration of usage in particular households.  If that is who the Minister is referring to I suggest he also needs to imply the other suppliers in the independent marketplace such as Bord G&aacute;is, Airtricity and many others because the legislation as drafted does not capture all electricity suppliers in the manner in which the Minister requires it.</P>
        <P>An issue arises around data protection and whether the ESB will supply that information.  If it does, has consideration been given to the fact that the ESB is a semi-State company and a commercial enterprise?  If it is required to give that information, how much will it charge local authorities for providing it?  Has that been considered?</P>
        <P>My understanding of the recent legislation on medical cards is that no data requirement for transfer of information was required from doctors or any health practitioners, yet under this Bill there is a requirement.  How far is the State prepared to go to acquire this information and will we supersede all previous data protection Acts?  The provision of PPS numbers is referred to in paragraph 11(2)(<i>a</i>) &ldquo;in relation to an individual, that individual&rsquo;s personal public service number (within the meaning of section 262 of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005).&rdquo;  I presume this means that the PPS numbers of individuals can be transferred from the Depart<Col N="576"/>ment of Social and Family Affairs to a local authority to ensure its registration database is complete.</P>
        <P>When I was a member of the joint committee which looked at improving efficiencies in the electoral register, the Department of Social and Family Affairs told the joint committee that data protection legislation precluded the Department from providing PPS numbers to third parties or State agencies, in that case the Electoral Commission.  Does the same barrier apply in this instance?  If not, are we creating a precedent for the wider use of PPS numbers by the State, for electoral register or other purposes?</P>
        <P>Questions remain to be answered regarding this Bill, and these are some which I feel require further clarification.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Paddy Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>The Bill provides for the trading of information between local authorities and the Revenue Commissioners.  The Revenue Commissioners might request information from a local authority regarding all owners of second homes in the local authority area.  The local authority is then obliged to provide the Revenue Commissioners with a list of properties owned by people within its area.  </P>
        <P>A local authority may also ask the Revenue Commissioners for any notice of assessment made against individuals who have properties or second properties in its jurisdiction.  That is a fierce invasion of a person&rsquo;s privacy.  We are giving a major power to local authorities.  Individuals have a right to keep their dealings with the Revenue Commissioners private.  This section appears to allow such information to be given to a local authority.  Thus, information about individuals, who may or may not own second homes, will be made public.  An individual may have recently disposed of a second home or may not have one at the time the information is sought.  I ask the Minister to clarify this matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the term &ldquo;relevant person&rdquo; include community welfare officers, who administer the rent allowance scheme in many instances?  I am sure local authorities would need information from community welfare officers regarding landlords and so on.  If this is so, the term &ldquo;relevant person&rdquo; should include community welfare officers.  Are they covered by data protection legislation?  Community welfare officers and officials of the Department of Social and Family Affairs will not give information to public representatives and officials of local authorities.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I assure Senators that I have looked at all these issues and I am assured, by the Attorney General and others, that I am not overstepping the mark with regard to invasion of privacy, etc.  I will answer the points raised one by one.  First, for Senator Coffey&rsquo;s information, I will read part of a letter from the Private Residential Tenancies Board:</P>
        <P LI="1">Significantly increased resources are being provided to local authorities for inspection purposes and funding more than doubled between 2005 and 2008, rising from &euro;1.5 million to &euro;4 million.  Funding will be maintained at this level for 2009, bringing funding allocations for this purpose since 2004 to &euro;15 million.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The letter sets out the number of inspections carried out and the PRTB registrations.  I will pass the letter to Senator Coffey.  It is clear that funding has increased significantly from 2005 to 2008.  The letter also states:</P>
        <P LI="1">The payment to the local authorities of their portion of the income stream is dependent on levels of inspection performance by those authorities and while that has increased over <Col N="577"/>the years, unused surplus funds are held by the PRTB in a fiduciary capacity for the local authorities.  By the end of 2008, that accumulated fund was in the region of &euro;9 million and it is currently estimated to be in the region of &euro;10 million.</P>
        <P LI="1">This provides a strong platform from which to fund more onerous inspection activities, in light of the new rented accommodation standards regulations. [Those new regulations were introduced in February 2009 and I think Senator Coffey will agree they were necessary.]  These regulations set down a more rigorous set of minimum standards, most of which have immediate effect.  However, those elements having cost intensive implications for landlords must be addressed by them within a four year window concluding on 1 February 2013.</P>
        <P LI="1">Conscious of the need to reduce this accumulated fund and aiming to move the PRTB to a more self-sufficient financial standing, the disbursement ratio referred to above was readjusted on 1 April 2009.  Over a number of years, as inspections activity continues and increases, the accumulated fund will be run down.</P>
        <P LI="1">The Department will continue to monitor the situation taking the long-term funding requirements of the PRTB into account and further adjustments to the registration fee income disbursement ratio will be made as deemed necessary.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I am happy to give Senator Coffey the full reply &mdash; I read only part of it &mdash; as I know the Senator has an interest in this matter.</P>
        <P>I will try to recall some of the issues raised.  Senator Cummins asked about community welfare officers.  It was not necessary to include a reference to community welfare officers because we are already dealing with the PRTB, which has access to that information.</P>
        <P>In reply to Senator Burke, local authorities will only have access to information relevant under the legislation.  They will not pry into people&rsquo;s other affairs.  I assure Senator Burke of that.</P>
        <P>Senator Coffey asked if we are covering all bases when we deal with the PRTB and the ESB and whether there are other sub-groups which should be included.  The advice of the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources is that all bases are covered by the legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank the Minister for his clarifications.  However, he has not answered my question.  Has the Department consulted the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner regarding the provisions of the Bill?  The legislation will require data held by agencies &mdash; State, semi-State and others &mdash; to be shared.  The ESB, for example, is now divided between ESB Networks and ESB supply.  Data protection legislation precludes the transfer of information between those two ESB divisions.  That is because of the open market in the supply of electricity.  I do not believe the legislation covers all bases.  The explanatory memorandum explains that information from the ESB is included to measure electricity usage in holiday homes and other homes used as second dwellings.  Many such houses can now be supplied by suppliers other than the ESB, which are not included in the legislation.  That base is not covered.</P>
        <P>I would like to hear more about the Data Protection Acts.  Has the Minister consulted the Data Protection Commissioner?  Does the Bill comply with data protection legislation?  I have concerns regarding this area and they were outlined to the joint committee by the Department of Social and Family Affairs.</P>
        <P>This is where legislation should be debated and analysed and its shortcomings identified.  I seriously suspect there are shortcomings in this section.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="578"/>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>If a person is in a nursing home for three years, that person is liable for the charge even if the house is not rented to others.  In most instances, families will have control of their parents&rsquo; house and they will not disrupt it by letting it to others.  However, that charge will be imposed on the person in the nursing home.  I do not believe this is what the Bill was meant to do.  I ask the Minister to find a way to deal with this.  People will be going into nursing homes under the fair deal scheme and when they pass on, a percentage of the value of their property will have to be paid.  Surely that should be sufficient compensation for the State rather than also asking for &euro;200 per year while people live out the last few years of their lives in a nursing home.  I urge the Minister to address this on Report Stage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Maurice Cummins has made an important and relevant point.  Everybody&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The section deals with data sharing.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Where a person is in a nursing home, perhaps suffering from dementia, and has a large family, the family is not in a position to do anything about the house.  Nobody can touch it.  The parent is in a nursing home as a result of ill health or mental infirmity.  It is ludicrous to expect that person to make a payment annually to the local authority.  I echo Senator Maurice Cummins&rsquo;s appeal that this situation be specifically excluded.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Paddy Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>Why would the Revenue Commissioners seek data from the local authority?  I can understand why, under this Bill, the local authority would need data from the Revenue Commissioners, but not why the Revenue Commissioners would require data from local authorities.  Getting information from the Revenue Commissioners is the same as sharing data with the ESB.  However, there is a specific provision in the Bill under which the Revenue Commissioners can request from the local authority the number of people who have second or third homes.  I presume the county manager will provide that information.  I also presume there will be no charge for this information.  The sharing of information can cost money, whether the Revenue Commissioners would charge the local authority or vice versa.  I can understand why the Revenue Commissioners might need the information but I do not know why the obligation would be on the local authority to provide it under this Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I am reliably informed that the Revenue Commissioners try to build up a matrix on tax compliance.  The reason is that individuals who are not tax compliant in a certain area tend to act the same way in other areas as well.  It can point the Revenue Commissioners in a certain direction.  That is the reason for the provision.</P>
        <P>On the points raised by Senator Paudie Coffey relating to data sharing and exchange, the first line of section 11 is very clear: &ldquo;Notwithstanding any enactment or rule of law...&rdquo;.  We have been given the best legal advice on this and we are advised that those matters are covered.  The Senator takes a different view and I accept that.</P>
        <P>I am not sure, a Chathaoirligh, if I am allowed to address the points raised by Senator Maurice Cummins or if it will arise under a different section.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>It might arise later in the Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I will be happy to do so.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not relevant to section 11.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Paddy Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>If the Minister deals with it at this stage can there be further debate on it?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="579"/>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I hope there will be no further debate because I wish to clarify the situation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>We should hear the Minister&rsquo;s response.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senators need to be assured on these issues and that is why I facilitated dialogue and consultation during the interval in the debate.  The Senators raised the question of liability for the charge in circumstances where a person who is in long-term care due to ill health still owns but does not occupy what was their principal private residence.  The Senator is correct that it was never the intention that the Bill should seek to charge people in this position or that any liability for the charge would apply in these circumstances.  For the avoidance of doubt, I will seek advice on the matter before the Bill is debated in the D&aacute;il and will take whatever steps are necessary to ensure that liability for the charge does not arise for such people.  I give that undertaking to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for that clarification.  I expect we will see the clarification regarding people in nursing homes on Report Stage.  With regard to the Revenue Commissioners, is there a precedent in principle in the Bill?  The Revenue Commissioners already acknowledge that where a dependent relative is living in a dwelling that is mortgaged by a son or a daughter, interest relief can be claimed on that dwelling.  In light of that and applying the same principle, there should not be a charge on dependent relatives who are living in a granny flat or in an annexed dwelling to the house.  A precedent has been set.  This section is about data sharing with the Revenue Commissioners.  The Revenue Commissioners are already giving tax relief for dependent relatives.  In concurrence with that principle, this charge should not be applied to dependent relatives living in a granny flat or shared accommodation that might be attached to a main dwelling.  Perhaps the Minister will clarify the position.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">8 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>A number of Senators have referred to a granny flat.  The question of whether these are separate dwellings is relevant and was part of our discussion during the interval.  Given the different arrangements people make regarding adjacent living accommodation for their parents, for example, in terms of access and the extent of living accommodation in the flat, some granny flats are likely to constitute separate accommodation within the provisions of the Bill and some will not.  Those that are not separate will not be liable for a charge.  I accept, however, that other granny flats will constitute separate accommodation and liability for the charge will depend on ownership of the property where it is used as a principal private residence.  Where those living in the accommodation do not own the granny flat the owners will, in common with others who own second properties, be liable for the charge.</P>
        <P>With regard to the Senator&rsquo;s point about the Revenue Commissioners, those discussions will have to take place with the Revenue Commissioners.  If the Senator is saying that what occurred previously sets a precedent now, he will have to flesh out what he means.  As far as I am concerned, this legislation is clear.  If the Senator is saying that we should make an exemption, it does not arise in this case.  We cannot make an exemption.  I have set out how it applies to that accommodation, and I do not believe an exemption arises with regard to how the Revenue Commissioners have acted heretofore.</P>
      
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>I will respond briefly, and I thank the Cathaoirleach for his indulgence.  There is a precedent whereby a person such as a dependent relative, perhaps a parent, is living in a second residence, not the principal private residence of the owner, and there is no income.  The Revenue Commissioners realise and acknowledge that and offer interest relief on the mortgage for that dwelling.  In the same light I ask that an exemption be provided for those <Col N="580"/>who have dependent parents living in a house or a granny flat where there is no income because it is not an investment property.  A person is looking after a dependent relative and that must be made clear.  The Minister tells me that there is no such provision in the legislation and such people will be charged.  I am disappointed with that outcome.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Paddy Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Coffey on this.  The Minister is applying this levy to granny flats or apartments or separate living quarters.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>It is as I stated.  It is very clear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Paddy Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>We all know what these are.  They are located throughout the country.  Provisions are made within families for a parent or parents to live separately but under the one roof.  In most cases that provision is made to prevent people going into nursing homes or similar accommodation.  This is wrong.  I support Senator Coffey who also feels very strongly about this issue.</P>
        <P>The Minister has not addressed another issue about which we spoke, namely, where people who may be living in poor accommodation apply for planning permission to build a new house.  The old house still stands as a house.  Later, that house can made into living quarters.  In some cases it may take a considerable amount of money to make the place habitable.  In others it may not cost much.  The Minister has not been specific about such houses and we know there are very many such throughout the country.  My reading of the Minister&rsquo;s statements is that such a house will be liable for &euro;200 per annum even if nobody is living in it.  In some cases such houses are derelict or nearly so but are still houses.  It seems they are liable for the charge.</P>
        <P>Under section 11, the local authority will provide information to the Revenue Commissioners and in this case, it will declare the owner to have a second home.  I do not know what use the Revenue will make of such information but it will have it.  I can see that being a problem but I want the Minister to be more specific in respect of such a type of house &mdash; the derelict, the nearly derelict or the kind that may not take much money to make it habitable.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Senator Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>I refer to Senator Coffey&rsquo;s point, which was expanded upon by Senator Burke.  I was unfortunate to miss about 45 minutes of the earlier discussion.  Amendment No. 6<i>b</i> that I proposed dealt with the granny flat issue.  It can be made exempt.  We are all happy that if the flat is part of an existing dwelling it will not come under the charge and we should not muddy waters by talking about that case.  We are discussing a self-contained flat which adjoins a residential property with both properties owned by the same person.</P>
        <P>I commend the Minister on the Bill but what he is doing in this regard is very wrong.  Many people build granny flats onto their house for different reasons, one being that they can provide care at close proximity for their dependent parents so that there is no need for them to go into a home.  That saves the State a great deal of money.  Another reason concerns isolation in rural areas where people do not want to live out in the countryside on their own and wish to feel protected.</P>
        <P>The State is now going to penalise a son or daughter financially for building a place for their mother or father in their later years.  That is unacceptable.  Sometimes when we are dealing with legislation we speak of line 22 and all the rest of it but we need to think about real-life experiences.  We need to talk about the son and daughter whose mother and father live in a rural isolated area in an old house in which they have lived all their lives.  They decide to build a granny flat onto their house and the mother and father leave their house to move into the granny flat, on which there will be a levy of &euro;200.  The house they left will also have a levy of &euro;200 every year because of a decision made by the son or daughter.  It was their right decision <Col N="581"/>to build a wee extension to the house, a self-contained unit to help their parents get through the later and final years of their life in close proximity to the son and daughter and grandchildren.</P>
        <P>I commended the Minister on this Bill but it was not supposed to be about penalising our elderly people or their sons and daughters who build granny flats for them.  It was supposed to be about those who had enough wealth to accrue second properties or rental properties throughout this city and in other areas and who used the water and sewerage services of the local authority and did not pay their fair share.  The old person or the son or daughter who dug into their own pockets to extend their house should not come under the terms of this Bill.  I plead with the Minister at this late hour on Committee Stage to consider this matter once again.  It can be made exempt.  There may be difficulties and perhaps my wording or that of other Senators was wrong.</P>
        <P>I believe we are coming at this in the right spirit.  I shall raise the issue outside this Chamber although I do not want to do so because I have been seeking this Bill for a long time.  It is very close to being ready.  Other concerns were raised that I do not share but this issue is fundamental.  The Minister is sending out the wrong signal.  We are talking about 4,000 properties &mdash; only a handful &mdash; but this will go to the core in communities throughout rural Ireland.  I am sure it happens in cities too although I am not familiar with that situation.  In rural Ireland it is a major issue and should not arise in this legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCannon"><NameTxt>Senator Ciaran Cannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his most conciliatory approach to the legislation up to this point.  He even engaged in a conversation with Members outside the Chamber and this is very much appreciated.  On his part he proposed to consider addressing the anomaly in respect of elderly people who have to move into permanent nursing care so that they might not have the levy applied to them.  I hope he will arrive at that conclusion.</P>
        <P>Senator Doherty is correct in pointing out that this issue arises time and again in rural Ireland.  Sons or daughters who are willing to take on the care of their often physically or mentally very ill elderly parents and choose to accommodate them within or immediately adjoining their own dwelling are taking the burden of care from the State and agreeing to undertake it themselves.  The State has encouraged this over recent years through the provision of home care packages and it is a very laudable aspect of our health care provision.  On the one hand, therefore, we encourage people to do this but on the other we seek to extract &euro;200 per year from them for choosing to assist the State in the care of its elderly people.  It will cost &euro;200 per year this year but who knows what it will cost next year or the year after.</P>
        <P>Like Senator Doherty, I do not believe for a moment the Minister intended this should occur when he first began to look at and propose this legislation.  He cast a very wide net to go fishing for tuna but he is catching a great number of dolphins which is not what he intended.  He conceded he will go back and look again at the issue of the elderly people moving to permanent nursing home care.  I implore him to undertake to look at this issue too.</P>

	<P>Given the Minister&rsquo;s fair mindedness, he must see this is absolutely ludicrous.  As Senators have stated, it is against good State social policy.  Effectively it concerns the same house.  I do not want to be repetitive but these are people who are doing the State a favour.  This must cut against everything the Minister believes in.  I salute his fair mindedness and, in common with my colleagues, I appeal to him to exempt this.</P>

        <P Just="Left">Let me be very clear, I do not seek out individuals on whom to impose a &euro;200 levy.  I do not wish to give the impression this is some kind of tax on the elderly.  People might construe it as such which would be unfortunate.</P>
        <P>Reverting to Senator Cannon&rsquo;s points, if one&rsquo;s elderly parents live beside one, I assume they would be located there so that they could be looked after.  Therefore, it would not be fair to categorise them as being independent.  I do not know how the issue of individual cooking facilities, etc. arises.  I would imagine it would not.</P>

        <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 12 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Senator Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>How did the Minister determine the fine, which is not to exceed &euro;2,000?  Some people who will be subject to this legislation have multiple properties.  We received representations today from people in the self-catering industry whose annual levy will amount to &euro;150,000.  Those with private rental properties may have a larger levy.  The fine is not to exceed &euro;2,000.  Approximately 52 people went to prison for not paying their television licences over the past two years.  I am not suggesting that people go to prison for not paying their holiday home levy or granny flat levy, which I hope will not exist this time tomorrow.  Is the fine of &euro;2,000 per individual property?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I am floating in on this rather opportunistically.  Senator Doherty raised the spectre of self-catering units and asked whether the fine was to be applied to each unit.  I received communication at a very late date from somebody I know who is engaged in the self-catering chalet business.  The cost of levies and fines would apparently be sufficient to put him out of business.  If possible, I will send a copy to the Minister and consider tabling some amendment.  I know it is not practical for the Minister, having yielded to much public persuasion on the matter of mobile homes etc., to exempt every single category one by one.  If he did, he would be left with absolutely nothing in the kitty.  However, I want to fire this shot so I will be able to say I mentioned the issue, tabled an amendment or sent the communication to the Minister for his consideration.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister wish to reply to Senator Doherty on section 12?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I tried to indicate that the fine will be per individual property.  Therefore, there would be an accumulation of fines.</P>

        <P>Amendment No. 13 not moved.</P><Col N="584"/>
        <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 15 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Senator Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>My question is loosely related to the payment to town councils.  In the Minister&rsquo;s Second Stage speech, he referred to the website facilitating the payment of a charge, which was designed by the Local Government Computer Services Board and which, if it is like the on-line system for the payment of motor tax, we all welcome.  The Minister stated the revenue accruing will be relayed automatically and at intervals to the bank account of the city or county council in whose area the property is situated.  What does &ldquo;at intervals&rdquo; mean?  Will it be every week, month, three months or six months?  I hope the local authority in Donegal will raise &euro;4.6 million through the revenue that accrues.  One problem the local authority has relates to cash flow and high interest rates.  If the money became available quicker, it would relieve some of the pressure on the authority.  Will the Minister clarify what &ldquo;at intervals&rdquo; means in respect of the on-line payment system?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>This section refers to mechanisms to allow local authorities to transfer what I understand is the income from the charges to town councils that are concerned about the administration in their own areas.  Senator Doherty mentioned the income from these charges.  Thanks to the Oireachtas Library and Research unit we have a very good graph with estimates of the income that various local authorities can expect from this charge.  Dublin City Council is high on the graph, as are the large counties, Cork and Donegal.  The income for small counties such as Monaghan, Carlow and Longford and even Waterford city is low down the list.  Waterford county, where I come from, can expect a fairly low income compared with other local authority areas.</P>
        <P>There are some town councils in its administrative area, including Tramore and Lismore, but other towns such as Portlaw, Kilmacthomas and Dunmore do not have town councils although they are larger than some that do have councils.  How will the local authorities be required to spend this charge when they take it in?  Will there be any requirements by ministerial order or otherwise to ensure local authorities share the income from this charge among the towns that do not have councils?  There seems to be no facility for that.  Do we have to rely on good management in the local authorities, through their managers and directors of services?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Senator Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>Section 15(1) provides, &ldquo;A county council shall, each year, make a payment to each town council within the county&rdquo;.  Should it be prescribed in the legislation that this happen within a certain timeframe?  The date of collection will be 31 March next year but a local authority does not have to hand the money over to a town council until December of that year.  There might be late payments but should the payment be made within a month of the deadline and the late fees be paid the following year?  I am thinking of Senator Glynn&rsquo;s comment about the large town councils in whose area there are many rental properties.  County councillors might hold onto the money because they know that having money in the bank is a major issue for local authorities which have overdrafts with high interest rates and so on.  The speedy release of money is a big issue for county and town councils.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn"><NameTxt>Senator Camillus Glynn</NameTxt>
	<P>I have made my position on this matter clear.  The Minister cannot accede to my request.  The Bill provides, &ldquo;A county council shall, each year,&rdquo; which means that every year it must make a return to a rating town council within its administrative area.  This does not apply to the former town commission county councils as I understand the Bill.  The rate struck by the former town commissions is a statutory demand on the county and is quite different from the rating town councils.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Glynn is exactly right.</P><Col N="585"/>
        <P>In response to the question about on-line payments, the computer boards disburse the money at intervals, probably once a month.</P>
        <P>The question of which town councils receive how much is a matter for the local authority, or the manager.  I hope that as we discuss these issues in more detail in the context of the White Paper we can examine the powers of the members.  We seem to agree that the managers have excessive power and the local members do not have those powers.  This must be addressed.  There is no question that there is an imbalance there.  It is recognised on all sides of the House.  That is what I intend to do in the White Paper.  I hope we can get broad agreement on those issues because reform of local government is urgent.  We do not have real local government, we have local administration.  The people at the top, the managers, have the power.  As democrats none of us can be too happy about that situation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Senator Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the Minister&rsquo;s latter comments.  That is why I think we could or should have grabbed the Bill by the horns and allowed local authorities to set their own rates but I note the Minister&rsquo;s comments on this and know that he is disposed to examining the point.  I welcome the fact that he has agreed to consider some of the other issues, three of which are covered in some shape or form in my amendments.  I am glad of the Minister&rsquo;s interaction with Members here.</P>
        <P>I did not put down an amendment under section 15 but my point is that the section commits the local authorities to paying the relevant money to the town councils but does not state when.  The local authorities will receive the money at the end of March but can hold onto it under the legislation until December.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Senator talking about town councils?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Senator Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>It is an annual payment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Senator Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P>I have spoken to those in the finance departments of local authorities who say that cash flow is a massive problem.  If a county council has &euro;1 million which it must give to its town councils having collected it in March 2010 and holds on to that money until December that will benefit the local authority, not the town council.  Holding onto the money for eight months makes a massive difference because it reduces interest rates and has the opposite effect on the town council.  Most local authorities run on overdrafts and high interest rates.  Should the legislation not state that a county council shall each year within one month of the 31 March deadline pay each town council?  The Bill gives them the scope to do this any time within the year.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The difficulty is that one does not know what the payments will be.  The local authorities have to collect the money and will not know at that stage how much has been collected.  That is why we do it annually.  The Senator&rsquo;s points on cash flow are correct and no doubt people want to get their hands on money as quickly as possible but the local authorities have to go out and collect the money, then disburse it to the town councils.</P>

	<P>As we come to the end of Committee Stage I acknowledge the engagement of the Minister and his officials with all sides of the House in respect of clarifications that we requested during the day.

      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>I acknowledge the engagement today by Senators on all sides of the House and the Minister and his officials.  I do not want to finish on a negative note but it is unfortunate that this charge was announced in the budget in October 2008 and as Senators we are grappling with the fact that we are squashing much legislation into the last few days of the session.  Very relevant issues of concern are been raised in the Bill and it is unfortunate we find ourselves with the time constraints we have.  I know it is up to the Leader to outline when Report Stage will be taken but it would be in the best interests of the Government and the Opposition if we could defer Report Stage until next week.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PearseDoherty"><NameTxt>Senator Pearse Doherty</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Echoing the sentiments of Senator Coffey, it is disappointing we did not get the time to tease out the amendments.  As other Senators and the Minister were providing explanations, it was difficult to think on one&rsquo;s feet, particularly when dealing with this type of legislation.  As somebody stated, the net is out there and we are catching people that we should not catch with these charges.  However, we are where we are.  I welcome the Bill and I called for it prior to the Government being willing to accede to the request.  It is important because it empowers local authorities and provides them with additional revenue.  If anything good has come out of the recession perhaps it is the widening of the tax base for local authorities.</P>
        <P>On my behalf and on behalf of my party I thank the Minister for the interaction he and his officials have had.  I am glad he took the approach he did to the Bill, not only in the debate today but in shaping it initially.  There are still a couple of bumps which we will try to smooth out on Report Stage.  I wish the Minister and his officials well in drafting the amendments he indicated he would consider on the three areas we raised today.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="587"/>
      <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn"><NameTxt>Senator Camillus Glynn</NameTxt>
	<P>I have always been an advocate of giving additional powers to local government and its members but with power comes responsibility and those members must take on board the responsibilities devolved to them.  This often involves taking hard decisions.  I look forward to the remaining Stages of the Bill.  I thank the Minister and I was particularly pleased that in his opening statement he honoured the commitment to create additional town councils.  That is extremely important; more important than some people realise.  Town councils, even the non-rating town councils as they are known, constitute a very important link.  They perform a very important service for the community.  They have an elected voice and often use it to articulate problems in their administrative area which are then taken up by the county council or by the Government.  All round, this has been a good day for local government and I look forward to Report Stage tomorrow afternoon.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senators for their engagement today.  It has been a very fruitful discussion.  I believe in teasing out issues as best we can.  The legislation was published a week ago and I appreciate the pressures that Members are under in trying to grapple with complex legislation.  This is a relatively short Bill but undoubtedly any time a levy is imposed sensitivities are involved, and particularly at a time of economic recession people are sensitive to any hikes in personal taxation.  I understand this and that Senators have a job to do.  Today shows that the two House system is one we can be proud of because it enables us to go through not just five Stages in one House but ten stages so when we are telescoping the time involved we are still in a position to go through the Bill in the detail required.  I thank all Senators for their engagement and I hope we can go through more of the issues tomorrow.  I have given assurances to Senators that I will consider those issues and they can be assured that I will do so.</P></Speaker>

      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>It is very bad practice to change the order of Bills without any notice to Members of the Opposition, in terms of getting speakers here and being prepared for the Bills that are coming before the House.  It is all part of rushing this legislation through and it is not good practice.  I ask the Leader not to do it again in the coming days, when there is so much legislation coming before the House.</P>

	<P>I take the Senator&rsquo;s point.</P>
        <P>This is a Seanad Bill which has been amended by the D&aacute;il.  In accordance with Standing Order 103, it is deemed to have passed its First, Second and Third Stages in the Seanad and is placed on the Order Paper for Report Stage.  On the question &ldquo;That the Bill be received for final consideration&rdquo;, the Minister may explain the purpose of the amendments made by the D&aacute;il.  This is looked upon as the report of the D&aacute;il amendments to the Seanad.  For Senators&rsquo; convenience, I have arranged for the printing and circulation of the amendments.  The Minister will deal separately with the subject matter of each related group of amendments.  I have also circulated the proposed groupings in the House.  A Senator may contribute once on each grouping.  I remind Senators that the only matters that may be discussed are the amendments made by the D&aacute;il.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be received for final consideration.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The Aviation (Preclearance) Bill 2009 was initiated in this House on 9 June and we had a very good discussion on it.  All Stages were passed here, with some amendments, on 16 June.  It subsequently passed all Stages in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann last night, with two further amendments.  These amendments arose from similar amendments that were tabled on Seanad Report Stage by Labour Party Senators and were supported by the Fine Gael spokesperson.  I was not in a position at that time to accept the amendments.  I said I would reflect on the issues involved before the Bill was debated in the D&aacute;il, with a view to tabling amendments if I thought it was necessary.  Having considered the matters in the meantime, I tabled two amendments on D&aacute;il Committee Stage last night.  They addressed the concerns voiced by Senators and Deputies.</P>
        <P>As this is a report of the D&aacute;il amendments to the Seanad, I want to explain the purpose of those amendments.  Amendment No. 1 is an amendment to section 5 and states:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 8, between lines 24 and 25, to insert the following subsection:</P>
        <P LI="1">&ldquo;(7) Nothing in this Act shall be construed as permitting a preclearance officer to be in possession of a weapon in the performance of his or her functions under this Act.&rdquo;.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">9 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P FLI="0">When the matter was originally raised in this House, and again in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, I explained that preclearance officers would not be allowed to carry any weapons in the preclearance areas.  The use of any type of weapons by preclearance officers was entirely rejected by the Irish negotiating team during the preclearance discussions that led to the intergovernmental agreement.  It was made clear beyond doubt that security within the preclearance areas would be provided only by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, as in every other part of the State.  However, I accepted there was an argument it should be made explicit in the legislation that US officers will not be allowed to possess weapons in the course of exercising any function under the Act.  Accordingly, following further examination on this issue, I proposed this amendment to the Bill in the D&aacute;il and it was passed last night.  The amendment <Col N="589"/>makes it clear beyond any doubt that preclearance officers will not be permitted to be in possession of a weapon in the performance of their functions under the Act.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Senator Brendan Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for the manner in which he has treated the House during the passage of this legislation through the Oireachtas.  It is a welcome development that such a number of Bills, including this one, have commenced in this House.  It is only fair to give credit to the Leader for his efforts in this regard.</P>
        <P>The Minister accepted a number of amendments put forward by the Labour Party on Committee Stage and on Report Stage agreed to accept the spirit of a couple of other amendments and to look at the possibilities for amendment during the Bill&rsquo;s passage through the D&aacute;il.  True to his word, the Minister did that and has come back with amendments with which I am reasonably happy and will accept on behalf of the Labour Party.  I believe they address our concerns and considerably improve the legislation.  Working with the Minister on this Bill has been a positive experience for me and demonstrates the value of constructive opposition and that the Minister was willing to respond positively to bring about improvements in legislation.</P>
        <P>I look forward to the implementation of the legislation and the realisation of the potential benefits to our citizens and our economy.  I thank the Minister and his officials.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>I will begin with the positive points and echo what Senator Ryan has just said.  It is continually the case with this Minister and his Department that if Senators put forward amendments and put a strong case for them, he is willing to consider them or will act on the intent of the amendments.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>I have had the same experience as Senator Ryan in this regard in the case of the Harbours (Amendment) Act and the Dublin Transport Authority enabling legislation last year.  I acknowledge again that I have always found a constructive approach on amendments is reciprocated by the Minister.  It would be remiss of me not to acknowledge the work done by Senator Brendan Ryan with regard to the amendments he proposed that were accepted and how they improved the legislation.</P>
        <P>However, I must point out that the manner in which this legislation has been brought for discussion now is unacceptable.  The legislation was due to be discussed later this evening.  When I arrived into the House and asked for a copy of the amendments that had been made, they were not available.  If it was not for the courtesy and co-operation of the officials in informing what was going on, I would have arrived into the Chamber to discuss amendments I had not even seen.  This is unacceptable.  It is not acceptable to change the Order of Business without the consent of the full House.</P>
        <P>We are moving into a week packed with legislation such as this, and to find the order of important legislation being changed without the wholehearted consent of the House is hugely disappointing.  I want to set down a marker for Fine Gael that this is something we will not accept.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>With respect, I am making the point that the Minister and his officials have been nothing less than superb with regard to responding to and acting on the points we have raised on this legislation and because of that, this is a better Bill than it otherwise would have been.  That is what the Oireachtas is here to do.  However, we have been let down by the way in which the legislation has been treated at this point of the process.  I would <Col N="590"/>not be doing my job if I did not emphasise that here.  I stress that Fine Gael will not accept such an attitude for the remainder of this term.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 1 improves the legislation and it is great to see the Minister acted on it.  However, it would be remiss of me not to emphasise that we should be dealing with the Bill in a different way, later this evening with everybody being aware of what is happening and having a copy of the amendments in their hands before coming to the Chamber.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I compliment the Minister and also Senator Ryan on putting forward his worthwhile amendments.  Their work shows the importance of Seanad &Eacute;ireann and demonstrates that under my stewardship as Leader every section of every Bill is discussed.  There is no guillotine in this House and there is no rushing ahead with legislation.  Every line of a Bill is discussed in the House.  We have often sat here until the early hours of the morning under the stewardship of the Leas-Chathaoirleach, the Cathaoirleach and former Cathaoirleach.  Legislation is not rushed in this House.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I thank the Minister, who has always been understanding when good amendments have been proposed.  I thank Members for this Bill having been initiated in this House.  It was initiated here and was not rushed on any Stage.  However, I regret that anybody would try to make an issue on account of us trying to facilitate a Minister at 9 p.m. on a sitting evening.  That is not how we have done business down through the years.  I understand some Members are here for the first time, but they must learn that we respect Ministers when they come to the House.  That is how I have always done business.  I have always consulted the party leaders, although this has not always done by my predecessors.  I consult, communicate and negotiate.  Anybody who tries to put a spin of any other shape on the situation knows he or she is not talking about me as Leader.</P>

	<P>To return to the legislation, I am grateful for how appreciative all colleagues are that amendments have been accepted in the Seanad.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to join my colleagues in congratulating the Minister on his approach to the work of the Seanad.  This is something that could be copied by other Ministers.  He is somewhat unique in his approach, although there may be one other Minister with a similar approach.  I want to reiterate the point that listening to the arguments made here during the course of a debate and being willing to come back with amendments is to be commended.  The Seanad should do more of that kind of work.  It is very good to see a more constructive approach to Opposition amendments and I commend the Minister on that.  I commend him in particular on his dealing with the issue of US officials and the carrying of arms.  It is important he has made that statement on behalf of the Government and that he has brought in an amendment to that effect.</P>
        <P>I do not want to involve the Minister in the procedural point we were making.  Our spokesperson on this legislation could have missed it.  We do not need a patronising lecture on how the House is run.  We all co-operate in the running of the House.  I want to make the point clear that we want our spokespersons to be present when important amendments are being considered.  Changing the order puts that at risk.  This is the basic point we want to make.</P>
        <P>I welcome these valuable amendments and the approach the Minister has taken in the House.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="591"/>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>Before dealing with group 2, I thank Senators for their positive comments.  When bringing forward legislation, in particular complicated legislation that requires significant attention, I try to bring it to the Seanad first, because of my positive experience with one of the longest pieces of legislation outside of a Finance Bill, namely, the Planning and Development Act 2000.  The contributions made in this House to that Bill greatly enhanced and strengthened the legislation.</P>
        <P>With regard to the nature of business in general, whether in this House or the other, there is always political cut and thrust and business is often adversarial in nature.  I do not believe this is necessarily the best way to deal with legislation.  On many different occasions, even on simple issues, such as those pointed out by Senator Ryan in the course of this Bill with regard to wrong dates or wrong citations in legislation, as well as on much more complicated issues, it is useful to hear the views of others and to try to act on them.  I will always try to do this and I thank Senators for recognising it.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 2 is a good case in point.  At least three of the Senators present, one from Fine Gael, one from the Labour Party and my colleague, Senator John Ellis, discussed this aspect of amendment No. 2 that I am proposing.  The amendment proposes that in page 9, subsection (1)(<i>i</i>)(II), line 7, after &ldquo;expedient&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;in the interests of the person being searched&rdquo;.  The amendment concerns the functions of Irish law enforcement officers.  Having teased out the issues and the use of the words &ldquo;or is otherwise expedient&rdquo;, this gave rise to a good debate and a questioning as to whether the interests of the traveller or anybody else were being looked after.</P>
        <P>The point was well made by the Senators opposite that while the purpose of the phrase &ldquo;or is otherwise expedient&rdquo; was to provide an appropriate level of protection for the individual, it could be interpreted that it was being inserted for expedient purposes other than those of the traveller.  I gave an example of what we intended which was meant to clarify the position and, while Senators opposite accepted that as a clarification, I knew they were still concerned.  I appreciated the concern that the words might be used against the interests of the passenger or the person being searched.</P>
        <P>At that stage, I was not in a position to respond immediately to the Labour Party Senators on the amendment but I said I would reconsider it.  Having examined the legal position and taken legal advice in order to avoid any doubt as to what the words are to mean, I brought forward this amendment to the D&aacute;il and it was passed last night.  It clarifies the position and ensures the wording we are now explicitly putting into the legislation makes it very clear that in the phrase &ldquo;or is otherwise expedient&rdquo;, the expediency relates to the person being searched &mdash; the passenger, in other words, not the pre-clearance officer.</P>
        <P>This amendment enhances and clarifies the Bill.  I thank Senators for raising the matter initially and for improving the Bill in this manner.</P>

	<P>I am pleased to be back in the Upper House to report on a range of amendments made by the D&aacute;il to the Bill.  The Bill was first discussed in this House on 1 October 2008 and completed all Stages on 10 December last.  Since then, as Senators will be aware, it has been debated in the D&aacute;il, amended and, I believe, improved significantly.  The list before the House today contains 157 amendments which have been made to the Bill as passed by Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  In view of that significant number, Senators will appreciate it would not be practical to discuss each amendment individually.  In my report to the House, I will therefore deal with the amendments under a number of broad groupings.  Of course, if any Senator would like to be briefed on a particular amendment, I will be happy to do so.</P>
        <P>There are a number of groupings.  With regard to the homelessness action plans, group 1 relates to amendments Nos. 1, 10, 15, 17, 22, 23, 47 to 53, inclusive, and 147 to 152, inclusive.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The issue of homelessness and the placing of homelessness action plans on a statutory basis was the subject of considerable debate during the Bill&rsquo;s passage through the Seanad.  I am pleased to be reporting back to the House today with these amendments.  As Senators are aware, The Way Home: A Strategy to Address Adult Homelessness in Ireland, which I published in August 2008, set out the key objectives of our homelessness policy, which are to eliminate long-term occupation of emergency accommodation and the need to sleep rough.  The strategy also contains a commitment to put homelessness action plans on a statutory basis and the amendments made to the Bill in the D&aacute;il, and first signalled in this House during the Second Stage and Committee Stage debates, deliver on that undertaking.</P>
        <P>Amendments Nos. 47 to 53, inclusive, contain the substantive provision and insert a new Chapter 6 with seven sections in Part 2 of the Bill, which deals with the functions of local authorities.  The provisions establish a structural process involving homelessness consultative forums, management groups and the making of and adoption of homelessness action plans by elected councils.  The plans will specify the actions to be undertaken by various stakeholders to meet broad objectives, including the prevention and reduction of homelessness and the promotion of an effective co-ordination between the various bodies involved in the provision of homeless services.  The consultative forum will bring together the key players in the provision of homeless services, statutory and non-statutory.  Its function mirrors at a local level the cross-departmental team and the National Homeless Consultative Committee which provide the platform for consultation nationally.  It will play a key role in the homeless action plan structure as a forum for discussion and debate on homelessness and it will provide input for the preparation of a homeless action plan and views and reports on the subsequent operation of the plan.  The management group will complement the work of the consultative forum but with a separate function, including a remit to make recommendations to housing authorities, the HSE and other relevant bodies in respect of homeless services, the preparation of the homeless action plan and recommendations regarding funding for homeless services.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for the amendments accepted to date in both Houses relating to homelessness, especially the arguments advanced by the Make Room campaign.  The fact that so many amendments have been taken on board demonstrates how well the policy has been formed and practised and how the issue has proceeded.  In any given set of proposals from NGOs not everything will be accepted.  However, the fact that so many amendments were accepted and the spirit in which they were accepted speaks well for the quality of the policy and the commitment to improve it, especially at a time when the danger of homelessness and the necessity of meeting the needs of the homeless has never been so great.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>On the introduction of the Bill in the House there was a serious engagement on the homelessness issue.  The Minister of State will recall that many amendments were tabled by this side of the House.  We engaged to a large extent with the NGOs and the Make Room campaign, which is very concerned about homelessness and how the State proposes to address this serious issue.  I welcome the amendments and anything we can do in a positive sense to try to address these unfortunate people who find themselves homeless is to be welcomed.  I acknowledge the role of the NGOs and those working at the coalface for engaging in the parliamentary process, for introducing information and for proposing amendments to Senators.  The D&aacute;il has helped to inform the legislation and to improve it as well.  The Minister of State and his officials have engaged with them and listened to them as well.  I welcome this aspect and I broadly welcome the amendments.</P>

	<P>I compliment everyone concerned.  In some ways this echoes the words of Padraic Colum&rsquo;s poem The Old Woman of the Roads, &ldquo;O, to have a little house!  To own the hearth and stool and all!&rdquo;.  Since taking over the portfolio of housing, the Minister of State, Deputy Finneran, has been very proactive in the whole area of housing and homelessness.  The Bill affords Members of both Houses an opportunity to make a real input and to address this very serious social ill.  I look forward to hearing the views of colleagues as the debate progresses.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with colleagues about the importance of this issue and the need to strengthen responsibilities in the area of homelessness.  However, it is in the implementation, monitoring and evaluation of such policies and the budgets allocated that we will really see the difference.  Will the Minister comment on this point and on the proposed monitoring and implementation of the policy?  He has made a good start with the legislation.  What strengths are in place to ensure these important matters are followed through?  That will be a key issue.</P>
        <P>Many of us believed the homeless strategy and the increased budgets to tackle homelessness over the years would bring about an end to it.  Unfortunately, given the economic downturn and the pressure on families this will be a very real issue throughout the country, not only in urban areas.  The way in which local authorities respond and how they are directed by Government will be critical in the years to come.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senators for their comments.  It can be seen from the Bill as amended that the views of Senators and their contributions were well analysed by my Department and the officials.  While not everything has been included, I am pleased that the intentions and wishes of Senators have been considered and there has been an acceptance of the wishes of Members.</P>
        <P>The matter of the budget is vital and I was very conscious of this when I launched the strategy in August 2008.  This is one of the few areas of Government expenditure that received an increase under the 2009 budget.  The allocation of money for the homeless in 2009 is &euro;62 <Col N="594"/>million, an increase of 5% on the 2008 figure.  This is topped up with approximately &euro;30 million from the HSE for the care programme for the homeless which is an important part of the homeless area.</P>
        <P>I refer to the main areas of work.  An extraordinary amount of consultation has taken place and I place on record the contribution of the agencies involved and the Make Room campaign, which I thank for its very forthcoming and clear statement, in which it welcomed the content of the new chapter of amendments published by me and included in the Bill.  My Department officials and I held discussions with the Make Room campaign on this issue and the campaign is pleased the amendments are reflective of that dialogue.</P>
        <P>The dialogue was necessarily extensive because as Senator Fitzgerald remarked the implementation of the plan is vital from here on.  It cannot be achieved by one person or group.  There must be a collective contribution involving people working together to implement the plan and to meet the aims of the strategy, which are very clear and simple.  The aims include the target that people will not be left in emergency accommodation for longer than six months and that the need to sleep rough will be excluded.  These aims are to be in place within two years.  We are committed to that and I assure the House that work is already in progress on these issues.  People are actively working towards these ends.  We did not wait for the legislation to pass fully through the Houses and we are already in the process of implementation.  Large numbers of people have been identified who are moving from temporary accommodation.  As I have stated previously, there have been people in temporary accommodation and bed and breakfast accommodation for seven and eight years, which I find totally inappropriate.  I vowed this would not continue.  People are entitled to remake their lives, to enter new relationships and to have a second start.  They cannot do so if they must be out on the sidewalk at 9.30 a.m. or 10 a.m.  The programme is extensive and there is a responsibility on the local authority and all the different agencies involved.  It is working co-operatively and it will not always run smoothly but if people keep focused it will eventually deliver the desired result which is the strategy announced last August.  I thank Senators from all sides of the House for their interest in this important area which is now being given its entitled legislation.  There was debate in the House about whether there should be a legislative framework and I gave an undertaking in the House that I would give a legislative backing to sections of the implementation plan and this is in the Bill.</P>

	<P>Group 2 amendments deal with incremental purchase which is the subject matter of amendments Nos. 2, 29 and 54 to 86, inclusive.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendments Nos. 2, 29 and 54 to 86, inclusive, deal with the incremental purchase scheme.  The main provisions for the incremental purchase scheme arrangements were contained in the Bill as initiated and passed by Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  The amendments made by the D&aacute;il provide for a further number of clarifications and improvements to those provisions.  I have also taken the opportunity to align the incremental purchase provisions in Part 3 with the new arrangements for the tenant purchase of apartments which will also operate on the incremental purchase model.</P>
        <P>Among the main changes to the incremental purchase arrangements as passed by the Seanad are a clarification on how the amount of money a purchaser will pay to an authority for a dwelling is calculated based on the purchase price provided for under amendments Nos. 59 and 60.  Amendment No. 61 is necessary to ensure housing authorities can refuse to sell a dwelling under Part 3 where the applicant household is or has been in arrears of rent.  The second part of this amendment, paragraph (<i>p</i>), however, allows for some flexibility in applying paragraph (<i>a</i>) to the applicant household as it allows authorities to approve a purchase application from <Col N="595"/>an applicant in rent arrears who has entered into a repayment agreement with a housing authority under section 34.  A simplification of the provisions governing the actual sale of a dwelling is provided under amendment No. 63 in Part 3.</P>
        <P>A simplified method is provided under amendment No. 72 for purchasers to get a current statement from the authority or approved body as to how many additional incremental releases for the purchaser have thus accumulated.  Purchasers can request this statement at any time from the authority or the body as it is a statement as opposed to a deed of discharge.  There is no cost to the purchaser for requesting this statement.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 75 provides for the insertion of a new section in Part 3.  This provides that a housing authority or an approved body may suspend the release of the charge share for any year where a purchaser breaches the terms and conditions of the charging order.  In such circumstances, the charge held by the housing authority or approved body will not be discharged during the charge period.  At the end of the charge period, the purchaser will be liable to repay to the housing authority or the approved body an amount equal to the percentage share in the dwelling held by the housing authority or the approved body based on the market value on the date of expiration of the charge period.  I do not envisage this provision being invoked regularly.  It is simply being inserted to ensure that where a purchaser does not comply with the terms and conditions of the charging order, the housing authority or the approved body concerned, has the power to take the appropriate action.  Where a purchaser fails to repay this amount within two months of receipt of the notification from the housing authority or approved body, it is open to the housing authority or the approved body to recover the debt outstanding as a simple contract debt in court as is already provided for with regard to moneys owed where a purchaser resells a dwelling within the charge period and fails to make the repayment to the housing authority or an approved body.</P>

	<P>I acknowledge again that this is another mechanism to allow people move onto the housing ladder from whatever accommodation they are in.  It is a genuine attempt by the Minister of State to make another provision in legislation to allow such people to have a house of their own.</P>
        <P>I ask for one clarification from the Minister of State.  Views differ among local authorities.  Where a local authority tenant dies and other family members are living in the house, there is an issue of succession to the tenancy of that house.  Some local authorities are of the view that the house keys must be handed over and the house handed back within a month.  The policy is that because the family members were not part of the formal rental agreement, it now becomes available to the wider housing list.  There is a social issue to be considered as some family members may have lived in that house for 20 or 30 years and surely they should have some succession entitlement to continue the rental of that house.  This point is not specifically related to incremental purchase but it relates to local authority housing.  The Minister of State may direct me in this matter.  There is a concern about the situation regarding the family of an elderly person who have lived in a house for many years.  I await the Minister of State&rsquo;s views on this matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Paddy Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Coffey in this regard.  It is an issue that has been well debated in many local authorities.  I compliment the Minister of State on bringing this complex legislation through the House with great efficiency and with great attention to the debate in the House.  He has introduced a degree of flexibility into the housing sector to allow people to move from sector to sector within local authority housing, whether they are homeless or are local authority tenants or have bought their own home.</P><Col N="596"/>
        <P>Senator Coffey is referring to a degree of consistency.  Some local authorities have interpreted this differently from others, as have some legal advisers to local authorities.  There are differing opinions within the same local authority, whether they be town councils or county councils.  He makes the point very well that in some cases people may be living in local authority houses for 30 or 40 years.  The person who is the original tenant believes he or she can leave the house to the siblings or other members of the family.  In some cases, there may be nobody living in the house but the people who were born, bred and reared in the house and brought up in that community feel they should be the people to get the house.  This is where the notion of consistency comes into it because in some cases, local authorities have allowed the family members to keep the house or sell the house in other cases and there has been inconsistency.  Some councils have taken hard-line decisions which have created difficulties and hardship.  Will the Minister of State outline the position under this Bill?  I hope there would be a degree of flexibility and consistency.</P>

	<P>The incremental purchase scheme allows for the first time people allocated a house to enter a purchase scheme on the day they were allocated it.  This has not been available to date and this is an innovation contained in this legislation.  I have been of the opinion for many years that this opportunity should be given to tenants.  It gives the person ownership of the house from the day they go into it and they take responsibility for maintenance and insurance.  This will be introduced on a pilot basis but I hope it will become the norm in a very short period.</P>
        <P>Regarding the matter of houses being passed on to other members of the family, I wish to be clear that these are matters for each housing authority and I do not wish to be seen to interfere with that.  I would be concerned also if there was not uniformity on the matter.  If there was not uniformity and inconsistencies arose, as mentioned by Senators, it might be the subject of a circular from me or even further legislation but it is an area on which I would like to see uniformity across the housing authorities.  It is not specifically dealt with in the legislation but the matter has been raised and we will take note of it and have it examined in the context of a circular, a meeting with housing officers, which happens on a regular basis in any event, or by way of legislation.  If there is a need for legislation in the future, I will have no hesitation in dealing with the matter by including it in a further Bill because I am sure there will be other housing Bills coming through.</P>

	<P>Group 3 is on tenant purchase of apartments.  I call the Minister to outline the subject matter of amendments Nos. 3, 13 and 14, 18 and 19, 87 to 114, inclusive, 142 and 157.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendments Nos. 3, 13, 14, 18, 19, 87 to 114, inclusive, 142 and 157 deal with the tenant purchase of apartments.  I am delighted to report back to the Seanad on these significant amendments to facilitate the introduction for the first time of a scheme of tenant purchase for local authority apartments.  The proposed scheme will deliver on the commitment outlined in the Government&rsquo;s housing policy statement and remove the glaring anomaly in the existing tenant purchase scheme that households allocated a local authority house have the right to buy but those allocated a local authority apartment to date have had no such opportunity.</P>
        <P>The tenant purchase model agreed by the D&aacute;il is based on a long-standing arrangement in the private sector for the ownership and management of multi-unit residential developments and the substantive provisions in this area are contained in amendments Nos. 87 to 114, inclusive.  For the benefit of Senators, I will outline in general terms how these provisions will work in practice.</P><Col N="597"/>
        <P>Under the proposed scheme housing authorities will be required to conduct a tenant plebiscite in individual apartment complexes proposed for designation by the housing authority for tenant purchase.  Where the plebiscite shows that a minimum number of tenants are in favour of designation and that a minimum number of tenants are willing to serve as directors of a management company if they proceed to buy their apartments, the housing authority may designate the complex.</P>
        <P>The authority will transfer ownership of each designated complex to a new management company established for the purpose, which will immediately lease all apartments back to the authority while retaining ownership of the common areas and services.  The authority will continue to let the apartments to the existing tenants who, subject to meeting the prescribed minimum tenancy requirement, will have the option of buying them from the authority under the incremental purchase arrangements.  Sales will proceed provided that the first sale takes place within a specified period after designation and that a minimum proportion of all the apartments in the complex are to be sold.</P>
        <P>The housing authority will continue to be the landlord to tenants in the apartments that remain unsold in the complex.  The tenants of local authority apartments will be able to purchase their homes for a proportion of the market value with a charge being placed on the property in favour of the authority or the body concerned for the portion of the equity not paid for, declining over time until the charge is eliminated.  The charge share will reduce in equal annual equities releases over 20 to 30 years of occupancy of the property unless the housing authority invokes provisions allowing for the suspension of the releases in cases where the purchaser breaches the terms of the lease.  This means that the equity stake not purchased at the outset, in effect the discount, will be given free of charge to the purchaser provided the terms of the scheme are complied with fully.</P>
        <P>If the tenant purchaser wishes to resell the apartment during the charge period, the authority has first refusal in buying it back.  If the authority declines to buy back the apartment, the tenant purchaser may sell it on the market in which case he or she must pay the authority the value of any outstanding charge on the property.</P>
        <P>This is, of necessity, a complex business.  The arrangements I have outlined are not straightforward but I believe they are the right ones.  I am prepared to endure a little complexity if it ensures that the interests of the State, the housing authorities and, above all, the tenants who wish to buy and the tenants who wish to remain tenants are protected.</P>
        <P>The remaining amendments in this grouping are all related directly to the new provisions and provide for the miscellaneous technical amendments to improve the clarity and understanding of this part of the Bill.  I am sure Senators on all sides of the House will welcome this provision.  I thank Members for their interest in this issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>This issue was highlighted for the Minister when the Bill was before the Seanad.  I recall at the time he could not give a commitment because of the complexities involved but undertook to address the concerns of Members of this House with regard to the equality issues raised concerning tenant purchase of apartments.  I welcome the fact that the Minister has done what he said he would do.  I acknowledge managing apartment complexes is a complex area in that there is purchase of some and not others, the common areas and so on, but the Minister has done his best to grapple with that difficult matter and the amendments before us will allow tenants a sense of equality.  They are no different from those who are renting a local authority house in that they too can buy an apartment in the same way they could buy the local authority house in which they were living.  I acknowledge the progress that has been made in this regard.  It will be welcomed, mainly in the authorities in the larger cities <Col N="598"/>where many of these apartment complexes are located.  I thank the Minister for his efforts in that regard.</P>
        <P>I do not wish to be negative but on the area of housing associations, which was debated here and in the other House, if we are talking about total equality the tenants of housing associations is an issue we should keep under review.  We might examine in a future Bill the possibility of those tenants having some opportunity to purchase association houses which have been provided for by the State.  There is an argument that must be acknowledged, and it is made in many local authority chambers throughout the country, that while tenants of those houses are glad to have them and the estates are run very well by the housing associations &mdash; I compliment the housing associations on their engagement in the social housing area &mdash; we should revisit this area in the future to further the argument of equality and the right of a person to purchase the house they have rented for many years.  However, I acknowledge the progress the Minister has made with regard to apartments.</P>

	<P>This is an innovative measure and the Minister deserves great credit for it.  As everybody in local government knows, apartment complexes have produced many difficulties and this measure will invest in former tenants of apartments home ownership pride, which is very significant.  I accept this area is complex and that it has been difficult but notwithstanding that, the Minister has taken the bull by the horns and come up with an innovative proposal.</P>
        <P>I have been in public life for 30 years and in my experience this is one of the most innovative measures in terms of home provision.  It is a marvellous development and I compliment the Minister on it.  No words of mine could give him enough credit for it because this is an area that has been difficult in terms of management.</P>
        <P>While on social trips to visit my relations in Great Britain, I took the time to visit apartment complexes and they present many problems, but the Minister has overcome the problem here and I compliment him and his officials on that.  It will stand as a monument to him in his capacity as the Minister responsible for housing.  It is a tremendous step forward in terms of home ownership.</P>

	<P>When the Bill was initiated in this House, I raised the matter with the Minister and found him willing to introduce these amendments.  I am glad they have been accepted in the other House.  This issue has been a long-running sore since legal difficulties arose when the scheme was first introduced in the 1980s.  The mechanism chosen will alleviate most of the concerns which have arisen since.</P>
        <P>It is my understanding that, subject to the regulations which will follow this legislation, the discount being offered will vary from the standard 30%, or 3% over a ten year period, to 60%.  I ask that the full 60% discount, or as close to it as possible, be offered to those who in the 1980s, having been involved in a housing purchase scheme found the offer withdrawn by local authorities particularly in Cork and Dublin.  A court action followed in Dublin.  Attention must be given to people who, now more than 20 years older, will find it difficult to secure banking finance for the increased purchase price.  Attention must also be given to the increased asset value of the properties.  It is important that the maximum discount is offered to people who find themselves in this position.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Paddy Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>This is an example of the flexibility which the Minister of State has shown.  I congratulate him on this initiative and I welcome it.  The Multi-Unit Developments Bill, which will regulate apartment management companies, was recently published.  Once a local authority apartment is purchased, the complex is no longer a local authority complex. <Col N="599"/> Would such a complex come under the new management companies Bill and would the local authority pay management fees to a management company?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>I have made provision in the legislation for voluntary bodies to make sales under the incremental purchase scheme.  I cannot force them to do so but I have made provision in the legislation for it.  Members are aware of the review being carried out of the voluntary housing side of the social housing programme.  The report of that review will be available later this year.  I will then be in a better position to speak on this matter.  There is provision in this Bill for voluntary bodies to sell houses to their tenants.  This is the first time this has been made possible.  Voluntary bodies may find it appropriate to sell because they may need to develop a fund base in the future.  I hope they will travel that road, now that we have provided the facility to do so.</P>
        <P Just="Left">With regard to management companies, I earlier referred to the holding of plebiscites, after which people must be prepared to serve as directors of the management company.  In many of the designated complexes, a large number of people may decide to continue as local authority tenants.  They must also be catered for.  Local authorities will not renege on their responsibilities to their tenants even when a management company is in place.  This is provided for in the legislation.  Where there is a genuine interest in selling, a sufficient number of people who decide to buy and people prepared to become directors &mdash; I am sure people will want to be directors of their own housing development to look after common areas, structural work and so on &mdash; things will fall into place.  However, local authorities will continue to be responsible for its own tenants.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>A number of amendments agreed in the D&aacute;il can be categorised under the miscellaneous heading.  Within this group there are some substantive changes, to which I will refer briefly.  There was a considerable debate on subsection 25(5) during the Bill&rsquo;s passage through the Seanad.  The intention of section 25 is to underline the seriousness of actions such as non-payment of rent or breach of tenancy agreements by specifying them as matters which disqualify households from eligibility for social housing support in the context of section 20 assessment procedures.  In particular, concern was expressed at the non-discretionary nature of the provision and also at the broadness of the breach of tenancy condition, that is, that any breach of an agreement, regardless of its seriousness, could result in a household not being eligible for social housing support.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There was also discussion on the interaction of section 25 with section 34, which sets out arrangements for the operation of a hardship clause where money is due to a housing authority.  The tenor of the argument was to point out the contrast between the discretion allowed for in section 34 and the lack thereof in section 25.  In response to the debate in the Seanad I indicated that my Department would examine the matter in consultation with the Parliamentary Counsel.  Having done so, I moved amendment No. 26 on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il to moderate the <Col N="600"/>measures somewhat by substituting a new subsection (5).  The new provision refers to the issue of rent arrears only and does not now refer to the breach of tenancy.  In addition, while the amendment maintains the mandatory feature of the disqualification of social housing support, it is tempered by linking the provision to the measures contained in section 34.</P>
        <P>The net effect of the amendment is to provide an applicant for social housing support with the opportunity to avoid the sanction of disqualification from eligibility if he or she enters into an agreement with the housing authority for the payment of outstanding money due.  I think this is a fair reassessment of the provision and I thank the Senators, particularly Senators Bacik and Norris, who raised the matter with some vigour on Committee Stage.</P>

	<P>I acknowledge that the Minister of State took on board the views expressed in the Seanad.  Strong views were expressed during the debate on Committee Stage with regard to these miscellaneous measures.  Some Senators felt the breach of tenancy agreements and rent arrears, while they did happen, were dealt with too harshly by the legislation.  I acknowledge there is a softening of sanction, provided agreements are entered into by the tenant and the local authority which protect the interests of the local authority and the State.  I welcome that and acknowledge that the Minister listened to the views expressed in the House.  These amendments reflect that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>The reassessment has resulted in a fair balance.  Obviously, people must meet their responsibilities but there are hardship cases.  The county manager is entitled to waive whole or part of rent arrears in certain circumstances.  The housing authorities have used that entitlement on compassionate grounds in certain areas in the past and I am sure that will continue.  It is provided for in law.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Group 6, amendments Nos. 9, 12, 115 to 133, inclusive, 140 and 141, 154 and 155, relate to affordable dwelling purchase arrangements.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>These amendments provide for the introduction of significant changes in the way affordable housing is made available for sale under various affordable housing schemes.  They provide for a shift to the equity sharing arrangement and away from the current procedures which involve a time-limited clawback in return for a discounted house.  The provisions, which were signalled in the budget of 2009 and are covered under amendments Nos. 115 to 133, inclusive, provide the legislative powers necessary for this equity sharing arrangement, together with enabling powers for an open market component to replace the current shared ownership scheme in due course.</P>
        <P>Under the new arrangements the purchase transaction will be largely unchanged from the purchaser&rsquo;s perspective.  However, instead of the units being sold at a discounted price, as they are currently, with the value of the discount being subject to a clawback that reduces over time, the housing authority will take a stake in the affordable unit sold.  The purchaser will have the option of either buying out the outstanding stake in steps or, alternatively, at the end of a fixed period of 35 years.  The various affordable housing schemes will continue to operate unchanged as the means of supplying affordable units but third purchasers will have the single affordable housing purchase mechanism available to them.  The stake held by the housing authority will be equivalent to the percentage below the market value at which the property is sold to the affordable purchaser.  Generally, affordable housing units are sold at 20% to 25% below the market value so I anticipate that the housing authority&rsquo;s share will be pitched at around this level.</P><Col N="601"/>
        <P>The new arrangements mean that affordable housing products can be tailored more closely to an individual&rsquo;s ability to pay.  Undoubtedly, the new arrangements are not as financially advantageous to households as the existing arrangements have proven over the years.  However, our basic objective in the provision of affordable housing is to support home ownership for households unable to purchase in the market without some degree of assistance from the State.  It is not about creating wealth.  The various affordable housing schemes in place provide a welcome means of bridging the affordable gap for households ready to take the step into home ownership but who require a modest level of support.  I believe the new arrangements will not only enhance supply but also offer better value for the State and provide a more equitable means of supporting the valid home ownership aspirations of the prospective purchasers.</P>
        <P>A small number of consequential amendments have also been agreed, which provide for a number of minor changes to provisions relating to affordable housing under the Housing Acts 1992 and 2002 and Part V of the Planning and Development Act, as well as deletions of proposed changes to the provisions of the 1992 and 2002 Acts for which the Bill provides.  These are now needed given the wider changes proposed under the substantive amendments.  The changes follow certain recommendations made in the report, Increasing Affordable Housing Supply, which was prepared by consultants for the Affordable Homes Partnership and subsequently published for public consultation following Government approval.  The report also identified measures that would assist in responding to the ambitious targets for affordable housing in Towards 2016.  During the consultation process, the shift towards an equity sharing arrangement, as now proposed, was supported by all the social partners.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>There was wide debate on affordable housing when this Bill was before the Seanad.  The changing market conditions show the need for changes in legislation to allow local authorities to sell affordable housing units in a more flexible manner than was previously permitted under legislation.  It was necessary to address that and this Bill goes a long way towards implementing that flexibility in the market which will allow people who aspire to home ownership to get on the property ladder and own their own house.  With market conditions in flux at present it is difficult to determine what is an affordable house.  Three years ago we fully understood what an affordable house was and how it could benefit people who wished to own a house.  However, with the fall in the market value of all houses, flexibility is required to reflect the current reality.  Local authorities need flexibility to give people the opportunity to buy such units.</P>
        <P>Will the Minister clarify the number of affordable housing units held by local authorities at present?  A substantial number of the units held by local authorities throughout the country are unsold.  There are still housing lists in the local authorities.  Where affordable housing units are not and cannot be sold even though they have been on the market for some time, has the Minister issued guidelines to the local authorities to advise them that they can recategorise these units so they can, for example, introduce them into the incremental purchase scheme or offer them as social housing to people on the housing lists?  That further flexibility is now required.  Perhaps the Minister will deal with it through a circular or guidelines to local authorities and housing directors.</P>
        <P>That would be a welcome development to address the current market conditions and the requirements of people on housing lists or those who might wish to buy houses.  The authorities could free them from the affordable sector and make it more flexible for people to move into those accommodations.  The Minister is aware that there are hundreds, if not thousands, of these units in the ownership of local authorities as a result of the Part V arrangements.  To some degree local authorities have been victims of their own success in this regard given that they acquired many units under Part V.  Now, however, the units are idle and vacant.  The <Col N="602"/>flexibility in the legislation must be extended to allow those units to be inhabited and to accommodate families.  I await the Minister&rsquo;s views in this regard.  I believe this must be done and local authorities must understand clearly that they have such flexibility, if that is the case.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <?oasys _cl14.5- ?><Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>The number of houses the local authorities have on their books is estimated to be approximately 3,700.  In some cases local authorities are finding it difficult but I am informed that they are possibly in a position to sell 1,000.  To ensure this important infrastructure is available to the people who need it, that is, those on housing lists, I have issued guidelines to local authorities.  These relate to the sale of dwellings on the open market at the market price &mdash; to accommodate that I recently increased the local authority loan limit to &euro;220,000; the sale of dwellings to local authority tenants under the incremental purchase scheme; the use of appropriate local authority properties to house persons currently obtaining rent supplement under a RAS type scheme for a temporary period; and use of temporary social housing supports under leasing arrangements.  The final position is where funds are available and where appropriate housing authorities may consider taking the units into their permanent housing stock to be allocated as social housing.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We have given a large degree of flexibility to the housing authorities in this regard.  There has been comment on this in the media and I insisted on taking part in a programme on RTE radio some weeks ago because there was some very negative presentation regarding the position of affordable houses.  I felt it necessary to take part and present the correct factual situation, as did a member of Dublin City Council.  These houses are an important infrastructure of the State albeit they are in the local authority system.  Some 3,700 houses have been built and are in the possession of our local authorities.  At another time we might say we were delighted to provide that number of houses.  We now have them in addition to those in the other schemes and they will be put into use for the best purposes, albeit perhaps not that for which they were originally intended.</P>
        <P>We must monitor and engage continually with the local authorities who have these houses.  Not all do.  There is a close connection between us and the authorities which is continual so we will be able to see how the scheme progresses.  We believe this matter will be resolved in the best interests of people on our housing lists.</P>
        <P>There is a minor cross-reference error in the Bill to a provision in the Planning and Development Act 2000 which will be corrected ahead of the Bill&rsquo;s enactment by way of the clerk&rsquo;s correction.</P>
        <P>I thank Members for their contributions during the course of the Bill, in its earlier passage through the House and again today, and for their report on amendments made in the D&aacute;il.  Members of this House have raised important matters in respect of the Bill and all  are reflected in the final document. Key provisions in respect of the tenant purchase of apartments and homeless action plans will have a statutory basis when the Bill is enacted.</P>
        <P>The primary aim of the Bill remains, namely, to give legislative effect to the reforms set out in delivering homes and sustaining communities.  That document set out a vision to guide the transformation of the housing sector over the medium term by delivering more and better quality housing responses and by doing so in a more strategic way that focused on the building of sustainable communities.  I believe the Bill is a key element in the practical implementation of that agenda.  I look forward to its enactment and moving on to the crucial implementation phase.</P><Col N="603"/>
        <P>Again, I thank Senators.  I brought the Bill to this House initially and had it read for a second time in this Chamber and am glad I did so because I spent almost 14 years in the Seanad.  The contribution of Members was very constructive and thoughtful.  I am glad to see Members of the House believe we have responded in so far as we could to the concerns they raised on Second and Committee Stages.

      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>If it is appropriate, I wish to comment on the passing of the Bill.  I thank the Minister of State for commencing the Bill in the Seanad Chamber where there was a great deal of discourse and debate regarding all the provisions it contained.  There was much engagement by all sides in the Bill.  The legislation tackles serious areas in our local authority areas that needed urgent attention, such as anti-social behaviour, improving how local authorities engage with housing applicants, how they function and the entire area of housing under their responsibility.  Homelessness was mentioned as a significant area that required attention and I believe there is good provision within the Bill.  Housing assistance programmes were intended to allow people get on the property ladder and give them the opportunity to own a place of their own.  All that is left, now that the Bill is going to pass, is to ask the Minister of State and his Department officials to ensure local authorities are communicated with well concerning the contents of this Bill so that it can be implemented in as full and proper a fashion as possible in the relevant administrative areas. </P>
        <P>I thank the Minister of State for listening to the debate and taking on board the views of all Members.  I thank his officials for their time and effort.  The Bill is comprehensive and complex and will have a major impact on our social housing policy and on how our local authorities implement that policy locally.   We in the Fine Gael Party broadly welcome this Bill and hope to see the fruits of that improvement in trying to house people who badly need accommodation.</P>

    <Title>Music Therapy. </Title>
      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for allowing me to raise the important issue of music therapy in the House and I thank the Minister of State for staying on to answer the Adjournment debate.  The Ministers of State, Deputies John Moloney and Jimmy Devins, and their predecessors will be very familiar with this matter because in September 2006 after a year&rsquo;s research I completed a report, Defining Music Therapy, on behalf of the Joint Committee on Arts, Sports, Tourism, Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, of which I was Chairman at the time.  Before I started the research I knew clearly that music therapy was very important but when I finished it I was shocked that although students can qualify as music therapists from the University of Limerick, the only location on the island of Ireland where students can so qualify, there is no professional recognition in this country for the profession of music therapist.  On the other hand, if students leave the University of Limerick and go to Northern Ireland, they will be treated in the same fashion as occupational, speech and language therapists and physiotherapists.  They are not physical therapists or &ldquo;musical&rdquo; therapists but are in the same category as all the recognised professions in our health sector.</P>
        <P>In the context of our current economic situation there are many people who might not have admitted to or perhaps might not have had mental health difficulties in the past.  There is a move to try to deal with mental health in a new way and I commend Senator Frances Fitzgerald, who is present, and Deputy Chris Andrews, who were involved today in the inauguration of a special cross-party, cross-sectoral approach to the issue of mental health.  That shows there is an issue that must be addressed.</P>
        <P>I have been dealing with this matter since 2006 in trying to have that professional recognition established.  I commend the Ministers of State who have been in charge of this area because they have made efforts to ensure that we at least know the path and have been cogent in our arguments.  I recognise Professor Jane Edwards of University of Limerick on the magnificent work being done there.  At different times, one can hear her on RTE explaining that work.</P>
        <P>Music therapy plays a central role in preventing repetitive behaviour and improving speech in autistic children, in returning speech to stroke victims and making Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease patients comfortable, as music is one of the only senses that transcends both sides of the brain.  While people with Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease might not get better because of music therapy, they will have a better quality of life.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Everything in health must be backed up by facts and statistics.  Previously, one could state that something was anecdotally this or that, but there are now facts to support the claim that music therapy works, and it should be central to any theme.  In every other English language health system, it is central.  I will not bore anyone with facts, but I will cite some of the comments made by people working in the system.  The majority of symptoms in children and adults, including attention deficit disorder, learning disabilities, autism, obsessive compulsive disorder, depression, anxiety, chronic pain and many more, are the direct result of electrical imbalances in the brain.  Many environmental factors can produce such an imbalance of electrical activity and function of both sides of the brain.  These have been documented as an increase of activity on one side or a decrease of activity on the other side.  Research has shown that the side of the brain that is most problematic is most often the side that is understimulated.  Brain balance music as a stimulant can be a powerful tool in achieving that balance.</P><Col N="605"/>
        <P>I am not discussing someone feeling better because I played a guitar or sang a song.  This is a clinical intervention that uses music to bring people out of themselves, to discover problems and to work in a multidisciplinary team to ensure that the patient can be clinically assessed and given a programme and can come out the other side as a functional person.</P>
        <P>Dr. Oliver Sacks, who is relatively famous for writing many books from which a number of films were made, including &ldquo;Awakenings&rdquo;, described music therapy.  He is claimed to be superb in that he surveys the use of music as a therapy, how singing can transform the brain&rsquo;s right hemisphere into an efficient linguistic organ when the left has been knocked out by a stroke and how rhythmic music can unlock the movements of sufferers of Parkinson&rsquo;s disease by imposing an external beat on their frozen internal clocks.  Since music memory seems to survive longer than&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It is sad that these facts are not recognised in Ireland whereas they are recognised internationally.  I hope that the House will be told of further moves in respect of the professional recognition of music therapy.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>I am taking this matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney.  I am pleased to have this opportunity to address the issues raised by Senator Keaveney.  I  emphasise the Government&rsquo;s steadfast commitment to people with disabilities and to the national disability strategy and its long-term goals and objectives, which we will continue to pursue in the coming years in partnership with all the key stakeholders.  The co-ordination and planning of services to meet the needs of people with disabilities form a central tenet of the strategy.  A critical element of such co-ordination and planning is the requirement to provide financial support for the development and implementation of services.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Significant investment has taken place in mental health services in line with the report, A Vision for Change.  This includes the development of community mental health teams and a significant expansion of child and adolescent mental health teams, which has led to an increase in the number of psychiatrists and therapists employed.  The Health Service Executive, HSE, aims to provide access to therapy services that are of a high quality, sustainable and orientated towards optimal outcome.  A range of therapeutic supports is provided for people with mental health difficulties, people with disabilities, including autism, and other service users.  The provision of such therapies depends upon the assessed needs of an individual.  Likewise, significant funding has been allocated in recent years under the multi-annual investment programme, which facilitated the prioritisation of therapy services in specialist disability services.  Since 2005, there has been an increase of approximately 397 whole-time equivalents in the level of multidisciplinary supports, including speech and language therapists, occupational therapists and physiotherapists being employed in specialist disability services.</P>
        <P>The Disability Act 2005, which commenced on 1 June 2007 for children aged five years or younger, sets out a legal footing for the assessment of children who have the right to have their needs assessed within specific timelines.  The Act also gives people with disabilities, including autism, who meet the criteria set out in the Act the right to a statement from the HSE setting out the services that will be provided to meet the needs identified in the assessment report.</P><Col N="606"/>
        <P>The HSE recognises the importance of providing therapy services and the significance of a multidisciplinary approach in their provision.  While the HSE recognises the benefits of specific therapies such as music therapy, this form of therapy are not among the range of therapies that are frequently selected to meet the assessed needs of individuals.</P>
        <P>As the Senator is aware, music, drama, art and dance are collectively known as creative arts therapies.  Creative arts therapists work on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis in a variety of health care and educational settings.  There is no formal grade of creative arts therapist within the health service.  The current professional status of such grades has been the subject of ongoing discussions between the Department of Health and Children and the HSE.  A business case regarding the establishment of a grade of creative arts therapist was submitted by the HSE to the Department of Health and Children last year.  It was examined and the Department requested further detailed clarification from the national HR directorate of the HSE to quantify and document fully the level of service being provided by persons within the health service currently undertaking work similar to that of the creative arts therapist.  The detailed information requested is being awaited and, as such, the process has yet to be finalised.</P>
        <P>However, as the Senator is aware, the significant demands on all public services are increasing and the priority for our health services in respect of disability services will be the provision of clinical therapies.  This does not detract from the importance of such therapies as music, art and drama to an individual&rsquo;s quality of life, but it signals the need for prioritisation.</P>
        <P>I reaffirm the Government&rsquo;s commitment to people with disabilities, the national disability strategy and its long-term goals and objectives, which we will continue to pursue in the coming years in partnership with all the key stakeholders.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>To counter the argument that music therapy is not frequently used, professionals cannot be kept in Ireland if music therapy is not recognised as they will not be paid amounts equivalent to that paid elsewhere.  There are also few full-time jobs.  Does the Minister of State agree that we should prioritise music therapy further?  Milford Hospice in Limerick is a good example of it working well.</P>

    <Title>School Accommodation. </Title>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I am raising the issue of Gaelscoil na Cam&oacute;ige in Clondalkin village.  I regret that I must table this Adjournment matter, but the position of the school is critical.  It has immediate needs surrounding two classrooms that the board of management recently decided could no longer remain open.  This meant that young children had to carry their desks and chairs across the yard to temporary accommodation.  There are serious questions as to how these children and classes will be accommodated in September.  This is an immediate crisis for the school, parents and children.  Will the Minister convey to the Department the serious concerns of the parents and teachers and everyone associated with the school?</P>
        <P>I understand discussions are taking place between South Dublin County Council and the Department of Education and Science.  We need the Department to clarify what will happen. <Col N="607"/> Will another site be found?  Will the Department pay for prefabs on another site?  Will it help with the procurement of a site and co-operate with the parents and management to ensure another site will be found and that funding will be made available to replace those prefabs that need to be replaced?</P>
        <?oasys _cl13.5- ?><P>The future of the school is a more considerable issue.  The prefabs in the school are extremely old.  Health and safety reports point to all sorts of problems, ranging from dampness and fire hazards to emergency exits opening the wrong way.  The general state of the building is poor and this is of major concern.  The quality of the teaching in the school is wonderful and the parents are very happy about it but the prefabs are far too old to continue using them for more than 200 children.</P>
        <P>Before the previous general election it was said there would be a new campus.  The most recent reply on this issue I have from the Minister states it is the Department&rsquo;s intention to provide the school with a new building and that agreement has been reached to provide a new building on a VEC-owned site.  This was said before the general election.  There is meant to be a large new gaelscoil campus but a serious question mark hangs over it.  Will the project, costing &euro;10 million to &euro;12 million, go ahead?  If so, it will be fantastic and the site will be great for the school.  Parents certainly want it.  However, this would be some years down the road and in the meantime there will be a major problem.</P>
        <P>The school&rsquo;s third and fourth class classrooms are being closed for health and safety reasons.  The school, in its current condition, cannot guarantee it will be able to accommodate children in these classes in September.  This is the immediate issue and it requires an immediate response from the Department.  It must respond to the crisis facing the school in terms of the two classes, costs, the supply of prefabs and engagement between parents and the Department on finding a suitable site.  The longer-term question concerns the location of the school and when a new building will be provided.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Finneran</NameTxt>
	<P>I am happy to respond to the debate on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, who unfortunately cannot be in the House this evening.  I thank the Senator for raising this matter as it provides me with the opportunity to outline to the Seanad the Government&rsquo;s strategy for capital investment in education projects and also to outline the current position on Gaelscoil na Cam&oacute;ige, Clondalkin.</P>
        <P>Modernising facilities in our existing building stock, in addition to responding to emerging needs in areas of rapid population growth, is a significant challenge.  The Government is determined to improve the condition of our school buildings and to ensure the appropriate facilities are in place to enable the implementation of the curriculum.</P>
        <P>The allocation for school buildings in 2009 is &euro;614 million.  This represents a significant investment in the schools building and modernisation programme.  This funding for the building programme, at a time of great pressure on public finances, is a sign of the very real commitment of this Government to investing in school infrastructure and will permit the continuation of progress in the overall improvement of school accommodation.</P>
        <P>All applications for capital funding are assessed in the planning and building unit of the Department of Education and Science.  The assessment process determines the extent and type of need presenting based on the demographics of an area, proposed housing developments, the condition of buildings, site capacity etc., leading ultimately to an appropriate accommodation solution.  As part of this process, a project is assigned a band rating under published prioritisation criteria for large-scale building projects.  These criteria were devised following consultation with the education partners.</P>
        <P>Projects are selected for inclusion in the schools building and modernisation programme on the basis of priority of need.  This is reflected in the band rating assigned to a project.  In other <Col N="608"/>words, a proposed building project moves through the system commensurate with the band rating assigned to it.  There are four band ratings overall, of which band one is the highest and band four the lowest.  Band one projects, for example, include the provision of buildings where none currently exist but where there is a high demand for pupil places, while a band four project makes provision desirable, but it would not necessarily relate to urgent or essential facilities.  I refer to a library or new sports hall.</P>
        <P>The position on Gaelscoil na Cam&oacute;ige is that this school is a fully vertical, co-educational primary school catering for children from junior infants to sixth class.  The school has a core staff comprising a principal and eight mainstream teachers.  It also has the services of two resource teachers.  The school authority is renting temporary accommodation which is located on the grounds of &Aacute;ras Chr&oacute;n&aacute;in.  &Aacute;ras Chr&oacute;n&aacute;in occupies the southern part of the site and is a centre for Irish cultural activities in the Clondalkin area.  &Aacute;ras Chr&oacute;n&aacute;in is also the trustee of Gaelscoil na Cam&oacute;ige and the site and prefabs are owned by Muintir Chr&oacute;n&aacute;in.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The school&rsquo;s enrolment on 30 September 2008 was 228 pupils, an increase of 6%, or 12 pupils, on the September 2007 enrolment.  It is the Department&rsquo;s intention to provide Gaelscoil na Cam&oacute;ige with a new building.  In this regard, agreement has been reached to provide the new building on a VEC-owned site.  The next stage is the appointment of a design team for the project.  However, given the competing demands on the Department&rsquo;s capital budget, it is not possible at this stage to be precise about when the design team will be appointed.</P>
        <P>The school authority had contacted the Department regarding the condition of one of the prefabs it is renting.  It has been advised that the landlord should provide accommodation of a suitable standard.  Last week the school authority contacted the Department outlining proposals for accommodating third and fourth class pupils from September 2009.  The Department is in ongoing contact with the school regarding its accommodation needs from September 2009 and is providing advice and assistance.</P>
        <P>The progression of all large-scale building projects, including this project, from initial design stage through to construction, is dependent on the prioritisation of competing demands given the funding available under the Department&rsquo;s capital budget.  The project for Gaelscoil na Cam&oacute;ige will continue to be considered in the context of the Department&rsquo;s multi-annual schools building and modernisation programme.</P>
        <P>I thank the Senator for affording me the opportunity to outline to the Seanad the current position regarding the school building project for Gaelscoil na Cam&oacute;ige.  I noted the Senator&rsquo;s comments on parents and others and I will forward them to the Minister.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister of State convey to the Department of Education and Science the urgency of this case?  There is nothing in the Minister of State&rsquo;s reply saying the new site will be made available soon.  It is a reiteration of the old position.  There is no news on when the new building may become available.  Will the Minister of State ask the Department to engage constructively with the parents and board of management to find a solution, at least for the two classrooms closed down at present, so the children can be accommodated from September onwards?</P>
