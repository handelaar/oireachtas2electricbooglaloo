	<P>I have received notice from Senator Cecilia Keaveney that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to make the necessary changes to ensure students can apply for their student grant at the same time as they apply for their college place in January 2010.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Jerry Buttimer of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to outline the plans he has to allow people to vote from home and extend the postal franchise for elections.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>The Order of Business is No. 1, Labour Services (Amendment) Bill 2009 &mdash; Second Stage, to be taken at the conclusion of the Order of Business and conclude not later than 7 p.m., if not previously concluded, on which spokespersons may speak for 15 minutes and all other Senators for ten minutes and on which Senators may share time, by agreement of the House.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>The decision of Allied Irish Banks to appoint one of its own as managing director at a purported salary of &euro;633,000 is a direct challenge to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, and the Government.  This is the second major internal appointment by AIB.  The Minister clearly called for external appointees to be appointed.  The timing of the decision is an absolute disgrace, coming only days after the NAMA legislation has gone through the Oireachtas.  Either we place a cap on salaries or we do not.  I hope the Minister will walk the walk rather than talk the talk on this matter.  I do not believe any mechanisms should be found, either through bonuses or otherwise, to conceal the true salaries of senior banking figures.  The credibility and authority of the Minister and the Government are being brought into question.  It is time the Government took action and stood up to the <Col N="336"/>banks.  After all, we own many of them.  This is happening at a time when the Government will be demanding sacrifices from everyone in the community.</P>
        <P>On Sunday week last the<i> Sunday Independent</i> published photographs of the houses of union officials and their salaries.  Whatever about the salaries, the publication of photographs of their houses was a gross invasion of privacy.  Of even greater significance is the fact that it published a photograph of the house of the secretary of the Irish Bank Officials Association, with a photograph of the family car without the registration plates blotted out.  This is a gross breach of security&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;at at time when the Garda Commissioner is calling on everyone to be cautious.  It was grossly irresponsible of the newspaper to do so.  It should send an apology because it is putting people&rsquo;s lives at risk.</P>
        <P>Several Senators on this side of the House have called for a debate on social partnership and the economy to take place this week.  It is not on the agenda and for this reason we oppose the Order of Business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>The point made by Senator Cummins about the appointment referred to was raised previously by my colleague Senator Ross and it is significant.  I ask Members to cast their minds back to the point made by me during the debate on the NAMA Bill last week when I said guidelines on credit control and the granting of credit were not worth the paper they were written on because the Minister could not direct the banks to do anything.  I have felt all along that this is the case.  We have no way of knowing whether this is the correct appointment.  We can have views on it one way or the other, but the Minister needs to provide a legislative basis and statutory imperative for his decisions.  There is no point in lifting the telephone or saying nice words to the banks, as it will not work in terms of the provision of credit or anything else.  There should be a process agreed at the AGM by the shareholders for this appointment.  The simple question of whether they would get someone else interested in the position would be answered if they placed an advertisement in the international newspapers.  Nobody needs to argue about the matter.</P>
        <P>Regarding the repayment and the reward, last week I referred to the French finance Minister raising this question.  This week Mr. Gordon Brown announced he would publish legislation to allow him to intervene if he thought payments to bank leaders were too high.  We should do the same here.  We should not be arguing across the House every week, rather we should give in legislation the Minister for Finance the right to do certain things in his dealings with the banks.  They should not be guidelines, words of advice or wish lists but decisions with a statutory basis.  Until that is done in an open way, we will not know what is going on and will not be able to have trust and confidence.</P>
        <P>I refer to the distraction caused by the Government&rsquo;s cynical announcement about laptops being given to every school.  At a time when schools have neither a proper connection to broadband, when bandwidth is too narrow, even for one computer if there is one in the school, and when schools are dependent on a satellite connection where bandwidth is not wide enough and services are patchy and unreliable at domestic level, it seems this is a soft focus photo opportunity and a distraction from the real issues such as the attempts to increase the size of classes, reduce the amount of money for administration in schools and the numbers of teachers.  This announcement should be put in its proper context.  It is a cynical distraction from the real issues in the education system at a time when there is much more to be done.  I talked about and asked for and welcomed the introduction of ICT in schools during the years but this is <Col N="337"/>hardly the way to go about doing it.  Let us have the broadband connection first and then we can proceed with the laptop scheme afterwards.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>As we had a fair level of debate on the banks last week, I will not dwell on the point.  The central objective of the NAMA project is to get credit flowing in the economy.  I cannot understand the contradiction at the heart of the argument in favour of NAMA made by some colleagues in the House.  They freely state they do not believe credit will flow again, yet they still support the NAMA project.  I cannot understand this.  If one does not think the central objective will be achieved, how can one possibly support it?  I am open to someone giving me the answer but it seems to be a fundamental contradiction.</P>
        <P>I respectfully disagree with Senator O&rsquo;Toole on the laptop initiative.  I welcome the decision of the Minister for Education and Science, surprising as it may seem for me to do so.  We are examining these matters in the run-up to the budget and the question of cuts is being debated.  According to reports in the British press this morning, the British Secretary of State for Education is making a big play of protecting and preserving spending on education.  Therefore, the ICT initiative in schools is important.  However, it is very limited and far from being enough.  I agree with Senator O&rsquo;Toole on broadband but if we are to be fair in the House, we should welcome such an initiative, however modest it is.  From my family and children elsewhere, I know access to ICT techniques in schools is of vital importance.  When I was a member of South Dublin County Council, I was very proud when the Labour Party-led council was able to provide a laptop not just for every classroom but for every individual pupil in St. Aidan&rsquo;s, a secondary school in west Tallaght.  Senator Hannigan tells me that in Uruguay a laptop is provided for every school pupil.  This is a move in the right direction and should be welcomed.  I agree that it does not go far enough.  Will the Leader do what he can to ensure spending in education?  In other decades with other generations we saw that preserving spending on education set a very important baseline for the future success of the economy.</P>
        <P>I agree with what Senator Cummins stated on salaries in banks.  Does the Minister&rsquo;s writ run in the banks or not?  Whether he can make stick his statement on a &euro;500,000 per annum will be a big test.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>As with other speakers I have concerns about the extent to which our financial institutions, despite the bank guarantee and recapitalisation schemes and the passing of the NAMA legislation after a great deal of detailed debate in this House, still act as though they are the people who write legislation and make the rules in this country.  We need to debate this in the House.  Clear signals have to go out to our banks and financial institutions that they are the groups being rescued by the Irish taxpayer despite their lack of competence at the very least in bringing about the economic turmoil that has resulted.  Who they can hire and at what rate are not decisions that should be solely theirs from here on in.  I have been shocked at the degree to which statements are made by financial institutions taking their policy as being writ before reaching any agreement with the Department of Finance or the Minister.</P>
        <P>The debate on NAMA is now less about the vehicle for delivering recapitalisation and funds to the institutions to allow lending in the economy and more about the extent to which these banks and financial institutions are prepared to change their culture and behave differently in the new economy that needs to operate.  The individuals who head one institution seem to act in a continual state of hubris.  This is not in the interests of the country and does not respect the wishes of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  We need to send out a clear signal through debate and, if necessary, through directive legislation to see that this type of behaviour does not persist.</P>
        <P>I invariably agree with Senator O&rsquo;Toole but I disagree with his denigrating of the proposal on laptop computers for schools.  A debate on education and the protection of its funding, as called for by Senator Alex White would be&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="338"/>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>They are unrelated issues.  These are like white elephants in the classroom.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>They should be discussed in the context of a debate in the House.  We will always be in a chicken and egg situation on whether we should develop information technology hardware or the software and technology that allows us to use it.  I would be happy to see any advance in supplying additional equipment and improving technology in the education sector.  The point of the most recent revised programme for Government was to include protective measures for the pupil-teacher ratio and elevate education as an area of expenditure that needs short-term protection.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>I concur entirely with Fine Gael&rsquo;s acting leader, Senator Maurice Cummins, on how the banks are running roughshod over the Minister and I compliment Senator Boyle on speaking so frankly and showing gumption by standing up and stating the case as it is.  I regret this did not arise in last week&rsquo;s debate.  It is quite repulsive that the banks still call the shots in deciding how they will appoint their personnel.  It is disgusting and I feel sorry for the Minister that he is so embarrassed.</P>
        <P>On the Adjournment debate I raised the fact that medical cards for all those aged over 70 are dealt with centrally in Dublin.  I got through to the local office this morning after calling the freefone number repeatedly for three days but officials there could not help me, even though they went out of their way in trying to do so.  I spoke to a lovely person who told me that I was lucky to have reached the office because up to 30 people could be waiting in the telephone queue.  The website advised people over the age of 70 years to contact the HSE by e-mail or freefone but did not provide a contact name.  This is the sole recourse available to a person who was given a medical card only to have it cold-heartedly removed in one fell swoop.  The gentleman in question is attending a pain specialist and will have to purchase expensive medication.  His circumstances have not changed in any shape or form.  The official with whom I spoke referred the matter to her supervisor for a response.  I demand that the Minister for Health and Children defend her policies before the House.  I received a letter from her stating she was forwarding a question on open heart surgery on a baby with Down&rsquo;s syndrome to the HSE.  However, when I telephone the HSE, I receive no positive answer for the over 70s.  Where does the buck stop?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Senator Ann Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>I commend the Minister for Education and Science on providing laptop computers for schools.  Backup infrastructure will be required to implement the laptop policy but I welcome the decision because it will further move us into the smart economy. </P>
        <P>The supplementary report on the findings and recommendations of the National Economic and Social Forum explored the connection between child literacy and social inclusion and asked why literacy levels remained low among pupils in disadvantaged areas.  Given that a national policy framework on literacy is about to be launched, we have a golden opportunity to discuss the reasons the barriers to literacy remain, even after concentrating on the issue for 25 years.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>I endorse much of what has been said about the appointment in AIB, news of which has leaked out in the past ten days.  As Senator Alex White noted, this issue concerns authority and who makes the decisions in this country.  More than six months ago the Minister for Finance and the Government made it clear that the appointment would be external.  This was announced in the wake of the stunt the Bank of Ireland had pulled on the Minister in installing an insider as heir apparent within days of the previous chief executive&rsquo;s exit.  At least this time around the Minister was going to use his 25% shareholding to show who was boss but the banks have put up two fingers to the Government and said: &ldquo;We are not taking it <Col N="339"/>from you&rdquo;.  It is an extraordinary challenge to the credibility of a Government which has blinked after eyeballing the banks for six months.  The matter is much worse than the appointment of a chief executive because there has been a fudge in order to disguise his appointment as well as the installation of an AIB director as chairperson.  Two insiders have apparently been appointed to look after the interests of the taxpayer.  These guys have shown that they are not acting in the interests of the taxpayer at all.  That is not their job.  The Government has been defied and appears to be sitting back and accepting this defiance.</P>
        <P>I am not impressed by leaks indicating that Mr. Michael Somers, the head of the National Treasury Management Agency, will be installed as vice chairman of Allied Irish Banks.  This is an exercise in camouflage to give the bank respectability.  The vice chairman will be a eunuch because others in the bank will cannibalise him.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>To add to the comments of Senator Cummins and many others, the Minister must urgently clarify his position beyond doubt.  Having listened briefly to an interview he gave on the &ldquo;News at One&rdquo;, while I do not believe he has blinked &mdash; to use Senator Ross&rsquo;s term &mdash; the leaks indicate that the bank has engaged in a pre-emptive strike.</P>
        <P>The proposed dual role for the chairman gives rise to corporate governance issues.  More important, however, is that with a deposit guarantee and the National Asset Management Agency in place, by the time recapitalisation has been completed the Minister will be the majority shareholder in the banks.  As Senator Ross noted, this episode gives rise to an important question of authority.  It is ridiculous in the current circumstances that a bank should be able to ride roughshod over the Government.  The Minister must urgently clarify his position on the matter.</P>
        <P>Public interest directors have been appointed to the banks.  Perhaps the House could hear directly from Mr. Dick Spring, a highly reputable and reliable public interest director, and some of the other public interest directors on the matter.</P>
        <P>I welcome the lifting of the blockade at Killarney National Park and compliment the efforts of the Irish Hotels Federation, Killarney Tourism, Killarney Chamber of Commerce and other bodies which liaised intensively and engaged actively in recent days to help people to see light.  I also compliment Senator Boyle on his efforts last week which failed.  I ask the Leader, perhaps through the good offices of Senator Boyle, to ensure we redouble our efforts in the matter.  The persons involved have written to the Minister requesting that the five Oireachtas Members from Kerry South meet the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, urgently to break the impasse.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>To add to Senator Coghlan&rsquo;s comments, I ask the Leader to make direct contact with the State representative on the board of Allied Irish Banks, Mr. Dick Spring, to request an explanation as to how this matter arose, whether an application process was in place and, if so, how it was managed.  This would enable the House to deliberate on how the process was completed.</P>
        <P>Following the enactment of the National Asset Management Agency Bill last week, I request that the Leader ask the Minister for Finance when, under section 2(10) of the Bill, he proposes to issue guidelines on making credit available to small and medium-sized enterprises.</P><Col N="340"/>
        <P>I call for an urgent debate on the Border counties, specifically the issue of cross-Border shopping.  There is a serious anomaly as regards the VAT rate which stands at 15% north of the Border and 21.5% here.  As many Senators will have noted from media reports, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment stated at the weekend that people must decide whether to support Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government or employment in this jurisdiction.  I do not blame people for seeking value for money in these difficult times.  However, there is an onus on us to take an innovative approach to the VAT rate in the forthcoming budget, perhaps by adopting the French model of applying different VAT rates to different products.  This would ensure people would obtain value for money.  The House should have a debate on how we can best achieve this objective and provide supports.  I also pay tribute to the retailers of the north west, especially those in Sligo who have shown a lead in launching the fair dealers campaign.  A group of retailers throughout the north west have come together to slash their prices and give value for money in light of the changed economic situation we are in and to compete with an unfair playing field a few short miles away which has a different VAT rate.  They say it is as easy as ABC to support the economy because it assists economic recovery, benefits local services and creates local jobs.  We in the Oireachtas must do what we can to adjust the VAT rate to help such people compete and give families value for money, which is what they want.</P>

      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>It is clear there is immense concern on both sides of the House about the leaking of announcements from AIB and a need for a debate on control of the banks and who in them is calling the shots.  It is extraordinary, in the wake of the lengthy debates on NAMA we had last week, that the taxpayer is shouldering the entire risk but the State, which should act in the public interest, cannot assert any control over who is appointed to the boards of the banks.  How can the Government, which has &euro;54 billion worth of bargaining power, be forced into what has been described as a compromise whereby it appears that the bank&rsquo;s choice will be appointed chief executive?</P>
        <P>Senator MacSharry referred to section 2(10) of the National Asset Management Agency Bill.  As many colleagues will be aware the Labour Party tabled an amendment to that section which called for the establishment of a credit mediator along the lines of that established in France.  It would act as an ombudsman and intervene when banks fail to extend credit to viable businesses.  I again call for a debate on that or a similar model which could be set up under section 2(10) as it is currently constituted because it is urgently needed to get the banks lending in the public interest.  However, ownership and control of the banks is another question.</P>
        <P>I also ask for a debate on the use of imprisonment.  A report in <i>The Irish Times</i> yesterday&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>Was it about bankers?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>It was unrelated to bankers but Senator White has seen a link.  A debate on the use of imprisonment generally is needed.  The report in <i>The Irish Times</i> referred to Dr. Conor O&rsquo;Neill, a consultant psychiatrist at the Central Mental Hospital, who reports that 8% of male remand prisoners have psychotic symptoms, a rate ten times that in the community generally and which is of immense concern.  New prison in-reach and court liaison services were set up to try to divert people from custody.  We are lucky to have Professor Harry Kennedy coming to speak at a seminar I am facilitating on the subject of mental health among prisoners which will take place at noon tomorrow in the audio visual room.  I ask colleagues to attend it if they can to hear more on the subject.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="341"/>
      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Senator Ivor Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>Many comments have been made regarding the position of our banks.  I congratulate the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, on all he has done to correct our banking system and the manner in which he has diplomatically and correctly gone about assisting in changes in the management structures, given the hamstrung position in which he finds himself.  It is important that we have correction of our financial institutions, something which has been taking place.  There have been smooth transitions over recent months.  It is crucial that the best people are appointed to the appropriate positions and that the best mix of management teams are in position to deal with the current challenges.  On the situation pertaining in AIB, about which there has been much comment, we have not yet seen the position fully played out and will see appropriate action being taken by the Government.</P>
        <P>I ask the Leader to contact the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy John Gormley, or, if necessary, the local authorities.  I understand various local authorities have increased their commercial rates, a decision which is made by the elected members of the various councils.  However, business personnel are experiencing genuine difficulties in paying increased commercial rates.  Some mechanism will have to be found to accommodate the current difficulties.  I ask the Leader to contact the appropriate authority and to report back to the House thereafter.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with my colleagues who called for a debate on the banking matters that have been discussed so far this afternoon.  I disagree with Senator Callely&rsquo;s description of the Minister for Finance as being hamstrung at the moment.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>No previous Minister for Finance was more enabled or strengthened, in the context of the banking situation, than the current Minister, who led the way for the recapitalisation of the banks, introduced the banking guarantee scheme and was praised for his virtuoso performance during last week&rsquo;s debate on the National Asset Management Agency Bill 2009.  If any Minister in recent Irish history has had the ability to challenge the banks, it is the Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan.  That is what this country wants him to do now.  I would like to emphasise two points that have been made by my colleagues.  It has been repeatedly suggested during the debate on the banks that we need to change the culture of Irish banking.  Those who are at the forefront of that culture spoke in the last week when they said &ldquo;No&rdquo; to change.  They do not want it, which is why severe and strong Government action is vital.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We have a duty to emphasise the obvious point that the banking sector is perfectly willing to publicly challenge a decision taken by the Government that introduced NAMA, the recapitalisation scheme and the bank guarantee to assist that sector.  We must respond to the attempts of the banking sector to challenge the legitimacy of the Government&rsquo;s authority in this area.  They must be responded to and challenged.  I am aware that a recently published book, <i>Who Really Runs Ireland?</i>, is doing well in the bestseller lists in the run-up to Christmas.  It is clear who the banks believe to be really running Ireland.</P>

	<P>Last week, a constituent of mine was refused treatment by her doctor unless she paid &euro;50 on the basis that she did not have a current card.  The card in question was <Col N="342"/>reissued in April 2009 and is valid until 2011.  When I contacted the relevant processing office which has been centralised to Finglas, County Dublin &mdash; it is the opposite to decentralisation &mdash; I had to spend 15 minutes waiting on the telephone before I got a reply.  The information one is given in such circumstances might be inaccurate.  The whole situation is quite unacceptable.  I intend to resolve this case today, one way or the other.  I am prepared to contact this woman&rsquo;s doctor and direct him or her to provide services to my constituent, who has a current medical card.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister for Health and Children to come to this House to explain why this nonsense has been allowed to develop in the Department.  She is the ministerial head of the Department of Health and Children, and the Health Service Executive is responsible to her.  I understand that all medical cards are to be processed in Dublin from now on.  When they were dealt with in regional centres like Roscommon, everyone was able to get an immediate response.  This is a retrograde step.  We are going backwards, not forwards.  I ask the Minister, Deputy Harney, to come to the House to explain the HSE&rsquo;s inadequate response to my constituents&rsquo; concerns about the retention of medical cards.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to ask the Leader if he has any further news about the case of a Nigerian who is being deported.  I thank my colleagues from all sides of the House who wrote to the Minister about the case, which I have raised previously.  Last week, many of us met in the corridors a pair of engaging gentlemen who are lobbyists for the tobacco industry.  They disingenuously expressed concerns about the health of the nation and about tax receipts etc.  I have since been briefed by the Irish Heart Foundation, which has pointed out that the lobbyists&rsquo; concerns are hypocritical.  History clearly shows us that the global tobacco industry has been deeply implicated in the smuggling about which the lobbyists were complaining.  In 1998, for example, a British American Tobacco tax executive was convicted of accepting bribes from a smuggling syndicate in Hong Kong.  In 2004 Philip Morris had to pay $1.25 billion over 12 years so the European Commission would drop smuggling charges.  In 2008 Canada&rsquo;s two largest tobacco companies, Imperial Tobacco and Rothmans, pleaded guilty to aiding and abetting smuggling.  The reason they are squawking now is that the cigarettes are not theirs but are counterfeit and they are getting nothing out of it.  They are approaching us in order to put the squeeze on the Government not to do anything about raising tax revenue on tobacco in the forthcoming budget, which I sincerely hope the Government will do.  The real problem is the fines are too low and not enough people go to jail.</P>
        <P>Last week in this House the question of executions in America was raised.  The man in that case was brain damaged as was shown by medical examination.  He had various psychiatric disorders.  Mr. Justice Richard Johnson, who is retiring as a very distinguished judge, has suggested we should re-examine the death penalty because it might have a deterrent effect.  It has not in America.  Some 80% of executions in America are in the south.  The overwhelming majority of murders take place in the south.  It obviously does not deter.  In order to do this, we would need to disentangle ourselves from the European Union, the Council of Europe, and various treaties.  We would need to hold a constitutional referendum, which would be extremely complex and difficult.  It would seriously undermine our efforts diplomatically and internationally to intervene in places like China and Iran.  The Chinese are murdering people judicially in Tibet and we have all raised questions of people in Iran being executed whether they are women, Kurdish or gay people.  I strongly oppose this and I hope other Members will also.</P>

	<P>I compliment Senator Mullen on a recent television performance in which he made a robust defence of the rights of the individual, particularly when it comes to character and integrity.  We must accept that it is not acceptable to replace fact with fiction even if it is seen to be a good story.  A broadcaster has enormous power and influence, which must be used responsibly.  I am convinced that Senator Mullen would not have found himself in the position of having to defend the rights of the individual if he had not been a Member of this House and if he had not also expressed certain sentiments on this.  For that reason he brought kudos to this House and to all public representatives, and I salute him for having done so.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>As an associate member of a teaching union, I have been somewhat disturbed by the e-mails I have been receiving from the union encouraging me to vote in favour of industrial action.  It is the right of unions to do so, but the question is whether it is responsible for the union leadership to be encouraging strike action at a time of national economic collapse.  I do not believe they speak for the majority of teachers.  They do not speak for the majority of teachers I know, many of whom are partners of or married to people in the private sector.  Based on the ballot, 55% voted and of those 77% voted in favour, which is only approximately 40% of the total number of teachers.  I ask the Leader to make every effort to speak directly to the Taoiseach and the Minister for Education and Science to ask them to redouble their efforts to prevent this national day of strike next Tuesday.  I know it is the intention of the majority of teachers to be in the classroom.</P>
        <P>On the subject of laptops in schools, ICT is a very important learning tool.  Every study on literacy and learning indicates that computers in schools improve learning outcomes.  However, what is the point of computers if the school does not have reliable broadband connectivity?  What is the point of computers if teachers do not have adequate training to use them and to teach their pupils how to use them?  Funding for resource teachers who provide computer training was withdrawn last year.  This is too important an issue for anybody to play politics with it.  The reality is that the computers in schools programme is only a gimmick unless it is done right.  As such, I support others in calling for a debate on information and communications technology in schools.  There is no point in providing for that in some schools but not in others, thus creating further inequality in the education system.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnEllis"><NameTxt>Senator John Ellis</NameTxt>
	<P>I support those calling for a debate, prior to the budget, on the overall budgetary strategy.  There were suggestions in this House last week that students were sleeping in cars.  I understand Senator Buttimer undertook to investigate the veracity of these claims in Cork.  Will he report to the House on his findings, as he said he would?  I am sure he is diligent enough to have investigated the situation thoroughly.</P><Col N="344"/>
        <P>I agree with Senator Healy Eames&rsquo;s comments regarding teachers.  Several teachers have contacted me in the last week to say they are being forced to participate in strike action next week despite having no wish to do so.  First, they do not want to neglect their students and, second, the financial consequences of losing a day&rsquo;s pay will be severe for some of them.  We should ask the teaching unions to reconsider their position before next Tuesday.  There are ways for unions to protest that will not be at the expense of students and members alike.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>I draw Members&rsquo; attention to two good news stories in recent days.  The first is the reopening of the northbound Dublin commuter rail line following several months of disruption.  The project was a logistical nightmare but was completed within budget and ahead of schedule.  We must give Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann the credit it is due in this instance.  It will mean a significant improvement in journey times for thousands of commuters.</P>
        <P>Second, I welcome the results of yesterday&rsquo;s European-wide survey indicating that Irish road deaths are now among the lowest in Europe, having reduced by approximately 100 in the past two years.  Moreover, deaths on Irish roads are now at their lowest level since records began.  This achievement is the result not only of increased driver awareness but also of the introduction of random breath testing some years ago.  Credit is due to two persons in this regard, namely, Mr. Gay Byrne, in his capacity as chairman of the Road Safety Authority, and the Minister for Transport, Deputy Dempsey.  The latter stood firm in the face of substantial opposition to push that measure through.  It was the right action to take and has had a direct impact in saving hundreds of lives.  I urge the Minister to stay true to his principles by pushing ahead with the introduction of lower blood alcohol limits for motorists.  This survey suggests that the number of road deaths can be reduced further, perhaps even to as low as 100, if that change is made.  I compliment the Minister on his work to date and encourage him to persist with his proposals.</P>

	<P>Last week I inquired about the Internet streaming of the business of this House to the media, by which I referred to the broadcast media.  The only way to increase public awareness of the way in which debates are conducted in this Chamber is by letting the public see the work we do.  This House is host to a fine level of debate with many different views being expressed.  The debate is sometimes very lively, always useful and often non-partisan, as we saw this morning.  I thank Senator O&rsquo;Toole for clarifying the point, for those who were unaware of it, that our debates are streamed on the Internet.  That broadcasting should be extended to television stations.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not interrupt the Senator but he might note, if he checks the record, that the two budgets in the past 12 months were preceded by statements from the Fine Gael finance spokesperson on where specific cuts could be made and the same will happen in advance of the budget on 9 December.</P>
        <P>I join Senator Hannigan in congratulating CIE on its speedy success on the Dublin-Belfast line.  Will the Leader ascertain what will happen on the Dublin-Wexford line?  No sooner had one problem been solved when another emerged yesterday morning, which will seriously discommode many people who travel by train daily from the south east to Dublin daily to work.  May we have a debate before the budget on the future of the semi-State sector, with particular reference to a number of difficulties that have emerged in CIE and a number of other semi-State bodies?  They account for a significant proportion of public expenditure and we should have a discussion on the sector before the budget is finalised.</P>
        <P>I support colleagues who have expressed disagreement with the Department of Education and Science&rsquo;s announcement on the provision of laptops.  This is a good idea but based on where the Leader comes from, he will probably verify my view that one cannot access broadband services, including satellite broadband, everywhere. This is also the case in large chunks of counties Kilkenny and Carlow.  Providing laptops in schools where broadband is non-existent is akin to installing light fittings in buildings without providing an electricity supply.  While I agree it is a desirable objective and it is easy for those who represent urban areas to support it, this new provision will have no impact on those whose children go to school in rural Ireland where the infrastructure is not in place.</P>
        <P>Like previous speakers, I also condemn Allied Irish Banks over the leaked report that it will appoint another insider to the post of managing director.  The bank previously appointed an insider as chairman.  We own 25% of the institution and the Minister for Finance has pushed the NAMA legislation through both Houses.  He has significant clout in the Act to ensure the banks follow his lead and he should take action.</P>

	<P>Last April the Minister announced a cap of &euro;500,000 on the pay of chief executives but not on the pay of senior executives in banks.  It is interesting no such general limit applies to them.  The cap has been disregarded in this instance, which highlights why the Minister is bottom of the list in a <i>Financial Times</i> survey published today of finance Ministers in the European Union.  One of the criteria used was the swiftness with which Ministers had grasped what action was required and their effectiveness in implementation.  He failed that test.  The Minister has confirmed that we will be notifying the NAMA legislation which involves a bailout of Irish banks.  It must also comply with European Union guidelines, to which I have already referred.  One of those guidelines refers to a cap on executive pay.  Where the Minister fails perhaps the European Commission may pick up.</P>
        <P>Another survey featured in today&rsquo;s newspapers reports that the International Financial Services Centre has plummeted in international competitiveness rankings.  The IFSC contributes approximately &euro;1 billion in corporation tax revenue, which is 17% of our corporation tax take, and employs 25,000 people.  The head of State Street Bank in Ireland, Mr. William Slattery, has indicated that the recent 4% increase in levies brings the marginal tax rate to 48% and that this has had a detrimental effect on the competitiveness of the IFSC.</P>
        <P>The Labour Party and others propose a third rate of tax.  The Labour Party would apply the new rate to incomes above &euro;100,000.  While, superficially, this may seem attractive, it would have a serious cost to the State and would do irreparable damage to the IFSC which is such a source of tax revenue and employment.</P>

	<P>I thank Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute; for his kind words, which are deeply appreciated.  At a symposium on education in Crescent Comprehensive College, Limerick last weekend, which I addressed, a person raised the issue of the provision of electronic white boards in schools.  This led to a brief and interesting discussion of the merits of such white boards.  Many people were of the view that the jury is out on the question of whether they contribute to better educational attainment.  That said, it is clear that we are coming from very far behind in the provision of information and communications technology in our schools.  In this Chamber in the last year, I called for a trebling of our education spend.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s announcement regarding providing laptops and digital cameras in classrooms.  I also hear the good sense from Senators Joe O&rsquo;Toole, John Paul Phelan and others about the necessity of having broadband if any of this is to make sense.</P>
        <P>People have given various illustrations of this difficulty.  I am reminded of the lore about a politician from my own neck of the woods who, famously, in the 1970s met complaints from people that they were still waiting for telephones by the award of a little device from the boot of his car.  Of course, it took a long time after that for the telephone to be connected.</P>

	<P>I begin by replying, through the Chair, to Senator Ellis.  In Cork last weekend, I found that students are waiting for grants to be paid, living in very poor conditions and frustrated by the lack of leadership from the Department of Education and Science.  I support Senator Healy Eames in asking the Leader when the Student Support Bill will come to the House.  Senator Healy Eames is correct when she says this is a most fundamental question.  I invite Senator Ellis to come with me to Cork to see the conditions in some of our third level institutions and the living conditions endured by students.</P>
        <P>I join other speakers in asking the Leader to arrange a debate on the banking fraternity.  The culture in our banks has not changed.  This morning, Allied Irish Banks gave the two fingers to the people, who bailed it out through the bank guarantee scheme, recapitalisation and NAMA.

We can have all the pious words and great rhetoric but it is time for the Minister for Finance to act on behalf of the people.  We have bailed out the banks but the banks, in particular AIB this morning, showed they do not care about ordinary people or the Minister.

	<P>Senators Cummins, O&rsquo;Toole, Alex White, Boyle, McFadden, Ross, Coghlan, MacSharry, Bacik, Callely, Donohoe, John Paul Phelan, Regan and Buttimer all expressed views on the appointment of personnel in the banks.  No decision has been made yet.  I agree with many colleagues on the banks making money available and on the banks and the Government getting together to ensure the flow of credit starts.  The biggest concern of most of us in the House is that credit will be made available, especially for small and medium sized enterprises which employ more than 800,000, because of the NAMA legislation on which we worked so long and hard last week.  The way everyone who contributed last week conducted their affairs was a credit to them as was the standard of debate.</P>
        <P>Senators McFadden and Leyden raised the fact medical card applications for the over 70s are dealt with in Dublin.  It was a retrograde step to centralise everything in the capital.  We all know of the great service provided in the old health board areas by people who were fully committed.  The HSE has much to answer for and I will endeavour to get the Minister to come to the House to address the serious concern of every Senator in regard to the poor service provided which was outlined in the examples cited by Senators McFadden and Leyden.</P>
        <P>Senator Cummins, O&rsquo;Toole, Alex White and Boyle expressed views on the publication of photographs of the union leaders&rsquo; houses in a Sunday newspaper.

A considerable amount of legislation is before the House for our consideration this week.  Unfortunately, I will not be able to arrange statements on anything because legislation must be given priority.  As I informed the House last week, on Tuesday, 1 December we will have an all-day open-ended debate on the budget and the financial state of affairs so colleagues may make their views known to the Minister to help the Government with the challenging budget on 9 December.</P>
        <P>Senator MacSharry raised cross-Border shopping and reducing VAT.  He paid tribute to retailers in the north west and the value for money they are offering to help their businesses survive.  All these issues can be raised in the pre-budget debate on 1 December.</P>

        <P>Senator Norris inquired about a gentleman last week who was required to attend the Garda national immigration bureau today to make arrangements for his deportation.  Further representations were received and a further submission was made based on these representations to the Minister who will discuss the further representations and submission with his officials tomorrow morning.  I hope this updates the position for the Senator.</P>
        <P>Senator Bacik called for a debate on prisons and prison sentencing.  I have given a commitment that it will take place.  Senator Callely raised the issue of local authorities increasing their rates.  Rate charges and rate valuations are a serious challenge for the Government.  Many <Col N="349"/>businesses are finding it very difficult to keep their doors open.  Rates are a serious challenge on the balance sheet.  I will pass the Senator&rsquo;s views on to the Minister.</P>
        <?oasys _cl14.5- ?><P>Senator Norris referred to increasing VAT and duty on tobacco in the budget.  A debate on the budget will take place on 1 December.

        <P>Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; congratulated Senator Mullen on his great defence of all in public life on television the other evening.  I join with him in that regard.  He was a terrific example of someone who was there to represent all public representatives honestly and fairly.</P>
        <P>Senators Healy Eames and Ellis raised the issue of the proposed one-day strike in regard to which very many people want to do the right thing.  I hope the Government and union movement can still explore the issues in talks because this must be done in consultation and negotiation regardless of whether it is done before or after the proposed one-day stoppage.  I hope that in the national interest the proposed one-day stoppage will not take place and that everyone involved will get around the table and in the national interest work to the best advantage of Ireland plc.  Many people know that &euro;4 billion in savings is required and they want to get on with the job of playing their part on possibly a once-off or a twice-off basis to help the country.

        <P>Senators Hannigan and John Paul Phelan also referred to the safety of travelling on Irish roads and pointed out that hundreds of lives have been saved in recent years following the introduction of the new regulations.  I congratulate everyone involved, the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, the Minister, Deputy Cullen, who played an important part in implementing random breath testing, and Mr. Gay Byrne and his team&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Hundreds of lives have been saved on our roads but thousands of people have been saved from serious injury as a result of the various changes introduced ranging from penalty points to random breath testing and speed cameras will also be introduced.  All these measures are assisting in making our roads much safer.</P><Col N="350"/>
        <P Just="Left">Senators Hanafin and John Paul Phelan raised the issue of broadcasting, the broadcast media and broadcasting the affairs of this House.  I fully support anything that could happen to make this possible.  The broadcasting of our affairs, perhaps the Order of Business, for one hour each week initially would be a step in the right direction.  We are endeavouring to examine the possibility of this happening.</P>
        <P>All the other matters that were asked of me are in regard to calls for a pre-budget debate.  As I said, this will take place on 1 December.</P>
        <P>Senator Regan outlined his serious concern regarding the IFSC, in regard to which I very much agree with him.  This sector faces a serious challenge.  This area of industry, which brings in &euro;1 billion in revenue a year, makes a significant contribution to the Exchequer.  It is of the utmost importance for it to maintain its competitiveness.  I know that the Government and the Minister for Finance will take this into account in the forthcoming budget.</P>
        <P>Senator Mullen outlined to the House the benefit of electronic white boards and the availability of broadband.  I have covered this area already.  I welcome all the advances that have been made in our schools in the area of technology.</P>

    <Title>Labour Services (Amendment) Bill 2009: Second Stage. </Title>
        <P FLI="0">Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="DaraCalleary"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dara Calleary</NameTxt>
	<P>First, I will describe the context for this Bill.  F&Aacute;S is the national training and employment authority and has the remit to provide a range of proactive job-related services, supports and programmes to assist individuals to remain in and return to the labour market.  The agency also promotes workforce development by upgrading the competencies and qualifications of individuals and by providing and facilitating targeted training programmes and services to employees and especially to the unemployed.</P>
        <P>There was a welcome fall in the live register in October.  However, despite this decrease some 412,400 people remain on the live register.  The Government is committed to continuing to provide these individuals with the necessary assistance during this difficult period such that they can return to work as quickly as possible.</P>
        <P>Significant numbers of unemployed persons leave the live register on an ongoing basis.  From November 2008 to October 2009 almost 155,000 people are recorded as leaving to employment.  This is a positive trend that shows there are still jobs available and that the Government activation measures are assisting the unemployed to develop their skills and secure employment.  In this context, I highlight some of the achievements of F&Aacute;S in 2008 to illustrate the scale of the work being carried out by the organisation and its staff.</P>
        <P>Under training in employment measures, some 26,100 apprentices were trained to meet future craft skills needs and 32,400 employees were upskilled in priority skill areas, including information and communications technology and management skills.  Under training for the unemployed, some 7,900 received specific skills training and 12,800 received training in foundation skills, including early school leavers and people with disabilities.  Under employment programmes, some 24,400 people were on a community employment or a job initiative programme at the end of December 2008.  Under employment services, F&Aacute;S employment services received notification of 96,000 job vacancies.  Some 60,000 people were referred to F&Aacute;S in 2008 from the live register, of which 41,000 were interviewed and approximately 34,000 had left the live register by the end of the year.</P>
        <P>I assure the Seanad that the T&aacute;naiste is working closely with her colleagues the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Hanafin, and the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy O&rsquo;Keeffe, to ensure appropriate responses are developed and put in place to meet the upskilling needs of those who are losing their jobs or facing uncertain employment prospects.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>I reiterate that the fact there were problems in one area in F&Aacute;S does not in any way reflect the work of the majority of the staff in F&Aacute;S, who are hardworking and committed to their role in supporting those who avail of the training or employment activities of the organisation.  I acknowledge the excellent work carried out by them.  Their commitment and professionalism are crucial in helping us to deal with the key labour market challenges currently facing this country.  Effective governance in any organisation is fundamental to efficient and cost effective delivery of services.  Effective governance flows from the board of an organisation and it is with this in mind that it is proposed to make a number of structural changes to streamline the board of F&Aacute;S.  In future, the board of F&Aacute;S will be comprised of members who have the necessary expertise and competencies to lead F&Aacute;S proactively in the current economic environment.</P>
      
        <P>It is against this background that I bring the Labour Services (Amendment) Bill 2009 before this House for its consideration.  The Bill is part of a response to ensure F&Aacute;S is fit for purpose and operates under the highest standards of corporate governance.  I propose to offer some <Col N="352"/>general observations on the rationale and general principles informing the content of this amending legislation and then proceed to summarise the provisions of the Bill.  I appreciate that Members will have greater opportunity to explore the provisions in more detail on Committee Stage, to which I look forward.</P>
        <P>The Labour Services Act 1987 established F&Aacute;S more than 20 years ago.  In the intervening period there has been a sea change in the worlds of corporate governance and public service ethics.  One of the aims of this Bill is to introduce current best practice in these areas into legislation in order to improve and update the corporate governance structure in F&Aacute;S.  The Bill also takes account of the recommendations contained in the Committee of Public Accounts Fourth Interim Report on Special Report 10 of the Comptroller and Auditor General and F&Aacute;S 2007 Accounts and the work of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  I pay tribute to the work of Deputy Bernard Allen and the members of the Committee of Public Accounts for the amount of time and work on F&Aacute;S in the past number of months.</P>
        <P>The board of F&Aacute;S as it is currently constituted is considered large and unwieldy.  It is proposed to reduce the size of the board from 17 members to 11 members, including the chair.  As part of this process, it is also intended to change the composition of the board.  The board will be appointed on the basis of relevant experience and competencies in areas such as the functions of F&Aacute;S, finance, corporate governance and public administration.  This will be a move away from the current system where a number of board members are nominated by bodies not accountable to the Oireachtas.  The Bill provides for a system of rolling appointments and resignations of board members.  Experience has shown that this system has the dual benefit of preserving corporate knowledge and at the same time bringing new ideas to a board.  The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment will appoint the members of the board in consultation with the Minster for Education and Science and the Minister for Social and Family Affairs.  It is also proposed to include the director general of F&Aacute;S as an <i>ex-officio</i> member of the board as is standard practice in other agencies under the remit of the Department, such as IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland.  The inclusion of the director general on the board of F&Aacute;S will improve the lines of communication between the executive and the board and will assist the board in its deliberations on often complex and varied matters.</P>
        <P>There is considered to be a lack of clarity around the accountability of the director general of F&Aacute;S to the Oireachtas.  In order to resolve this matter, provisions have been included in the Bill that set out quite clearly the accountability of the director general to the Committee of Public Accounts and other committees of the Oireachtas.</P>
        <P>F&Aacute;S has a significant annual budget and it is important that its spending is directed in a way that is both transparent and provides value for money.  External contractors provide a number of services to F&Aacute;S and it is in this context that provisions have been included in the Bill that will prohibit staff and board members from engaging in procurement matters where a conflict of interest exists.  These provisions also provide for appropriate penalties where these rules are broken, including dismissal for members of staff and the removal from the board of board members.  Wrongdoing can take place in large organisations in both the public and private sector even where proper internal financial control structures are put in place.  Against this background, provisions have been included in the Bill to protect bona fide whistleblowers when reporting wrongdoing at any level within the organisation.</P>
        <P>I propose to summarise the main provisions of the Bill.  These will be examined in more detail on Committee Stage.  Section 4 provides that the director general of F&Aacute;S shall be accountable to the Committee of Public Accounts.  He shall, when required, give evidence to the committee on the regularity and propriety of transactions recorded in any accounts of F&Aacute;S subject to audit, the economy and efficiency of F&Aacute;S in the uses of its resources, the systems <Col N="353"/>and procedures employed by F&Aacute;S for the purpose of evaluating the effectiveness of its operations and any matters affecting F&Aacute;S in a special report of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  As is the norm in these provisions the director general shall not express an opinion on the merits of any policy of the Government or a Minister of the Government.</P>
        <P>Section 5 provides that the director general of F&Aacute;S shall be accountable to other committees of the Oireachtas.  This section provides for the director general to attend any committee appointed by either or both Houses of Oireachtas and give an account in respect of matters of the general administration of F&Aacute;S that fall within the terms of reference of that committee.  This section also provides that the director general is not required to attend to give an account to an Oireachtas committee of any matter that he is of the opinion is likely to be the subject of proceedings before a court or tribunal in the State unless, on foot of an application by that committee, the High Court determines otherwise.</P>
        <P>Section 6 provides for a number of requirements for disclosure and conflicts of interests in respect of the members of the board and staff of F&Aacute;S.  Under the provisions of this section, a board member must declare a material interest in any matter relating to a contract or arrangement that comes before the board.  Following such a declaration the board member must absent himself or herself from the meeting, take no part in any deliberation on the matter and not vote on a decision relating to the matter.  Similar provisions are included in this section with regard to staff members in F&Aacute;S.  A staff member must disclose any material interest that he has in any potential agreement, contract or arrangement and must not take part in any negotiations or deliberations on this matter.  In addition, he must not influence or seek to influence or make any recommendations on the matter.  The legislation provides that in the event of a staff member contravening this section, F&Aacute;S may take appropriate action against that person including termination of the person&rsquo;s contract.  The sanction against board members who contravene the provisions of this section is contained in section 9 of the Bill and provides for the removal of the board member by the Minister.</P>
        <P>Section 7 provides protection from civil liability to employees of F&Aacute;S who make a bona fide report of offences being committed under any enactment or any serious wrongdoing being committed in respect of F&Aacute;S to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or a member of the board.  It also provides protection to employees who report contraventions to the Minister of directions given by the Minister.  This section of the Bill introduces a prohibition on the penalisation of F&Aacute;S employees who report offences being committed, serious wrongdoing or contraventions of ministerial directions.  Penalisation in the context of this section means suspension, layoff or dismissal or the threat of suspension, layoff or dismissal; demotion or loss of opportunity for promotion; transfer of duties, change of location of place of work, reduction in wages or changes in working hours; imposition of any discipline, reprimand or other penalty; and coercion or intimidation.  This section also makes it an offence for staff members of F&Aacute;S to make reports in bad faith to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, members of the board or the Minister.</P>
        <P>Section 11 provides for redress for penalisation contrary to the provisions contained in section 7 of this Bill.  This section sets out the structure by which an employee of F&Aacute;S may seek redress if they are of the view that they are being penalised for reporting wrongdoing in F&Aacute;S.  Employees may make a complaint to a Rights Commissioner if they consider that they are being penalised by F&Aacute;S for reporting breaches of legislation or serious wrongdoing with regard to F&Aacute;S.  Following investigation of the complaint the Rights Commissioner will make a decision on the matter.  Either party may appeal the decision of the Rights Commissioner to the Labour Court.  Where F&Aacute;S does not carry out the terms of the decision of the Rights Commissioner, the employee may bring a complaint before the Labour Court to seek a determination to have the terms of that decision effected.  In the event that F&Aacute;S fails to carry out the terms of the Labour Court determination the employee may make a complaint to the <Col N="354"/>Circuit Court for an order directing F&Aacute;S to carry out the determination in accordance with its terms.</P>
        <P>Section 8 is an amendment to section 13 of the Labour Services Act 1987 to provide for the removal of the prohibition on the disclosure of information obtained by a member of the board in the course of his or her duties in certain circumstances.  The current legislation prohibits the disclosure of information with limited exceptions.  This amendment will permit the disclosure of information specifically to the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and remove any doubt about there being a legal barrier to a member of the board reporting issues of concern to the Minister.</P>
        <P>Section 9 provides for a restructuring of the board of F&Aacute;S in a number of ways.  The board is considered large in comparison to many non-commercial semi-State boards and to streamline the board it is proposed to reduce its size from 17, made up of 16 ordinary members plus a chairman, to 11, made up of ten ordinary members, including the director general, and a chairman.  The Bill will provide for a departure from the current model of 17 members where nominations can be made by other bodies &mdash; trade unions and employers nominate four members each and employees of F&Aacute;S elect two staff members to the board &mdash; to a model of 11 members where the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, in consultation with the Ministers for Social and Family Affairs and Education and Science, will select the chair and nine ordinary members based on their ability and experience.  The other member will be the director general.  Due to a reduction in the size of the board, the quorum for a meeting of the board will be reduced from nine to seven.  Nominations to the board will be based on relevant experience and competencies in the functions of F&Aacute;S or finance, trade, commerce, corporate governance or public administration.  Membership of the board will be limited to two terms of not more than five years each.  In addition, to facilitate the development of fresh ideas and experience, the section also provides for a rolling system of appointments to the board.</P>
        <P>The section also includes a provision to amend paragraph 12 of the First Schedule to the Labour Service Act, 1987.  The purpose of the amendment is to update and strengthen the regulations surrounding the dismissal of a member of the board and is in keeping with current legislation in this area.  The amendment provides that the Minister may remove a member of the board if the member is not adequately performing his or her functions, if there is a material conflict of interest in relation to the performance by the member of his or her functions, if it is necessary or expedient for the effective performance by F&Aacute;S of its functions, or if a member of the board has contravened the provisions in relation to disclosure of interest as provided for in section 6 of the Bill.</P>
        <P>Section 10 provides for the repeal of Part II of the Schedule to the Labour Services Act 1987, as employees of F&Aacute;S will no longer be appointed to the board following election as described in the Schedule.</P>
        <P>I reiterate that it is the Government&rsquo;s view that F&Aacute;S is a key agency in its plan to fight unemployment and ensure workers do not become distanced from the labour market.  The introduction of the Bill sends a clear signal to the public on the Government&rsquo;s commitment to restore public confidence in the ability of F&Aacute;S to deliver on its training and employment mandate.  On Thursday the Government will publish advertisements seeking expressions of interest in serving on the new board of F&Aacute;S.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

	<P>I was thinking of times past.</P>
        <P>Fine Gael will support the Labour Services (Amendment) Bill on Second Stage but will have a number of amendments to table on Committee Stage.  I agree with many of the Minister of State&rsquo;s opening comments on the role of F&Aacute;S.  It is much maligned in the light of the difficulties that emerged at the top level of the organisation in the past 12 months, in particular.  However, good work is done on the ground in training apprentices, retraining and upskilling people for the workforce and in local employment schemes.  One of the first debates in which I participated in the Chamber seven years ago was on the importance of the community employment aspect of F&Aacute;S.  Often that work goes unheralded and is not noted.</P>
        <P>The Bill does not go far enough in terms of a root and branch review of F&Aacute;S and a full discussion of what we want our national training agency to do.  A considerable body of opinion, with which I concur, holds that we ask too much of F&Aacute;S, that its fingers are in too many pies and that it should be broken up into a number of smaller and more manageable agencies which would be specifically targeted at delivering in the areas with which they would be concerned.</P>
        <P>I was interested in the Minister of State&rsquo;s final comments on the Government&rsquo;s objective to keep F&Aacute;S at the centre of our fight to improve the position of the country&rsquo;s labour market.  The public no longer has confidence in F&Aacute;S as an organisation.  That is not due to any lack of effort on the part of employees and trainers; it is because of the actions of executives and board members over a sustained period of years.  The Bill is a missed opportunity to reform the way we deliver training programmes.</P>
        <P>I was also interested to hear the Minister of State insert the words &ldquo;in future&rdquo; when referring to the board of F&Aacute;S comprising members with the necessary expertise and competencies.  In other words, like many of us, the Minister of State acknowledges that in the past perhaps many of the board members did not have the necessary expertise and competencies to be able to fulfil their roles correctly.</P>
        <P>The Bill&rsquo;s chief component is a reduction in the number of board members.  I welcome these provisions as the old board was an unwieldy body.  I also welcome the protections included in the Bill for whistleblowers.  I share the view that the Government needs to introduce general legislation on whistleblowing to ensure the positions of people throughout the public service would be secure if they were in a position to declare that something untoward was occurring.  While this is what should happen, I welcome the protections contained in the Bill.</P>
        <P>I welcome the provision on the accountability of the director general before the Committee of Public Accounts and other Oireachtas committees.  The Bill correctly seeks to provide the Minister with the power to remove board members who underperform in their functions.  However, it is worth remembering that most of what we saw uncovered in F&Aacute;S in the past 18 months concerned the actions of the top executives rather than those of board members, although no doubt they were somewhat responsible in their lack of oversight of what was happening beneath them in the structure of the organisation.  The provision should be extended to put the Minister in a position where they can remove leading executives from their positions for underperformance.</P>
        <P>I refer to the fact that many Members of both Houses, including Senator Ross and Deputy Varadkar, highlighted what had gone on in F&Aacute;S over a period of time.  For ten years we had virtually full employment and spent &euro;1 billion per annum on the State training agency.  We now know that much of that money was misused.  That is why it is essential to have a new training agency and we should remove some local employment scheme functions and place them in their natural home in local government.  There is even an argument to be made that responsibility for <Col N="356"/>some apprenticeship schemes should be removed and given to the Department of Education and Science or an agency under its aegis.  The organisation is unwieldy and a strong case can be made for various agencies taking its powers and being specifically targeted to deliver results in the areas with which they are concerned.</P>
        <P>Will the Minister of State comment on the media reports that followed the tabling of a parliamentary question by Deputy Lee on senior management remuneration and the increase in the number of senior managers in F&Aacute;S from 170 to 290 in an 11 year period?</P>
        <P>The reply to the parliamentary question also revealed that the total pay bill for these managers increased by 77% and an average remuneration of &euro;80,000.  In 1997, F&Aacute;S employed 11 staff for every manager but that figure had decreased to seven by 2009.</P>
        <P>During the boom years, the Government took its eye off the ball in terms of overseeing F&Aacute;S.  A number of high profile politicians, including the T&aacute;naiste, have held the position of Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  It is a difficult job and much like the current Minister for Finance, many of the problems which the T&aacute;naiste is trying to address are not of her making.  However, during her term in that role, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, doubled the number of directors from 15 to 30 and flew in the face of all that she has preached in her political career regarding reducing management staff in State bodies.</P>
        <P>Perhaps the Minister of State will indicate whether an examination is being conducted of the Labour Services Act 1987 with a view to creating a new group of training agencies.  F&Aacute;S is trying to do everything from social employment to fourth level education but that is an unsustainable model for the future.</P>
        <P>The employment programmes and community employment schemes run by F&Aacute;S cost approximately &euro;430 million per annum.  While much of the work done through these programmes is valuable, their proper home is in local government.  Despite the recommendations of the McCarthy report, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, continues to advocate an extension to the powers of local government and most Members of this House have served on local authorities.  This is an area over which local authorities should be given control because most of the work done through these programmes is at the local level.</P>
        <P>The budget for corporate services and regional directorates costs F&Aacute;S &euro;150 million per annum.  Particularly in the current economic environment, we must ask whether we are getting value for that money.  In light of what we have learned over the past 18 months, I suggest that we are not getting value for our money.  The corporate and regional directorate budget is 50% greater than the &euro;100 million spent annually on apprenticeships, an area in which F&Aacute;S is internationally recognised as having excelled.</P>
        <P>We need to examine closely the &euro;1 billion we provide to F&Aacute;S annually.  Given that more than 400,000 people are signing on the live register, it has never been more important that we find new employment and upskilling opportunities.  The timing of the revelations about the agency are particularly disappointing for that reason.  Arguably, we did not need to spend anything approaching &euro;1 billion during the good times but that money is now needed to provide real opportunities to those who find themselves on the live register.</P>
        <P>While I have reservations about the Bill&rsquo;s failure to go far enough in examining the role and multiple functions of F&Aacute;S, any legislation which would reform the board of the agency and the spending of public moneys must be welcomed.  I will be supporting the Bill on Second Stage, therefore.</P>

      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Senator Ivor Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish my good friend and colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Dara Calleary, continued success and thank him, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and their officials for their work on the Labour Services (Amendment) Bill 2009.</P>
        <P>The Bill amends the legislation governing F&Aacute;S, our national training and employment authority, by providing for stronger governance and accountability.  It is clearly acknowledged that the Bill contains important elements which will lead to a realignment of the agency&rsquo;s programmes and supports for individuals remaining in or returning to the labour market.  The public perception of the work done by the very committed individuals who work in F&Aacute;S has been clouded somewhat due to recent media coverage of certain isolated matters.  I am sure we all accept that such media attention can be exaggerated and may not give a clear and informed picture.  It certainly should not in any way reflect on the beneficial work carried out by the majority of the agency&rsquo;s employees.  I acknowledge their commitment and professionalism, which are crucial in helping us deal with the challenges presented by the labour market.</P>
        <P>F&Aacute;S was established more than 20 years ago and significant change has occurred in the intervening period, particularly in respect of corporate governance and public service ethics.  Effective governance is fundamental to every organisation&rsquo;s efficiency and service delivery.  For that reason, I wholeheartedly support the structural changes the Bill introduces to streamline the board of F&Aacute;S.  The Minister of State noted the membership of the new board will reflect the agency&rsquo;s work and programmes and that members will have the requisite expertise and competencies to guide it through the current economic difficulties.  I welcome the reduction in the size of the board, the proposed system of rolling appointments and the removal of the automatic right to nominate individuals not directly accountable to the taxpayer.  Furthermore, the director general of F&Aacute;S will be accountable to the Oireachtas and directors and staff will be required to disclose conflicts of interest.  Whistleblowers who report serious wrongdoing will be protected.</P>
    <HtmlBk SectId="3" />
        <P>One would expect these provisions to feature in the Bill.  I will not discuss in detail the various sections, as these matters are best left to the Minister, his officials and the Parliamentary Counsel.  We trust them to incorporate and embroider in the legislation the changes required.</P>
        <P>With hindsight, one can ask the reason certain measures were not introduced in the principal Act.  One can ask the same question of any legislation before the House.  I anticipate that this initial amendment will be followed by further changes.</P>
        <P>All of us recognise that we face major challenges.  Circumstances are changing at a rate we never expected and the impact of the current global economic and financial crisis is complicated by several factors unique to Ireland.  Many of those in business or seeking to embark on careers or self-development are experiencing considerable difficulties, particularly in the area of apprenticeships, with which F&Aacute;S is closely associated.  Many of the individuals and companies involved in or associated with the construction industry, including electricians, plumbers and bricklayers, are in survival mode and face major challenges.  As we progress through this difficult, challenging and turbulent period, we should maximise the potential of all opportunities.  In fairness to F&Aacute;S, some of the recent changes the organisation has announced tap into current market opportunities.  As Senators will acknowledge, times of recession offer opportunities.</P>
        <P>I am particularly pleased to note that consultation, dialogue and discussion will take place between the Ministers for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Social and Family Affairs and Education and Science on the membership of the new board of F&Aacute;S.  To compare the new and old structures is to compare chalk and cheese.</P>
        <P>I do not know what role, if any, IBEC will have in discussions on the F&Aacute;S board, its governance and corporate direction and the practicalities of developing the organisation&rsquo;s potential. <Col N="358"/> The vast majority are prepared to work together to maximise whatever potential presents to ensure we secure the best outcomes.  I note from the Minister of State&rsquo;s contribution that the purpose of the Bill is to achieve the best returns and outcome.  That being the case, I presume the legislation will have an easy passage through the House.</P>
        <P>I have little to add to the Minister of State&rsquo;s contribution.  I welcome his comments on how he intends to achieve the objectives set out in the Bill.  One question many Senators want answered is when this legislation will be put to bed and its benefits delivered.</P>
        <P>I understand the Minister of State may be somewhat constrained in what he can say.  Difficulties arose in one area of F&Aacute;S, specifically in matters connected with the board.  I agree that corporate governance is necessary and that we must ensure that whatever emanates at board level comes downstream.  The role, function and responsibility of certain members of the board may not have filtered down, which is good.  It is also welcome that the new director general will have a different remit, including in terms of reporting to the various committees of the Houses.  This is an important element of the Bill.</P>
        <P>I hope the Minister of State and his Department will be open to others giving a view as to how we can maximise the potential of the significant opportunities presenting at this time.  We need to tap into the experience of the people who have their finger on the pulse.  I would like people with practical, hands on experience of the marketplace, its demands and changing structures to be involved in the board of F&Aacute;S.</P>
        <P>Recently I learned of the case of a person in the construction sector who had the misfortune to be made redundant.  He contacted F&Aacute;S and was able to avail of opportunities overseas under a F&Aacute;S programme.  On his return to Ireland, he secured gainful employment owing to his overseas experience and the training he had obtained from F&Aacute;S.  I could cite many similar cases.  I congratulate the Minister of State and ask him to keep up the good work.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State.  This legislation was born out of the toughest of times and significant public interest in developments in F&Aacute;S.  It is the Government&rsquo;s response to these developments.  Notwithstanding this, I have major difficulties with regard to what is absent from the Bill and some regressive aspects of the legislation.</P>
        <P>I take as given the points made about the good work done by F&Aacute;S.  This work needs to be recognised and supported.  Having spoken to many F&Aacute;S staff, it is clear morale in the organisation is low.  It is vital, therefore, that Members acknowledge the good work the organisation does.</P>
        <P>I will address specifically what the legislation does and does not do in responding to some of the issues which arose during recent deliberations at the Committee of Public Accounts.  It is appropriate that the clerk to the committee is present in the House.  I approve of the decision to reduce the size of the board as it was too large.</P>
        <P>We are returning to the dark ages.  However bad the previous problems were, at least somebody had to nominate persons from ICTU, IBEC and other quarters.  The Bill proposes to return that power to the Minister&rsquo;s office.  It is not the worst aspect of this proposal.  The worst aspect is how one comes by the nominations.  This is a major issue and I guarantee the Minister of State that of all the things which are happening the biggest issue for us is the lack of trust and confidence in the political system.  There is a need to let air into it and recognise the impact of the things we, myself included, have been doing for years.  I sat on the executive council of ICTU and we made nominations to F&Aacute;S.  I take my share of responsibility for how things were done and how they should be done better in future.</P><Col N="359"/>
        <P>It is proposed that the members of the board should be appointed after consultation with the Minister for Education and Science and the Minister for Social and Family Affairs from among persons who, in the opinion of the Minster, have experience and expertise in matters connected with finance, trade, commerce, corporate governance or public administration.  The wording is deliberately loose and was included deliberately by the parliamentary draftsmen to give the Minister protection to make nominations.  I cannot think of any aspect of life which is not connected to the functions of F&Aacute;S.  It does not help us.</P>
        <P>We should examine some of the things which we could do.  In terms of NAMA, a public advertisement was issued and the Government received expressions of interest.  The same should be done for this board.  I ask the Minister of State to confirm there will be an approved structure and how it will be done.  An advertisement only elicits and attracts expressions of interest, but one must then decide what to do with the list.  At least two of the bodies included in NAMA were, for many years, in the habit of advertising for expressions of interest in the directorship of their institutions.  Another great example of advertising is that done by the Courts Service for the appointment of members of the Judiciary.  Publishing advertisements inviting expressions of interest is a great idea but what happens next is shrouded in secrecy.</P>
        <P>We then need to look at the functions of the board and look for expertise and experience in finance, trade, commerce, corporate governance or public administration.  Someone then has to look at giving weightings to those areas and decide which are the most important.  This is something which should be done before any names are revealed so nobody can say a person who has expertise in finance also lived in a Minister&rsquo;s constituency or make other comments.  I am not impugning any negative intentions on the Minster.  Rather, I am referring to how the media, public and commentators read issues such as this.  The positions should be advertised and a weighting should be given to all the requirements outlined in the Bill.  People should then be selected for interview and following the interviews the names should be sent to the Minister.  There is no problem with the Minister being on or having his people on the board.  He does not have to be required to accept all the proposals which come to him.</P>
        <P>I will give the Minister of State an example of how this happened in recent times.  The recent Broadcasting Act gave, for the first time in the history of the State, power to the Committee on Communications, Energy and Natural Resources to select four people for nomination by the Minister, who could then reject them.  I have no objection to such a provision because Governments are elected to govern and cannot be undermined.  However, the Minister would have to give a good reason for his or her decision.</P>
        <P>The reason I refer to the example regarding the board which will be the successor to the RTE authority is that the Minister nominates five people and the committee nominates four, which the Minister can reject but will not do so.  There are 13 requirements governing in what areas the members should have experience and expertise.  One has to find people with experience in more than one area or all the posts will not be filled.  The Minister, as required by the Act, sent five names to the Committee on Communications, Energy and Natural Resources which considered them &mdash; they were good and honest citizens &mdash; and asked which of the 12 boxes each one ticked.  There was a mixed group comprising people from the Government side and all other parties, and the committee could not decide which boxes they ticked.  It had to ask the Minister for assistance to determine which five boxes were ticked so it did not have to examine them again but could look at the others.</P>
        <P>The committee decided the posts would be advertised, which has been done, that there will be a short-list which will be done on the basis of weightings it approves and an interview will then take place, all of which will be done like a normal appointments process.  At the end of the process, the people selected will come before a public session of the committee, not to be <Col N="360"/>grilled and embarrassed as one might see in Washington, but to say they are happy to be nominated and outline what they bring to the party.  I would love if such a process could be included in this Bill.  Every appointment process should include a requirement that people come before a committee where they would not be embarrassed but would be properly treated as those who are doing the State some service.  This is an issue about which I feel strongly.  People who want to serve on a board should be happy to let the world see why they are there.</P>
        <P>As an Independent I wish to raise another issue which is often not addressed.  The Government has a policy position on many issues and I see nothing wrong with it having people on a board who are there because they pushed forward the policy statement or position of the Government party or the programme for Government.  This is something about which we all have to be very level headed and pragmatic.  It is not about being completely pure, rather, it is about getting the best people in to do exactly what we were elected to do and what the law requires.  I ask the Minister of State to again examine that issue.  I am glad to see he nodded in agreement with me and I would like to see how that process could be completed ethically.  Senator Moylan and I were attending an ethics committee when the Minister of State was speaking so I ask him to forgive me for not hearing everything he said.</P>
        <P>Another deficiency in the Bill is the board structure, which is left wide open.  I raised a point regarding the board of NAMA during the debate last week on which the Government conceded because it needed my vote and about which I felt very strongly.  I feel equally strongly about this issue.  During the discussions of the Committee of Public Accounts evidence of all sorts of bad governance practices arose and I am delighted one issue included in the Bill is that of corporate governance.  We discovered the audit committee reported to the executive which undermined the whole process of corporate governance.</P>
        <P>A provision should be included in the Bill that an audit committee, a finance committee and a risk management committee be established.  I ask the Minister of State to do this because if one does not put a provision such as this into the board structure I guarantee it will not be done by the board members.  If there is no finance committee the financial arrangements such as deciding on budgets, cash flow meeting budgets and arrangements for debtors and creditors will be done by the executive.  Such matters will be flashed by the board which will be dealing with top-level strategic decisions and will not go into the detail required.  That is how bad habits start.  A sub-committee of the board which will bring a report to the board and nobody else on the finances, the budget for the next year, the sinking funds, insurance and cash flow required and the benchmarked budget for the current year is required.  Such a report should be examined by three or four members of the board.  The board cannot chose what it puts in front of itself but should have to examine the figures from top to bottom with the financial controller of F&Aacute;S.</P>
        <P>It is important the board and the audit committee consider the risk element and ensure external auditors come in three or four times a year to stress test the functions in place to see if it is collecting its debts and dealing with data properly and how it would deal with any risks which would arise and could threaten the whole operation.  This would deal with issues such as credit cards.  The expenses of the chief executive also came up.  How are such matters dealt with?  If the Minister of State wants them to be dealt with in a managed way, he has to consider the structure of the board.  I could talk for three hours on this issue.  There is no suggestion the many problems associated with the governance structure of semi-State bodies are developing because people do not mean well.</P>
        <P>The outgoing chairman of F&Aacute;S who is a friend of mine has obviously been devastated by much of what has happened in the last year.  He accepts that as chairman, he has to take responsibility for what happened during his time in that position.  As he said at a meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts, he regrets that things were not done differently.  I am saying <Col N="361"/>this in the most honest way possible.  He was not aware that the audit committee should have been reporting to the board rather than to the chief executive.  I mention that as an example.  It was not that the board made a decision to that effect &mdash; it was a legacy issue.  It has been the case for the last 12 years.  If one wants a board to perform a certain task, one should structure it in a manner that ensures it will do so.</P>
        <P>I have spoken about related issues such as finance, audits and risk management.  Such issues cannot be dealt with by a board which meets for two or three hours once a month but does nothing else.  The chairman of the organisation&rsquo;s finance committee, whoever he or she may be, should be asked to report to its board.  That report should state whether he or she has gone through the year&rsquo;s figures with the financial officer.  It might state, for example, that they are happy with some matters, concerned about others and would like certain steps to be taken.  All the papers available to the finance committee should be made available on the F&Aacute;S members&rsquo; website.  Any member who wants to look at them should be encouraged to do so.  If everybody has access, everybody will know what is going on and nobody will be embarrassed.  If all the questions are asked in the right place, it does not become an embarrassment.  If a person&rsquo;s expenses are out of line, they will emerge through that process.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister of State to examine this issue carefully.  I reiterate that the structure of the board is as important as its membership.  While I appreciate that this legislation has been considered by the other House, I suggest the other House does not tend to deal with certain matters that are more important.  I ask the Minister of State to keep an open mind on this issue of importance to make the legislation more effective.  I have no doubt that there is no difference between what the Minister of State and I, or anyone else in this Chamber, are seeking to do.  If one wants certain things to happen, one has to legislate for them.  They will not happen if they are not put on a statutory basis.  That, in a sense, is how we should set about making F&Aacute;S work.  If the structures I have recommended are put in place, the issues that caused problems in the last six months will be dealt with.  In the last six months there was no discussion about training, job creation or the other positive work of F&Aacute;S.  There was no scrutiny of the positive objectives or purposes of F&Aacute;S because people were too busy looking at other things.  We need to dispose of them now.  I have suggested a good way of removing them from of the equation.</P>
        <P>I wish the legislation well and hope to examine certain issues in more detail.  I will listen closely and carefully to the Minister of State&rsquo;s response.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>This legislation was originally drafted on foot of the findings of the Committee of Public Accounts following its examination of whether certain activities had been supportive of the public good.  In the committee&rsquo;s report the use of public money was deemed to be less than perfect.  As the Bill was being drafted, we learned that the original findings of the Committee of Public Accounts represented no more than the tip of the iceberg.  The Bill was discussed in the D&aacute;il in advance of its consideration in this House and it seems we are dealing with a problem of massive proportions.</P>
        <P>For many of its purposes, F&Aacute;S is a fine organisation.  Many of its staff are doing good work on behalf of the State.  When I worked as a community employment supervisor, I spent some of my time trying to justify a wage funded through F&Aacute;S.  I welcome the aspects of the Bill that seek to bring about the corporate governance changes that are badly needed in F&Aacute;S.  Some of the measures such as the change in the size of the board are practical.  Others relate to the means of appointing the board.  F&Aacute;S is unusual by comparison with most public bodies because a large part of its membership comes from the social partnership process.  The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment does not have a great deal of control over F&Aacute;S, other than in whether to approve those proposed by the various social partners as members of its board.  It would be better to move away from a system that has not been seen to work well for the <Col N="362"/>organisation to an approach, whereby people will be selected on the basis of their skills, abilities and experience.  I would prefer a method of more open involvement such as that advocated by Senator O&rsquo;Toole, whereby the public could submit nominations for posts and Oireachtas committees could be involved in the vetting of nominees.  The legislation agreed in the reviewed programme for Government would allow such changes to happen.</P>
        <P>In addition to changing the size of the board and the means of appointing board members, the legislation seeks to change the culture within which F&Aacute;S, as an organisation, has been managed in recent years.  However, it may be difficult to do this.  It is obvious, in terms of corporate governance, that the director general has to be an <i>ex officio</i> member of the board.  Some activities engaged in in the name of the organisation in recent years do not reflect well on the office.  The manner in which recent directors general have left office has not been acceptable to the public.  I hope this will not happen again in the future as we reform F&Aacute;S.  A dramatic change in the organisation&rsquo;s corporate governance culture is needed to allow this to happen.</P>
        <P>We need to think even further about these matters.  This is an enabling Bill in the sense that it gives the Minister the power to control how the future shape of the organisation will look.  We may need to examine how the organisation is constituted.  What areas of training should it be involved in?  How should it interact with other State agencies?  How should it identify future economic needs of the country?  To inspire public confidence which has been badly dented by the recent revelations and findings of the Committee of Public Accounts, we should consider whether the name of the organisation needs to be changed.  As we wait for F&Aacute;S to be properly constituted, to have new board members, a new culture of governance and a proper focus and to become fit for purpose, the renaming of the organisation could be needed.</P>
        <P>I welcome some of the other measures included in the Bill such as the introduction of a rolling system of appointment of members and the implementation of many of the recommendations of the Committee of Public Accounts.  I especially welcome the whistleblower provision.  While it is just one element of what we need to do in the Bill, it is important because public confidence in F&Aacute;S is in great need of repair.  The legislation is a small step in making sure that happens.</P>
        <P>We need to consider how F&Aacute;S can be an instrument for fostering economic change and development, as it should be.  As I said, it has done valuable work in trying to identify training needs and meet the skills gap.  The new and improved F&Aacute;S, regardless of what it is called, should be part of the general debate in both Houses of the Oireachtas on stated Government policy on matters such as the smart economy document and the training programmes that need to be provided.  We need to meet traditional needs in construction and subsets of construction such as carpentry, electrics and plumbing.  There should be greater emphasis on new technologies and green approaches to the economy, which is where our future economic direction will lead us.</P>
        <P>In the absence of a radical restructuring and an infusion of new thinking, ideas and people into the organisation, the fecund cultural leap needed cannot be made.  The challenge for the Minister and the Department is to make sure F&Aacute;S, as an organisation, deals properly with its corporate governance and is structured properly.  We should question its reason for existence and means of delivering services in order that it uses the public resources it receives in the best possible way.  The period from which F&Aacute;S is recovering results from having a huge budget at a time of full employment.  There is a need to use public resources properly at a time when such resources are at a low ebb and when we especially need to retrain, reskill and re-employ large parts of our workforce.</P><Col N="363"/>
      
        <P>This measure is just the tip of the iceberg, not unlike the allegations that were made and the findings of the Committee of Public Accounts which have helped bring it about.  It needs to be followed through not only with concerted departmental action, but also with a series of questioning within social partnership itself and as part of the ongoing political process to ensure we have a State training agency that is meeting our economy&rsquo;s needs and in which the public have full confidence.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Senator Brendan Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State.  I welcome the introduction of the Bill which attempts to deal with the fallout from the F&Aacute;S debacle.  It would be unfair not to acknowledge that F&Aacute;S has had significant successes down through the years as the Minister of State recognised in his speech.  The majority of people working in F&Aacute;S were not engaged in the high flying junketeering we read about so shockingly in recent times.  In the main they are decent, honourable people who, I find, are always willing to help.  They were far removed from all of this and most of them are shocked and ashamed by it all.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>We in the Labour Party want to see F&Aacute;S being strictly fit for purpose and in terms of governance the Bill goes a long way towards delivering the improvements that are required.  However, F&Aacute;S needs to be more concerned with its essential core work of upskilling people&rsquo;s competences and qualifications, and matching people&rsquo;s skills with available job opportunities.  It needs to provide specific and well-resourced training programmes, giving an opportunity for people who may have illnesses or disabilities to participate positively by developing their individual skills.  In this context the CE schemes are vital.  Where these can be shown to be of use from the perspective of rehabilitation, we must allow people to make their contribution so they feel they are part of the workforce.  A flexible approach to participation on these schemes must be tolerated.  The cost comes out of the public purse whether it is the dole or a CE scheme.</P>
        <P>F&Aacute;S should not be pursuing far-fetched notions about courses, such as that inspired by NASA in Florida.  Where was that all going?  Where could it have gone?  It seems like there was so much money available that F&Aacute;S did not know what to do with it.  The budget had to be spent.  This was the mentality and it needs to be changed.  All expenditure should be put into value-for-money projects and spent at home where at all possible.  F&Aacute;S must get back to basics and do the essential things well in an efficient and effective way.</P>
        <P>As the numbers on the live register are approaching 500,000 &mdash; thankfully the most recent figures have shown them pulling back &mdash; there is an urgent need for a properly functioning employment and training agency.  It should be one that meets the needs of those who require training, upholds high standards, has a clear focus and is involved in providing support services throughout the regions.  It should also ensure that people are sufficiently skilled and trained to avail of employment opportunities as they arise.</P>
        <P>Those requirements must always be uppermost in our minds when it comes to dealing with this legislation and in discussing the role of F&Aacute;S.  The difficulty, however, is that in its current shape F&Aacute;S is not fit for purpose.  It is dogged by scandal, corruption, low standards and ineptitude, as well as a lack of corporate governance and accountability.  All those elements make F&Aacute;S a dysfunctional organisation and in my view a function of Fianna F&aacute;il cronyism in the past.  The scandalously generous financial package agreed with the former director general, Rody Molloy, following his resignation from his position, which was not consistent with Government guidelines, is an indicator of how Fianna F&aacute;il looks after its friends.</P>
        <P>If we are honest in terms of how we should go about tackling these problems and putting in place the kind of root and branch reform required, there needs to be an acceptance of the nature of the problems that beset F&Aacute;S.  Hopefully some lessons have been learned.  There has been a great deal of media comment regarding the social partners who are members of the <Col N="364"/>board of F&Aacute;S and their apparent failure to take the necessary action following the revelations that emerged.  However, it must be remembered it was the board that established the internal audit that revealed all of the unacceptable practices that were prevalent in F&Aacute;S.  In addition, the board made it known that it was not informed about certain matters by members of the senior management of the organisation.  Many members of the board were genuinely shocked and horrified by the material that has emerged.</P>
        <P>That said, however, the F&Aacute;S scandal could and should be used as a case study for use in public policy education in how things can go wrong if proper controls and governance are not put in place.  I welcome this new legislation as it attempts to address the various governance issues.  I support the reduction in numbers of members of the board but I still have difficulties with the manner of their appointment, which will still leave it open to appointment of friends of the Minister of the day.  There is a case to be made for worker directors, a matter we can tease out further on Committee Stage.</P>
        <P>The provisions in the Bill relating to disclosure and conflicts of interest are positive.  I agree with Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s recommendations on the board structure.  It makes infinite sense to me and I look forward to some proposals in that regard.  The section dealing with protection of whistleblowers is also to be welcomed as is the accountability of the director general to the Committee of Public Accounts and other committees of the Oireachtas.</P>
        <P>As I said previously, F&Aacute;S, and indeed AnCO before it, have had a successful past and a very good record of achievement.  We must try to get the organisation functioning well again.  In respect of what has happened recently, there will be a day of judgment and hopefully the matters will get a fair hearing.  However, we must ensure the new F&Aacute;S under new direction has the capability to pick up, as a second chance, those young people that our systems have failed.  Most unemployed people look to F&Aacute;S as the main public employment service and F&Aacute;S needs to be as creative as it can be at that role.</P>
        <P>We need to consider what is positive in F&Aacute;S and how we can improve it and not concentrate only on the controversies and scandals that have occurred.  We need to examine whether the functions of F&Aacute;S are fit for our current needs and to correct any shortcomings.  Correcting the problems that the Bill endeavours to will not solve all the problems of F&Aacute;S.  Today&rsquo;s <i>Irish Independent</i> reported that pay for F&Aacute;S managers has grown twice as fast as that for non-managerial grades in the past ten years.  Apparently, this was due to a significant degree to an increase in numbers at management level, at a time when most leading-edge companies are stripping out layers of management and supervisory staff.  We need to look to leading-edge companies to give us the example and model for what needs to be done in public bodies and Departments.</P>
        <P>In addition to the governance issues addressed in this legislation, F&Aacute;S needs good business leadership with a focus on value for money, performance measurement, accountability, elimination of waste, continuous improvement and, importantly, speed of decision making if it is to be transformed to the organisation needed to address today&rsquo;s training and unemployment challenges.  We must not underestimate that challenge but we cannot afford to shirk it.</P>

	<P>As we are all aware, F&Aacute;S as the national training and employment authority has a duty to provide supports and programmes to assist people to remain in and return to the workforce.  F&Aacute;S is a key agency in the Government&rsquo;s plan to reduce unemployment.  On 31 December 2008 under employment programmes, 24,500 people were on community employment schemes or a jobs initiative programme.  We all know the invaluable work being done under those schemes.  In every parish considerable work under community schemes has been done, is being done and I am hopeful will continue to be done.  It has given a great social aspect to people&rsquo;s lives as they are doing something productive in the community rather than sitting at home twiddling their thumbs.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister of State to help young people whose training was nearly complete but because their sponsoring company had gone out of business before they completed it could not get that final piece of paper.  I know a few young people who had been in training.  I appeal to the Minister of State to offer support to people in that situation, either by securing them a place in another company for the required timeframe or by making some other arrangement.  I welcome the co-operation between the Minister of State and the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Hanafin, and the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, in getting these types of schemes off the ground and supporting them once they are in place.</P>
        <P>It is fitting the Minister of State acknowledged in his presentation the great work done by the majority of F&Aacute;S staff who take pride in their work of helping young people and the unemployed to secure employment.  I welcome the amendments that were made to the Bill in the course of its progress through the other House.  F&Aacute;S was established in 1987 and the legislation associated with it was in need of updating.  The agency was established in a time of recession, after which the good times arrived.  There is no doubt that management of the agency became lax and that certain unsatisfactory practices became the norm.  It is time to tighten up the legislative provisions relating to F&Aacute;S, which is what this Bill proposes to do.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State has outlined the main provisions of the legislation in detail.  I acknowledge the indication by Fine Gael colleagues that they intend to support it.  The Bill amends the legislation governing F&Aacute;S to provide for a stronger governance and accountability structure at the State employment and training agency.  Specifically, it provides for a reduction in the size of the board from 17 to 11, the introduction of a rolling system of appointments to the board and the removal of the automatic right to nominate individuals for appointment to the board from bodies not directly accountable to the taxpayer.  The legislation makes the director general of the agency accountable to the Oireachtas.  This is a welcome provision which, if it were already in place, might have precluded some of the unacceptable activities of which we were made aware in recent months.  The Bill obliges directors and staff of F&Aacute;S to disclose any conflicts of interest and prohibits directors and staff from any involvement in matters where such a conflict of interest arises.  The whistleblower provisions offer protection to members of staff who report serious wrongdoings in the organisation.  This is a welcome recognition of the fact that whistleblowers were sometimes cast aside after they blew the whistle on certain people.  The Bill takes account of the recommendations of the fourth interim report of the Committee of Public Accounts in regard to the special report of the Comptroller and Auditor General regarding F&Aacute;S&rsquo;s 2007 accounts.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Bill and look forward to its implementation without delay.  I hope these proposals will help F&Aacute;S to grow in the coming years, at a time when we are in great need of the expertise and experience of its staff in helping people to face the challenges of unemployment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Calleary.  Although we propose to introduce amendments on Committee Stage, Fine Gael supports the Bill.  I agree <Col N="366"/>with Senator Carty that a significant challenge for F&Aacute;S is the situation of apprentices who are unable to continue their training.  Even if we do nothing else, that issue must be addressed as a matter of urgency.</P>
        <P>In his speech, the Minister of State referred to the 412,400 people who are unemployed and welcomed the fall in the live register in October.  The reality, however, is that the Government has no coherent plan to tackle the unemployment crisis.  It is imperative that there be a focus on effective strategies for moving people from welfare to work.  There was an interesting article in <i>The Irish Times</i> last Thursday which analysed the potential situation of a married couple with two children according to whether they were PAYE workers, unemployed or self-employed.  Surely we are all agreed that a system which allows a person on social welfare to have more income than a working person, either PAYE or self-employed, is unacceptable.</P>
        <P>We now find ourselves in the unfortunate position that the vast amount of good work being done in training centres throughout the State, such as the one in Rossa Avenue in Cork, and via community employment schemes in every parish, sporting club and community organisation, is tarnished by the activities of a minority.  This important Bill is about restoring confidence in the structures of F&Aacute;S and in how it does its business.  The Government could have gone further in the provisions regarding the appointment of the board.  I agree with Senator Boyle that it is time to change F&Aacute;S&rsquo;s name, corporate image, logo and branding.  That image is ruined beyond repair.  I say that as somebody who is involved in the community employment scheme in my local GAA club and who has visited the training centre in Cork on numerous occasions.  The pride of the workers and instructors there is second to none but the reality is that the reputation of the agency is tarnished beyond repair.</P>
        <P>The blame for this must rest at one level with the political masters who were aloof and distant.  Nothing was done when the pay bill for F&Aacute;S management rose twice as fast, at 77%, as that for non-managers and when the number of managers increased by 71%.  What would the Taoiseach say to the Minister of State if it were the latter who oversaw such developments?  He would send the Minister of State to the backbenches and would promote Deputy Flynn or somebody else from Mayo.  A situation where the number of managers rose 18 times faster than the number of operational staff was clearly unsustainable.  I am not being political in saying that is farcical stuff.  If the Minister of State were on this side of the House he would say exactly the same.</P>
        <P>We must have a new training authority.  The Committee of Public Accounts, under the chairmanship of Deputy Allen, did the State a great service in its investigations in this area.  There was something rotten in F&Aacute;S.  Any right thinking and fair minded person will acknowledge it was rotten beyond contempt.  I agree fundamentally with Senator Carty that we must have a training authority that has as its sole motivation and objective the upskilling and retraining of people for the purpose of helping them to enter the world of work.  That is what a State training and employment agency must be about.  I say that as a person who spent eight years as a director of adult education in a local school.  We speak about trust and confidence but the reality is that people are laughing at F&Aacute;S.</P>
        <P>One of the greatest challenges facing the agency is the reluctance of people on social welfare to go into the world of work.  That is not to say that I do not accept people are unable to find work in some cases.  Through this legislation we must allow F&Aacute;S to manage its services in such a way that people will buy into the idea that the F&Aacute;S training regime is an effective provider of re-education and upskilling of the highest quality.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State referred to effective governance, which we all want, but will that result from the reform of the agency under this legislation?  Will the Fianna F&aacute;il Party make F&Aacute;S fit for purpose?  It has been known for a long time that the agency carried on like a Fianna F&aacute;il cumann, whether the Minister of State likes it or not.  He can dismiss that but that is the reality <Col N="367"/>and it has been proven by what has happened.  There was no accountability from the top down.  If a training manager comes in late on a Monday morning or does not do his job properly, he is hauled in but nothing happens to the board and its executives.  That is why F&Aacute;S needs to be reformed.</P>
        <P>The composition of the board needs to be examined, as Senator O&rsquo;Toole eloquently pointed out.  I agree with the American way of doing business.  There should be an open competition for appointments to the board with either the Public Appointments Service or the Committee of Public Accounts interviewing candidates.  Let us end once and for all political patronage in this country.  I can point to individuals appointed by Ministers to boards who should not have been but were because they were friends of the Minister involved or whoever.  That must stop.  Appointments to the board should not be in the Minister&rsquo;s gift.  The Bill provides for appointees of the Ministers for Education and Science, Enterprise, Trade and Employment and Social and Family Affairs.  Let us broaden this process.  We are living in a new Ireland where people are tired of the old ways.</P>
        <P>I canvassed 52 houses on a middle class estate in Cork last night and the board of F&Aacute;S was raised by six householders who had no interest in or connection with the agency.  If the Minister of State wishes to restore its credibility, make it fit for purpose and change its governance structure, filling appointments to the board must not be in the Minister&rsquo;s gift.  She should provide for an open competition and, as Senator O&rsquo;Toole said, the open and vague language in the Bill which gives the Minister wriggle room should be deleted.  Public interest directors should be appointed similar to those appointed to the boards of banks.</P>
        <P>Taxpayers&rsquo; money is at the heart of this.  If we want to send a person to the moon, that is fine but one only has to examine what F&Aacute;S did with the taxpayer&rsquo;s money over recent years.  Will that change under this Bill?  I am concerned because the fundamental aim of the agency is to prepare people for work through training and upskilling.  The legislation is a lost opportunity.  The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and her predecessors, Deputies Harney and Martin, ignored Fine Gael for years about F&Aacute;S.  The director general of the agency must be made more accountable.  For example, he or she could be asked to appear in the Seanad for a debate to make the agency relevant to this House.</P>

	<P>That might happen but it is up to the people.  The people will decide, not a cosy cartel of Fianna F&aacute;il hacks.  We must allow people to have confidence in F&Aacute;S.  That is not the case currently and that has belittled the great work being done, which is a sad shame.  I hope the Bill will provide for this and I wish the Minister of State well.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Paddy Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State and I wish him well with this important Bill.  F&Aacute;S has been the subject of significant debate over the past 12 months or so.  The Minister of State said the agency, as the national training and employment authority:</P>
        <P LI="1">[H]as the remit to provide a range of proactive job-related services, supports and programmes to assist individuals to remain in and return to the labour market.  The agency also promotes workforce development by upgrading the competencies and qualifications of individuals and by providing and facilitating targeted training programmes and services to employees and especially to the unemployed.</P>
        <P FLI="0">That is a positive statement.  Currently, more than 400,000 people are out of work and this presents a golden opportunity to F&Aacute;S to liaise with the many skilled people who are out of work.  Thousands of carpenters, electricians, blocklayers and builders are unemployed and marvellous programmes could be put together by the agency to utilise their skills.  For instance, <Col N="368"/>significant work could be on local authority projects.  Poor quality local authority housing could be renovated through a F&Aacute;S scheme with the skilled people available while parks could be upgraded and roads widened.  These skilled tradesmen could be organised by the agency to do great work and I hope the Minister of State will ensure this happens.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole is probably correct that the new board should have three sub-committees, including audit and finance sub-committees.  Over recent years there was a lack of control in the agency from the top down and, therefore, control must be restored.  I hope the Bill will provide mechanisms to address this issue but while the composition of the board is important, the mechanisms, checks and balances put in place are more important.  F&Aacute;S had too much money over the past ten years and staff did not know what do.  There was abuse left, right and centre.  Investigations should be carried out in certain areas.  For example, a number of schemes have been highlighted.  Pass rates on a scheme in Dundalk were falsified and works were carried out on the private house of a sponsor in Waterford while in my home town, Castlebar, grants were drawn by a group for a meals and wheels scheme but another group said they were not used for this purpose.  There was argument and counterargument and nobody seems to know what happened.  The Committee of Public Accounts has investigated a number of these issues and the Comptroller and Auditor General will report on them.</P>
        <P>F&Aacute;S should have checks and balances in place.  Consultants were hired to carry out checks and we need to evaluate whether these people, who were paid by the State to carry them out, did so.  If they did not, there should be consequences.  The kernel of the wastage problem lies in the lack of checks and balances.  Consultants who made external evaluations did not do them properly or in accordance with the remit given to them by the board of F&Aacute;S or the Minister.  They should be brought to task.  We must have real control in this area.  If consultants had carried out checks in Dundalk, Waterford, Castlebar and elsewhere and reported that work was or was not being done properly, we would not be in this position.</P>
        <P>Great work has been done by F&Aacute;S.  We are inclined to think everything in it is bad.  Senator Carty who is in the House knows Mayo Abbey well.  I do not know whether the Minister of State has visited it but every Minister should visit the abbey to see what has been done there.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DaraCalleary"><NameTxt>Deputy Dara Calleary</NameTxt>
	<P>Quite a number have done so.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Paddy Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I know that.  Opposition spokespersons have also visited it.  Deputy Phil Hogan was there a number of weeks ago and was amazed to see the work being done there.  There are houses, cr&egrave;ches, a resource centre and gardens.  Vulnerable people in the parish are looked after.  Management knows the people who are isolated and vulnerable.  There was a time when only the priests of a parish knew who the old and vulnerable were.  Under the directorship of Ger Maguire, vulnerable people are brought together every Friday and given a meal, including vegetables from the abbey garden.  The team at the abbey must be congratulated.  This is part of the amazing work being carried out by F&Aacute;S.  I have no doubt there are other such projects throughout the country.  It is unfortunate that projects such as this can be marred by vested interests and people who are out for their own gain.</P>
        <P>When the Bill is enacted, I hope we will see a better system of checks and balances from top to bottom in F&Aacute;S.  If consultants or outside agencies are given responsibility for evaluating F&Aacute;S projects, they must do their work and be seen to do so in accordance with the mandate given.  If they do not, they should pay a price for their failure.  We should look back at some of those who made evaluations to see if they fulfilled their mandate satisfactorily.  This should be done in conjunction with the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  The two should be put together and a full assessment of the evaluations carried out.</P>
        <P>Fine Gael supports the Bill.  The sooner it is enacted the better, as there are more than 400,000 people out of work.  There is much work to be done, for which the Bill can be a catalyst.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I am disappointed at the level of comment from and cheap sniping by some Senators on the other side of the House.  I do not include Senator Burke in that observation.  However, Senators Buttimer and Ryan referred to F&Aacute;S as an expanded Fianna F&aacute;il cumann.  Their comments lowered the tone of the House and brought the debate down to the level of nonsense.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Bill.  There have been major problems in F&Aacute;S.  However, every Member of the House knows someone who is working on a F&Aacute;S scheme, been a F&Aacute;S supervisor or had an interaction with F&Aacute;S.  We all know the impact of these interventions on individuals and our communities.  At a time when many spheres of life are receiving bad press, justifiably or not, it is important that we commend the work being done in F&Aacute;S.</P>
        <P>Senator Buttimer spoke about changing the name of the organisation and starting from scratch.  It is too simple to say we should not start from where we are but from somewhere we would like to be.  The Bill aims to reform the hierarchy of F&Aacute;S, how it is set up and how it functions.  However, many aspects of F&Aacute;S are working well.  I do not accept, therefore, that starting from scratch would add much to this reform.</P>
        <P>In my constituency unemployment has always been very high.  There is an element of cross-Border working which sometimes masks the real figures.  Some may not like me saying this but it is the reality.  The Border has presented opportunities, as well as many challenges.  I commend the Government for the development of the &euro;27 million consolidated centre which is about to open in Buncrana.  It will house a decentralised social welfare office, a Garda station and a car testing centre.  Unfortunately, we need the new social welfare office, as the staff of the three or four social welfare offices in Buncrana have been working under very difficult circumstances.  They will now be consolidated in one centre.  People who lose their jobs and must have that first interaction with State services will do so in a wonderful public service centre which will open on 27 November, a very important day in my life because it is the date on which I was born.  While we must do as much as we can for people who lose their jobs, I hope we can maintain as many as possible in jobs.  I commend the initiative to give State support to companies which are exporting.  I believe the T&aacute;naiste intends to expand the scheme to bring more people into it.  However, our first goal should be to keep people in employment.  This often means providing training in the workplace, rather than waiting until people are unemployed before they can avail of it.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Education and Science recently announced a major investment in information technology.  The Government will invest &euro;150 million in the provision of lap-tops in schools.  One still hears people condemning investment in IT.  If we do not invest in this area, where will today&rsquo;s young people be tomorrow?  We must train teachers to use IT equipment because students are often ahead of the teacher in this regard.  F&Aacute;S may have a role in providing such training within schools.  I note that it worked with Mr. Paul Rellis of Microsoft on such a project.  Could business interact with schools to ensure the skills being taught in schools are relevant to the workplace?  This must be done at primary school level.  Early intervention is important; the earlier we intervene the more likely we are to ensure pupils will be employable when they leave school.</P>
    <HtmlBk SectId="4" />
        <P>I commend the fact live register figures are going down.  In Letterkenny, the waiting time for the jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance is approximately two weeks.  It is two weeks in Killybegs and seven and a half weeks in Buncrana.  I have been told it is approximately 22 weeks in Castlepollard.  I recognise the waiting times in Donegal are not the worst but I would like to think we could get money in people&rsquo;s pockets and do whatever we can to shorten the waiting times.</P>
        <P>There are new roles which F&Aacute;S can play and we should work with business to help identify them.  Often there is flexibility in F&Aacute;S which is not to be found elsewhere.  I know some of that flexibility might have been abused and perhaps that is part of the problem.  However, if we get rid of that flexibility, we could get into trouble.</P><Col N="370"/>
        <P>When I became a Member of the other House, the first thing people asked me was whether I could get them off a community employment scheme because they were happily unemployed and wanted to be left alone.  However, fairly soon people asked me if I could stop them from being taken off a scheme because they wanted to stay on it.  When people had done three years on a community employment scheme, there was a battle to extend it.  There were also battles in regard to people over 55 and over 60.</P>
        <P>F&Aacute;S plays a very important role.  We spoke about what it is doing in the community.  Projects would not be possible without it.  F&Aacute;S provides psychological help and support to people by providing training to enable them get back to work and by enabling them to participate in community employment schemes and so on.  People have something to do when they get up in the morning and a social outlet to meet people in similar circumstances.  The new unemployed are better trained and skilled.  We must be able to tie what we have in terms of training and skills with what we need.</P>
        <P>There are opportunities in this Bill and I wish the Minister of State well with it.  I heard Members of the Opposition state they will table amendments to it.  I hope the standard of the amendments tabled will be a little higher than some of the debate which has taken place.  Cheap shots were taken which are not becoming of this House.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DaraCalleary"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dara Calleary</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senators for their contributions and look forward to continuing the debate on Committee Stage.  I wish to make a number of points on the appointment of the board.  On Committee Stage in the other House, I made a commitment that we would take into account nominations from the Select Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment, as well as the joint committee, to the board of F&Aacute;S.  I intend to see that commitment through.</P>
        <P>As I said in my interaction with Senator O&rsquo;Toole, we will place advertisements in the national newspapers on Thursday seeking expressions of interest from people who may wish to join the board of F&Aacute;S and who fulfil the criteria.  I assure the House that it is not window dressing.  We are serious about opening it up as widely as possible.  We have already had more than 200 expressions of interest since it was known that a new board would be appointed.</P>
        <P>There is a debate to be had on whether one brings in people before they are appointed or whether one questions how they are doing their job after they are appointed.  I do not agree with Senator Buttimer on many issues but especially in regard to this idea of people appearing before an American Senate-style committee.  It is a part-time job because remuneration would not be enough to make it a full-time job.  We are asking people to come forward because they have specific strengths and talents and to put them before an American Senate-style committee would be asking too much.  Senator O&rsquo;Toole spoke about those appointed perhaps meeting the committee.  I will reflect on that as well as on his points about the board&rsquo;s sub-committees.</P>
        <P>I agree with Senators Carty and Buttimer on the apprentice situation.  We face a challenge in that regard.  We have done much work with the apprentices.  The institutes of technology training programme for redundant appreciates is providing 700 places.  When combined with the existing initiative for redundant apprentices, including the ESB programme, approximately 3,800 apprentices are progressing their apprenticeships or are receiving training.  We have more to do in that regard.</P>
        <P>Senator Burke mentioned the capacity to deliver to those unemployed tradespeople and their capacity to get involved in community activities.  I drove around Mayo yesterday on flooded roads.  The roads were flooded for the want of few leaves being taken out of gutters and drainage tables being opened.  That is an area in which we could use people.  I am open to suggestions on activation policies, especially programmes which train people to move into the <Col N="371"/>workplace.  I do not want training programmes in F&Aacute;S to become permanent as that is not what they are designed for.  I ask Senators to come forward with ideas in that regard.</P>
        <P>A proper rebranding exercise for an organisation the size of F&Aacute;S and everything that would go with it would cost a fortune.  It could justifiably be regarded as a waste of money at a time when there are 420,000 people unemployed.  Every cent we spend on F&Aacute;S should be spent on getting people out of the situation in which they find themselves.  I accept damage has been done to the brand but throwing the baby out with the bathwater is too much.  At a time when every cent must be examined, rebranding is a luxury too far.</P>
        <P>The new director general, Paul O&rsquo;Toole, has already made strenuous efforts to talk to F&Aacute;S staff and clients and to show he is a new kid on the block and that he has a new style of management.  That coupled with a new style of board will assist in the rebranding that is necessary.</P>
        <P>A number of investigations are ongoing through the Committee of Public Accounts and the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Reports will follow that process.  I believe the Committee of Public Accounts will meet on Thursday week at which some issues will be considered.  I refer to the point Senator Burke made about courses and the assessment of courses.  An assessment is being done on all private trainers and the courses they provide to F&Aacute;S and that will be made public in due course.</P>
        <P>A number of Senators raised the cost of F&Aacute;S management.  I would like to give the actual story as opposed to the imagined one.  By the end of 2009, management grades in F&Aacute;S will have reduced, compared with 2003, by more than 10% and by 20% in the senior management grades.  F&Aacute;S will look at further reductions in staff in 2010.  During the ten-year period referred to in reports this morning, 75% of the increase in management grades occurred owing to a one step increase from a senior staff grade to assistant manager as part of the major restructuring the organisation.  F&Aacute;S management grades currently make up 12.8% of total staff and the associated costs must be seen in the context of the very wide responsibilities of the organisations.</P>
        <P>Again, I thank Senators who spoke for their interest.  I assure Senator Burke that I have been to Mayo Abbey at Senator Carty&rsquo;s invitation and it is a superb centre, as are so many F&Aacute;S projects.  Tonight many community organisations throughout this country will get together to provide services in health and so on and all sorts of commercial ventures on the back of F&Aacute;S and F&Aacute;S employees.  We are putting this board in place for those communities and those workers who have done us proud and that is why I look forward to a robust Committee Stage debate.</P>

        <P>What I seek in raising this matter is simple and straightforward.  From now to Christmas students are focused on next year&rsquo;s leaving certificate.  By January they will be filling in CAO forms or other forms, depending on whether they intend to study in this country or outside it.  Their focus in the period from Christmas to January is on to which college and to what course they will apply.  Once the application format is complete and the students have applied to colleges for their chosen courses, they are entirely focused on their exams.  I am confused as to the reason it is not possible for the Department of Education and Science at the start of the year to set out the criteria required for qualification for a grant and the information students should submit.</P>
        <P>When students are gearing their thoughts towards filling out forms for the college courses they wish to take and are prioritising them in the order of preference and their expected results in the leaving certificate, it is ridiculous that provision is not made for them to fill out simultaneously a form for the grants for which they might apply.  They cannot do that currently because the qualifying criteria is not provided by the Department in time and in line with the CAO process.  Therefore, this process takes place later in the year.</P>
        <P>The fact that students are geared more towards exams up to June and, in the case of many students, July, the concept of applying for a grant links in with a time when they have other things on their mind.  However, that is not the essential point.  The point is that by the time this information is given, it is very much into the summer.  Some students throughout the country are only now getting their first grant and others have been told it will definitely be the week before Christmas before they get any payment and then they will get a double payment.</P>
        <P>I remember a good few years ago the importance of the grant for those who were waiting to receive it.  The fact that students have to wait until the eve of Christmas for their grants is a difficulty for many of them.  I do not understand why staff in the various vocational education committees and county council offices should be put under pressure now because everything in this respect has been left to the last minute.  The criteria for qualification for student grants came out late, the students then applied for them and the staff in the offices have had to interpret those forms and check facts and figures.  By the time all the applications, of which there are now a glut, have been processed, it will be Christmas before they can be assessed.</P>
        <P>If the Department issued the criteria for student grants in January, students could submit their applications for grants at the same time as they submit their applications for college courses and the information required could be submitted any time between then and May or June.  The only critical point then is whether the students get the results they need for the courses for which they have applied.  However, if the processing of all the information is done to the point of waiting to learn if students get their first choice, second choice, or do not get sufficient points for any of their choices, at least that process would be logical and systematic.</P>
        <P>Some people might argue that we should wait for the introduction of Student Support Bill to make any changes that may need to be made, but I cannot understand why we would need to await the introduction of any other legislation.  I will bow to the expertise of the Minister of State in terms of his response, but I would like to think that if the Department could issue the information a little earlier to facilitate the county councils, the VECs, the potential students and their parents, it would do so.  The tax year has changed from April to March to 1 January to 31 December.  People&rsquo;s income details for last year are available from January as opposed to April as was the case in the past, which was a reason we would not have needed to bring forward the date in this respect.</P>
        <P>What I seek is simple when one considers it written in black and white.  The information should be submitted earlier and the turnaround in terms of the processing of the applications <Col N="373"/>could then be more systematic.  It would take the pressure off the staff in the offices, the students and their parents.  The opposite is the case now.  Students and their parents are under pressure and are berating the staff in offices because students do not have the money they need to make ends meet.  Everybody is trying to be realistic and accommodating but, unfortunately, the poor staff are getting abuse and students are doing their best to hold down colleges places.</P>
        <P>We met representatives of the Union of Students in Ireland last week.  I would always encourage students to take up part-time jobs, whether stacking shelves or some other job, to earn some money.  Such work helps them to socialise in a different forum, although it is probably not one to which they would aspire to work in the future.  Such learning curves are important and they should avail of the opportunity to earn some extra money.  However, there are no part-time jobs in some parts of the country.  Therefore, students do not have the fall-back position that students had in earlier times.</P>
        <P>As a spokesperson on education, I look forward to the making of such simple changes which would have significant implications for everybody involved, be it the student, his or parents or those within and outside the system.  There is pressure to bring forward the introduction of the Student Support Bill but it should not be the be-all and end-all in regard to this issue.  Provision should be made for the grant criteria to be released earlier in order that students can be aware that January is the month for form filling and once such form filling is complete, they can relax and focus on what they need to, namely, getting the best possible results in the leaving certificate.</P>
        <P>I hope the Minister of State will be in a position to tell me that the Department might be in a position, even by way of regulation, to fast track the criteria in this respect.  The lack of such provision currently means that the process cannot be moved along.  The processing of forms in June, July or August that are needed at the start of September is not fair to those concerned.  None of us wants this unfair situation to continue any longer than is necessary.  I look forward to a positive response from the Minister of State on this matter.</P>

	<P>I am taking this Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe.  I thank the Senator for giving me this opportunity to outline the Department&rsquo;s plans in regard to applications by students for student grants.</P>
      
        <P>As the Senator will be aware, the Department funds four maintenance grant schemes for third level and further education students.  These are the higher education grants scheme, the vocational education committees scholarship scheme, the third level maintenance grants scheme for trainees and the maintenance grant scheme for students attending post-leaving certificate courses.  The higher education grants scheme is administered by the local authorities and the other three schemes are administered by vocational education committees.</P>
         <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The Department is actively engaged in a programme of administrative and legislative reform of student grants.  The overall objective of this programme of legislative and administrative reform is to facilitate the introduction of significant service level improvements in the administration of student grants, thus providing for greater consistency of application, improved client accessibility and timely delivery of grants to those who need them most.  It will include guaranteed timeframes for the assessment of grants and more efficient arrangements for handling applications.  It is envisaged that, when fully implemented, the administration of student grants will be a significantly more customer-oriented system involving a more simplified and accessible application system.</P>
        <?oasys _cl13.5- ?><P>The Student Support Bill provides for the transfer of responsibility for student grants to the VEC sector.  In the existing budgetary situation, resources are not available to advance transition to new administrative arrangements in the immediate future.  However, it is not possible <Col N="374"/>to say definitively at this point when new administrative arrangements can be put in place and the Minister is keen, in light of the commitment to put all student grants on a statutory footing, to provide a statutory basis for all student grants for the intervening period and to advance improvements to the current administrative arrangements.  Therefore, the Department is endeavouring to progress at the earliest possible date to a single scheme of grants as provided for in the Bill while further exploring the options for administrative streamlining in the context of budgetary considerations and the Government&rsquo;s overall programme of public service reform, Transforming Public Services.</P>
       <P>The Department is actively engaged with VECs and local authorities on several initiatives through several technical working groups, which will bring improvements on an incremental basis.  The comprehensive and user-friendly website, <i>www.studentfinance.ie</i>, an initiative of the Higher Education Authority, HEA, and funded by the Department, is already proving to be valuable in helping students to access information on the various grants available for further and higher education.  In addition to providing information on the grants administered by the local authorities and vocational education committees, it also offers information on the back to education allowance, the student assistance fund and the fund for students with disabilities.  This considerable store of information is proving to be of great benefit.</P>
        <P>In streamlining the process of applying for a student grant, this year for the first time a downloadable application form was available on the <i>www.studentfinance.ie</i> website.  A student can print the application form and complete it in full, or alternatively download the application form, complete it on-screen and print it.  Course acceptance forms, which must accompany the application form where a student has accepted a place on an approved course, are also available to print from the <i>www.studentfinance.ie</i> website.</P>
        <P>A business process re-engineering exercise is being conducted in respect of the administration of student grants.  This exercise, being undertaken as part of the Government&rsquo;s Transforming Public Services initiative, will involve a deep-rooted analysis of the existing schemes, services, processes and procedures to identify the improvements that can be made.  It is designed to effect an enhancement both of the quality of customer service and the efficiency and value for money of service delivery.  Alongside this initiative, the Department is engaged in the development of a new, more user-friendly application form for student grants, which we all welcome.  As part of the overall programme of reform, it is planned to make application forms available a good deal earlier in the year such that students can submit grant applications following completion of the CAO process, as suggested by Senator Keaveney.  It is also planned to introduce earlier closing dates such that the process of assessing grant applications can be brought forward significantly to enable early decisions on grant applications to be made by the awarding authorities.  I thank the Senator once again for raising this matter.</P>

	<P>I welcome the information contained in the Minister of State&rsquo;s reply.  I appreciate there is a bigger picture in respect of the student support scheme.  My point in raising the issue was to indicate that in the meantime we might be able to effect an interim solution, which the Minister appears to be offering.  If the Department officials are listening, perhaps they could forward an indication of the date they are considering, since the Minister of State referred to bringing it forward significantly.  That is all I seek at this point.  I thank the Minister of State for his response.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Leas-Chathaoirleach for the opportunity to raise this matter and I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Calleary, who is earning his keep this evening, for his attendance.  The Minister of State will be aware from his involvement with &Oacute;gra Fianna F&aacute;il of the importance of the involvement of young people in politics.  It is also important for <Col N="375"/>people across the political spectrum to vote and participate in elections.  Those of us who study politics will be aware of the trends in turnout for elections and of the decline in turnout in various types of elections.  Participation is most important and voting is the most democratic action any citizen can make.</P>
        <P>It is time to allow the franchise to be extended and to make it more accessible for people.  Let us consider the way in which we run concurrent elections, for example, the running of local and European elections.  If they were held separately, the turnout would be low in each case.  However, I believe the running of local elections has helped European elections.  Let us consider the turnout in referenda, with the possible exception of the last Lisbon treaty referendum.</P>
        <P>It is time for the way in which we organise elections and the way in which we allow people to vote to be changed.  During the recently concluded election process in the USA, I observed the process in New Jersey in which the State extended the franchise to its citizens and allowed them to vote from home using a new website, <i>www.njvotefromhome.com</i>.  I appreciate the difficulty we have had with electronic voting and the lack of accountability and transparency, and I have no wish for the Minister, Deputy Gormley, to return to the excesses of that matter.  However, we could request citizens to vote from home by postal ballot.  It would be easy to arrange, expand the franchise and allow citizens to vote from home.</P>
        <P>I say as much because I noticed the number of people who live, work or study in Cork city but who had to go back to their homes in Munster or outside Munster to vote.  On a given day of an election it may not suit a person to vote because of work or study commitments.  Equally, there are people who may go on holidays or on pilgrimage.  For example, during the last local elections, a considerable number of people from the diocese of Cork and Ross were on a pilgrimage to Lourdes and could not vote.  They were predominately in the age category of 50 years and above and they were disenfranchised on that occasion.</P>
        <P>We must consider a means of attracting people to vote and we must not be afraid of enticing participation.  I note the state of Oregon and other states in the USA have absentee ballots.  I believe we should consider an absentee ballot, whether for Irish people who have emigrated, who work abroad or who are on holiday.  We should allow people the opportunity to vote.  I note the state of Oregon has had no verifiable evidence of voter fraud.  Checks and balances were in place.  It should be possible to put in place a franchise that allows people to vote from home, whether by postal vote or electronically by computer.</P>
        <P>Another bugbear of mine is the timing of elections.  I have become a firm advocate of using Sunday as the day to hold an election.  It would ensure the majority of students would be available to vote and casting a vote on that day would be more accessible than other days.  I appreciate some people would be on shift work but, generally, fewer people work on Sunday.  It could create more of an opportunity for people to vote.</P>
        <P>I recognise the Minister, Deputy Gormley, referred to the possibility of 16 and 17 year old people voting in local elections for a trial period.  However, we must increase the interaction between young people and politicians in the body politic, perhaps through their appointment to strategic policy committees, SPCs, in local authorities.  I note the Minister of State is looking at me quizzically.  As he is well aware, some people do not bother to turn up to SPC meetings and there is nothing wrong with giving young people an opportunity to attend such meetings.</P>
        <P>The basic thrust of my argument is that we must think outside the box about election participation.  I hope the Minister of State will give some thought to extending the franchise to allow people to vote from home.  The Minister of State should also consider extending the postal vote.  It is currently restricted to the elderly, the disabled and members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Defence Forces and the Naval Service.  It is restricted but it should be opened to allow more people to participate.  We have gone beyond the impersonation stage and beyond being afraid of who will vote.  We should open the franchise and consider how best we can get people <Col N="376"/>to participate in democracy.  Opening the franchise to allow people to vote from home would help to accomplish this.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DaraCalleary"><NameTxt>Deputy Dara Calleary</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Buttimer for raising this issue and for giving me the opportunity to brief the House on the issue of postal voting.  Under electoral law, in order to be able to vote at elections and referendums in this jurisdiction, a person&rsquo;s name must be entered on the register of electors for a constituency in the State in which the person ordinarily resides.  Each city and county council is statutorily responsible for maintaining the electoral register in its functional area, which comes into force on 15 February each year.  The person&rsquo;s citizenship determines the polls at which he or she is entitled to vote.</P>
        <P>Postal voting is provided for in electoral law, as enacted by the Oireachtas, in respect of certain categories of persons who are entered in the register of electors.  The Electoral Act 1992 provides for postal voting by wholetime members of the Defence Forces, members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Irish diplomats serving abroad and their spouses.  Subsequent legislation enacted by the Oireachtas has extended postal voting to other categories.  The Electoral (Amendment) Act 1996 covers electors living at home who are unable to vote because of a physical illness or a physical disability.  The Electoral Act 1997 addresses electors whose occupation, service or employment makes it likely that they will be unable to vote in person at their local polling station on polling day.  In these cases, the law provides for completion of the necessary voting documentation at a Garda station.  The same Act also gives postal votes to fulltime students registered at their home who are living elsewhere while attending an educational institution in the State.  The Electoral (Amendment) Act 2001 covers certain election staff employed at the poll outside the constituency where they reside.  The Electoral (Amendment) Act 2006 includes in the postal voting arrangements electors who are likely to be unable to go in person on polling day to vote because of the circumstances of their detention in prison pursuant to an order of a court.  As in other electoral matters, in considering the possible extension of postal voting, there is a need to strike a balance between facilitating participation in the democratic process by the greatest possible number, to which Senator Buttimer refers and to which we all subscribe, and the need to avoid putting in place arrangements that are open to abuse and that would be difficult to enforce, thereby undermining the validity of the whole process.</P>
        <P>The programme for Government, agreed in 2007, contains a commitment to establish an independent Electoral Commission that will, amongst other things, take responsibility for electoral administration and oversight and implement modern and efficient electoral practices.  The renewed programme for Government reaffirms this commitment and states the commission will propose reforms to the electoral system across a wide range of areas within 12 months.  I have no doubt that postal voting will be one aspect of the electoral system that will arise for consideration in this context.  This is the best way to take forward consideration of the important issues that have been raised this evening.</P>
        <P>I agree with Senator Buttimer on the question of Sunday voting.  Regarding the interaction of young people and this House, we should pay tribute to the education programme of the Oireachtas and to the outreach officers doing such a fine job.  I am not sure if we should inflict young people on SPCs.</P>
