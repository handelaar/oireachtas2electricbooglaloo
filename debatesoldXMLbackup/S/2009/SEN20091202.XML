	<P>I have received notice from Senator Paschal Donohoe that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism to provide an update on the policy to amalgamate the National Gallery, the Museum of Modern Art and the Crawford Gallery and the plans, if any, he has for legislation to achieve same.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Fidelma Healy Eames of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Transport to confirm how secure the funding for the western rail corridor is and to outline the timeframe for implementation of same.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>Yesterday we saw one news media organisation claiming it had an exclusive on the Government&rsquo;s approach to the budget &mdash; there would be a 10% cut in child benefit and a 5% cut in all social welfare payments.  On the same day we saw the possible strike being averted, which I welcome, and a new proposal on unpaid leave being made.  I have a number of questions on these issues.</P>
        <P>It appears a briefing on the budget was given to one media organisation, which is in sharp contrast to the announcement made on the taking of unpaid leave.  Is the aim of this kite flying exercise and media briefing to test backbench and Independent Member opinion?  With regard to the proposal on unpaid leave, last week we saw the impact a one-day strike could have on public services, with the cancellation of outpatient appointments and hospitals struggling desperately to catch up.  It appears the Government is now proposing staff in the public sector take 12 days unpaid leave.  Serious questions which should be debated in this House arise about the impact of such a proposal on services.  Front-line staff are already stretched in trying to provide a service.  We do not want the wrong decisions to be made, as we must keep our international credibility in managing the public finances.</P>
        <P>I am concerned also about the proposed 10% cut in child benefit which is used to help every family in the country.  Many payments under the umbrella of child benefit are used to meet child care costs.  I ask that the Minister be invited to the House today to discuss the matter.  I, therefore, propose an amendment to the Order of Business to continue the discussion on these serious issues.</P>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>In the past few weeks I have spoken on a number of occasions about the possible outcome of the negotiations in Government Buildings.  The two main objects for everybody are to reduce the public sector pay bill by &euro;1.3 billion and decrease the number of public sector personnel by 15,000.  It seemed as if they were two impossible objectives but now it appears the Government has managed to convince the social partners on all sides that this will be done.  It seems clear also that there will be agreement.</P>
        <P>I will make two clear points.  Reducing public sector numbers by 15,000 will have an impact on services and require the remaining staff to increase productivity and work longer or smarter.  A reasonable question was raised by Senator Fitzgerald but how will this proposal work in the education sector which appears to be receiving attention?  Every year approximately 10,000 primary teachers take a five-day course during their summer holidays.  In return, they are entitled to three privilege days during the course of the year.  In other words, they give up 50,000 days and are entitled to 30,000 back during the course of the year.  In our experience spanning decades teachers never take more than two thirds of the leave to which they are entitled.  As has been noted in the House, for the first one, two or three days of sick leave, schools are not entitled to bring in a paid substitute.  I give this information in order that Members can understand schools are structured to deal with the occasional absence of individual teachers.  This will have to happen if the arrangement takes effect.  It is not the ideal &mdash; I do not love it &mdash; but it is not new or novel.</P>
        <P>Nobody has said how the public sector will work with 15,000 fewer staff.  This is the first time we have seen anybody try to make it work smarter.  I do not know if it will work but there is an outline of the process.  The Government has taken the first step towards reducing the size of the public sector which will try to work with fewer staff.  This is what all parties have asked <Col N="3" />for.  The Government will save money and the strike has been averted.  Pupils will not lose out and parents will not be discommoded but the service will be uninterrupted.  There will be a reduction in public service numbers and we will arrive at the beginning of public sector reform.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This process squares a circle that in the past month or two people said would be impossible to do.  The way forward is very difficult and it is a little unfair to call it a climbdown.  Staff who would work for ten or 12 days without being paid did not see it that way last night when I spoke to them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not sure about the particular media outlet which was briefed by the Government and I am interested in hearing more about the matter.  It is interesting to read reports in newspapers which in the past stated &mdash; perhaps hoped &mdash; the public service unions would be beaten.  They are now leading with headlines that the Government has caved in to the public service unions.  It cannot be both; in my view, it is neither.  One newspaper has stated trade union leaders were jubilant last night about this agreement.  That is fanciful; the union leaders certainly do not look jubilant in the photograph carried beside the article.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>They never do.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>They have no reason to be jubilant and they are not looking for jubilation.  They are not looking for humiliation and defeat either, which appears to be what some commentators and politicians want.  It seems the only way some think we can make progress is through confrontation, with people being beaten and shot down.  I do not agree with this or see it as the way forward for the country or the public service.  As somebody who absolutely supports the need for radical reform in the public service, I know that nobody in his or her right mind believes it can be achieved in two weeks of negotiations.  How could all of the issues we have debated here be addressed in such a short time?  It is nonsensical or daft to suggest that was possible.  There was no cave-in and the trade unions have not won a famous victory.  In one newspaper report a trade union group describes what happened yesterday as &ldquo;the greatest betrayal in the history of the Irish trade union movement&rdquo;.  Which is it?  My party has called for negotiations with a view to reaching agreement.  Yesterday&rsquo;s developments represent a small but welcome advance.  It is only an interim measure, not a solution to the problem and I do not know if it will work.</P>
        <P>Senators Fitzgerald and O&rsquo;Toole may be right in raising questions about how the 12 days unpaid leave proposal will work.  Perhaps in a couple of years we will describe them as the 12 days of Christmas 2009.  We do not know how the proposal will work.  The idea should be considered further and thrashed out in the next couple of weeks.  Do we want confrontation or to make progress?  People must decide what they want: do they want to see people beaten or do they want to see a national recovery effort involving all of the people in order to see a turn-around of our current economic position?  For that limited reason, yesterday&rsquo;s developments are welcome.  In the Labour Party we have argued that the public sector pay bill must be reduced.  Serious efforts should be made to achieve this without cutting basic pay.  The interim agreement seems to suggest this is possible.  However, I do not know if it will ultimately be possible to reduce the public sector pay bill without cutting basic pay but I hope it will.  This represents a small step forward in that regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>Most Senators will welcome the agreement with the social partners on how we can address the immediate budgetary position.  It is an agreement to help us meet the &euro;4 billion adjustment the Minister for Finance will address in the other House next week and which we in this House will have another opportunity to debate.  I agree with Senator Alex White in his contention that it is an interim measure and an exercise to meet the immediate <Col N="4" />problem of a &euro;4 billion adjustment.  We must be conscious that in documentation sent to the European Commission we committed to a further &euro;4 billion adjustment next year and the following year.  There shall be adjustments until 2014.  On that basis, we can only see today&rsquo;s agreement as an interim measure and must constantly examine the cost of the public service in terms of wages and the numbers working within it.  The adjustment we will be making on 9 December will only be one of three or four to be made in subsequent budgets.  On these grounds, we can only welcome the fact that there is some agreement and a sense of reality entering the wider public debate on our difficult budgetary position.  We cannot avoid forever the more difficult decisions that lie ahead.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment to the Order of Business.  I agree with other Senators that nobody wants confrontation, but we are entitled to know more.  While this may be an interim measure, there must be more to it because it seems to leave us at least &euro;500 million short in the plan to cut &euro;1.3 billion from the public sector wage bill.  It is only an interim measure and we hope it will work, but we are in the dark as to whether it will.  Thank God, however, there will not be a strike tomorrow. </P>
        <P>As Senator Fitzgerald said, we must have some concerns with regard to the impact of this measure on services, particularly education.  It was good to hear Senator O&rsquo;Toole outline how we may be able to get around some of the problems.  Health is a more serious area of concern and I look forward to hearing what the Leader has to say on the issue.  It is important that in taking this route we allow&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Does the Senator have a question for the Leader?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Of course.  Will the Leader explain to us how the unpaid leave system will work?  What will happen in the case of good patriotic workers who continue to work?  Some people do not want to be out of work and will be willing to continue working and take the hit &mdash; just as everybody in this House and the other are taking a hit.  We must all put our shoulders to the wheel.  No one can stand aside from the national effort.  I understand there is a provision that people can defer the unpaid leave and obtain holidays in lieu down the line.  Perhaps the Leader will explain how this will work.  Does this mean we are getting into a never-ending deferral of the situation?  We need more detail on the issues and for that reason, I second the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I salute the trade union movement because it has demonstrated the maturity and responsibility we have come to associate with it through the years.  In the bad old days, it was the trade union movement that stood up on behalf of the most vulnerable sections of society.  As a result, we had the Celtic tiger period.  Without the trade union movement, that would not have happened.  I see what is emerging from the negotiations as an exercise in responsibility which will help ensure confrontation can be avoided.  If we look back on the record of this House in the past few months at some of the many constructive comments made here, we will see many of our concerns reflected in what is now emerging from the negotiations.  If we did not achieve the result we now seem so close to achieving, what would the alternative have been?  It would not only have meant confrontation, but also loss of jobs.  It would also have undermined any possibility we had of making progress.  We are all aware of the crisis we are in and have discussed it here at length.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We should also salute the Government, not just with regard to this issue.  If the word &ldquo;compromise&rdquo; is not central to every effort made, we will not succeed.  We are all aware of and have met the different lobby groups.  If we are to find any cohesion in the future, we must be prepared to look at our own position.  We have all said it is necessary to have individual <Col N="5" />sacrifices.  In many ways, these individual sacrifices are inculcated in the representative groups involved in the negotiations.  Many of those here have called for a return to social partnership.  We have had virtual social partnership in the past couple of weeks and I would be very surprised if we did not return to full social partnership in the future, which is precisely what we want.</P>
        <P>When we talk about a victor, we are not talking about trade unions, employers or Government.  The country will be the victor.  As legislators, that must be our main concern.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I propose an amendment to the Order of Business, namely, that non-Government motion No. 39, No. 21 on the Order Paper, be taken without debate before<?oasys _jy ?>No. 1.</P>
        <P>I found yesterday&rsquo;s debate very interesting and compliment the Leader on having that debate.  A pre-budget debate eight days before the budget makes a great deal of sense.  I am not sure I understand how we can stand up today and debate it again.  However, as Senator Fitzgerald said, there has been a development with the publication in one medium of the results of the agreement yesterday.</P>
        <P>I was rather honoured by Senator Alex White yesterday who referred to my thoughts as being fanciful.  That is quite a compliment to me.  I hope Senator White does not mind me returning the compliment by saying his thoughts today were a little fanciful.  I am concerned by some of the details regarding the 12 days unpaid leave.  Senator O&rsquo;Toole said those 12 days could be spread over a number of years.  Senator Fitzgerald spoke earlier about the importance of international credibility.  I have a concern about international credibility with regard to the deal it appears was made yesterday.  As I was coming to work this morning I heard someone on the radio speak about a company in the private sector whose employees took two weeks unpaid leave last year.  However, they got paid unemployment benefit during those two weeks and came out better than they would have done.  I would like my mind to be put at rest.  I would like to know this will be a win situation for the State and it will save &euro;1 billion, or whatever it expects to save, on the basis of agreeing to unpaid leave.</P>
        <P>I have a concern about the service we will get if we are so overstaffed that we can do without the 12 days of work.  I do not understand this.  I have some grandchildren at school in France and have met some of their teachers there.  They cannot understand the education system here and the number of days and hours worked in teaching in Ireland.  I also have a huge concern with regard to the number of appointments that had to be cancelled when we had just a one-day strike last week.  If it is such a benefit to have 12 days off, would it not have been better to have 12 days strike and save the money on that basis?  I ask this with tongue in cheek.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlexWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Alex White</NameTxt>
	<P>That is fanciful.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes it is.  I have a serious concern about the situation if we do not get international recognition that we are taking the necessary tough steps.  If we say we must avoid confrontation at all costs, we will do ourselves damage, the amount of money we will have to continue to borrow and pay interest on will continue for years to come and we will not get out of our difficulty.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>We had a good debate on the budget yesterday.  For the next week and beyond the main topic of discussion for people will be the budget.  Nobody here is certain of what exactly has been agreed in the discussions.  There are reports in the newspapers that there will be a pay cut of 7% or similar, which I think is too low, plus 12 days unpaid leave.  If it is a case of unpaid leave with no pay cut, we are fudging the serious challenges facing the country.  If that is the case, we are letting down good civil and public servants throughout the country. <Col N="6" /> Many of these people have talked to me about the situation.  They work hard but they have told me they cannot take the already generous holidays they have because of the workload.  To add 12 unpaid leave days to that achieves nothing for them.  They expect and anticipate a pay cut and if we avoid that &mdash; for whatever reason &mdash; we are in a serious situation. </P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator O&rsquo;Toole spoke about 15,000 people and it seems the 12 days would equate to losing approximately 15,000 or 17,000 people in the public service.  McCarthy already mentioned cutting the public service by 17,000.  This brings us to 34,000.  However, I think we need to reduce numbers in the public service by between 50,000 and 60,000 people.  Within the past 11 years public service numbers have increased by 150,000.  It would be nice to think we could sustain that, but we cannot.  I know of public service offices where the staff in them have no work to do.  I have heard that from people working in the same area of those public services.</P>
        <P>I can give an example from my area of public servants in the health services being entitled to go home if there is a power cut.  A power cut occurred in a building they were sharing with others at 2 p.m.  The generator was switched on and power returned but they were told the rule is if the ESB cuts the power, the workers are entitled to leave and so they went home.  There is no place for this action in any organisation and particularly not in the public service given the serious difficulties facing this country.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>I am genuinely concerned that this move by the unions to propose 12 days&rsquo; unpaid leave for public servants is a financial exercise, a stroke of the pen that will work outside.  It will work fine in theory but not in practice.  I ask the House to consider the impact on children and on their classroom education which could be monumental.  I disagree with my colleague, Senator O&rsquo;Toole, on this issue.  I am a teacher who qualified in the mid-1980s and who benefited from those three days&rsquo; personal leave arrangements.  Whenever one of us teachers needed to take personal leave, it meant mayhem for the other teachers because my 35 children had to be put in on top of other teachers&rsquo; classes.  With three days&rsquo; personal leave, sick leave which is now not covered by substitution and now 12 days&rsquo; leave on top, a teacher could genuinely be absent for up to 20 days a year.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">No interruptions, please, Senator.  We do not want a Second Stage speech on that matter.  We want questions to the Leader.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator should not mind my indulgence.  It is questions to the Leader.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to know from the Leader whether there has been a buy-in by principals and teachers on this issue.  Unless there is agreement from front-line staff, this will not work and it is our children who will be hurt.  There will be a lowering of standards.  Ireland does not rank against the top countries in the OECD.  We are just hanging in there about average.  Other countries such as Finland are investing in their teachers.  I have a great difficulty with this proposal.  I support the Fine Gael amendment to the Order of Business that this matter be discussed because the practicalities of the proposal will affect our children&rsquo;s education and this is my concern.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianODomhnaill"><NameTxt>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill</NameTxt>
	<P>I refer to what has been said about the negotiations between Government and the trade unions over the past 48 hours.  I join other Senators in welcoming the discussions and the commitment from the trade union movement to discuss with Government the seriousness of the situation.  However, I seek clarification to ensure these proposals will not have detrimental effects on public services.  I welcome the fact that strike action will not take place tomorrow and public services will be provided tomorrow.  Many local authorities and departmental sections are under pressure currently to provide the services and a cut of 12 days in such areas may have a detrimental effect.  I am not suggesting this would be the case but I seek clarification on the effects.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Foils&iacute;odh an plean 20 bliain don Ghaeilge an tseachtain seo caite ag an Aire Gn&oacute;tha&iacute; Pobail, Tuaithe agus Gaeltachta.  Leagtar amach strait&eacute;is ann 20 bliain idir na Ranna Rialtais i dtaca leis an nGaeilge ar fud an oile&aacute;in agus cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an tuarasc&aacute;il sin a thabharfaidh todhcha&iacute; l&aacute;idir don teanga, n&iacute; hamh&aacute;in sa Ghaeltacht ach ar fud an St&aacute;it.</P>
        <P>I welcome this 20-year strategic plan for the Irish language.  I ask for a debate on that document as soon as possible and on the role of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Arts, Sport, Tourism, Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, of which Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; is a member.  The first step would be to feed the molta&iacute; or recommendations back to that committee and to the Minister.  I hope that, subsequent to the work of the committee, this House would have an opportunity to discuss the document ahead of the Minister making any further decisions based on recommendations from the committee.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilPrendergast"><NameTxt>Senator Phil Prendergast</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">With regard to the proposal for 12 days&rsquo; unpaid leave in the public service, I wish to comment on how it would operate in the nursing profession where there is a policy of summer closures in different hospitals, specifically in South Tipperary General Hospital where nurses routinely take unpaid leave and often at the end of a period of maternity leave.  Therefore, this arrangement is already in operation in many places.</P>
        <P>I was forced to cancel some of my clinics because of the flooding which continues to be an horrific experience for many people around the country.  I met many clients who are very concerned at any intention by Government to cut child benefit as it will mean the difference between working and not working for such people.  It is well documented that an unemployed person is more costly to the State than a person who continues in employment.  The decision to stay working can hinge on as small a sum as &euro;10 or &euro;15.  It has been proven by research that each unemployed person costs the State &euro;20,000.  I do not regard this proposal about child benefit as being progress and it will affect disadvantaged people.</P>
        <P>I ask for a debate on a report in today&rsquo;s newspaper which shows a 70% drop in the times of waiting for operations.  I am being parochial in this regard but this statistic is not the case in the south east as yet because no one I meet in my clinics has experienced any lessening in waiting times.  I suggest this drop only applies in Dublin or the bigger centres or the centres of excellence or whatever one wishes to call them but it has not reached the sunny south east just yet.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Like my colleagues, I refer to the discussions that took place in Government Buildings last night and I have some questions for the Leader.  Many of my colleagues have pointed out that these are interim measures and that nobody knows whether they will work or what their effect will be.  It is bit late now for such questions.  The discussions have been going on in different forms for the past six to 12 months.  The difficulties faced by our economy are very well flagged in the OECD report.  It is very late in the day for people to be standing up and saying they do not know whether these measures will work and that these are only interim measures.  A person facing a cut in child benefit will know the effect this will have <Col N="8" />on his or her income.  A young person facing the effect of a reduction in social welfare and dole payments knows the effect this will have.  Nobody is saying to these people these will be temporary or interim measures and we do not know what the effects will be.</P>
        <?oasys _cl13.5- ?><P>I have two questions for the Leader.  From what I have gathered from the media, people are saying there will be a 5% cut for everybody.  Where is the equity in such a proposal?  Does it mean that a person on &euro;125,000 a year and another person on &euro;25,000 a year will both face the same percentage cut?  Where is the fairness, equity or justice, in such a proposal?</P>
        <P Just="Left">I heard people on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; saying this will be a temporary cut.  Nobody represented by these people believes this, whether these are union leaders or politicians.  We know the difficulty we are facing is much deeper, more permanent and more structural.  As much as I welcome ambiguity at times and know the role it plays in politics, we need clarity not just for the international markets but also for our own people.  The consensus that has ill-served our country in the past three or four years is at grave danger of being repeated.  I am terrified that not just the Government but everybody sitting around the table has bottled it.</P>

	<P>I second Senator Quinn&rsquo;s amendment to the Order of Business.  When that debate took place last year I was very pleased at the support which came from different sides of the House for that particular Bill.  I would be hopeful if at some future date it is discussed in the House that we may have more support from both sides of the House and that people might like to join me in proposing the Bill.</P>

Is fi&uacute; lua go bhfuil l&aacute; oscailte ag Conradh na Gaeilge inniu maidir le tuairisc McCarthy agus mholfainn do mo chomhghleacaithe dul trasna an bh&oacute;thair agus dul i mbun cainte leis na daoine ansin.</P>
        <P>It is good that a number of the unhelpful recommendations in the McCarthy have been set at nought by the 20-year strategy for the Irish language, which is welcome.  It would also be good, as Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill said, if people&rsquo;s proposals on the strategy were discussed by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Arts, Sport, Tourism, Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs and forwarded to the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.</P>
        <P>With regard to the emerging deal between the Government and the unions, while it is uncertain, I sincerely hope the Government is not fudging the issues.  Pay cuts have to be part of the plan to get the economy back in order and the budget back in balance but pay savings at the price of productivity cannot be a good idea.  This is not the way to go but I am conscious we are all making comments in a vacuum with great uncertainty.  Let us hope the Government continues to recognise these challenging times require big, brave decisions, not compromises that could fatally undermine the recovery strategy.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Leader invite the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach to the House to discuss this so-called agreement?  It is a classic Irish solution to an Irish problem with obfuscation and confusion.  I am sure the Leader will agree we have a Taoiseach who talks like Rambo and acts like Bambi while Mr. McLoone could not run F&Aacute;S, yet he can govern the country.  Where are we going?  Many questions need to be answered.  For example, what are the implications for public services, the public and the budget?  It is appalling that the Government cannot govern at all.  The deal illustrates the fact that the Government has no coherent, joined-up plan.  Does the Leader agree the sooner we have a general election to give a Government a mandate to govern the country, the better?</P>
        <P>I refer to the upcoming budget.  I have made a request to the Leader on numerous occasions because I am concerned that Ireland, as a sporting nation, will not be at the races and will be uncompetitive, which cannot be allowed to happen.  The Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, <Col N="9" />the Irish Sports Council and the Federation of Irish Sports must have a plan to fund our high performance athletes and sports for London 2012.  I welcome the deal between the GAA and the GPA which provides for recognition of the GPA.  It was a good day for Irish sport.  Irish sport deserves to be treated with respect by Government but that has not happened this year.  The Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism got rid of the sports capital programme while sports funding in general was cut.  If we are serious about sport and those involved, a plan must be in place which should be matched by Government funding in order that the tricolour can be raised aloft in London and national pride restored.</P>

	<P>When is it proposed to resume the debate on the Multi-Unit Developments Bill?  Has a date been agreed for the debate requested by a number of colleagues regarding domestic violence?  Would it be possible to hold it before the end of the session?</P>
        <P>I refer to the comments of colleagues on next week&rsquo;s budget.  We do not have sufficient money for the next few years.  The budget will represent an incredible challenge to the Government but if it cannot exempt people on welfare from cuts and the impact of the budget, then under no circumstances can any other sector of our community be exempt.  I agree with colleagues that the challenge in the budget will be to achieve the most equitable solution while minimising the impact on the most vulnerable sectors of our community.</P>

	<P>I welcome the deferral of the strike but, unfortunately, outpatient appointments and elective procedures scheduled for tomorrow were cancelled and, sadly, there is no time to reschedule these appointments.  It is fortunate for the parents of schoolchildren that they do not have to take a day off work.</P>
        <P>I am concerned about how under-resourced our health service has become.  Today&rsquo;s newspapers reported on the 17% increase in breast cancer deaths in the State while yesterday a significant report by St. James&rsquo;s Hospital highlighted a striking increase in the incidence of HIV-AIDS.  I seek an urgent debate on how the health service is being resourced.  I refer, in particular, to Mullingar Hospital which has been subject to numerous bed closures.  I have asked repeatedly for the Minister for Health and Children to be invited to the House and she has not attended.  Why is that?  When will she be in?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I join colleagues in welcoming the deferral of tomorrow&rsquo;s proposed strike.  Following a bleak week, flood waters are receding just as the prospect of a strike has receded but we are still facing into the appalling vista of the budget next week.  I would like a debate on a number of public services that are likely to be cut in the budget, especially those relating to early childhood care and education.  We are opposed to the expected cut in child benefit.  With a number of other Members, I was present at the launch of Start Strong, which was formerly the Irish Childcare Policy Network.  It put forward persuasive policy papers on the need for investment in early childhood care and education.  The Government is not willing to make such investment and we need a debate on how best to target funding in that area, just as we need to ensure child benefit is not cut.</P>
        <P>I also seek a debate on the third level sector which is likely to face even more cutbacks.  Students&rsquo; unions, particularly those in the Dublin Institute of Technology and Trinity College Dublin, have highlighted the severe effect of registration charges and the repeated increases in this charge.  Such charges are fees in all but name.  Other colleagues, notably Senator Healy Eames, have raised the issue many times.  The disimprovement in facilities for students at the same time as the registration charge is increasing means we need a proper debate.  Trinity College students have raised the way in which the registration charge is being spent.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Senator John Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>Many colleagues have referred to the proposed deal between the public service and the Government.  I would like a debate on this issue when it is finalised.  The Taoiseach said no deal would happen unless public services remained unaffected.  The deal is predicated on public services being maintained at their current high level.  However, the public service has stepped up to the mark and I hope there is a deal.  Whether it is through the pension levy or the unpaid leave proposal, the public service is playing its part well in our current circumstances.  There is a great deal of criticism of different functions of the public service, politics and the church.  The majority of people want to do their work conscientiously and well, whether they are in banks or wherever, and it does not serve us well to make broad statements about the church.  They are not the church; they are the antithesis of what the church is and what it should be.  Similarly, there are excellent public servants in the public service and I hope this deal goes through so that we may all benefit in these difficult times until we see better times.  The Government is spending hours, days, weeks and months to ensure the current budget is fair.  That is all we can ask of it.</P>

	<P>Senators Fitzgerald, O&rsquo;Toole, Alex White, Boyle, Coghlan, &Oacute; Murch&uacute;, Quinn, Walsh, Healy Eames, &Oacute; Domhnaill, Prendergast, Buttimer, Donohoe, Bacik and Hanafin welcome that the strike has been called off.  I welcome the good news and wish the talks and future deliberations well.  The majority of people want to see as many jobs maintained as possible.  Wages are not the be all and end all anymore; it is about having a job, having something to do and being able to make a contribution.  Next Wednesday I will propose on the Order of Business that the House adjourns at 3.30 p.m. until 6 p.m. to allow colleagues to attend the budget debate.  The House will return at 6 p.m.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Buttimer was anxious to know when the next election will be held.  My best guess is May 2012.  The last thing the country wants is a general election because if we had one, we would have two.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I say this from my vast experience, having gained this over quite a long time.  We need unanimity in respect of the challenges.  Some &euro;4 billion must be cut in the budget and however this is done we must protect those who are vulnerable in our society.  I agree with colleagues&rsquo; serious concerns about certain areas.  Senator Quinn proposed an amendment to the Order of Business, seconded by Senator Mullen, regarding motion No. 39, No. 21 on the Order Paper, and I agree to the amendment.  Senators &Oacute; Domhnaill and Mullen welcomed the 20 year plan for the Irish language proposed by the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v.  I understand this will be presented to the Oireachtas committee for its views.</P>
        <P>Senator Prendergast referred to child care benefits and I agree with much of what she said.  We realise that in the past few years child care benefits have quadrupled.  I welcomed that on many occasions here.  Regarding the issue of waiting lists, I will pass on her concerns to the Minister.</P>
        <P>I agree with the sentiments of Senator Buttimer that we should do everything we can to prepare our athletes for London 2012.  We should do anything that will lift the spirit of the nation so that we are proud of the talents on the island.  They should be given equal opportunity <Col N="11" />with everyone else in the world.  I concur with his good wishes and congratulations to everyone in the Gaelic Athletic Association and the GPA in respect of reaching agreement.</P>
        <P>Senator Corrigan referred to the Multi-Unit Developments Bill.  I will update the House on this matter tomorrow morning.  It is at an advanced stage.  We fully support Senator Corrigan&rsquo;s views on domestic violence.  I have no difficulty in doing anything I can to enhance the call by the Senator.  Senator McFadden called for a debate on health.  I have no difficulty in having the Minister for Health and Children come to the Chamber but we will leave it until after the budget.  The social welfare Bill will be discussed the week after the budget.</P>
        <P>Senators McFadden and Glynn and I speak in unison when doing everything we can to enhance the Midland Regional Hospital, Mullingar.  The figure of note is that in 2006 the Midland Regional Hospital, Mullingar received &euro;54 million and in 2009 it received &euro;64 million.  Major investment has been made in the hospital.  Some 19,000 patients were treated in the hospital last year, which augurs well for the future of the hospital.  Our concern is to ensure that nothing interferes with that.  I agree with the Senator&rsquo;s sentiments in this respect.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>The purpose of these amendments is to take account of the position of victims of crime and to provide them with legal representation.  Amendment No. 18 refers to the information given by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to victims of crime in terms of early release on bail and the terms of such release.  Amendment No. 19 refers to information in respect of parole and the notice of prosecution for breach of conditions of release, the way in which this information would be provided and the notice of discharge, leave of absence or escape of an accused or offender and the way in which he or she would be notified.  There is also an amendment in respect of deportation and provision for the appointment of a representative to receive these notices.  The other provisions are in the same vein and are designed to ensure the victims <Col N="13" />of crime receive the requisite information in respect of the convicted person.  This is in accord with the basic EU framework decision on the standing of victims in criminal proceedings.  We are trying to enhance the position of victims of crime and to provide them with reasonable information in all circumstances.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Regan&rsquo;s amendments.  Earlier, we debated other amendments concerning the treatment of victims.  At that stage the Minister stated in his view it was not appropriate to place those in statutory form.  I anticipate he may take the same view in respect of these amendments and I am conscious that some of the provisions are already carried out in practice, notably, that an investigating or prosecuting garda tends, where possible, to try to give victims notice of the release of accused persons on bail or following a term of imprisonment.  However, it is important these measures are placed in statutory form because research carried out on the treatment of victims within the criminal justice system shows that victims wish to be kept informed and notified.  I have carried out some research in this area as well.  It is of particular concern to victims when an offender or alleged offender is released on bail or following sentence but the victims are not informed.  There have been some very distressing situations in which victims have seen the person who assaulted them on the street but were not aware of their release from prison.  It is very important to have a statutory requirement that victims are kept notified of the release or deportation of offenders.  Another aspect of the amendments relates to the appointment of a victims&rsquo; representative.  This puts in place what occurs in practice in many cases whereby a victim support person accompanies the victim to court.  Many groups throughout the country provide court accompaniment services to victims.</P>
        <P>Yesterday, I remarked on the Order of Business that I was part of a Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights delegation that visited the new criminal courts complex on Parkgate Street.  I put on record in the presence of the Minister how impressed the other members of the delegation and I were with the new facilities offered there and I congratulate the Courts Service in this regard.  In particular, we were very impressed by the new facilities for victims or vulnerable witnesses, who are now to be kept separate from the public.  Excellent facilities are provided for these people, especially for child witnesses.  It is a very important and practical support offered to victims and witnesses in the Dublin area.  However, it is also important victims throughout the country are given notice by the Garda in cases where offenders are being released such that they are not taken by surprise or caused distress if they see someone on the street whom they understood was in prison.</P>

        <P Just="Left">I will read from my speaking note in respect of amendments Nos. 18 to 31.  It is important to indicate my views such that on Report Stage and in the other House they will be set down.  It is important for the preparation of further stages of the Bill to do this.</P>
        <P>However, before I do so I refer to the implementation of the EU framework decision referred to by Senator Regan.  I share the Senator&rsquo;s commitment to improving the services victims can expect to receive from our criminal justice agencies.  I am committed to ensuring we have the systems in place to deliver the best possible support for victims.  If we are to remain relevant there must be regular reviews and an enhancement of the systems.  In this regard I refer to the Justice for Victims initiative which I launched last year, which was the genesis of this Bill.  I also refer to the establishment of the victims of crime office within my Department, the commission for support of victims of crime and the review of the victims&rsquo; charter.  These are examples of the initiatives I have taken in the past 18 months since I became Minister.</P>
        <P>We must aim for a more effective means of delivery of services.  I favour the legislative approach when it is the most effective, efficient and appropriate means available.  The Bill bears testament to my commitment to introduce legislation when necessary and appropriate.  However, I am also impressed by the effectiveness of the voluntary service providers and the suitability of the services they provide.  We have an obligation to support and assist these organisations.  However it is the personal commitment and dedication of the organisations that contribute to their success.  I fear that many of these attributes would be lost if we interfered too much and reduced the scope of voluntary effort.  In particular, I would be concerned that a statutory framework for all the services would impose a rigidity and result in a loss of much that is good in the current approach.  I am committed to supporting the organisations to which I refer and the targeted, high quality services they provide for specific categories of victims.  These groups articulate the needs of their clients.  By channelling our resources through them, we are avoiding bureaucratic logjams and maximising value for money.  We are also ensuring victims obtain a service which is tailored to their needs.</P>
        <P>I am pleased to inform the House that since 2005 the Commission for the Support of Victims of Crime has provided &euro;5 million for more than 50 voluntary bodies which support the victims of crime.  The commission which operates independently under the aegis of my Department places special emphasis on funding services that assist victims in court.  I mention this as a very good example of targeted services.</P>
        <P>The Senator will understand, therefore, I cannot accept his belief that legislation is necessary in order to secure the delivery of the notification services mentioned in amendments Nos. 18 to 23, inclusive, or the elaborate mechanisms foreseen in amendments Nos. 24 to 29, inclusive, with regard to the appointment of representatives.  I accept that, even in the absence of legislation, there must always be a general policy or framework.  The victims&rsquo; charter provides such a framework.  Since it was first published almost a decade ago, the charter has provided the impetus for the development of new services and highlighted the benefits of co-ordination within an overall framework.  It has shown itself to be very effective.  Like most things, however, it requires periodic review.  As stated, I have arranged for such a review to take place and hope to be in a position to publish the revised charter in the first quarter of 2010.  Where possible, I wish to improve the implementation of the existing charter provisions and discover where new provisions might usefully be added.  With that general approach in mind, I will now comment on the amendments.</P>
        <P>The amendments under discussion can be split into two groups.  The first group, comprising amendments Nos. 18 to 23, inclusive, and 30 and 31, focuses on the provision of information for victims  and facilitating communication between victims during certain criminal justice pro<Col N="15" />cedures such as those related to bail and parole.  The notification proposals would certainly result in victims being given a great deal of information on offenders.  However, have victims been asked whether they want such an arrangement to be put in place?  I am not aware of a demand for such a statutory-based service.  Knowing that the offender has been convicted and sentenced is enough for most victims because it represents closure.  Regular updates would, in many cases, be an unwelcome reminder.  I prefer the current system, under which the victim initiates contact with the victim liaison services of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or the Irish Prison Service and makes the decision that he or she wishes to be informed of significant developments in the investigation of the offence or the detention of the offender.  Under this system, victims are contacted in writing or by telephone at the appropriate times.</P>
        <P>I am also concerned about the resource implications of the amendments.  Amendments Nos. 18 to 23, inclusive, would place responsibility for ensuring victims were given notice of several issues &mdash; ranging from bail proceedings to the deportation of offenders &mdash; by the Secretary General of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  Giving effect to these proposals would require another layer of bureaucracy.  While that would be of doubtful value, we must also wonder if victims, as a group, would be better served than they are under the current arrangements.  The services and procedures of the Court Service, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Irish Prison Service would be channelled through the Department as opposed to dealing directly with victims, as is the current practice.</P>
        <P>I also note that the amendments do not distinguish between serious and less serious offences.  Realistically, this is a factor which must always be taken into account.  I might be sympathetic to the proposals if they added to the quality of the current services.  However, I am of the view that they would not provide any tangible improvement to these services.  I do not need to remind the House of the severe restriction on resources.  Any increase in resources must be matched by a solid and measurable return for that investment.</P>
        <P>Amendments Nos. 19 and 30 provide for victims to be notified of parole board hearings and allowed to make submissions to the board or the Minister.  It is proposed that any submission made to the board be made available to the offender.  I have a number of concerns about this proposal.  In the first instance, it would place a statutory requirement on a body which has no statutory basis.  The board&rsquo;s principal function is to advise the Minister on the administration of long-term prison services.  The board, by way of recommendation to the Minister, advises on a prisoner&rsquo;s progress to date and on how best to proceed with the future administration of the sentence.  The final decision in this regard lies with me, as Minister.</P>
        <P>The parole board has discretion to exclude the views of the victim from a prisoner&rsquo;s dossier on the grounds of potential negative implications for the safety and security of that victim.  The amendments tabled by the Senator &mdash; apart from still permitting a victim&rsquo;s address to be withheld &mdash; seem to remove this discretion.  The effect might be to expose the victim to associates of an offender in his or her local area and deny confidentiality in respect of the written submission, with all of the consequences that might flow therefrom.  I am sure that, on reflection, the Senator might agree that this might not be a desirable outcome.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 21 might have implications for the procedures operated by the Irish Prison Service.  It would provide for prior notification to be given to victims when an offender was to be detained in hospital.  Advising victims about a prisoner&rsquo;s movements might not in many cases be consistent with good management or security policies.  It would be impossible to safeguard the integrity of the information once it was given to another person.  A prisoner remains under the control of the prison authorities while he or she is incarcerated.  I suggest, therefore, that there is something of an added risk to victims as a result of the fact that the offender <Col N="16" />might be in hospital.  Having balanced the potential security risks against the limited added risk of escape, I do not propose to accept the amendment.</P>
        <P>Amendments Nos. 23 and 31 which relate to providing victims with notice of the deportation of offenders strike me as unnecessary.  The Immigration Act 1999 sets out the procedures relating to the sentencing of foreign nationals, including the possibility of deportation on release.  The Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill 2008, currently before the Oireachtas, is the appropriate instrument in respect of which this matter should be raised.  The Bill, a consolidation measure, is a comprehensive and single statement of the law on immigration.  I do not want to begin unravelling the approach taken in that Bill by making separate provision in one area even before it is enacted.</P>
        <P>Amendments Nos. 24 to 29, inclusive, provide for an elaborate and complex arrangement which would cover the appointment, functions and termination of appointment of representatives of victims who would receive the proposed notifications for which the Senator&rsquo;s earlier amendments provide.  I am uneasy about these proposals which lack safeguards and oversight.  I wish to mention a few obvious areas of concern in this regard.  If adopted, the proposals to which I refer would give a third party specific statutory rights in respect of personal information from both victims and offenders.  We would need to evaluate this from a data protection perspective.  The proposals do not specify any vetting processes to which the nominee should be subjected.  Provision is not even made in respect of a good character condition.  The latter is the least that should be expected of someone whom it is proposed should, on behalf of victims, make submissions on very sensitive matters to parole boards and during deportation processes.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>It is clear that the proposed amendments are grounded in the relevant EU framework decision, particularly Article 4 thereof.  Ireland has implemented the framework decision through several legislative measures and the victims&rsquo; charter.  Article 17 of the framework decision which deals with implementation states, &ldquo;Each Member State shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Framework Decision&rdquo;.  According to the framework decision, it is, therefore, permissible for Ireland to implement it, at least in part, through administrative means.  The European Commission has stated it cannot assess the extent or degree of implementation in the absence of legislation.  It has also made the point that legislation demonstrates the degree of commitment on the part of the national authorities to supporting victims.  These are reasonable points.  However, we have in place a wide range of legislative measures aimed at supporting victims and these work well.  The fact that they are spread over many years and different statutes does not mean they are less effective or important.</P>
        <P>I return to my basic point, namely, that solutions and support need not always require legislation.  We have a strong level of voluntarism and strong family and community networks.  I am happy to build on these pillars and continue to support them in their excellent work.  For the wide variety of reasons to which I refer, I do not propose to accept the amendments.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister&rsquo;s reply is predictable, particularly in the context of our previous discussion on the matter.  There is no question that the victims&rsquo; charter is comprehensive.  If its provisions are implemented in an effective manner, the charter can go a long way towards meeting the needs of victims in being provided with information and involved in the criminal prosecution process.</P>
      
        <P>I welcome the fact the Minister has indicated the victims&rsquo; charter will be reviewed in 2010 because, in many cases, we have a voluntary code and a voluntary system of implementing policy but ultimately, it requires legislation in order that the provisions and policies are effectively implemented.  This may come to that.</P><Col N="17" />
        <P Just="Left">In regard to the European Commission and the point about the commitment to implement the provisions of the framework decision, that is the basis on which the amendments tabled by Fine Gael are premised.  I do not suggest in tabling these amendments, nor does the framework decision suggest, that information is forced on victims.  In all cases, it is premised on the victim wishing to receive and requesting the information, which is the subject matter of the proposed amendments.  This would only arise in the case of serious crime.  I stand by the amendments and believe we need victims&rsquo; rights established in legislation.  These amendments are designed to do that.  That procedure is more in conformity with the requirements of EU legislation than the purely voluntary code the Minister proposes.  A review of that code is welcome and we will see at that stage whether victims of crime are satisfied that it is proving effective.  I stand by the amendments tabled.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Without going over the area again, having been in this office for more than 18 months, I see very clearly why, in the context of the Lisbon treaty, we decided to ask for particular arrangements in the justice and home affairs area, especially in regard to criminal law.  That shows clearly we have a very distinct type of legal system which is very different from that in mainland Europe.  In the framework decision and the discussions on a revised framework decision in this area, which are ongoing, it is quite clear the European Commission takes this into account.</P>
        <P>The most recent discussion on this issue was at the Council of Europe in Brussels in July.  One of its conclusions was to call on the Commission to support by all suitable means member states in their efforts to make sure victims of crime can benefit from decisions taken at EU level and, if appropriate, proceed to put forward the relevant legislative proposal and other measures.  It clearly acknowledged that this can be done by a suite of legislative and administrative measures.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It would be wrong if the impression was to be given from what Senator Regan said that there is nothing on a statutory basis in regard to the protection of victims.  There is and as I said, it is contained in much legislation enacted over a long period of time.  The statutory provisions are in place to protect victims.  I refer to the success of the victims&rsquo; charter, and not only the one issued by my Department.  One should look at the various initiatives taken in other areas.  I compliment the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on fulfilling the victims&rsquo; charter by having its own victims&rsquo; charter and procedure in regard to notification of victims, which is very well set out.  The Garda family liaison officers keep victims&rsquo; families informed of the progress of serious investigations.  The Irish Prison Service also has a number of initiatives in this area, including the Irish Prison Service victims&rsquo; liaison officer.  It is important to note these services are provided on an opt-in basis.</P>
        <P>Some families do not want to be notified and want closure, and I know this from my examination of files in regard to recommendations from the parole board.  Other families want to be notified and, as much as possible, their considerations must be taken into account.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Prison is about rehabilitation and trying to get people who have committed heinous offences to reform.  I hope, when let out having served their sentences, prisoners would be able to go back into society without committing crimes again.  I see from the many files with which I deal that there are people in jail serving very long sentences, deservedly so.  It is also clear from some people&rsquo;s rehabilitation and remorse and regret about the crimes they have committed and from the assistance they have received from their families, that they will not commit crime again because they have learned a very salutary lesson.  It is important some cognisance is taken of this.</P>
        <P>Victims must have as much notification as they require.  The present system is more than satisfactory.  Leaving aside the issue of resources, which is important, what would worry me is <Col N="18" />that if we made it too bureaucratic, everything would have to be ticked off by legal teams parsing and analysing whether everything had been done in accordance with the statute.  To a certain extent, one would leave out the flexibility there, in particular in regard to NGO groups which, despite more difficult economic circumstances, are very well funded by the Commission for the Support of Victims of Crime, which is funded by my Department.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister said my intervention suggested there were no legislative provisions for the victims of crime.  In fact, that is my point.  There are legislative provisions for the victims of crime and what I suggest with these amendments is that we complete the process.  The framework decision, which this country is legally obliged to implement, recognises that victims should have rights in the criminal process.  The Minister is saying that is fine but that we will do it on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis and administratively by way of a voluntary code.  What that really means is that the victims will have rights but they will not be enforceable.  That is the key distinction the Minister is overlooking.</P>
        <P>There are commitments in the victims&rsquo; charter but it is only a charter and has no statutory basis which would ensure there would be recourse to the courts if the rights of victims were not adhered to.  The point the Minister made was that we do not want lawyers in on this and a procedure where the rights of victims would be enforceable.</P>
        <P>There is no doubt the Irish criminal legal system is quite distinct from that of continental Europe.</P>
        <P>It is a distinction which should not be used to suggest that we have a superior criminal law system.  Given the current breakdown in law and order and the increase in crime figures, I do not think our criminal legal system is of the highest standard or should be regarded as immutable by European best practice.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I do not wish to repeat myself but if we were to put this on a statutory basis, we would create more restricted bureaucratic procedures and a basis for challenge by the legal profession.  We would remove the flexibility that exists in the system at present.  There was a time when victims were not notified or given a liaison officer but that has changed dramatically in the past few years, mainly due to initiatives such as the victim&rsquo;s charter.  The existing legislation and substantial administrative arrangements for victims&rsquo; rights are working well, although I would be willing to amend them on occasion.  We are bringing forward the revised victims&rsquo; charter and will ask for the input of victims&rsquo; groups, which are, by and large, happy with the existing statutory and consultative arrangements.</P>

      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 32: </P>
        <P LI="1">In page 11, line 11, to delete &ldquo;Court of Criminal Appeal&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;Supreme Court&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This amendment is self-explanatory.  In my contribution on Second Stage of the Bill I noted that the May 2007 report by the expert group on balance in the criminal law gave rise to many <Col N="19" />of the provisions made in this Bill.  My amendment seeks to give effect to the report&rsquo;s specific recommendation that an application be made to the Supreme Court.  Section 7 deals with exceptions of the rule of double jeopardy in Part 3.  This interpretation section defines &ldquo;Court&rdquo; as the Court of Criminal Appeal.  The aforementioned report advises &ldquo;that a greater rationality needs to be brought to the piecemeal development of the jurisdiction of the Court of Criminal Appeal&rdquo; and recommends that appeals be brought instead to the Supreme Court.</P>
        <P>This amendment is also appropriate in light of the new departure Part 3 makes to criminal law.  Our neighbouring jurisdiction has already introduced statutory exceptions to the rule of double jeopardy but these provisions have been used only sparingly.  Strong safeguards need to be inserted to ensure that persons acquitted following a trial will not be in fear of retrial other than in very rare cases.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Given the recommendations of the 2007 report, it would seem more appropriate that the Director of Public Prosecutions would apply for retrial orders under section 8 to the Supreme Court rather than the Court of Criminal Appeal.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not propose to accept the amendment.  The balance in the criminal law group indicated the court process for setting aside an earlier acquittal and ordering a new trial should be dealt with by the Supreme Court.  However, I am advised by the Attorney General that the constitutionality of so allocating that role is questionable because Article 34.4.1&deg; of the Constitution identifies the Supreme Court as the court of final appeal.  I am also advised that it would be inappropriate to give a new jurisdiction to the Supreme Court where it might be called upon to hear oral evidence.</P>
        <P>Aside from these considerations, section 14 of the Bill has the advantage of allowing an appeal by either side on a point of law to the Supreme Court.  This approach mirrors the process by which an alleged miscarriage of justice against a convicted person may be quashed and a retrial ordered.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Leaving aside the fundamental difficulty with the substance of the amendment, I am advised that it is in any case inadequate from a drafting perspective.  It fails to address the references to the Court of Criminal Appeal in section 11, which inserts a new section into the Criminal Justice (Legal Aid) Act 1962 to provide legal aid for those who are subject to retrial orders under sections 8 or 9 of the Bill.</P>
        <P>In view of the Attorney General&rsquo;s advice on the doubtful constitutionality of giving new jurisdiction to the Supreme Court, I ask Senator Bacik to withdraw the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I should have noted that the Government&rsquo;s long-standing policy has been to abolish the Court of Criminal Appeal.  Legislation introduced in 1995 envisaged the subsumption of the Court of Criminal Appeal into the Supreme Court but it has not yet been commenced.  I do not clearly understand why the Attorney General has taken the view outlined by the Minister.  I will withdraw my amendment in order to reconsider it further but the expert group&rsquo;s recommendations are sensible.  It is well known among practitioners that the Court of Criminal Appeal has developed its jurisdiction in a piecemeal fashion, although that is a bigger issue than the jurisdiction of that court. My amendment is in keeping with long-standing Government policy in this area. </P>

	<P>A recent report by the working group on the court of appeal, chaired by Mrs. Justice Susan Denham, published last August, acknowledged the necessity for a court of civil appeal.  While the report rejected some criticism of the court, particularly in respect of giving <i>ex tempore</i> judgments, it does take the view that a permanent team of judges would lead to a more comprehensive development of the criminal law jurisprudence in the long term.  That <Col N="20" />report is being examined.  There is a commitment in the programme for Government to holding a referendum on this issue.  While the report deals primarily with the court of civil appeal the Court of Criminal Appeal will also be taken into consideration in any examination of that area.  What would be proposed is to give the Supreme Court a new jurisdiction potentially leaving the situation whereby oral evidence would be given.  The Supreme Court is the court of final appeal.</P>

      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I am grateful for the Minister&rsquo;s clarification.  I hope Mrs. Justice Susan Denham&rsquo;s recommendations will be taken on board.  The piecemeal development of the jurisdiction of the Court of Criminal Appeal is the difficulty, largely due to the constantly shifting judges.  I do not mean this as any criticism of the individual judges but different judges have sat making it hard to see a consistent set of principles evolve.</P>
        <P>Now that the Court of Criminal Appeal has a permanent home in court 22 in the new criminal court complex hopefully there will be a new and more fixed team of judges.  I should have earlier extended my compliments beyond the Courts Service to include the Minister and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform on their excellent work on the building.  I might criticise many aspects of public private partnerships, which have not served the State well in some areas such as regeneration projects in Dublin, and in Thornton Hall, but on this project the partnership seems to work well.  This is a great improvement on conditions for criminal trials.  I hope the physical conditions of the Court of Criminal Appeal will be matched by the emergence of a better and more consistent set of principles from the jurisprudence of the court.</P>

This amendment is intended to be more precise about the definition of &ldquo;new and compelling evidence&rdquo; in section 7 where the provision states: &ldquo;which could not, with the exercise of due diligence, have been adduced during those proceedings,&rdquo;.  We want to clarify the type of evidence being described.  Section 8 arises only where the prosecution seeks the order for retrial.

	<P Just="Left">We asked the Parliamentary Counsel to examine this amendment and it said the addition is not necessary.

      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I will not press the amendment at this stage but there is a certain ambiguity in the wording of the section because there could be evidence which was known to the defence during the trial but &ldquo;which could not, with the exercise of due diligence, have been adduced&rdquo; by the prosecution.</P>

        <P LI="1">In page 11, line 26, after &ldquo;concerned&rdquo; to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="1">&ldquo;, for example DNA evidence or an admission by the person concerned&rdquo;.</P><Col N="21" />
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">This seeks to amend the definition of &ldquo;new and compelling evidence&rdquo;.  The phrase used is &ldquo;new and compelling&rdquo; meaning evidence which is reliable, substantial and of a high degree of probity, in other words, it implicates the person with a high degree of probability.  I am not sure that is sufficiently restrictive.  The review group has identified only one conviction under part 10 of the British Criminal Justice Act 2003.  I should have checked to see if there had been any since 2007 when the group reported.  In the case of Dunlop, which was decided in 2006, to which the group refers, an acquittal was reopened where an accused person had made various admissions, more or less confessing his guilt in respect of a murder.</P>
        <P>The review group recommends that any right of appeal or exception to the principle against double jeopardy should be capable of use only in exceptional cases and must be subject to sufficient safeguards.  It refers also to the European Convention and to Articles 2 and 4 of the protocol which state there is a right not to be tried or punished twice and that cases should only be reopened where there is evidence of new or newly discovered facts.</P>
        <P Just="Left">According to the review group&rsquo;s report, which deals with the British provisions and the sort of evidence that arises, &ldquo;safeguards would have to be introduced in the form of: (a) an exacting threshold for the obligation, such as that the evidence is compelling&rdquo;.  The word compelling is used in the phrase &ldquo;new and compelling evidence&rdquo; which is welcome but the group cites the examples of DNA evidence or a confession to the offence.  We propose to insert that here.  It does not restrict new and compelling evidence to those two examples but by giving examples it specifies the sort of exacting threshold required before the Director of Public Prosecutions can make the application for a retrial order.  We want to clarify what sort of new and compelling evidence it is envisaged would be at issue where a section 8 application is made.  It is to ensure that this is an exacting threshold and that it is a new jurisdiction which will be used only sparingly.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">In the UK two convictions after retrial have been obtained and one retrial is still outstanding and has been ordered.  The Senator proposes that two types of evidence, DNA and confession, be inserted as examples of what might constitute new and compelling evidence.  I am aware the balance in the Criminal Law Review Group when recommending that the rule against double jeopardy should be modified to allow acquittals to be re-opened on the basis of new evidence, identified DNA evidence and confession evidence as examples of compelling evidence.  I agree that they may constitute compelling evidence in a particular case.</P>
        <P>Two of the few cases which have been successfully retried in the UK on the basis of its new and compelling evidence procedure were based on admissions by acquitted persons.  I caution, however, against assuming that DNA evidence is always compelling.  It certainly puts a person at the scene of a crime but does not of itself necessarily implicate the acquitted person with a high degree of probability in the offence.  Its significance depends on other evidence in the case.  It may be that the acquitted person admitted to being at the crime scene during the original trial.  In such a case DNA evidence that emerges after the acquittal and puts the person at the scene is very unlikely to constitute compelling new evidence.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As regards confession evidence I understand that an application for retrial in the UK which was based on admissions by the acquitted person was rejected by its court of appeal because it was considered to be unreliable.  Including examples of evidence would be very unhelpful and would have the potential to create the incorrect impression as to the value of particular types of evidence.  The value of any piece of evidence is dependent on surrounding circumstances.  There are many types of evidence.  Discerning whether any new evidence is compelling is properly a matter for the prosecution in the first instance, and the court in the second instance.  That is the approach taken in the Bill.</P><Col N="22" />
        <P Just="Left">The test to be met before the Director of Public Prosecutions may make an application for a retrial order on the basis of fresh evidence is an exacting one, rightly so.  The reopening of an acquittal must be an exceptional occurrence, otherwise our criminal justice system would fall into serious disrepute.  The test requires the Director of Public Prosecutions to form the view that the evidence is new, that it was not adduced in the earlier proceedings and could not, with the exercise of due diligence, have been so adduced.  That is the important qualification to guard against sloppy investigations and prosecutions.  The test also requires the Director of Public Prosecutions to form the view that the new evidence is reliable, substantial and implicates the person with a high degree of probability in the commission of the relevant offence concerned, and the public interest requires the application for a retrial to be made.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The test for the Court of Criminal Appeal goes further by requiring it to consider whether granting the retrial order is in the &ldquo;interests of justice&rdquo;.  The meaning of the &ldquo;interests of justice&rdquo; is amplified in section 10(3).  It requires the court to have regard to such matters as whether any retrial would be conducted fairly, the passage of time since the commission of the offence and the interests of victims.  I am satisfied the definition of new and compelling evidence set out in section 7, together with the additional matters which the Director of Public Prosecutions and the court are required to take into account, are sufficient to ensure this procedure will be used only in exceptional cases.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not envisaged in the section that just because DNA evidence comes forward that it is necessarily new and compelling, because it obviously must implicate the person concerned with a high degree of probability and be compelling apart from that.  I can envisage a situation where DNA evidence which might not emerge during the trial might not offer anything new or compelling to implicate the person concerned.  However, it is hard to see any evidence which fits otherwise within the definition of new and compelling that is not DNA evidence or admission by the person concerned.  There might be others, but those are the two obvious examples that spring to mind.  I will not press the amendment at this stage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">There are two significant conditions built into the Bill.  The Director of Public Prosecutions can only make the application where it appears to him that there is new and compelling evidence and that it is in the public interest to make the application.  There are several significant safeguards in the Bill from the perspective of the acquitted person.  First, the possibility of an acquittal being reopened on the basis of new and compelling evidence is restricted to the most serious offences in the Statute Book.  Second, the provision has prospective effect only.  Third, the test to be met by the Director of Public Prosecutions is very high in order to that the procedure is only used in very clear and exceptional circumstances.  Fourth, the court must have regard to the interests of justice, including whether any retrial could be conducted fairly when making its determination.  Fifth, the acquitted person is on notice of the application and is entitled to legal aid.  Sixth, unlike in other jurisdictions that allow the acquitted person to be remanded in custody or on bail pending the determination of the trial application, the acquitted person will be at liberty and not subject to any restrictions.  Seventh, the possibility of an appeal to the Supreme Court is provided for in section 14.  Eighth, the Director of Public Prosecutions may only make one application for a retrial.  Penultimately, if a person is acquitted a second time, there is no possibility of making a further application for a retrial order.  Finally, there is no possibility of a without prejudice prosecution appeal in the case of a person acquitted following a retrial order.  That is proposed in section 24 of the Bill.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to make one point about this, although it probably comes under section 8.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="23" />
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>We are dealing with section 7.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I can deal with it under this amendment.  The Minister has spoken about the prospective effect of the change in the double jeopardy rule.  I wonder why that is the case.  I would like hear the Minister&rsquo;s clarification on it.  We have a different constitutional position to the UK, but when the double jeopardy rule was limited in that country, it was made retrospective.  It is a common law right as distinct from a constitutional right; therefore, I do not readily see the impediment to making it retrospective.</P>
        <P>The whole purpose of abolishing the rule in the first instance is to restore confidence in the administration of justice and to ensure that it is done.  There are two constitutional provisions which people have in mind when considering whether it could not have retrospective effect.  Article 15.5 of the Constitution forbids the Oireachtas to declare Acts to be infringements of the law when they were not so at the date of their commission.  That does not arise here.  Article 38.1 states that no person shall be tried on any criminal charge, save in due course of law.  I do not see the conflict there if the rule was retrospective.</P>
        <P>The real test for a retrial &mdash; reference to this has been made in the High Court &mdash; is whether there is a risk of an unfair trial.  This should be decided in the sense of balance of competing public interests.  There is an issue of confidence in the administration of justice.  Justice should be seen to be done where there is new and compelling evidence that there should be a retrial.  Why should it not be made retrospective, given that there does not seem to be a constitutional impediment to making it so?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I disagree with Senator Regan.  I am glad to see it is prospective only because there would be constitutional difficulties if it was not so.  I am also glad the Minister has confirmed the safeguards that apply to section 8, even though I know we are straying into section 8.  These safeguards are welcome and my amendments to section 8 are aimed at trying to clarify the safeguards and ensure that they are watertight.</P>
        <P Just="Left">When he listed the safeguards, he said the person who has been acquitted would be at liberty.  We are opposed to section 16 because we are not clear what it means.  The section allows the detention of a person who has been acquitted, but in respect of whom there has not yet been an application under section 8.  That is like a floating detention power, because there is not any purpose specified for the detention.  I may have missed something, but I have discussed this with colleagues and we cannot see the purpose of section 16.  Is it to give the Garda power to investigate and interrogate somebody, or is it simply to enable the Garda to bring an acquitted person before the court for a section 8 application?  It is far too broad in the power of detention it provides.  It may be unconstitutional, given that it relates to somebody who has been acquitted.  It is certainly at odds with what the Minister has just said, namely, that the person in respect of whom the section 8 application has been made will be at liberty.  Reading section 8, it appears such a person would be at liberty but section 16 gives a garda power prior to a section 8 application to seek that the District Court judge would authorise arrest and then detain somebody.  I would like clarification on this from the Minister, although we may leave it until the debate on section 16.  However, it arises in the context of section 8.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I support what has been said by Senator Eugene Regan in regard to the possible application of this provision in retrospective fashion.  I note Senator Bacik&rsquo;s point on the possibility of there being constitutional difficulties in this regard, which is the answer that has previously been given by the Minister.  I will be interested to hear his explanation as to what exactly these constitutional difficulties will be.</P>
        <P>We are speaking about the passage of a law which will provide, in very exceptional circumstances where very solid and substantial evidence is available, for the possibility of a retrial. <Col N="24" /> We are not talking about some sort of <i>carte blanche</i> law which will be used every day, and I trust the possibility of a retrial will be used in an exceptionally sparing fashion.  However, any law has to be about justice.  How can it be just or fair that particular victims against whom crimes were committed before the date this law is enacted will not be able to have those matters reopened in particular and very exceptional cases?  As Senator Regan pointed out, we are not attempting to introduce a situation where a person or persons would be charged with an offence which was not an offence before this law was passed.  We are obviously talking about cases where an offence which was a crime X number of months or years ago remains a crime, not new crimes.</P>
        <P>I would be interested to know exactly what are the constitutional parameters which have caused people to suggest this law cannot apply retrospectively.  Why are we now defining two categories of victims &mdash; those against whom crimes were previously committed and those against whom crimes will be committed next month or in 12 months?  How can the Minister make that differentiation?</P>
        <P>I look forward to the Minister&rsquo;s initial observations.  I ask him to reflect carefully on the argument presented by Senator Regan on this section.  If we are to have confidence not just in this law but in our entire body of law, justice must be seen to be fair and to be applied in a fair fashion, and the same law and arrangements should apply to every citizen.  If this law is introduced in prospective fashion, as Senator Bacik said &mdash; these legal terms are new to me &mdash; we will clearly have two categories of victims, one where, if substantial new evidence is available, the victim or the victim&rsquo;s family can have the satisfaction of having a trial reintroduced, and a second category of victim on whom we shut the door and to whom we say go away.  It is important there would not be such a variation in our law.</P>
        <P>I look forward to the Minster&rsquo;s presentation of the case for his earlier argument on Second Stage on the difficulty of having this law applied retrospectively.  It certainly applies retrospectively in a number of other jurisdictions, although I know different jurisdictions have different legal systems, different bodies of law and different foundations of law.  However, if there was a genuine will in this House or in the country to ensure all victims were treated equally and that there would not be two categories of victims, we would be in a position to find our way around this problem.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>With respect, perhaps we could deal with this issue when dealing with section 8.  I raised it in the context of trying to outline to Members the safeguards for acquitted persons in regard to the possibility of a retrial.  Section 8 deals with the issue of retrospection so perhaps the issue would be best dealt with at that stage and we can also deal with section 16.</P>

      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 35:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 12, subsection (5), line 36, after &ldquo;concerned&rdquo; to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="1">&ldquo;and the person may appear and be heard by the Court&rdquo;.</P><Col N="25" />
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">The amendment is self-explanatory.  It seeks that the person in respect of whom the application is made has the right of appearance before the court.  It is already implicit in subsection (5) that if the Director of Public Prosecutions has to give notice to the person concerned, it is an important safeguard in this provision that clearly it would be very wrong if this could be made <i>ex parte</i> without the person being informed.  If that is the case and if the person has the right to be given notice and the right to legal aid under section 11, he or she should also have a right to be heard.</P>
        <P>The Minister may say it is unnecessary because it is already clear from the terms of the section, as well as the terms of section 11, but I would like the point clarified.  As I said, I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s listing of the safeguards contained in the section, which is very important.  However, given the obligations under the European convention case law and given the recommendations of the review group report, it is required that we would have safeguards here.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is a major departure from our current criminal justice procedures that a person who is acquitted can be subject to a retrial.  It is very important that we ensure these are powers that can only be used sparingly and that we also provide for safeguards against any abuse of the new power in the section.  Otherwise, as the Minister himself has said, the entire criminal justice system will fall into disrepute.  There needs to be certainty in the criminal law for victims and for offenders.  It is very important that there is also certainty for persons who have been tried and acquitted, which has always been a cornerstone of our criminal justice system.  This is a departure from that.  While it is a departure the merit of which in principle is recognised by everyone, it is something that must be done sparingly.  It is a new power for the Director of Public Prosecutions which must be subject to very stringent safeguards and to an exacting threshold for the application.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator anticipated my use of the word &ldquo;unnecessary&rdquo;.  We believe it is inappropriate in criminal proceedings legislation.  The words which the amendment proposes to insert sometimes appear in legislation but dealing only with a civil proceeding.  They would be unusual in the criminal context, the reason being that it is taken for granted, unless the contrary is stated, that a person who is subject to criminal proceedings has a right to appear to be heard.</P>
        <P>I am advised in the case of sections 8 and 9 that it is also taken for granted that an acquitted person, who is a central character in the application for a retrial, has a right to appear and be heard.  He or she is on notice of the application, as stated in subsection (5), and it is also clear from subsection (6) that this right is taken for granted.  Subsection (6) provides that an application may be heard notwithstanding that the acquitted person fails to appear, subject to the proviso that the court is satisfied that in all circumstances it is in the interests of justice to proceed to determine the application in the absence of the acquitted person.</P>
        <P>The Bill also provides for legal aid for the acquitted person.  This is provided in section 11, which amends the Criminal Justice (Legal Aid) Act 1962 to create a new legal certificate which is to be available to an acquitted person who is the subject of an application for retrial order.  If the acquitted person was not entitled to appear and be heard, this legal aid provision would be redundant.  There is no ambiguity in the Bill around an acquitted person&rsquo;s right to appear and be heard in respect of the application for retrial under either section 8 or 9.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I will withdraw the amendment in light of what the Minister has said but I would like clarification on the relationship to section 16, or at least an indication from the Minister that he will address my concern about the section given that he stated that one of the safeguards in section 8 is that the person will be at liberty in respect of this with regard to <Col N="26" />the offence of which they have been acquitted.  There is provision later in the Bill where somebody is detained in respect of other matters.</P>

      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 36:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 12, subsection (6), line 38, after &ldquo;Court&rdquo; to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;if satisfied that the Director has given the person concerned all reasonable notice to facilitate his or her appearance and&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This amendment provides an extra test for the court before it may proceed to hear and determine the application in the absence of the person.  Given what the Minister has said about the right of the person to be heard before the court &mdash; I am glad he clarified that &mdash; it is of extreme concern that an application of this serious nature could be heard in the absence of the person.</P>
        <P>I understand there may be cases where this is necessary.  If the section 8 jurisdiction is to be used only sparingly, the section 8(6) jurisdiction must be used even more sparingly.  It concerns somebody who is acquitted and innocent in law.  That person is not expecting further criminal proceedings and may have moved abroad or left the jurisdiction, as he or she is entitled to having been acquitted.  I accept that the court should have power to hear and determine the application in a person&rsquo;s absence but it is important that the court must be satisfied it is in the interests of justice to do so.  The court must also be satisfied that the Director of Public Prosecutions has given all reasonable notice to the person concerned to enable an appearance before the court.</P>
        <P>There may be a more elegant way of putting the amendment but the director must give the person concerned all reasonable notice to facilitate their appearance.  The Minister may say that is unnecessary as the director will do this anyway but it is important there is a requirement for the court to be satisfied that this is the case, as well as being satisfied that it is in the interests of justice to proceed in the absence of the person.  The person is not accused and &ldquo;acquitted&rdquo; is the more correct term.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Amendment No. 45 is in similar terms and relates to with-prejudice prosecution appeals where many similar concerns arise.  This is the procedure under section 23 where it is proposed that the Director of Public Prosecutions or the Attorney General can appeal a verdict even where somebody has been acquitted on indictment after commencement of the section.  There is a provision in section 23 for the appeal procedure and there is a specific notice requirement in slightly different terms in section 23(2).  The test in subsection (3) allows the appeal to proceed in the absence of the person acquitted.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I have proposed an amendment that the court would have to be satisfied not just that it is in the interests of justice to proceed in the absence of the person concerned but also that the Director of Public Prosecutions has given all reasonable notice to the person concerned to facilitate an appearance.  We may be dealing with somebody who has been acquitted some years previously and subsequently left the jurisdiction.  It may not be possible to locate such people but it is important that the Director of Public Prosecutions would take all reasonable <Col N="27" />steps to do so before any proceeding could take place in their absence.  We are dealing with acquitted persons.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>We believe the amendment is unnecessary.  There is a similar provision in section 9(7) dealing with tainted evidence acquittals, but for some reason the Senator has not proposed an amendment to it.  The person&rsquo;s absence may be due to him or her having absconded and fled the jurisdiction, and such action on the part of the acquitted person should not have the effect of vetoing a hearing of the application or an appeal, if that is the case.</P>
        <P>The acquitted person may have a valid reason for non-appearance and that is why the court may only decide to proceed with the hearing in the absence of the person if it is satisfied in all circumstances to do so in the interests of justice.  I am assured the interests of justice test encompasses consideration of whether the prosecution gave the subject of the application or appeal, as the case may be, reasonable notice to facilitate his or her appearance.  The amendment is unnecessary.</P>
        <P>If somebody had either absconded or left the jurisdiction after an acquittal, the normal extradition rules would apply, especially with the European arrest warrant if somebody was on the continent of Europe.  The Senator has argued it is necessary to have the court satisfied of the director&rsquo;s efforts but in these circumstances the court would always be under an obligation to ensure reasonable notification was given.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I am interested in the Minister&rsquo;s use of language which illustrates why we must be so careful with section 8 to ensure there are sufficient safeguards.  The Minister commented on a person absconding but we are talking about a person who has been acquitted.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Perhaps the person absconded on purpose knowing that an application was to be made.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>The person is not subject to any criminal charge.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>No.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I know &ldquo;abscond&rdquo; is not a legal term but the use of the word implies that the person would leave with the charge hanging over them in some way.  This clearly deals with somebody who has been acquitted.  There is no time limit on section 8 now so when the section commences, somebody could be acquitted and five years down the line the Director of Public Prosecutions might move an application under the section because new evidence only arises at that point.  If that is the case, it may be impossible to track down the person concerned to give notice.</P>
        <P>There may be examples of a person deliberately not appearing because an application has been made but there may also be applications made under section 8(6) where it is not possible to locate the person.  To say that this is because a person has absconded is immediately to suggest the person is guilty.  We must be careful of the issue and that is the reason we have proposed the amendment.  I will withdraw it now but we will press it on Report Stage.</P>
        <P>I will propose an amendment for section 9(7) on Report Stage and I am grateful to the Minister for pointing out that oversight.  Such an amendment should also have been included with the amendment to section 23.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
        <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 8 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P><Col N="28" />
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I have looked at the section very carefully with respect to retrospective action.  People understand that with criminal law generally, the principle of legislating from a retrospective point of view is impossible.  Somebody can only be convicted of a crime on the basis of the legislation in place at a particular time.  That is a general point.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>There is an issue in this legislation regarding the reopening of acquittals on the basis of new and compelling evidence and an acquittal being tainted.  There is a fundamental principle in this relating to the separation of powers.  We cannot pass legislation in the Oireachtas overturning or changing any decisions made in court.  This legislation is different from that.  The call for retrospection would, in effect, be a direct intervention against previous judgments made by courts.  This allows the courts to be involved.  At every hurdle in the legislation there is judicial involvement.  In other words, the courts must be involved in determining whether an acquittal is to be reconsidered.  It is not the Oireachtas that will be making the decision; that is the difference.  I have given consideration to this issue.  I met at least one family and indicated we had considered the issue of acquittal intensely with the Office of the Attorney General.  The advice of the Attorney General is that an attempt to retrospectively allow the reopening of acquittals would involve a breach of the principle of a separation of powers.  It is well established that the Oireachtas cannot alter or reverse a finding of the courts.  Under existing law, the effect of a judgment of acquittal is that the person acquitted cannot be reprosecuted in any circumstances.  Were the proposed law to alter that position by operating retrospectively, the effect of judicial determination would be altered.</P>
        <P>Apart from this fundamental objection, there is a strong argument that to retrospectively change the status of an acquittal and provide for the possibility of interference with the verdict of the court, where there was not that possibility at the time of the person&rsquo;s trial, would infringe the person&rsquo;s right under Article 38.1 of the Constitution not to be tried on any criminal charge, save in accordance with law.  I am conscious that these constitutional requirements are cold comfort to the victims of crime and their families.  I am also conscious of the potential added benefits that retrospection, if it were to apply, would bring.  It would most likely allow the provisions to be used much earlier and us an opportunity to take advantage of the great developments in forensic science, particularly DNA profiling, in the past 20 years.</P>
        <P>I am aware that other jurisdictions, including the United Kingdom, have applied their equivalent provisions retrospectively.  However, both I, as Minister, and the Oireachtas must operate within the constitutional framework we have in the State, namely, that the retrospective approach adopted in the Bill reflects the particular duty we have.  I am aware, too, that a number of countries, among them southern Australia, have only allowed for prospective effect.  The same applies to the Bill currently before the New Zealand Parliament.  The United Kingdom does not have the type of constitution we have; therefore, we must judge the retrospective effect under the constitutional framework under which we operate.  I am advised that, in the case of the United Kingdom, its provisions have not yet been subject to legal challenge.  Also, there has been substantial comment from outside commentators on its legislation.  They have expressed a strong view that the UK legislation, as proposed and in place, does not comply satisfactorily with the requirements of the European Court of Human Rights.</P>
        <P>I have sympathy for victims in the circumstances in which they find themselves, but having looked at the matter very closely I must, for all of the reasons mentioned, be guided &mdash; as must the Government and the Oireachtas &mdash; by the strong legal advice available, not just to me but also to the Attorney General.  I cannot just reject his advice.  We must accept it because he is the law officer of the land.  I would be in dereliction of my duty as Minister, as would the Government, if we were to ignore the advice of the Attorney General in this respect.</P><Col N="29" />
        <P>I am not making a political point, but if the Senators who suggest this legislation can be made retrospective received the proper legal advice from constitutional lawyers, it would clearly state this is not possible.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his explanation, but I am not entirely convinced.  One could argue that the principle of double jeopardy which I classify as a common law right has been used and referred to in various judgments of the courts and has, at times, been invoked as a constitutional right.  In this legislation we are interfering with that principle.  Therefore, retrospection would not create new criminal offences or interfere with the notion of a fair trial.  I have not brought forward an amendment on this issue and do not, therefore, propose to prolong the debate.  However, I reserve my position on the issue before Report Stage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I have spoken on section 8.  I welcome the safeguards and the fact the section will only operate prospectively.  My amendments were designed to ensure the safeguards were watertight for the person acquitted in respect of section 8 applications and I intend to press the second amendment on Report Stage.  I ask the Minister for clarification of the relationship between sections 8, 9, 16 and 23 which clearly provide for a power of detention, or so it seems, in advance of these applications being made to the courts.  It is a retrospective power of detention of an acquitted person.  The Minister may prefer to leave this issue aside until we deal with section 16.  I have given notice that I oppose that section.  I am happy if that is how the Minister wants to deal with the matter.  Given that it was he who raised the issue of a person being at liberty during the section 8 application process, I thought I should raise it here.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I listened with interest to the Minister&rsquo;s comprehensive reply and noted that he dwelt on the phrase &ldquo;the constitutional framework&rdquo; which underpins our body of law.  Reference was made to Article 15.5 of the Constitution which reads, &ldquo;The Oireachtas shall not declare acts to be infringements of the law which were not so at the date of their commission&rdquo;.  Our request that this legislation apply retrospectively would not breach Article 15.5 because we are not asking for something to be declared an infringement that was not previously an infringement.  </P>
        <P>The Minister also referred to Article 38.1 which reads, &ldquo;No person shall be tried on any criminal charge save in due course of law&rdquo;.  While I am not a constitutional expert, I suggest a move to have this law applied retrospectively would not breach Article 38.1.  Will the Minister outline clearly the section or statement in the Constitution that prohibits him from making this legislation retrospective?  I respect what he said about the advice presented to him by the Attorney General.  However, will he confirm whether there is a constitutional bar in making this legislation retrospective?  If retrospection is constitutionally barred, what section of the Constitution deems it repugnant?  Is the Minister just working on the basis of advice given by the Attorney General which is a compilation of his views and legal traditions, etc?  My contention is there is no constitutional provision which would disallow or debar us from making section 8 retrospective.  We can, obviously, have different political views as to whether there should be retrospection.  However, in order to determine the issue, will the Minister tell us whether it is constitutionally repugnant?  If it is, there is obviously a section in the Constitution which deems it so.  Will the Minister advise me on whether there is such a section?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not have a copy of the Constitution to hand but a separation of powers between the courts, the Executive and the Oireachtas is clearly indicated in the Constitution.  By making criminal laws retrospective, in effect this is an interference in the power of the courts to hand down judgments.  This is an infringement of the Constitution and also a <Col N="30" />possible infringement of a person&rsquo;s constitutional right under Article 38.1: &ldquo;No person shall be tried on any criminal charge save in due course of law&rdquo;.  This means the law at the time when he or she was charged.  This is a double-whammy, so to speak.</P>
        <P>The Senator may argue that we are changing decisions by means of this legislation but this is not the case.  We are giving the courts the opportunity to revisit in exceptional circumstances but it is entirely a matter for the courts and is not any action or omission on the part of the Oireachtas that is changing a judgment previously handed down.  This is something the Oireachtas cannot do because of the separation of powers under the Constitution.  This Bill proposes giving the ability to the courts to revisit their own decisions.  The Senator is proposing that the Oireachtas allow a situation where previous decisions can be overturned and this is not possible.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>It might be helpful if the Attorney General&rsquo;s advice were made available to us and the Minister may be in a position to present us with same in the near future.  I am a million miles from being in any way expert in this matter but the kernel of my argument is that we are not attempting to create new law in the sense of new offences.  We are not suggesting that some event or some intervention which previously was not an offence should now become an offence.  In my view we are not interfering with Article 15.5.  We are speaking about cases where an offence which is now against the law was previously also against the law.  I do not fully comprehend the Minister&rsquo;s argument as to how we are breaching our constitutional framework.  The Minister speaks of the separation of powers.  It would be up to the courts to use this section.  The Oireachtas is not issuing an instruction to use this section.  However, from a layman&rsquo;s perspective, by means of this Bill the Oireachtas is willing to give powers in an extremely limited number of cases for the courts to consider whether on the basis of new evidence, for example, a case should be retried.  Our argument is whether this is possible retrospectively.  I appreciate the Minister&rsquo;s comments about those people who believe that justice may not have been done but while this application will only apply prospectively rather than retrospectively, we are now very clearly defining two categories of victims and this is very regrettable.</P>
        <P>I would be interested in hearing the Attorney General&rsquo;s opinion.  I ask the Minister to reflect on this request during the latter stages and when the Bill goes to the other House.  It is not up to other jurisdictions or parliaments to set the body of law for this country but at least we have seen indications from afar that it is possible to consider retrospective application.  The Minister&rsquo;s mind appears to be closed on the matter but I hope he would be willing to examine the situation again and try to bring some degree of redress to people who believe they are becoming very second class citizens and second class victims as a result of the way this new proposed law is to be written.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Having clarity on this issue would obviate the need for protracted discussion on Report Stage.  However, I fail to understand the Minister&rsquo;s argument.  We are aware of the constitutional principle of the separation of powers and it is respected in this House or is endeavoured to respect it.  The suggestion is that to abolish retrospectively the double jeopardy principle is to interfere with judgments of the courts.  The fact is that interference and the abolition of the double jeopardy principle does just that in any event because it gives power to the Director of Public Prosecutions to bring a new trial to a new case against the person who has been acquitted where there is compelling evidence.  Every appeal of the Director of Public Prosecutions invites the courts to change their views on a judgment.  The Minister suggests it is an invitation to the courts to revisit their own judgments but that is in fact what would apply whether it is prospective or retrospective.  The broad principle and notion <Col N="31" />of the separation of powers gets us nowhere with regard to this matter and is not pertinent as to whether the abolition of double jeopardy is prospective or retrospective.</P>

	<P>I suggest to the Senators that they perhaps take their own distinct legal advice although I accept that Senator Regan has a legal training.  There is clear case law to support the issue.  The Senators are asking for the Oireachtas by legislation to possibly overturn previous decisions made before the passing of this Act.  I can put it no better than Mr. Justice Lynch in his 1994 judgment in Howard and Others <i>v.</i> Commissioners for Public Works and Others when he stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">The Oireachtas cannot alter or reverse that finding or the declaration and injunction made on foot of same.  To attempt to do so would countervene the constitutional separation of powers in that the Oireachtas would be trespassing on and into the judicial domain.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I refer to significant other case law, Buckley <i>v. </i>Attorney General in 1950, and the judgment of Mr Justice Keane that: &ldquo;While there would clearly be no constitutional objection to the Oireachtas altering the general law, setting aside a specific adjudication by a competent court was another matter entirely.&rdquo;  All the advice I have received is to the effect that because of the clear fundamental confirmation in the Constitution of the separation of powers, to make any criminal law retrospective would be contravening that principle of separation of powers within the Constitution.</P>

      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 37:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 18, subsection (1), lines 8 to 11, to delete all words from and including &ldquo;if&rdquo; in line 8 down to and including &ldquo;Court&rdquo; in line 11.</P><Col N="32" />
        <P FLI="0">The amendment proposes to delete the condition for appealing from the Court of Criminal Appeal to the Supreme Court because the appeal conditions are discriminatory against the acquitted person, providing no right of appeal unless the court, the Attorney General or the Director of Public Prosecutions certifies that there are points of law of exceptional public importance.  It may be like existing general law in respect of appeals from the Court of Criminal Appeal but it is discriminatory against the acquitted person.  There is no reason he or she should not have the right to appeal if the Attorney General or the Director of Public Prosecutions may do so.  It is unnecessary to insert this additional proviso.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator is seeking to remove the criterion for an appeal to the Supreme Court by either party for an application for a retrial order.  The criterion is long established, namely, that the court, the Attorney General or the Director of Public Prosecutions must certify that the determination involves a point of law of exceptional public importance and that it is in the public interest that an appeal should be taken to the Supreme Court.  This is the criterion laid down in the Courts of Justice Act 1924 governing an appeal from the Court of Criminal Appeal to the Supreme Court.  Similar filter mechanisms to that proposed in the section are to be found in other statutory codes in this and other jurisdictions, including section 29 of the 1924 Act.  I am satisfied the criterion is appropriate in this case.  The Attorney General has advised that there is no constitutional obligation to have a full appeal available regarding a determination on an application for a retrial order.  If the case proceeds to a retrial and a conviction is handed down, there will be facilities for appealing the later conviction.</P>
        <P>I acknowledge the section, similar to section 29 of the 1924 Act, provides for an inequality of position in that the Director of Public Prosecutions is a party who can certify the appeal, while the defendant must obtain a certificate from someone else but that inequality arises from the different roles of the Director of Public Prosecutions and it is not unconstitutional discrimination or an inequality of arms.  In addition to the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Attorney General may certify the appeal.  It is presumed that these officers, one of whom is a constitutional officer, will exercise that discretion appropriately.  The Court of Criminal Appeal may also certify the appeal.  The court is not a party and has no interest of its own to promote or protect.  It is exercising a judicial function, with all the attendant constraints and duties.  The evidence of practice establishes that the court has frequently granted certificates, even where it has held against the accused in regard to issues the subject of the appeal.  I am satisfied, therefore, with the scope of the appeal avenue in this section and do not propose to accept the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I acknowledge the existing provisions are discriminatory but this is a new provision relating to appeals specifically against a decision by the Court of Criminal Appeal under section 10, that is, where the court grants a retrial order quashing a person&rsquo;s acquittal under section 8 or section 9.  We are, therefore, dealing with a new area of law because until now there was no provision for the court to quash an acquittal on this basis.  A section 10 decision is definitively against the acquitted person because it is an order for a retrial.  It is highly unlikely, therefore, that the Director of Public Prosecutions would seek to appeal it, yet this section provides that the appeal can be taken by either the acquitted person or the Director of Public Prosecutions but it may only take place where the Director of Public Prosecutions, the party in respect of whom the decision is of necessity made under section 10 in his or her favour, is one of the parties, yet he or she has the power to certify that an appeal shall lie to the Supreme Court when it is clear from the earlier sections that the appeal will only be taken by the acquitted person.</P><Col N="33" />
        <P>The Minister has said the Attorney General or the court may also certify and, in practice, in the relatively rare cases where it has arisen, the Supreme Court grants a certificate.  This may even become similar to the current farcical procedure, whereby the Court of Criminal Appeal must consider the question of whether there is leave to appeal before considering the appeal where there is an appeal against conviction or sentence.  The expert group pointed to the pointless nature of that process and stated it should be reviewed.  Other groups have also recommended a similar review.  If the Minister inserts another mechanism that will become something similar, why is he bothering with that formula?  Why not state a person may appeal to the Supreme Court?</P>
        <P>One of the Minister&rsquo;s justifications in opposing my amendment to section 7 was that if he substituted the Supreme Court for the Court of Criminal Appeal, there would be no appeal beyond that where the Supreme Court granted a retrial order under section 10.  That is a valid point but if I accept it, clearly an appeal should lie to the Supreme Court by the acquitted person where a section 10 order for a retrial has been made.  It is not necessary to insert the certification procedure in this section, particularly when it is so lopsided, given that an appeal is also capable of being made by the Director of Public Prosecutions, yet the Director of Public Prosecutions may certify that the appeal be taken.</P>
        <P>I propose the insertion of the words &ldquo;shall lie&rdquo;.  Perhaps a neutral test could be inserted in the interests of justice or on a point of law.  I could not have a difficulty with that but deleting the reference to the Attorney General or the Director of Public Prosecutions and having only the court certify the appeal might be a useful amendment.  The Minister has acknowledged the inequality in the current provisions for the appeals mechanism in section 29 of the 1924 Act but we are dealing with a different mechanism.  This is not about a clear-cut criminal appeal against conviction or sentence where the Court of Criminal Appeal has upheld a conviction and a point of law arises.  The section deals with an acquitted person, against whom a retrial order has been made but where the retrial has not taken place.  They are still acquitted, they are still innocent and this is a new procedure where the Court of Criminal Appeal gives the retrial order under section 10.  There should therefore be an appeal from that.  Perhaps this should be on a point of law or perhaps it should be a point of law of exceptional public importance but the Attorney General or the Director of Public Prosecutions should not have power to certify this.  It seems an unnecessary filtering or blocking mechanism in respect of someone who was acquitted.  Just because there is inequality in the law does not mean we should reproduce it here.  This is especially true when we speak of acquitted persons.  I intend to press this amendment on Report Stage if not now.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>I think Senator Bacik is correct.  The phraseology is contradictory.  The Minister referred to the separation of powers yet in the same sentence we have the courts, the Attorney General and the Director of Public Prosecutions certifying matters.  The solution is that if we want to limit appeals to matters of exceptional public importance or if it is desirable in the public interest that such an appeal should be taken, the court should decide on the basis of the submissions of the parties before the court.  A wording along these lines would be more appropriate than the either or situation in respect of the acquitted person.</P></Speaker>

	<P Just="Left">I will press an amendment on this matter on Report Stage.  I am grateful to Senator Regan for his words of support.  The debate was adjourned on this amendment as the Senator was indicating the reasons he agreed with me on it.  I hope the Minister will consider changing the wording of the section in the way I propose in the amendment but, if not, that he delete the words &ldquo;the Attorney General or the Director&rdquo;.  I would not have a problem with the court certifying that the determination involves a point of law.

	<P>When I was speaking to the amendment, the Cathaoirleach intervened to advise that the sitting was to be suspended.  I had indicated that the Minister had referred to the separation of powers and I suggested the court, the Attorney General and the Director of Public Prosecutions were in the same frame in this section.  It should be a matter for the court to decide.  If we are directing that an appeal would only lie to the court on a point of law of exceptional public importance, or is desirable in the public interest, that is something only the court should determine.  Needless to say, it would be determining it on foot of submissions from the applicant, the Attorney General or the Director of Public Prosecutions, as the case may be.  Senator Bacik has raised an important issue.  This provision merits revision.  That is the point at which we adjourned the debate before lunch.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I apologise; the Minister did respond.  There was then another round of discussion.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a time-honoured filtering mechanism, whereby matters are only referred to the Supreme Court on a point of law of exceptional public importance and where it would be in the public interest that an appeal be taken to it.  That filtering mechanism has worked well since 1924.  I accept what Senators Bacik and Regan have said about this being a new move in that it will abolish the rule against double jeopardy but, equally, I do not believe we should remove the time-honoured filtering mechanism to ensure only matters involving a point of law of major public importance are referred to the Supreme Court.  As we have seen and as I have often said, 60% of all judicial reviews concern immigration, of which quite a substantial number end up in the Supreme Court.  I am not saying this is wrong but they get through the filtering mechanism.  When I started to practise law in the mid-1970s, a judicial review was the exception rather than the rule, but now it is the rule.  That is one of the reasons we have a very skewed systems of matters being referred to the Supreme Court; hence the request by the Judiciary for the establishment of a court of civil appeal to make sure only cases involving a substantial point of law would be referred to the Supreme Court.  That is the reason I would be reluctant to look at this issue again.  A person going forward for retrial has the normal appeal mechanisms open to him or her, if he or she were found guilty in the retrial.  </P>
        <P>I will consider the matter again before Report Stage.  We again asked the Office of the Attorney General about this and it did not see any reason the long-standing filtering mechanism in this respect should be changed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not want to labour the point but my position changed slightly as I was replying to the Minister&rsquo;s first response to the amendment.  I indicated that I would change the wording of the amendment and will do so before Report Stage.  Rather than deleting all of the words from and including &ldquo;if&rdquo;, I will propose the deletion of the words &ldquo;the Attorney General or the Director&rdquo;.  I accept what the Minister said about the need for a filtering mechanism to ensure only cases involving a point of law of exceptional public importance are referred to the Supreme Court.  My difficulty is with the lopsided nature of the certifying mechanism, whereby one of the parties, the Director of Public Prosecutions, has the power to certify and the other party, the acquitted person, does not.  Given that section 10 decisions are always in favour of the Director of Public Prosecutions, because of the retrial order being made, it is pointless to suggest he might want to appeal.  The appeal will be made by the acquitted person; it is wrong, therefore, that only the Director of Public Prosecutions should have power to certify.  It should be the court alone which has that power.  </P>
        <P>The long-standing filtering mechanism, to which the Minster referred, applies to somebody who has been convicted.  This relates to a new procedure where a person has been acquitted and a retrial order is made but the retrial has not yet taken place.  He or she has to wait for the completion of a second trial and a conviction before being entitled to appeal.  Given that there has already been one trial, in which the person concerned has been acquitted, it would be fair to have a more neutral appeals mechanism to the Supreme Court.  I accept the existence of a filter but I do not accept a lopsided or unequal filter and I am grateful for the Minister&rsquo;s intention to consider the matter.  I call on him not only to consider my original amendment but also to consider the more limited amendment I have proposed, that is, to delete the reference to the Attorney General as a director.  I do not understand why he should have the power to certify in this particular instance.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is the issue.  It is appropriate that the screening to which the Minister refers should be used only in these cases.  It is a matter for the court to decide and it <Col N="36" />would be better if the court decided on foot of submissions made rather than the phraseology used in the legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Bacik remarked that she changed her view as she spoke.  Equally, I acknowledged to my officials that we would consider restricting it to the court.  The amendment is better than the proposal made earlier.  We will consider the matter and revert to the Attorney General&rsquo;s office in respect of the more recent proposal.</P>

        <P>Section 14 agreed to.</P>
        <P>Section 15 agreed to.</P>
        <P Just="Center">SECTION 16.</P>
        <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 16 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I spoke about this section while discussing section 8.  I was pleased to hear the Minister&rsquo;s remarks on a person in respect of whom an application for a retrial order is being made under section 8.  Presumably, this applies also to a person in respect of whom a section 9 application is being made.  It is my understanding and that of the Minister that such a person would be at liberty.  This is why I was surprised on Second Stage to find in section 16 a rather open-ended arrest and detention power in respect of a person whose only qualification is that he or she has been acquitted.</P>
        <P>This is not about a person in respect of whom a retrial order has been made under sections 8 or 9 or a with prejudice appeal order.  It is simply a person who has been acquitted.  Under section 16(2) a Garda superintendent or higher ranking officer may approach a District Court judge and inform him or her that he or she has certain knowledge and that something has come to his or her attention since the person was acquitted which is likely to reveal the existence of new and compelling evidence and, therefore, seek an arrest.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This flies in the face of established common law and constitutional protections of innocent persons.  No application has been made to the Court of Criminal Appeal at that stage in the process.  It seems there is no requirement for the Director of Public Prosecutions to have formed a view that an acquittal has been tainted or that new and there is compelling evidence.  The superintendent alone may seek this arrest warrant or authorisation and the District Court judge may then arrest the person.  Once such a person is arrested under <i>subsection (3)</i>, he or she will be taken forthwith to a Garda station and detained there for a period as authorised under section 4 of the Act of 1984 and, subject to the section, shall be dealt with as though he or she had been detained under that section.  This is very murky because the section 4 detention procedure has been litigated extensively and custody regulations are used with the procedure and so on.</P>
        <P>Generally, the section 4 procedure is used to detain a person the Garda seeks to interview.  Interviews may be conducted according to certain rules, but it seems extraordinary that section 16 confers power on a garda to seek the arrest and detention of someone who has been acquitted and that such a person may then be questioned.  I am unclear as to the purpose of the measure.  Is it to bring such people before the courts for a section 8 or section 9 application? <Col N="37" /> Is it to gather the new and compelling evidence?  This would be very wrong.  There is a lack of clarity because a garda may have knowledge of something that might confirm the existence of new and compelling evidence.  Is the garda then entitled to go on a fishing exercise and detain someone to get information through interview and interrogation with a view to building a section 8 case against such a person?  I am unclear about this matter.  I oppose the section because the lack of clarity raises constitutional difficulties about the detention of someone under the section.</P>
        <P>I refer to the ending of the detention.  The legislation states detention may be ended if there are no longer reasonable grounds for suspecting a person has committed the offence in respect of which they were arrested.  However, such a person would not have been arrested in respect of committing an offence but for the fact that a Garda superintendent informed a District Court judge that he or she had knowledge of new and potentially compelling evidence.  The person has already been acquitted in respect of the original offence.  Section 16(5)(<i>a</i>)(ii) suggests detention may be ended where there are no longer reasonable grounds for believing detention is necessary for the proper investigation of the relevant offence.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It seems detention is for the purpose of investigation but there must have been an investigation prior to that point for an application to be made in the first place because a garda must have some knowledge of the existence of new and compelling evidence.  I am puzzled by the section.  It may be the case that it is intended to be as wide as I have suggested.  How else is such a detention to be terminated?  A person may be held for up to 24 hours under the 1984 Act, as amended, but normally there is a requirement that such a person is charged.  If someone is held under a section 4 detention, he or she is released when grounds no longer exist for detention or he or she is released and then charged.  However, in this case there is no indication of what happens next.  The legislation states &ldquo;the detention shall be terminated forthwith&rdquo;.  If nothing else happens under section 16(5) once the section 4 period expires, which is 24 hours at present, the detention is terminated and a person should be released.  What happens next?  One presumes the Garda furnishes the Director of Public Prosecutions with any new information and the Director of Public Prosecutions makes an application to the Court of Criminal Appeal under section 8.</P>
        <P Just="Left">However, it strikes me that section 16 rides roughshod over the safeguards in section 8 if a person may be arrested and detained to gather evidence or to show there is new and compelling evidence against him or her for a section 8 application.  What is to prevent the Garda seeking this procedure for every acquitted person or to test whether such a person would make a confession having been acquitted?  The Garda could arrest, detain, determine if it can extract a confession and then it would have a second bite at the cherry.  I am not impugning the Garda or suggesting the Garda would behave in this way at random.  However, as legislators we must ensure there are safeguards against abuse by ill-intentioned individuals and I see no such safeguards here.  Section 16 as currently drafted is too broad.  Unless I have missed something I see no reason for this requirement or for such very extensive powers of arrest and detention of a person previously acquitted and in respect of whom there has been no section 8 or section 9 procedure at that stage.</P>
        <P>It is also interesting to read the section in conjunction with section 15 which outlines the safeguards and the proviso that powers may be used only in accordance with this Bill.  It lists what the Garda is not permitted to do without the consent of a person, where such a person has participated in a relevant offence in respect of which he or she has been acquitted.  Quite properly, the section lists the requirement for such procedures as arrest, detention, interview and so on.  However, section 16 undermines all that with the provision that such a person may be arrested as if under section 4, but without the usual stipulations of a section 4 detention, such as when a detention comes to an end a person must be charged or released.  There is no <Col N="38" />provision here that such a person would be charged at that stage.  He or she is simply released but the case may have been built against him or her during a detention and he or she may be subject to a section 8 or section 9 application then.  Will the Minister clarify the purpose of the section and how he intends to ensure safeguards against abuse?</P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>If one were to extend the logic of Senator Bacik&rsquo;s argument regarding the arrest of people under this section, no one could be arrested prior to being charged, leaving aside the procedure for a retrial under this legislation.  Obviously, the Garda is entitled to arrest someone in accordance with the law to question him or her, or else it would not have the ability to solve crime.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Bacik, when referring to section 15, answered her own question on the rationale behind section 16.  As she stated, the section contains safeguards in respect of what can be done.  It must also be pointed out that following the arrest of a person, it will be necessary for a superintendent to apply for a judicial <i>imprimatur</i>.  There cannot be a subsequent charge unless the court so directs.  This is not something that might be used willy-nilly and in every circumstance in order to allow the Garda to have another bite at the cherry.</P>
        <P>Section 16 is central to the procedure governing the reopening of acquittals on the basis of new and compelling evidence.  It allows for the arrest of a person where his or her detention is necessary for the investigation of information that points to the existence of new and compelling evidence.  It is important to note that the arrest follows judicial authorisation.  The maximum period for which a person may be detained is 24 hours, the maximum permitted under section 4 of the Criminal Justice Act 1984.</P>
        <P>In combination with section 15, section 16 represents a safeguard for acquitted persons.  Without the prohibition in section 15, an acquitted person would be subject to Garda arrest and detention in the normal way for the offence in respect of which he or she has been acquitted.  Once the law provides for the retrial of acquitted persons in certain circumstances, it follows that, unless some special provision is made in law, such persons would be subject to normal Garda powers as part of a proper investigation of new evidence.  The offences to which the new and compelling evidence procedure applies are all arrestable offences.  This means that any such person, on the basis of reasonable suspicion, would be liable to be arrested and detained without the need for a judge-assisted warrant.</P>
        <P>In recognition of the status of the acquitted person and the need to remove any potential for harassment of that person, section 15 prohibits the exercise of a range of standard Garda investigation powers, including those of arrest, detention, fingerprinting, the taking of forensic samples etc., except in accordance with the special provisions in section 16 to 18, inclusive.</P>
        <P>Section 17 makes similar provision in respect of the arrest of an acquitted person who is in prison or a child detention school with regard to his or her suspected involvement in an offence for which he or she has been acquitted.  The section also makes special provision for search warrants.</P>
        <P>As stated, section 16 provides for judicial authorisation of an arrest.  Before issuing an arrest warrant, a judge must be satisfied that the senior member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na seeking it is in possession of information on the relevant offence in respect of which a person was acquitted which has come to the attention of the Garda since that person&rsquo;s acquittal and which is likely to reveal or confirm the existence of new or compelling evidence in connection with his or her suspected participation in the offence for which his or her arrest is being sought.  This test requires the judge to have regard to the exacting threshold which must be met in order to ground an application for a retrial on the basis of new and compelling evidence.</P><Col N="39" />
        <P>Senators may be interested to note that other jurisdictions that have modified the rule against double jeopardy in order to provide for retrials where new evidence emerges post-trial all allow the exercise of police powers in respect of the acquitted person subject to special safeguards.  In general, such safeguards come in the form of prior approval from the prosecution services.  Having regard to the independence of the Director of Public Prosecutions in the State, I do not wish to go down that road.  I have instead opted for judicial oversight which provides a strong safeguard to protect the acquitted person from potential harassment.</P>
        <P>Apart from the fact that, in combination with section 15, it provides a safeguard for acquitted persons, section 16 is also critical from an operational perspective.  It goes without saying that before the Director of Public Prosecutions initiates, under section 8, an application to have an acquittal quashed and a person retried, the new and compelling evidence on which that application is based must have been properly verified by the Garda in order to ensure its reliability and substance.  To ensure such verification, the Garda must have the possibility of using standard investigative powers to question the person, take his or her fingerprints, gather forensic samples, etc.  These powers all arise in the context of Garda detention.  It might not be necessary for the Garda to seek the arrest of and detain a person in every case.  However, the power to do so must be available as an option.</P>
        <P>The purpose of the arrest under this section relates to the investigation of possible new and compelling evidence.  It will arise before a decision is taken by the Director of Public Prosecutions to initiate an application for a retrial order.  In no way does section 16 allow the acquitted person to be detained in custody pending the determination of the application for a retrial order.  As stated, while other jurisdictions permit an acquitted person to be remanded in custody or placed on bail pending the determination of the application for a retrial, I have decided not to go down that route.</P>
        <P>Having regard to an acquitted person&rsquo;s entitlement to the presumption of innocence, he or she will be at liberty, without the possibility of restrictions being imposed, pending the determination by the Court of Criminal Appeal of the retrial order.  I am aware that this gives rise to the risk of an acquitted person absconding but I am advised that this is unavoidable.  In order to address that fact, section 8(6) provides that if an acquitted person fails to appear, the court may, subject to the requirements of the interests of justice, allow the hearing to proceed in his or her absence.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that section 16 strikes the appropriate balance between the rights of the acquitted person and the needs of the investigation into the existence of new and compelling evidence.  In such circumstances, I urge Senators to support it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for clarifying that the person will be at liberty pending the hearing of an application under section 8.  I understood him to state that prior to section 16 being brought into operation, the Director of Public Prosecutions must have already formed a view on the existence of new and compelling evidence.  However, that is not clear from the wording of the section.</P>
        <P>I do not accept the Minister&rsquo;s contention that I am making a much more general point regarding arrests and so forth, far from it.  I am stating this is an exception to the normal procedures under which garda&iacute; form reasonable suspicions, arrest people, etc.  That will already have been done in this instance in respect of persons who have been tried and acquitted.  We are, therefore, dealing with a very different situation in respect of people who previously were not capable of being rearrested.</P>
        <P>It is clear from what the Minister said that a section 16 application would be made prior to those made under either section 8 or 9.  I reiterate my contention that this matter is too broadly <Col N="40" />defined in section 16, particularly in the light of the fact that there is a difficulty in the context of an investigation being carried out by the Garda and the omission of a reference to the Director of Public Prosecutions having already formed a view.  There is no provision to the effect that the Director of Public Prosecutions should, prior to a senior member of the Garda making an application to the District Court, have formed a view or that a section 8 application is contemplated.  Perhaps it might be useful to table an amendment in this regard and I reserve the right to introduce such an amendment on Report Stage.</P>
        <P>I could not frame an amendment to section 16 for discussion on Committee Stage because I was not able to identify the stage at which the application should be made.  Now that the Minister has clarified the position, I believe I see a way in which the section might be amended in order to make it somewhat more specific.  I will, therefore, reserve my position on the matter until Report Stage.</P>
        <P>It is clear that, under section 16(9), there is also a power of arrest in instances where retrial orders are made under section 10.  When I first read the Bill, I was not sure whether it was envisaged that this would also apply following the making of a retrial order under section 10.  However, section 10(1) includes a power for the court to make conditions or give directions.  In such circumstances, the court can provide a warrant for arrest.  Section 16 is, therefore, only relevant where somebody has been acquitted and where a retrial order has not been sought or granted.  Owing to the fact that the Minister has confirmed this fact, it is all the more important that we ensure there are stringent safeguards in place in respect of the detention period, what is permissible and the necessary mechanisms which must be triggered before a person can be detained by a judge of the District Court under this section.</P>

	<P>My previous remarks may perhaps have clarified the purpose of the section which the Senator proposes to oppose.  If we were to agree to delete it, we would be faced with a ludicrous situation where the Garda would not be able to put new and compelling evidence discovered by its members to the acquitted person against whom, subject to judicial authorisation, it might wish to bring a charge.  That would be complete nonsense because garda&iacute; would have to be able to confront and question a potential defendant in regard to this new and compelling evidence.  </P>
        <P>The Senator is entitled to table an amendment on Report Stage and we will deal with it but this is the right way to go.  As I said, we did not go down the route of other jurisdictions which have changed the rule in this respect.  We are making it subject to judicial authorisation and the detention is only in respect of new and compelling evidence and is subject to a very strict regime and time limit.</P>

	<P>Amendments Nos. 38 and 39 are related and may be discussed together.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</P>
        <P>Government amendment No. 38:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 22, lines 1 to 7, to delete subsection (10) and substitute the following:</P>
        <P LI="1">&ldquo;(10) Nothing in this section shall affect the power of the Court to issue a warrant for the arrest of a person in respect of whom an order has been made under <i>subsection (1) </i>of <i>section 10</i>.&rdquo;.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendments Nos. 38 and 39 are technical amendments.  Amendment No. 38 substitutes subsection (10) for section 17(10).  The effect of the substitution is that paragraph (<i>b</i>) of subsection (10) is deleted.  Paragraph (<i>b</i>) provides that nothing in this section shall effect any power conferred by law apart from this section in regard to the arrest, detention  or transfer of persons in prisons or children in detention schools.</P>
        <P>Section 17 sets out the circumstances in which a District Court judge may issue a warrant for the arrest of a person who is in prison or in a children&rsquo;s detention school in connection with the person&rsquo;s suspected involvement in an offence for which he or she has already been acquitted.  The arrest is for the purpose of confirming or revealing the existence of new and compelling evidence.</P>
        <P>Subsection (10)(<i>b</i>) was inserted as a safeguard to ensure that section 17 did not restrict other arrests, detentions or transfer powers in respect of prisoners or children in detention &mdash; for example, the power to arrest such persons in connection with an offence other than the offence for which the person was acquitted.  However, on reflection, the Parliamentary Counsel advised that it serves no practical purpose.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 39 is similar to amendment No. 38.  It also arises following further consideration of section 18(8) by the Parliamentary Counsel.  The amendment substitutes section 18(8).  In effect, it deletes subparagraph (<i>b</i>) of subsection (8) which provides that nothing in section 18 shall affect the operation of any power conferred by law apart from this section in regard to the search of any place or person.  Subsection (8)(<i>b</i>) was inserted as a safeguard to ensure that section 18 did not have unintended consequences for other search powers such as the power to apply for a search warrant in regard to property owned by an acquitted person in connection with an investigation into his or her involvement in another offence.  On reflection again, the Parliamentary Counsel advised that it serves no practical purpose.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied sections 17 and 18 are drafted in sufficiently clear terms to avoid any unintended consequences for other arrest and search powers.</P>

        <P LI="1">In page 24, subsection (1), line 19, before &ldquo;arising&rdquo; to insert the following:</P><Col N="43" />
        <P LI="1">&ldquo;which gives to a directed verdict or which prevented the jury from considering evidence which was properly admissible or a misdirection of law to the jury&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This amendment proposes to insert new words into section 23(1) relating to with prejudice prosecution appeals.  The amendment seeks to specify what type of errors of law can be the subject of an application under section 23, again being mindful of the change in the law section 23 represents and recognising that the expert group on the balance in criminal law said that a trial that flounders of an error of law made by a trial judge cannot reasonably be described as a trial in due course of law.  It argued in favour of a with prejudice right of appeal.  However, it stated that the jury decision on the merits, following reception of all admissible evidence, is totally impregnable under its proposal.  I agree with that because this should be an exceptional power capable of being exercised only in exceptional circumstances.</P>
        <P>The expert group said in the summary of its report that only where the jury is directed as to its verdict, or wrongly prevented from considering admissible evidence, could the jury verdict be impugned.  Using the language of the expert group report, we simply specified what type of question could be appealed under section 23, in other words, the decision in favour of the accused and only in a question of law which gives rise to a directed verdict or which prevents the jury from considering evidence which was properly admissible or a misdirection of law to the jury.  We have broadened it somewhat from the balance report.  I have spotted a typographical error in the amendment and apologise for that.  It should state &ldquo;gives rise to a directed verdict or which prevented the jury from considering evidence which was properly admissible or a misdirection of law to the jury&rdquo;.  It simply specifies in order to ensure that this is more watertight and that this will only be exercised in exceptional circumstances.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senator for what she said.  I had intended to bring forward amendments on Report Stage to refine the scope of this section.  Section 23 represents a radical departure in our prosecution appeal system.  It is intended to capture the recommendations of the balance in the criminal law group that with prejudice prosecution and right of appeal against acquittals following trial on indictment should be permitted in certain circumstances.</P>
        <P>The group recommended that the right should be available in the case of an erroneous ruling by a trial judge which resulted in a judge directing acquittal or weakened the prosecution case which was put to a jury.  The report of review group emphasised that a jury acquittal, following receipt of all the admissible evidence, should be totally impregnable under the regime, as the Senator said.  The group also recommended that a prejudice prosecution appeal should be available against a decision by the Court of Criminal Appeal to quash an acquittal but not order a retrial.</P>
        <P>I am concerned that section 23 does not capture with sufficient precision the recommendations of the review group and for this reason I intend to bring forward amendments on Report Stage which will seek to ensure the threshold for appeal is sufficiently high to protect jury decisions following receipt of all admissible evidence while at the same time not setting the bar so high that the section is inoperable.</P>
        <P>While I appreciate the intention behind the Senator&rsquo;s amendment, I ask her to withdraw it because I am advised by the Parliamentary Counsel that the amendment as drafted does not require a sufficient link between the jury decision to acquit and the erroneous ruling by a judge.  Having regard to the constitutional right to a jury trial, we must be careful when making provision for overturning a jury that a verdict, following receipt of all admissible evidence, is left untouched irrespective of whether it might be considered perverse.  This point is not adequately captured in the section as currently worded which provides that the appeal will solely be on a <Col N="44" />question of law and does not require a link between such a question and the adverse effect on the jury&rsquo;s consideration of the evidence from the prosecution&rsquo;s perspective.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I am grateful that the Minister has indicated his acceptance of the principle of my amendment.  I was concerned about the lack of specificity in section 23 as it stands and I welcome that he plans to insert further qualifications or restrictions.  He was probably more critical than I of the current wording of the section.  This kind of with-prejudice appeal represents a radical departure, especially in the context of jury verdicts.  Jury trials have long been a vital part of our criminal justice system and it is important that we minimise any impacts that would undermine them.  I withdraw my amendment in light of the Minister&rsquo;s acceptance that the section as it stands does not strike the correct balance.</P>

At present where a person is convicted, freezing orders remain in place until the conviction is set aside on appeal where no retrial or confiscation is ordered or satisfied.  It is sensible to provide a corresponding provision in favour of a prosecution in the case of a with-prejudice prosecution appeal under section 23 because otherwise the Director of Public Prosecutions would lose one of the benefits of the appeal in that the defendant would have the opportunity to dispose of or hide his or her assets in the period between the acquittal and the conclusion of the appeal or retrial.  The interpretation of the words &ldquo;proceedings for an offence are concluded&rdquo; contained in section 3(16)(<i>f</i>) of the 1994 Act is being amended to provide that it means, <i>inter alia</i>:</P>

	<P Just="Left">This amendment inserts a new section to amend the provisions on the admissibility of character evidence of an accused person in the Criminal Justice Act 1924.  I will briefly outline the existing law before addressing the amendment as it would aid Members in their understanding of the proposed changes.  As the law stands, section 1(<i>a</i>) of the 1924 Act provides that an accused shall be a witness in his or her defence only if he or she consents to take the stand.  An accused who takes the stand is liable to be cross-examined by the prosecution but exceptions arise to that general rule.  Section 1(<i>f</i>) of the 1924 Act prohibits the cross-examination of an accused regarding previous convictions or bad character unless certain circumstances arise.  The accused will lose the so-called shield under three conditions.  The prosecution can cross-examine the accused about his or her commission of or conviction for another offence if it satisfies the similar fact evidence rule.  The accused will also lose his or her shield if he or she has attacked the character of the prosecutor or witness for the prosecution, has given evidence of his or her own good character or has adduced some evidence from witnesses for the prosecution.  This does not extend to defence witnesses.  The accused can also be cross-examined if he or she has given evidence against a co-accused.</P>
        <P>As the balance in the criminal review group noted, this gives rise to anomalies.  Under the existing law, an accused person may retain the shield simply by refusing to take the stand.  Deceased and, often, incapacitated victims are not available as witnesses for the prosecution, which means that an accused can avoid the consequences of an attack by him or her on the character of a person who in other circumstances would be a prosecution witness.  Victims who cannot be witnesses are at present afforded no protection for their reputation or good name.  This has the potential for intensifying the distress and suffering of their families.  Such a situation amounts to an undeserved benefit to the accused from the degree of injury inflicted on the victim.  The overall picture that emerges from the present situation is that an accused or his or her legal team can adduce evidence of the good character of an accused or conduct an attack on the character of other persons with a high level of impunity.  Deceased or incapacitated victims are left with little or no opportunity to respond to claims by the accused.</P>
        <P>It is against that background that the amendment to the 1924 Act is being proposed.  The amendment implements the recommendations of the review group.  Section 1(<i>f</i>) is being amended in two respects. Subparagraph (ii) is being amended to provide for the dropping of the shield where the accused has personally or through counsel asked questions of any witness designed to establish the good character of the accused or where the conduct of the defence is <Col N="47" />such as to impugn the character of the victim.  The new subparagraph (iii<i>a</i>) extends the loss of the shield to include cases in which the accused or his or her legal team asks questions of any witness where the conduct of the defence is such as to involve imputations against the character of the deceased or incapacitated victim.  This extends the circumstances where the shield is dropped to include non-witnesses.</P>
        <P>A new section 1A is being added to the 1924 Act to provide that the defence must give seven days&rsquo; notice of its intention either to make an imputation against a prosecution witness or a deceased or incapacitated victim or to establish the good character of the accused.  In the absence of such notice, the leave of the court will be required by the defence to make such an imputation.  This need for notice arises in cases where the witness is not present and able to defend himself or herself.  It will often take time to check and examine details of allegations against persons who are not present and whose ability to assist even where he or she is alive is impaired.  In cases where the defence uses this case the prosecution may ask questions of the accused or other witnesses as to the bad character of the accused.  The accused may be called as a witness and the prosecution may ask the accused or any other witness questions about the accused&rsquo;s previous record of bad character or the good character of the victim.  This is despite the rule in section 1(<i>f</i>) limiting the circumstances where the accused who is a witness can be asked about his previous record or character.</P>
        <P>My amendment addresses anomalies that are open to abuse by an accused either to enhance his own standing or to question or impugn the character of others who are not able to defend themselves.  I am not rewriting the rules of evidence.  I am not attacking or reducing the established rights of defendants.  I am merely addressing a particular situation that is especially important to the families of victims.  I am respecting the position of the review group.  It was careful in its approach, as was I.  It is clear that it did not favour any general relaxation of the current rules.  I am satisfied that the changes are necessary but careful.  There is nothing in my amendment that would prevent an accused raising issues relating to the victim if he or she can demonstrate that they are true and are relevant to his or her defence.  My amendment aims to prevent the abuse of the anomalies in the current rules and I am happy to commend these amendments to the 1924 Act.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I am happy to support the amendment in principle.  I accept that it is a significant departure but it causes great distress to victims, and particularly to their families, when the accused raises provocation as a defence and the family feels that the character of their deceased relative has been impugned without any possibility of a response.  Many years ago I spoke about this to Advocates for Victims of Homicide, AdVIC.  It has called for such an amendment.  It is also a recommendation of the expert group as the Minister said.</P>
        <P>I want to raise two points, however, to improve the wording of the amendment.  They are almost typographical errors.  Subsection (<i>b</i>) states: &ldquo;notwithstanding section 1(<i>f</i>), the person may be called as a witness and be asked, and the prosecution may ask any other witness,&rdquo;.  Should that not be &ldquo;or&rdquo; the prosecution or &ldquo;and/or&rdquo;?  If the accused is not taking the stand the prosecution can ask any other witness, as an alternative.  The same is true if the accused does take the stand.  The present phrase suggests that the prosecution can ask another witness only where the accused has been called as a witness.  Will the Minister please check that point?</P>
        <P>Subparagraph (ii) of subsection (<i>b</i>) reads &ldquo;would show that the person in respect of whom the offence was alleged to have been committed is of good character&rdquo;.  I would say &ldquo;is or was of good character&rdquo; because the person may be deceased.  In my example the character of a deceased person has been impugned, for example, where the defence alleges provocation in a murder trial.  In that case &ldquo;the person in respect of whom the offence was alleged to have been committed&rdquo; is deceased but his or her character is being attacked.  That is the sort of case the <Col N="48" />Minister seeks to address here.  The phrase &ldquo;is of good character&rdquo; implies that it refers only to someone who is alive but is incapacitated, which is the other circumstance covered by the legislation.  Will the Minister consider these two small changes to improve the wording of this provision?</P>

        <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
        <P>Government amendment No. 48:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">In page 28, after section 32, to insert the following new section:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">&ldquo;34.&mdash;(1) An accused shall not call an expert witness or adduce expert evidence unless leave to do so has been granted under this section.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">(2) Where the defence intends to call an expert witness or adduce expert evidence, whether or not in response to such evidence presented by the prosecution, notice of the intention shall be given to the prosecution at least 10 days prior to the scheduled date of the start of the trial.</P>

        <P LI="2" el="5">(<i>a</i>) the name and address of the expert witness, and</P>
        <P LI="2" el="5">(<i>b</i>) any report prepared by the expert witness concerning a matter relevant to the case, including details of any analysis carried out by or on behalf of, or relied upon by, the expert witness, or a summary of the findings of the expert witness.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">(4) The court may grant leave to call an expert witness or adduce expert evidence even if no report or summary of the findings are included as required by subsection (3)(<i>b</i>), if the court is satisfied that the accused took all reasonable steps to secure the report or summary before giving the notice.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">(5) The court shall grant leave under this section to call an expert witness or adduce expert evidence, on application by the defence, if it is satisfied that the expert evidence to be adduced satisfies the requirements of any enactment or rule of law relating to evidence and that&mdash;</P>
        <P LI="2" el="5">(<i>a</i>) subsections (2) and (3) have been complied with,</P>
        <P LI="2" el="5">(<i>b</i>) where notice was not given at least 10 days prior to the scheduled date of the start of the trial, it would not, in all the circumstances of the case, have been reasonably possible for the defence to have done so, or</P>
        <P LI="2" el="5">(<i>c</i>) where the prosecution has adduced expert evidence, a matter arose from that expert&rsquo;s testimony that was not reasonably possible for the defence to have anticipated and it would be in the interests of justice for that matter to be further examined in order to establish its relevance to the case.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">(6) The prosecution shall be heard in an application under subsection (4) or (5).</P><Col N="49" />
        <P LI="1" el="5">(7) A notice required by this section to be given to the prosecution may be given by delivering it to the prosecutor, or by leaving it at his or her office or by sending it by registered post to his or her office.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">(8) Where the court grants leave under this section, the prosecution shall be given a reasonable opportunity to consider the report or summary before the expert witness gives the evidence or the evidence is otherwise adduced.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">(9) In this section&mdash;</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">&ldquo;expert evidence&rdquo; means evidence of fact or opinion given by an expert witness, and &ldquo;expert witness&rdquo; means a person who appears to the court to possess the appropriate qualifications or experience about the matter to which the witness&rsquo;s evidence relates.&rdquo;.</P>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">This amendment is based on the recommendations of the review group which examined the question of whether there should be a more general prior disclosure of defence evidence.  It rejected the idea of general disclosure but recommended more limited requirement of disclosure of evidence of a technical and special nature.  The Government accepted this recommendation and the amendment gives effect to it.  It provides that the defence must give the prosecution notice of its intention to adduce evidence.</P>
        <P>The notice must normally be given at least ten days in advance of the scheduled start of a criminal trial but the court retains discretion to allow for shorter notice, for example, where it feels it is necessary to respond to some fact that arises in the course of the trial from the evidence given while in the witness stand by an expert witness for the prosecution.  The application from the defence must include the name and address of its expert witness as well as details of the evidence the expert proposes to give.  The application is to be accompanied by reports and summary findings of any analysis carried out by the expert witness.  When assessing the application the court will satisfy itself that the evidence it is proposed to give meets the requirements in statute or otherwise to the standard of evidence.  This ensures the procedure is not used to introduce irrelevant or frivolous material or to otherwise waste the court&rsquo;s time.</P>
        <P>The procedures in this amendment are modelled on section 20 of the Criminal Justice Act 1984, notice of alibi in trials on indictment, which requires notice of the particulars of the alibi as well as details of witnesses to be called in support of the alibi.  The wider picture is that generally a considerable disparity exists between the advanced disclosure required of prosecution and defence in criminal cases.  The prosecution is required to set out details of the precise conclusions that it seeks to prove in the form of statement of particulars of the offence on indictment and to furnish not only copies of exhibits and statements of witnesses intended to call but also any other material which may be useful to the defence.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The defence, by contrast, with limited exceptions such as the alibi evidence to which I referred and information on witnesses required by the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act 1998, or the intention to adduce evidence regarding the mental condition of an accused under section 19 of the Criminal Law (Insanity) Act 2006, is not required to furnish any such information.</P>
        <P>Having viewed various options and having considered the position in the UK and elsewhere the review group felt the time was not right to undertake any wholesale changes but there is no doubt that a case can be made for prior disclosure in the case of expert evidence.  Such evidence is often very complex.  It can relate to a wide range of medical, scientific and mechanical issues, to mention some of the more common ones but it will often relate to matters such as the evaluation of DNA analysis methods, the interpretation of DNA results and pathology reports.</P><Col N="50" />
        <P>The analysis and subsequent reports are often prepared by specialists in agencies outside the State.  It is reasonable that the prosecution should have some opportunity to consider and evaluate such evidence.  The defence, after all, will have had details in advance of all of the evidence, including the expert evidence on which the prosecution relies.  The amendment does not require disclosure of all of the defence evidence.  It is limited to one area where the nature of the evidence is such that it very often cannot be evaluated instantaneously.  I recommend this amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>In response to the Minister&rsquo;s point about disparity between defence and State, it goes without saying that the might of the State is weighed against the defence.  That has always been recognised in the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights and in our Constitution and the due course of law guarantee.  It is important to bear that in mind.  This provision is not unduly onerous but I am glad to see there is a provision in the Minister&rsquo;s amendment which will allow the defence to bring in evidence of this nature without the necessity to seek notice.  In my experience the necessity for such evidence often arises in the course of the trial and therefore it would have been impossible to give the requisite notice.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>This amendment addresses a difficult issue, namely, the requirement of the Garda not only to seek out but also to retain evidence.  While being mindful of the inconvenience and loss being suffered by at least some owners of the property involved, I do not claim that this amendment will address all the concerns in this issue but it will bring a measure of relief as well as a degree of certainty to the law.  There is considerable jurisprudence on this issue from the Supreme Court.  In its judgment in the 2001 case of Braddish<i> v.</i> DPP, Mr. Justice Hardiman stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">It is well established that evidence relevant to guilt or innocence must, so far as is necessary and practical, be kept until the conclusion of the trial.  This principle also applies to the preservation of articles that give rise to a reasonable possibility of securing relevant evidence.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">In her judgment in a more recent Supreme Court case, Savage <i>v.</i> DPP, Mrs. Justice Denham outlined a best practice suggestion for the Garda to follow when deciding on whether to return or retain the property.  This amendment is an attempt to transpose this best practice suggestion into statute, or at least aspects of it.</P>
        <P>The approach taken in the amendment is based on section 21 of the Criminal Justice Act 1984, as amended by the 1999 Act.  Section 21 establishes a procedure for proof by written statement.  The current proposal develops that procedure.  It provides a mechanism whereby exhibits may be presented by way of a written statement which contains all relevant analysis to the satisfaction of both parties.  The procedure entails the prosecution, at its discretion, presenting a statement or report to the defence.  The defence then has the opportunity to agree to or accept the report presented to it by the prosecution, in which case the property is returned or disposed of.  The defence may commission its own report, or may require that the item be retained or presented at trial.  Although it is a limited procedure, the arrangement refers to the prosecution making its approach to the defence at least 23 days prior to the scheduled start of the trial.  The Police Property Act 1897<b> </b>is available to deal with claims for the return of property after the conclusion of proceedings.  Therefore, I recommend this amendment to the Seanad.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I am very conscious that there has been a long body of case law on the issue of presentation of evidence, and I declare an interest as I acted in one case that went to the High Court on this.  I welcome the attempt to put certainty in the law, but this may be difficult to operate in practice.</P>
        <P>I wish to make suggestions to improve the procedure outlined by the Minister in the new section 35.  The time of seven days outlined in the new section 35(4) for the defence to serve this notice in writing on the prosecution, indicating what they propose to do with the property, is simply too short.  I do not think it will work in practice.  The prosecution can serve the prosecution notice about the property at any time at least 23 days prior to the start of the trial.  That could occur right at the beginning of the criminal proceedings.  In my experience, this arises where somebody reports a crime to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, garda&iacute; investigate and find stolen property, they arrest an accused and the owner then seeks the return of his or her property.  This might happen at a very early date, possibly even prior to the accused&rsquo;s first appearance before the District Court if that person is on bail.  It may be that the accused will not even have instructed a solicitor or been granted legal aid.  Where the owner is seeking the return of the goods in that sort of case and the garda&iacute; wish to dispose of the property having taken their photographs, they can serve the prosecution notice on the accused because that is allowed in the new section 35(2), but the defence &mdash; just the accused person at this stage &mdash; will only have seven days to respond.</P>
        <P>The new section 35(5) provides that the defence shall, not later than seven days after service of that notice, serve the defence report of evidence on the prosecution.  That seems to be too <Col N="53" />tight to be workable in a situation where an accused person may not have been assigned legal aid.  It would be better to have longer time limits in those particular subsections.  I do not want to overstate this and I can table amendments on Report Stage.  However, I have been involved in cases like this and I know in practice that it may be very difficult for the defence to comply with this.  I do not see a proviso saying that all this could be done over a longer period.  The real risk is that the garda&iacute; involved will dispose of the property if they have not heard from the defence.  We then have the whole Braddish <i>v.</i> DPP and Dunne <i>v.</i> DPP scenario all over again where the defence may apply to the courts claiming that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na should have retained the property.  I just seek to make the provision more workable.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">We can look at the dates for which the defence must make a response.  There is an onus on the prosecution to stick to the 23-day notice, which is stringent.  We will look at it on Report Stage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not think the 23 days is stringent.  The prosecution must do it at least 23 days before the trial, but at any point in the months preceding the trial.  It is a tight onus on the defence or the defence solicitors who are increasingly being given these time limits for the disclosure of evidence.  In that context we need to look at extending the period for the service of the defence notices.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>

	<P>Certainly, but there is a balance and I do not think it is being struck here.</P>

        <P>Government amendment No. 51:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">In page 28, after section 32, to insert the following new section:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">&ldquo;37.&mdash;The First Schedule to the Criminal Justice Act 1951 is amended by the insertion of the following reference:</P>
        <P LI="2" el="5">&ldquo;26. The offence at common law of breach of the peace.&rdquo;.&rdquo;.</P>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">This amendment amends the Schedule to the Criminal Justice Act 1951 by inserting a new paragraph that refers to the common law offence of breach of the peace.  The Schedule to the 1951 Act lists offences which may be tried either as summary or indictable offences.  Section 2 of the 1951 Act sets out the procedure on whether to proceed on indictment or by way of a summary case.  The decision is one for the Director of Public Prosecutions or the District Court when it considers that the offence in question does not fall within its jurisdiction, or for the accused who may elect for trial on indictment.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In the 2006 case of Thorpe <i>v.</i> DPP, a case stated from the District Court to the High Court, the status of the offence of breach of the peace was examined.  The High Court confirmed that it was an offence known to law, although not having a statutory basis, and ruled that the offence could be prosecuted as a summary offence.  Having regard to its origins, this ruling effectively classified it as an either-way offence.  Nevertheless, doubts remain about the law on this offence.  It has its origins as a common law misdemeanour and, as such, was regarded as an indictable offence.  Despite that, the offence has been tried summarily.  Although the High Court decision clarifies the law for the moment, a different view might be taken in another case or by the Supreme Court.  There is no statutory basis for regarding an offence as an either-way offence.  The solution I propose clarifies the matter and provides a statutory basis for treating it as an either-way offence to be tried either on a summary basis or on indictment depending on the circumstances of the case.</P>

The Schedule lists the offences in respect of which the Director of Public Prosecutions may seek to quash an acquittal and seek a retrial on the basis of new and compelling evidence.  The threshold for the inclusion of offences in the Schedule is that a maximum sentence of life imprisonment applies on conviction with the exception of the offences under section 7 and section 8 of the International Criminal Court Act 2006 &mdash; genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes and ancillary crimes.  In some limited circumstances, a person convicted of an offence under section 7 or section 8 is liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 30 years rather than life imprisonment.  The three offences I propose to add to the Schedule attract maximum sentences of life imprisonment.  I believe their inclusion is appropriate.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Senator Brendan Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 3, between lines 31 and 32, to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="1">&ldquo;(9) No compensation upon leaving office shall be payable to the Director General or any other officer or employee unless the terms of the compensation are approved by a committee appointed by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann for the purpose.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">In light of significant public comment and disquiet regarding recent events, the amendment seeks to ensure there is a control on golden handshakes for senior staff by having the terms of compensation agreed by a committee of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  We need to ensure there is no significant bumping up of payoffs and a committee specifically set up to deal with the matter would be a useful control.  It is a significant matter.  While the Minister of State may suggest the relevant Minister is accountable to the Committee of Public Accounts, we are not necessarily sure how payments are computed on the cessation of employment.  In regard to the most recent matter concerning Rody Molloy, serious concerns were raised in terms of the payoff as to whether it was in keeping with guidelines.  The amendment seeks to deal with concerns in that regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DaraCalleary"><NameTxt>Deputy Dara Calleary</NameTxt>
	<P>We oppose the amendment on the grounds that, as we have discussed at committee level, it is a matter for the Minister with the consent of the Minister for Finance to determine the terms and conditions of the director general of F&Aacute;S and to determine the mechanism for determining the remuneration of F&Aacute;S employees.  The Minister is responsible to the Oireachtas in this matter.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The issue of severance packages to chief executive officers is a more general one.  The Government is reviewing the issue of severance and retirement packages as part of a broader examination that is under way following the publication of the Green Paper on pensions.  The <Col N="57" />Green Paper addressed, among other options, items that might be considered for future pensions development.  Our objective is to put in place a pensions system that is financially, economically and socially sustainable.  The issue of public service pensions is addressed in chapter 13 of the Green Paper.  We are at an advanced stage in the development of this matter and hope to be able to bring forward proposals in the near future.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I echo the sentiments expressed by Senator Ryan.  The amendment arises from what we have seen in the recent past in F&Aacute;S in terms of the payments that were made to the ex-director general of that organisation, the completely unsatisfactory manner in which the T&aacute;naiste explained those payments and the complete lack of transparency as to how figures and settlements were arrived at.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I fully support the Labour Party amendment.  While the Minister of State has given some sort of positive indication in his remarks, he will not take the amendment on board.  I would not be particularly happy with that but I will leave it to Senator Ryan to indicate whether he will put the amendment to a vote.  It is important in this Bill, which deals specifically with the board and operations of that body, that we should insert some sort of framework so the fiasco that happened with Mr. Molloy&rsquo;s resignation and subsequent settlement does not happen in the future.  This Bill is the correct place to insert it.</P>

I urge the Minister of State to accept the amendment.</P>

        <P LI="1">In page 4, to delete lines 27 to 30.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">The intention of this amendment is to remove the gag on the director general in commenting on Government policy.  We want to find a mechanism whereby the director general can comment on what he or she may feel about an issue when appearing before the Committee of Public Accounts or any other committee.  We live in a democracy and it should be possible to raise matters of policy which are causing public concern.  I ask the Minister of State to accept the amendment.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I second Senator Ryan&rsquo;s amendment.  This particular type of phraseology is much used in legislation I have seen going through the House with regard to State agencies.  It is important where serious consideration is given to whistleblowing legislation across the board in certain new items of legislation.  I believe it is part of the renewed programme for Government that such provisions are made.</P><Col N="58" />
        <P Just="Left">This is not strictly a whistleblowing amendment but it is an opportunity to allow the director general of F&Aacute;S to express an opinion.  The Minister of State in response will point out that it would be unsatisfactory if the director general expressed a view that was completely contrary to Government policy.  The phraseology of that part of section 4, which states that in the duties of the director general they shall not question or express an opinion on the merits of any policy of the Government or a Minister, is archaic and does not fit with the times in which we live.  It certainly should not fit with any attempts by any Government to introduce transparency into the way it operates the semi-State sector.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DaraCalleary"><NameTxt>Deputy Dara Calleary</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DaraCalleary"><NameTxt>Deputy Dara Calleary</NameTxt>
	<P>We are not in a position to accept the amendment as a Government decision of 7 March 2006 has formalised a sectoral approach to addressing the issue of whistleblowing.  That decision requires Ministers to include, where appropriate, whistleblowing provisions in draft legislation relating to specific sectors.  The inclusion of this overall provision in the Bill is consistent with a sectoral approach and to include the overall Department would be against that approach.  We cannot accept the amendment.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Senator Brendan Ryan</NameTxt>

        <P LI="2">&ldquo;8 ordinary members (including a worker director and&rdquo;.</P><Col N="60" />
        <P FLI="0">This amendment seeks to reduce the size of the board and include one worker director.  There is scope to reduce the board further in this case and business can be done more effectively and efficiently with a smaller board.  There is also a concern with this aspect of the legislation because of a failure to allocate a place for worker directors.  There is a strong case for worker directors.  We propose that room be made for one worker director on the newly constituted board.  In the past, worker directors have played a significant and positive role on various semi-State bodies and they could do so in the future.  In theory, having a worker director on the board should work in favour of a company because the director would be aware of the context and reason for difficult decisions.  As a worker elected to the board, the director must justify his position on the board to the workers.  This is a positive thing and is a tried and trusted practice.  We have worker directors on the boards of RTE, Bord na M&oacute;na and other semi-State bodies.  I believe there is a good case for continuing that tradition and, therefore, urge the Minister of State to accept our amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Ryan&rsquo;s amendment which is similar to my amendment No. 8.  There is a small difference in that the Labour Party amendment seeks to reduce the size of the board further than is proposed in the Bill.  Both amendments seek to include a worker director.  I do not understand the logic behind removing the worker director from the board.  I understand that legislation enacted in 1977 laid the foundation stone for worker directors to be placed on the boards of semi-State authorities.  It seems a step backward to remove this provision.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>To cut to the chase, this Bill would never have been introduced were it not for the sterling work of a number of Members of this House and the D&aacute;il in unveiling difficulties that emerged within F&Aacute;S.  However, despite the profligacy of certain senior managers and the lack of oversight by the board as evidenced in the coverage those issues have received, everybody has pointed out that the ordinary staff of F&Aacute;S provide a vital service the length and breadth of the country.  Both the community employment schemes and the apprenticeship schemes F&Aacute;S operates have been acknowledged around the world.  These have been very successful.  Everybody acknowledges that the role of the ordinary worker in the organisation has been undermined to an extent by the activities of senior management and, perhaps, a lack of oversight by board members.  However, I believe those ordinary workers should continue to have a representative voice at board level within the F&Aacute;S structure.  It is for that reason I have tabled amendment No. 8 and support amendment No. 7.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DaraCalleary"><NameTxt>Deputy Dara Calleary</NameTxt>
	<P>I endorse Senator Phelan&rsquo;s remarks on the workforce of F&Aacute;S generally.  The workers are outstanding, apart from the small minority whose activities have been revealed.  Senator Phelan spoke about the quality of the apprenticeship system.  That quality extends throughout the organisation.  Our decision not to have a worker director on the board is no reflection on that.</P>
        <P>The Department has moved away from the model of a worker director over a number of years.  We consider F&Aacute;S as an agency as opposed to the commercial semi-State companies to which Senator Ryan referred.  Our other agencies, such as the IDA, Enterprise Ireland, Science Foundation Ireland and Shannon Development, do not include worker directors on their boards.  The main objective of the Bill, as recognised by both Senators, is to reform and strengthen the board.  We are moving completely away from the sectoral basis of appointment, which dictated the formation of the F&Aacute;S board until now, towards a board that will be appointed by the Minister and for which the Minister will be answerable to both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P><Col N="61" />
        <P>Another change is that the director general of F&Aacute;S will now be an <i>ex officio</i> member of the board.  Therefore, there is a formal link with the staff and with the day-to-day operations of F&Aacute;S to the board through the director general of F&Aacute;S being at the table.  Therefore, we cannot accept the amendments.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Senator Brendan Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Minister of State indicated in his response that the objective of the legislation was, more or less, to bring F&Aacute;S into line with other agencies and he has attempted to differentiate between agencies and semi-State bodies.  I am not sure I understand the rationale or reason for that.  It makes sense to have worker directors and it is beyond me why it makes sense to have worker directors on semi-State boards but not on agency boards.  Will the Minister of State comment on this?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DaraCalleary"><NameTxt>Deputy Dara Calleary</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">There is no major science to it.  We are moving towards a different method of board selection and the agencies are directly within our remit.  There are different restrictions around the commercial semi-State bodies.  The director general will be around the board table and will, as happens currently, have a direct role in the input of the board activities.  He can and will be in a position to reflect the views of the staff.</P>

	<P>I am sure the director general will be a person of the utmost quality.  However, it is not that long since the ordinary staff of F&Aacute;S would have felt their views would not have been adequately represented by the person who filled that position.  Therefore, that provision is not particularly acceptable.  The Bill proposes to reduce significantly the number of people on the board, but the board will still have a membership of 11, including the chairperson and the director general.  I do not see any reason one of the other nine people could not be a representative of the staff of the organisation, someone independent of the director general of the organisation.  I feel it is important to provide for this.</P>
        <P>In general I am not someone who stands up here to support union interests or such things.  However, if we have learned anything from the morass in F&Aacute;S over recent months, we should take on board the view of the ordinary workers in F&Aacute;S who operate the agency who felt they were not listened to sufficiently and were badly managed by those in senior management positions.  This has proven to be the case.  It is not acceptable for the Government to say the workers will be represented by the most senior manager in the organisation on the board.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Senator Brendan Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The tradition in Ireland in terms of worker directors has been that there has been a strong association between the worker director and the unions.  However, the case we are putting in the amendment does not concern the unions as such, rather the concept of the worker being elected to the board and becoming a director.  The Minister of State suggested that because the director general will be on the board, this somehow fills the gap.  I do not accept this to be case.  I spent time in the private sector up to two years ago before I became involved in full-time politics.  I had arrived at the point where I had moved to the other side of the table and was negotiating with the unions.  If I had said to them that I would represent them well, I am sure I would have been told where to get off.  They would have been of the view that they did not need the chief executive or the general manager to represent them.  Notwithstanding the Minister of State&rsquo;s rationale in terms of agencies, I think it is<?oasys _jy ?>worth holding on to worker representation on the board.  Therefore, I will be pressing the amendment.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I appreciate the sentiments of both Senators.  Advertisements were placed in the national newspapers some weeks ago to invite expressions of interest from people <Col N="62" />interested in serving on the board of F&Aacute;S.  I have not seen the final list of applicants but there is potentially a provision there for members of staff to apply.  When this Bill was being considered on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il, I gave a commitment that submissions from the Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment would be considered.  I do not wish to comment on another amendment but if a member of staff of F&Aacute;S were to be part of that submission then I would give it precedence.  However, I cannot accept this amendment.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 9:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 12, line 2, after &ldquo;Minister,&rdquo;, where it firstly occurs, to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;with the approval of a committee of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann nominated for the purpose&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The amendment would provide for Oireachtas scrutiny of the appointment of members of the F&Aacute;S board.  It would stipulate this should be done with the approval of a committee of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann nominated for the purpose.  As I stated on Second Stage, I support the reduction in the number of board members but I still have difficulties with the manner of their appointment because the appointment of friends of the Minister of the day remains a possibility, which is a major concern of my party.  Oireachtas scrutiny should be provided for and the old days of political appointments must come to an end.  The amendment would go some way towards addressing the problem which, I hope, will be solved.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>The two amendments are related, although mine is slightly different.  They are designed to ensure the Oireachtas would be enabled to scrutinise whoever was appointed to the board in the future.  The Labour Party amendment refers to a D&aacute;il committee whereas mine refers to the Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment which should have the final say.  It is time the Government not only published advertisements in newspapers seeking suitably qualified persons, with which we all agree, but that it also opened the process to complete scrutiny by the Oireachtas by allowing the Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment to have the final say on appointments to the board.</P>
        <P>Senator Ryan has correctly pointed out that, ultimately, the Government&rsquo;s proposed new appointments mechanism does not mean the primary qualification to be a member of a board will not be friendship with the Minister for the day or political affiliation.  That is not acceptable in this day and age, although numerous people with political affiliations have fulfilled their functions correctly and admirably on State bodies during the years.  However, a new approach is needed to the appointment of board members and this legislation is the correct vehicle to get the ball rolling.  The amendments seek to introduce a new level of transparency in appointments to the board of F&Aacute;S in the future and I urge the Minister of State to accept them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DaraCalleary"><NameTxt>Deputy Dara Calleary</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank both Senators.  The purpose of the Bill is to fundamentally change the structure and culture of the board of F&Aacute;S.  Throughout the passage of the legislation, I have repeatedly stated we are seeking people with an interest in, or experience of, the functions of F&Aacute;S, including those with a background in finance, corporate governance and public administration.  I am glad Senator Phelan clarified his remark about political affiliation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>It should not be a bar.  Nobody would say that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DaraCalleary"><NameTxt>Deputy Dara Calleary</NameTxt>
	<P>It should not be a barrier if people are qualified.</P>
        <P>With regard to the construction of the new board, we have examined a different approach.  The Department placed advertisements in the newspapers to which it received in excess of 150 responses which are being assessed.  I also made it clear at the select committee and in the D&aacute;il that, having served on the joint committee, I would give credence to submissions made by the committee before the board was appointed.  I invite such submissions again.  Both Senators are members of the committee.  When the legislation is passed, we will move quickly to appoint the members of the board because we have put a great deal of thought into the calibre of persons we want to see on the board and where the organisation should go following the events of the past year which have not been a good advertisement for the public service.  We want to <Col N="64" />use the board to change this.  Ultimately, the Minister will make the appointments.  She is answerable for them to the D&aacute;il, the Seanad and the joint committee.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The wider issue relates to the manner in which political appointees in the United States are called before committees and put through the mill before being appointed.  That is not the road we should go down in making part-time appointments because Ireland is too small a country.  There is merit in having a board answer for its performance while in office to a committee and I would like to flesh out that proposal at some stage.  Questioning appointees before they take up a post may prevent people from applying or discourage them from getting involved in State boards and result in us losing talent.  We have made changes to the construction of the board and to the way we approach this.  I am open to suggestions and the proposal of names.  I welcome names from any field whom a Member feels have a role in rebuilding F&Aacute;S.  We are not in a position to accept formal amendments.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Senator Brendan Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome much of what the Minister of State said.  We agree that we want the best people willing to serve on the board of F&Aacute;S and a series of other agencies.  While we are talking about F&Aacute;S today, should we be talking about another agency tomorrow we would propose the same principle on the need for in-house approval.  The Minister of State indicated a departure, whereby positions on the board will be advertised and expressions of interest will be sought.  It is still open to the Minister to ignore those applicants.  There is no onus on the Minister to accept these candidates.  The Minister can appoint whoever he or she wishes.  That does not address the issue.  Our amendment, referring to the approval of a committee, means that this is open to flexibility thereafter in how this is done.  Accepting this amendment does not mean the applicants must troop in before a committee.  It could be done in a variety of ways.  The flexibility and creativity could be generated by the committee in respect of dealing with concerns people may have.  This is an important amendment.  I ask the Minister of State to reconsider.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not accept the explanation of the Minister of State in refusing to accept either of these amendments.  When any changes are proposed to how State boards are appointed, we are told that any change in the structure will result in qualified people being lost.  Despite this, the Government has come some way down the road to reforming how these appointments are filled.</P>
        <P>Senator Ryan pointed out that the Government has a majority on the committees of the Oireachtas.  Ultimately, if the Government wishes to pursue the appointment of an individual against the wishes of a minority on the committee, that can still be done.  The principle is that the committee should be empowered to question the suitability of someone to hold such a position.  Ultimately, the person in question should be in a position to give an overview of the role and what he or she wants to do as the officeholder.  Any provision to open up the appointments process to that level of scrutiny should be welcomed and should be accepted by the Government.  The Minister of State should change his mind.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 11:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 13, line 23, after &ldquo;Foras&rdquo; to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;or any person whom is classified within An Foras as a Director or Assistance Director General,&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This amendment seeks to extend the category of staff member in F&Aacute;S who can have his or her employment terminated for one of the listed reasons for non-performance of his or her duty.  As stated previously, this Bill was introduced following a number of revelations about activities that took place in F&Aacute;S.  The Bill is aimed principally at remedying the lack of action that was taken and the lack of oversight by the board of senior management within the organisation.  The legislation, as put forward, does not include any level of direct supervision by the Minister of the activities of senior managers.  From the knowledge we now have of what happened in F&Aacute;S, we know it was those senior managers who took many of the bad decisions and who managed to squander, in some cases, quite large amounts of public money.  The fact that there is no provision for the Minister to deal directly with those senior managers in terms of the performance of their roles and their functions in the organisation is a significant loophole.  The purpose of the amendment is simply to extend to senior management the same provisions proposed under the Bill for board members if they fall down in the operation of their duty as senior managers with F&Aacute;S.  The amendment is especially important in the light of what we know about what went on in F&Aacute;S and will be instrumental in ensuring similar activities do not occur at senior management level in future.  I trust the Minister of State will be in a position to accept the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DaraCalleary"><NameTxt>Deputy Dara Calleary</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not appropriate for a Minister to have any function in the day-to-day human resource management of any organisation.  Senator Phelan is correct to state that what took place in F&Aacute;S was wrong.  I will reflect on this matter at the conclusion of the process.  There were checks and balances outside F&Aacute;S but it was the supervision of F&Aacute;S that floundered.  A properly structured and appointed board with effective sub-committees along with a properly empowered director general will fulfil the role.  We cannot accept the amendment because it is not appropriate for a Minister to be involved in matters which are the responsibility of the board and the director general.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand the Minister of State&rsquo;s logic and explanation but it seems ironic to propose legislation designed to ensure the activities uncovered in F&Aacute;S do not reoccur while completely ignoring the major source of the activities and difficulties which arose.  I understand it is undesirable for the Minister to have a direct involvement.  However, this amendment is very specific in that it limits the category of employee affected to a small number of senior managers within the organisation.  It spells out specifically the criteria under which the Minister may become involved.  We have seen a litany of abuse of public expenditure by certain senior managers within F&Aacute;S over a protracted period.  Any legislation that seeks to remedy that but which does not seek to deal with the people directly responsible is deficient.  I understand the Minister of State&rsquo;s explanation but I do not accept it.  A similar provision, although not necessarily worded in the manner of this amendment, should be accepted to ensure such activities do not recur in the future.</P>

	<P>I thank all Senators for their time and input to this process in recent weeks.  I thank the officials of both Houses, including the Clerk of the Seanad and the Clerk of the D&aacute;il, the clerk to the Select Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment and officials in our Department who have worked very hard on the legislation at a time when their attention has been diverted to other issues in respect of F&Aacute;S.</P>
        <P>I reiterate the remarks of Senators and Deputies during the passage of the legislation concerning the staff of F&Aacute;S.  The actions of a small number of people have damaged the whole organisation.  However, this should not take away from the quality, commitment and passion for their work of the people in F&Aacute;S.  Throughout the country, whether as part of apprenticeships or community employment schemes, people&rsquo;s lives are being enhanced by the work of F&Aacute;S.  What took place in F&Aacute;S should in no way diminish the role the staff have played in the running of the organisation and their contribution to society.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This House and the other House have come out of this process well in respect of the role of the Committee of Public Accounts and the Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  It shows we have an effective committee system that can be used well and which has great potential.  I acknowledge my thanks to the Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts, Deputy Bernard Allen, the Vice Chairman, Deputy Darragh O&rsquo;Brien, and other members for the role they have played and continue to play in respect of F&Aacute;S.  I trust every Senator will join me in offering my best wishes to the new director general, Mr. Paul O&rsquo;Toole, as he attempts to deal with the issues that arose in the organisation and, more important, as he tries to deal with the task at hand in terms of addressing the needs of the 430,000 unemployed.  That figure increased today and it should be our focus in respect of F&Aacute;S and in terms of providing the best possible service for these people at a very difficult time in their lives.  We must refocus our attention and energies on that job.  It was never more needed than now.

	<P>I thank the Minister and his officials who were most accommodating towards me before the Bill reached Second Stage.  I reiterate the earlier comments of Senator Ryan.  There was a lack of information available concerning when Committee Stage would be taken.  That was very unsatisfactory and I trust the Leader will be in a position to order the business of the House more clearly in future.</P>
        <P>I echo the sentiments of the Minister of State, Deputy Calleary, on the role of F&Aacute;S, especially his final comments on the importance of F&Aacute;S now at the juncture in which we find ourselves.  F&Aacute;S is crucial and has fulfilled an important role up to now but for those who find themselves unemployed, the importance of a State training agency cannot be overstated.  I trust the Bill will ensure that what was uncovered in F&Aacute;S in recent months cannot happen again.  I was disappointed several amendments were not accepted which could have strengthened the Bill further.  Nevertheless, I support the thrust of the Bill, the emphasis it places on improving the transparency of certain aspects of the operation of F&Aacute;S and the need to ensure there is a proper State training agency to deal with the difficulties facing the country.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State.  As a former psychologist and someone who managed a project for young people who had had their first serious experience of mental health difficulties, including psychosis, I also welcome the opportunity to conclude my reply to the Second Stage debate on the Mental Health (Involuntary Procedures) (Amendment) Bill 2008.  In view of the time constraints involved, I will only make a number of brief points.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>We are limiting the amendment we are proposing to a very clear focus, namely, that section 59(<i>b</i>) of the Mental Health Act 2001 which relates to the involuntary use of electroconvulsive therapy be deleted.  What we are proposing will not interfere with the voluntary use of this treatment.  Electroconvulsive therapy is a controversial treatment.  The website of the Royal College of Psychiatrists attests to this fact and states the benefits of the treatment are as yet unproven.  Electroconvulsive therapy involves the forcible administration of an electric shock to patients who are extremely mentally unwell.  The protocols set out under the Mental Health Act 2001 require that an anaesthetic and a muscle relaxant be used as part of the administration of the procedure.</P>
        <?oasys _cl13.5- ?><P Just="Left">There is widespread disagreement among psychiatrists in respect of this therapy and some of them refuse to administer it.  There is great variation, on a regional basis, in the use of electroconvulsive therapy in Ireland.  The therapy is so controversial because the long-term impacts are extremely serious.  The impacts that have been reported by those who have undergone the procedure include emotional blunting, serious loss of memory, other cognitive impairments and a sense of a gross violation of their physical integrity.  The World Health Organization is opposed to the involuntary use of electroconvulsive therapy, particularly on those under 18 years of age.</P>
        <P>Mental health difficulties and serious mental illness present a real challenge to society.  We are moving in the direction of using more humane and multidimensional treatments.  When one considers the history of psychiatry, one becomes aware that many barbaric practices which <Col N="69" />completely violated individuals&rsquo; rights were used.  We are moving slowly towards the use of more humane treatments.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Bill proposes something from which future generations of mental health patients will benefit.  A certain amount of courage will be required in accepting the Bill.  There is a great deal of concern and ignorance among members of the general population and legislators with regard to whether what is proposed would amount to good practice.  I argue, on the basis of the research carried out by the Green Party, that it does amount to good practice.  I call on the members of other parties to support the Bill which will lead to the deletion of the sections of the Mental Health Act 2001 relating to the involuntary use of electroconvulsive therapy.</P>

        <P Just="Center">SECTION 1.</P>
        <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 1 be deleted.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Section 1 refers to section 58 of the Mental Health Act 2001 which relates to the practise of psychosurgery.  In consultations which took place since the previous occasion on which the legislation was debated, the other sponsors of the Bill and I agreed that it needed to be more focused and should concentrate solely on the involuntary use of electroconvulsive therapy.  However, we are still of the view that action should be taken to tackle the legislative provision relating to the practise of psycosurgery.  This should be done in the context of a future review of the Mental Health Act 2001.</P>
        <P>&ldquo;Psychosurgery&rdquo; is a more polite medical term for the practise of lobotomy.  It has not been practised in this country for more than 30 years and the likelihood is it probably will not be used.  We should be unhappy it is provided for in legislation but that is not the focus of the Bill.  On those grounds, we propose that section 1 of the amendment Bill be deleted.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The purpose of this debate and the Bill, as we hope to progress it, concerns involuntary treatment and the inconsistencies in how people are treated medically in terms of physical ailments and psychiatrically in terms of mental ailments and the principle of, and the ability to give, consent.  It is not an all-embracing attempt to change the legislation.  However, it points to one important area.  As we move on to the other amendments, it is important to put on record that it is not about removing, in all circumstances, the use of ECT, a controversial treatment, but of minimising its use.</P>
        <P>There is an acceptable argument that it has been overused, misused and unfortunately has affected people in a way that may not have been intended.  There have been victims of the use of this treatment.  We will hear arguments as to how people have been treated successfully owing to the existence of the treatment.  In striking the balance between people&rsquo;s right to their own bodily functions and minds and the need to protect society and administer an appropriate course of medical and psychiatric attention, we can all agree, whatever else we agree about in terms of the general focus of this Bill, that our law is deficient and that the review of the Mental Health Act is overdue and needs to come to a quick conclusion and make appropriate changes in order that the rights of patients, in particular, can be better protected.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="70" />
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I am in an area in which I am out of my depth inasmuch as I do not know a great deal about this.  However, I have spoken to some people who have had involuntary treatment and it has had a very severe effect on their lives.  One is torn between the disastrous personal experiences of people and the professional advice.</P>
        <P>I have checked up on this.  It is very interesting that a much refined version of lobotomy, to which Senator Boyle referred, called neurosurgery for mental disorder is still carried out in the United States and in the United Kingdom in Cardiff and Dundee hospitals for persistent severe depression, anxiety and obsessive compulsive disorders.  In 2006 a neurosurgeon in Cardiff described the practice as not a panacea but added that in patients for whom all other treatment has failed, it transforms their lives if it works well.  Many professionals in the area still see a place for the treatment.  Nobody is disagreeing with the treatment as such.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There is an oft held perception that ECT is a high risk with little benefit but we must look beyond those pure assumptions or perceptions as to what ECT is and whether it can bring benefit to those suffering, even if they are unable to agree to the therapy at that time.  It is worthwhile noting a report published in the<i> Lancet</i> medical journal by researchers at the University of Edinburgh and the University of Aberdeen who found ECT to be the most effective treatment for depression, particularly when the condition is accompanied by psychotic symptoms or hallucinations.  However, they pointed out that there are some risks associated with ECT, including having greater anaesthesia and memory impairment.  The researchers said that all effective treatments for depression, which is by nature associated with the most profound suffering, must be welcomed.</P>
        <P>In another report in the <i>Lancet </i>in 2003, the United Kingdom ECT review group found ECT to be one of the most safe and effective treatments in medicine.  I am going to some pains to remind Members that it is a very effective treatment.  As the <i>Irish Journal of Psychological Medicine </i>highlighted in its editorial published this year, this proposal is meant to promote the use of advanced directives made by patients early in the course of their illness when they have capacity.  The assumption is that advanced directives will prevent paternalism and promote the rights of the patient.  However, the authors of the article state that a ban on involuntary ECT would render them unable to treat some of the most mentally ill people in society.  They state it would lead to medical deterioration and subsequent general hospital treatment for some.  It would mean a basic violation of the treatment contract because the detention in hospital of involuntary patients should be based on the principle of reciprocity for which they state they must aim to restore decision-making capacity to patients.</P>
        <P>I agree with this view that medical practitioners must be able to have the ability to restore this decision-making capacity to involuntary patients.  That is why I find it difficult to divide between the personal experiences of those who have spoken to me and the medical experience and the professionalism of the experts in that area of medicine.  I am not saying we should not go ahead with this but I am expressing the concern that we should not jump into it without giving serious consideration to the very definite medical advice we have been given before we assume it is the correct thing to do.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MariaCorrigan"><NameTxt>Senator Maria Corrigan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity the Bill provides to debate this crucial and, at times, very distressing aspect of care for people.  The amendment that a programme of electroconvulsive therapy shall not be administered to a patient unless the patient gives his or her informed consent in writing to the administration is one with which we are all in agreement where the patient has capacity to consent.  This demonstrates the need to move with speed on the capacity to consent legislation which we have been expecting.  Much progress has been made on it and I hope it will be brought before us.  It raises a vital issue for people with mental health difficulties and people with intellectual disability in terms of the basic human right it would restore to them.  We need to see that legislation as quickly as possible because without it, we would find it difficult to implement this amendment.</P><Col N="71" />
        <P>I refer to the group of people who may not have capacity to give consent.  That is where the conundrum arises.  Senator Quinn referred to past research.  Results are mixed but there is a very clear body of thought in the area of mental health which would attest to the effectiveness of ECT for a very limited number of patients.  The conundrum for us is what process should be in place where a patient cannot give consent.</P>
        <P>We have spoken about the idea of advanced consent.  Looking at the issue of advanced consent would be very beneficial where somebody is at the initial stages of illness or has a history of illness and has the capacity to give consent when well.  From my personal and professional experience, I know that for a very small number of people advanced consent would not have been an option because of the speed with which they found themselves suffering from mental health issues.  The conundrum for us is what should be in place for those individuals who have not been able to give advanced consent and are not in a position to give consent at the time of proposed treatment.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The amendment proposes that we would withhold the right for ECT to be administered.  I am not too sure that this is the best way forward.  We must have regard for the medical advice given to us.  However, perhaps we should look at the provisions, whereby two consultant psychiatrists would sign off on it and at whether a different process should be in place which would see the involvement of a strong advocate for the patient who is not a consultant psychiatrist.  I am not casting aspersions on the professional integrity of consultant psychiatrists and accept they act in the best interests of their patients, but I am trying to ensure our legislation provides reassurance that rights will be protected.</P>

      <Speaker pid="KieranPhelan"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>As we are on Committee Stage, I ask Senators to speak to the section.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the focus this Bill has brought to mental health issues.  Judging from the comments of the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children at a recent meeting of the Joint Committee on Health and Children, he will need support from all sides of this House if he is to maintain funding for mental health.  We are at present discussing the quality of mental health interventions and how to ensure the highest standards of care and protection in all treatments.  Electroconvulsive therapy will not be familiar to most Senators because it is rarely mentioned in the public arena.  Like many other psychiatric treatments it has been practised behind closed doors in the past.  This debate is part of an ongoing and necessary process of bringing transparency to such treatments.</P>
        <P>I previously suggested that the Minister of State or the Joint Committee on Health and Children should arrange hearings on the issue in order that interested parties can offer their opinions.  I would like a better focus on mental health issues and the funding of services but I acknowledge the Acting Chairman&rsquo;s advice that we speak directly to the section.</P>
        <P>The Mental Health Commission&rsquo;s investigation of the administration of ECT without consent is relevant to this debate.  The variations in ECT administration around the country raise serious questions and explain to some extent why the Green Party has brought forward this Bill.</P>
        <P>I would like to discuss the issue of involuntary treatment in the context of capacity legislation and a review of the Mental Health Act 2001.  Similar principles should be applied in respect of standards on voluntary patients in areas such as continuing medication after three months if we are to ensure best practice in the treatment of vulnerable patients with mental health issues.  The Bill will not apply to patients who are willing and able to offer consent but questions arise in regard to depriving incapacitated patients of the chance of being treated with ECT.  I appreciate this is a controversial issue and that some countries have decided to discontinue ECT or have introduced advanced directives on its use.  We should consider these options because I am concerned about the variations in treatment in Ireland.  Advanced directives, advocacy roles or court directives could be developed to govern the use of ECT.  I imagine that the numbers treated would decrease as a result.</P><Col N="72" />
        <P>We must accept, however, that ECT remains a recognised form of treatment for certain conditions.  I appreciate that some user groups and advocates of this Bill take the view that it should not be considered as a treatment.  Such concerns are understandable given the nature of ECT.  Equally, however, some expert researchers will attest to its usefulness.  I was recently given a briefing by a psychiatrist who made a strong argument for the use of ECT as a last resort in very specific cases.</P>
        <P>I ask for the Minister of State&rsquo;s opinion on the implications of depriving incapacitated patients of the chance to be treated with ECT.  In the case of a person who lacks capacity, it may be possible to deal with the question of whether the treatment may be given under the common law doctrine of necessity.  The safeguards may be more limited in such a situation because the legal provisions would be vague and less protective of patients.  We will have to consider the legal implications of the Bill.  If certain categories of people can benefit from ECT, I ask whether the Minister of State believes it should be maintained, albeit with enormous safeguards.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KieranPhelan"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>On a point of clarification, the Minister of State may comment if he so wishes but as this is a Green Party Private Members&rsquo; Bill, Senator Boyle will be addressing Senators&rsquo; questions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Minister of State to comment on the issues I will raise.  I am probably the only Member of this House who has administered ECT.  It is a truly barbaric procedure but so too is major surgery.  We should consider the outcome of the treatment in asking whether it is necessary.  I have witnessed the recovery of people who were incredibly depressed after they were treated with ECT but I was too inexperienced at the time to know whether they would have benefited from alternative treatments.  We should discuss the Bill from the perspective of whether we are for or against ECT.  I am not convinced that advanced directives would be as effective as some presume because nobody decides to embark on ECT before trying all the alternatives.  Patients may not have the opportunity of considering advanced directives on ECT.</P>
        <P>If we are not going to ban the treatment, we should examine the effectiveness of the protocols governing its application.  Anecdotal evidence strongly suggests that ECT is being used inappropriately and too often.  Perhaps we should restrict the treatment to a limited number of institutions and consultants.  When I was a senior house officer, consultants directed me to go to a ward, with an anaesthetist, to carry out ECT treatment on a patient.  That was maybe too loose a way to carry out the treatment.  When the Minister of State responds he may need to examine within his Department the protocols and procedures for carrying out ECT, by limiting it to certain institutions and tightening up the way it is carried out, who is informed or who allows it to go ahead.</P>
        <P>I do not know that advanced directives will work.  Advanced directives for ECT should be the same as advanced directives for any form of treatment, for example, for someone involved in a car accident or who gets a serious illness and is left comatose.  The advanced directives should kick in for anybody who no longer has the capacity to decide his or her own future.  That could apply to dealing with someone who has Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease.  None of us would decide to write an advanced directive on what should happen if we get Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease.  We simply get it and then it is too late.  This situation is similar.  We should consider whether we abolish ECT or allow it to continue in a very rigid way.  The Minister of State needs to bring forward proposals on that issue and that may be what we should debate on later Stages.</P>

	<P>We have had an opportunity for hearings and to invite in experts but have not done so.  We are still at the point we were at last year.  No reforms or changes have been made to the Mental Health Act.  Senators have made very good suggestions today about the need for people with serious mental health difficulties to have advocates, for advanced directives, considering approaches that have social and psychological dimensions rather than relying on extreme, controversial biological treatments such as ECT and its involuntary use.  It is important to respond to the points other people are making here.  We need to take this issue more seriously.

      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Green Party has withdrawn certain aspects of its original proposals in this Bill, I will confine my comments to what remains, essentially whether ECT should be permitted in the absence of the patient&rsquo;s consent.  I admire the animating spirit behind this initiative and believe it is right and proper that we think long and hard in terms of human rights and dignity when we consider any kind of medical procedure.</P>
        <P>Without wishing to sound patronising, it is because people care so much that important issues are brought before us.  Nonetheless, the question of consent raises a core philosophical issue.  Our society correctly lays a strong emphasis on rights and that leads to our thinking about patient autonomy which is important most of the time.  Rather like anti-discrimination provisions they are always right except when they are wrong.  There may be circumstances in which, if we viewed this issue through a communitarian lense, or within the concept of paternalism, which is not desirable in itself because its language is wrong, it may remain a fact that in certain cases society must on occasion act in the best interests of some of its members.  Therefore an untrammeled appeal to a doctrine of patient autonomy could end up operating not just against the common good but against the good of individuals in particular circumstances.  That <Col N="74" />is what animates my contribution, with great and sincere respect for what the Green Party proposes.</P>
        <P>We all agree that ECT is the last resort.  It is often prescribed for patients who are involuntary, unlikely to be willing or able to consent.  That goes without saying.  The question is whether the treatment is effective and whether the safeguards ensure that ECT is sparingly used only in cases where it is deemed to be necessary.  I understand that in practice if the legal representative of the patient objects to the treatment the matter would go to the tribunal which safeguards the rights of the patient in whose best interests it acts.</P>
        <P>In Ireland today ECT is reserved for certain circumstances, such as catatonia, treatment resistant depression or severe depression with stupor, which would likely lead to a person&rsquo;s death by starvation, and in cases where the person would die if not given ECT, especially if he or she is elderly or frail.  Could this be an important and essential treatment backed by some kind of evidence base?  I need to think about and research it more before ruling it out completely.  The patients most in need of ECT, whether those in a catatonic state or depressive stupor, are generally unable, by virtue of their condition to give consent.  Therefore, changing the law so that it can be given only with consent may result in deaths.</P>
        <P Just="Left">While I am open to debating this issue I am concerned that the Bill, although well meaning, could be counterproductive and I wonder whether the opinion of the medical community has been sufficiently taken into account.  Starting with Hippocrates, medical treatment has the best interests of the patient at heart.  This occasionally involves the use of treatments such as this or, in rare cases, psychosurgery.  Insisting that patients who are often not in a position to act in their own best interests should have a veto over ECT treatment could be a dangerous and counterproductive measure.  In the words of one medical contact, if a person was capable of acting in his or her own best interests he or she would not need ECT.</P>

	<P>We are talking about rarely used treatments, that are strictly regulated but where a treatment is evolving, it is not the place of this House to substitute its judgment for that of medical professionals who might in the future develop a type of psycho-surgery or other treatment that could be beneficial.  These matters must always operate within constitutional and legal parameters.  I underline again my respect for the spirit underlying the Bill, even if I cannot support the proposed removal of the possibility of this procedure being performed without consent.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Members for their contributions.  It is important to note we are talking about a limiting of the practice of electroconvulsive therapy.  The debate relates to those subjected to the treatment, and whether a majority have been affected in a negative way, rather than helped.  The existing law is failing in many respects.  The safeguards for patients implemented by the Mental Health Commission are carried out too secretively.  The extent to which the patient or his representatives is able to contribute that process is non-existent.</P>
        <P>Our process is behind that found in other European countries.  ECT is not practised at all in Slovenia.  In England and Wales, the practices are quite similar to those in Ireland.  However, Scotland has had a separate Parliament since 1999 and the Scottish Mental Health (Care and Treatment) Act 2003 gives patients with capacity the right to decide.  Where people in this country have the capacity to decide, that capacity is overruled in the current situation and the treatment is administered regardless.  That is a flaw in its own right.  The involuntary nature of the practice when people have the ability to refuse is a major flaw in our legislation.  None of us can be happy with this.</P><Col N="75" />
        <P Just="Left">The Austrian Government tried to overcome the difficulties described by Senator Corrigan by appointing a patients&rsquo; advocate who would act on a patient&rsquo;s behalf.  There is something similar in Belgium, where a person known as judge of peace acts under similar principles.  There are laws in Denmark which allow for complaints about the administration of involuntary treatments and involuntary admissions.  That is subsequent to the fact, but it has helped reduce the reliance on psychiatric measures in Denmark.  Over a 20-year period to 2008, the number of beds in psychiatric institutions in Denmark halved because the Danes took what we would argue is a more humane approach.  The balance at state and federal level in Germany is towards a more human rights patient-centred approach over and above what are seen to be the preferred approaches of the medical profession in administering care and attention.  Ironically, ECT has been more or less taken out of the psychiatric system in Italy, which was the first country to use the practice.  It is now expressly discouraged for schizophrenia and is banned as a means of achieving a rapid remission of symptoms in those who are deemed to be suffering under such psychiatric conditions.</P>
        <P>We argue that Ireland does not have the proper balance between the rights of patients and the administration of effective standards.  In the renewed programme for Government that was recently agreed, the Government committed itself to making appropriate amendments to the Mental Health Act 2001 to address concerns regarding involuntary committals and procedures.  As limited as it is, this Bill is a sincere attempt to do this.  It will not happen tonight, but we have edged the debate forward.</P>
        <P>Proposals have been made on how we can involve more actors in the debate, and I accept the points made by Senator Fitzgerald.  However, Senator de B&uacute;rca already pointed out that we have had that in the original debate also.  I welcome the formation of an Oireachtas group on mental health, and this is possibly a good forum for such a debate to happen.  However, this debate has been dominated too much by the established psychiatric profession.  There is a great debate within psychiatry itself and many psychiatrists do not believe this is an effective form of treatment or that it should be administered to the extent that currently occurs.  The debate has seen very little contribution on the role and rights of patients.  The Minister of State has made several attempts in the ongoing review to change the situation, but this is about where we need to go with this Bill.</P>
        <P>Senator Mullen made a point about patients&rsquo; rights and the threat to wider society.  I do not accept that the use of ECT has anything to do with life saving.  Psychiatrists might make arguments about mental capacity and personality disorder, but life saving procedures are medical procedures.  They relate to the physical condition of the person and I do not see the situation as described by Senator Mullen.</P>
        <P>When we are passing Bills, we must avoid legislating for the particular.  The legislation in force is based on a mythical set of standards, whereby there is an extreme case in every circumstance for which the law must provide.  As our law is predicated on that premise, there are too many innocent victims who fall foul of not being the extreme case, who get treatment that is not necessary but is seen to be the easiest treatment.  We should not have a psychiatric system or a philosophy of psychiatry that is based on this.  That is why we are moving these amendments and seeking support.</P>
        <P>The first amendment tries to take away the debate on psychosurgery or lobotomy, which I find far more offensive, even though we have not practised it here for 30 years.  That will not be the focus of the Bill.  The second and third amendments deal with electroconvulsive therapy.  I will wait for the contribution of the Minister of State on this, but I welcome the comments made by all Members.  While there are reservations about specific aspects of what is being proposed in the Bill, there is a sincere belief there is a need to change the legislation to get the balance right.  If there is a means for this House to find a way forward on the basis of this Bill, we will have done well.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnMoloney"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Moloney</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senators for their contributions.  I acknowledge the sincerity of the Green Party in this debate.  I also acknowledge that ECT treatment is controversial.  I am glad that I do not sense any political involvement in this, as it is a genuine attempt to ensure our mental health services are reformed, which is the continuing role of a Minister of State with responsibility for mental health issues.</P>
        <P>We are speaking specifically about involuntary treatment, which has always been the way.  I must accept that it is a year since we debated this issue, but I have spent the last 15 months travelling around the psychiatric hospitals.  I have done this for a number of reasons and I always made sure that the press were never notified, nor were political colleagues.  I did that at all times to ensure we built a belief that we were trying reform the mental health services.  On most occasions when I visit a hospital, I ask to meet the staff who deliver this treatment and visit the ECT rooms.</P>
        <P>I am taken by the many valid points raised by Senator Fitzgerald, including that on the variation in treatment across the country.  Without trying to lead to a cosy proposal I might make shortly, I made the point at the Joint Committee on Health and Children that it was no longer sufficient to make a yearly statement on mental health services.  Since taking office, I have believed it is important we tie down the commitments and recommendations made on the reform of mental health services in A Vision for Change which has been running for four years and has five or six left to run.  From the outside, I saw the importance of having in place a director for mental health who would have as his or her only brief the driving of the reform of mental health services.  I am pleased to say Mr. Martin Rogan is now in place.  However, it is not just a matter of having a person in place but of having someone who will be directly responsible for driving reforms.  I have always insisted on the person in question not being responsible to the Minister, lest there be any argument about political motivation.  The job description for the post of director should be to be specifically responsible to the monitoring committee charged with delivering reforms.  That is now in place as part of the building blocks.  The other part concerns the 14 clinical directors.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I will come to the net point shortly but I wish to establish my own credentials first.  Clearly, we cannot be true in our talk of reform unless funding and capital are provided.  I have made proposals in this regard to the Government.  I made this point also at the Joint Committee on Health and Children; therefore, it is not just a matter of talking about talks behind closed doors.  I have proposed a five-year capital programme on how we should develop and put in place all of the capital programmes required.  I accept that capital programmes are not the answer to every issue and are only part of our public commitment to deliver reforms.  My proposal is that whatever is raised in the mental health sector from the sale of 800 properties should go back into mental health services specifically and that there should be a clear money trail from the sale of the properties down the line to the commitments and recommendations made, whether in regard to intensive care units, intensive care rehabilitation units and the Central Mental Hospital.  I wish to deal with these issues in the context of mental health service reform.</P>
        <P>In the past year I have received many submissions from people who believe we should remove ECT, a matter which has arisen in today.  There are three public positions on ECT &mdash; there are those who are totally opposed to the treatment, there are those who are in favour of it and, as I have come to realise having listened to the debate, there are those who are in favour of it, provided certain safeguards are in place.  I concur with the latter.  I am not here to argue the pros and cons, and that is not a cop-out because I will come to my net point shortly.</P>
        <P>A year ago submissions and presentations were made to me on the need to remove ECT from mental health services.  I was taken by the debate.  I have since had the opportunity to meet those who administer the treatment, as well as those who are totally opposed to it.  I <Col N="77" />accept that in some cases the treatment does not work but that it does in others.  While I do not want to make either case, it has been suggested ECT does not work.  Only last week, however, I received a letter from a person who offered to come to a committee of the Houses, perhaps the Joint Committee on Health and Children.  The person has a severe mental illness &mdash; he is catatonic &mdash; and wrote to make me aware of the fact that he put his survival down to the treatment in question.</P>
        <P>I am making the case to convince myself in the sense that, on the one hand, I have evidence that suggests there is an argument for the retention of ECT, although I am not swayed by it, but, on the other, there is evidence on the other side of the argument.  I do not use the phrase &ldquo;putting this out for wide consultation&rdquo; because what it means in political speak is that I let the issue run for months or even years and that the next person coming after me would have to pick up the pieces.  I accept from what I have heard from the Members who have moved the motion and all who spoke is that this is a very serious issue.  While I do not want to respond in contradictory terms, when the point is made that we had a year but did nothing, I must say the opposite.  I will try to show the House what I mean.  First, as part of the programme for Government, in which my party and the Green Party are involved, we have considered not just continuing reform of mental health services but also a review of the Act.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P Just="Left">The second issue can be confirmed by many hospital staff.  The third issue is as follows.  The Mental Health Commission has promised to meet me before 10 December to outline its views on how we should deal with unwilling or unable people.  A fortnight ago I met the representatives of the College of Psychiatry of Ireland.  Let me make it clear to the House because I must respond to the point made, although I accept it was not meant as a criticism, the established mental health service providers are totally in favour of ECT.  While this might be so, as Minister of State and with the officials who work in the Department, I am not advancing that case in any way.  What we are suggesting is that this is such a huge leap &mdash; the word &ldquo;courage&rdquo; was used &mdash; I must have the courage to make the right decision.  In that context, I will meet tomorrow the representatives of the hospital consultants.</P>
       <?oasys _cl13.5- ?><P Just="Left">All of this has been a process in the past year to ensure I am properly informed before I make a recommendation to the Government.  I ask Members to consider that we have been genuine in our attempts to come to an informed conclusion.  I have also invited the representatives of the College of Psychiatry of Ireland, as well as those who propose the abolition of ECT, to come to the Houses on one day, when those in favour of its retention and those in favour of its abolition can make a presentation to members of the joint committee.  Rather than put the issue on the long finger &mdash; it is far too serious for that &mdash; I give a commitment to the House that by March I will have completed the consultation process.  I will know the pros and cons and at that point it will be up to me to make a decision.  I also give a commitment to the House that not only will I make recommendations &mdash; I am not a professional and bow to those who are &mdash; but also that the relevant Bills will be ready by then.</P>
        <P>I wish to respond to some of the points made.  Senator Fitzgerald made the point that mental health issues should be to the fore and that the process for ensuring this should be directed through the Joint Committee on Health and Children.  I will ask the Chairman to facilitate those people who in the run-up to March want to make written submissions and, if time is available, to take some verbal presentations.</P>
      
        <P>The issue is serious and the word &ldquo;courage&rdquo; strikes me.  I will try to deal with the matter more specifically.  I must also have the courage to ensure the plight of those who cannot protect themselves by securing treatment is examined.  I have the courage in that context to ask that we do not make the decision on this legislation now.  I ask that Committee Stage be adjourned to allow me make a genuine attempt to address the issue.</P>
        <P>It is not a matter of trying to be cosy politically or to escape my responsibilities in this portfolio.  I do not want to ignore the genuine commitment of the proposers of the motion.  I <Col N="78" />have been as active as a Minister of State can possibly be in this Department for the past 15 months and I have made it clear that in February I will host a public appraisal of where we are with A Vision for Change.  I will deal with the level of commitments of what we will do with regional directors and, more importantly, of dealing with the capital programme.</P>
        <P>By March I will bring forward a nationwide proposal on using local radio and personalities, including people involved in Shine and other mental health groups.  We will go the regions and promote the concept of eliminating the stigma in mental health.  I will do that publicly but in the meantime I ask to be allowed space to work.  I will ignore nobody and take all into account.  The time for decision will be March and I ask people to allow me that space.  I ask the Green Party Members to adjourn the debate on Committee Stage until then.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I have heard the comments of the Minister of State and my colleague and have some sympathy with what he is trying to achieve.  He mentioned hospital consultants and has noted the contact he has had with the college of psychiatrists.</P>
        <P>It is important that any consultation process defined to end by March will have all the actors involved.  The Minister of State mentioned organisations such as Shine.  Every mental health advocacy group and patients&rsquo; rights group should be fully involved in the process and identified as such.  The process should have defined outcomes and work towards the possible drafting of heads of Bills that would tackle this question.</P>
        <P>I am encouraged by the contributions made by many Members this evening.  We have no desire to divide the House on the issue and hope Members will continue to contribute to the debate, especially through the Oireachtas group on mental health.  Having heard what the Minister of State said and being cognisant of amendments submitted by other Members, I seek the agreement of those proposing amendments and the House in general to adjourn the debate on Committee Stage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Boyle&rsquo;s comments.  It is important that any consultation involves the user groups.  We must also hear the views of the professionals involved in the area and it is critical that the consultation be comprehensive.  We are coming from a position with psychiatry where user groups did not have the kind of voice they needed, although I am thankful this is changing.  There is a way to go with the issue and the way this consultation unfolds could be important in developing that role for user groups.  I congratulate those involved with the user groups because they have been pioneers in ensuring a focus on the client, patient and user of services.  It is critical to get that balance as it has been missing in so many areas of life, particularly in psychiatry.  It is great to see such change and we must do everything possible to encourage it.</P>
        <P>If March is the deadline, will Ireland have ratified the UN Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities by then?  It would be a good template to measure what we are doing in the area.  Will the same deadline apply to the capacity legislation and the review of the mental health legislation?  We need a holistic approach to what is being discussed and there are rights issues involving voluntary as well as involuntary patients, electroconvulsive therapy, ECT, and other areas.  We are asking much of the Minister of State but all of these issues are intertwined.  We will get the best result if they are dealt with holistically.</P>

	<P>I support Senator Boyle&rsquo;s proposal to adjourn the debate on Committee Stage.  I pay tribute to the work done by the Members of the Green Party in bringing this Bill forward and giving us the opportunity to focus on what needs to be done and take time to look at the issue as a whole.  Senators Boyle and de B&uacute;rca were initially very clear that they were focusing on a particular area but we have had the opportunity to widen the debate.</P><Col N="79" />
        <P>The Minister of State has commented on the review of the mental health legislation and the implementation of A Vision for Change.  I compliment the Minister of State on the work he has undertaken and welcome that he has set a March deadline.  To achieve what he hopes to achieve, much work remains to be done.</P>
        <P>I appreciate that the Minister of State has mentioned the groups with which he has consulted.  I add my voice to that of other colleagues in asking that the consultation be as wide as possible.  In particular, there should be consultation with patient and advocacy groups as well as families.  A wider range of professionals and personnel involved in the delivery of the mental health service should also be included as we can only benefit from widening that scope.</P>
        <P>To achieve what the Minister of State hopes to achieve, we must be upfront about the issue.  We need the capacity legislation and, without it, much of what we hope to do will be stymied.  This legislation will be a momentous milestone in the delivery of services but if we try to proceed with any of our reforms without putting that legislation in place, we will be coming up constantly against a wall and conflict over people&rsquo;s rights.</P>

	<P>I add my words to Senator Boyle&rsquo;s proposal.  I was very impressed by the debate and it was an eye opener for me.  I did not know very much about the topic, although I had met some people with experience of the issues being discussed.  I also found a viewpoint being expressed by the professionals.  The Minister of State has opened our eyes and minds to the challenge which is not easily met.  He has explained the matter very well and I appreciate the work put into it by the Green Party and both of its Senators.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State has committed himself to a March deadline, which is useful.  The debate has been productive and I hope Senator Boyle&rsquo;s proposal is accepted.  The debate has opened our eyes and minds and given us a chance to air the issues.  I look forward to holding the Minister of State to the March date.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PhilPrendergast"><NameTxt>Senator Phil Prendergast</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State.  I have witnessed ECT and seen its positive effects.  I can only judge it as positive from what I have known beforehand.  I will not be descriptive of cases where it may not have been positive as I do not have the experience to discuss it in fine detail.  I admire the way the Minister of State is going about his brief and visiting all units around the country.  Psychiatry is constantly evolving and there are new treatments and management styles, some of which conflict with management practices within regular psychiatry services and, perhaps, new models of training, evaluation and how we assess progress or the lack of it.  My colleagues have stated there are many differing opinions on the use of ECT and whether its use is positive or negative.</P>
        <P>I agree completely with the process by which the Minister of State intends to bring the Mental Health (Involuntary Procedures) (Amendment) Bill to the Seanad.  I am willing to co-operate with that process and facilitate the widest possible communication and deliberations with all parties in order that we will have the most comprehensive information available to inform the debate and how best we can progress what is best for those who will be affected by the decisions we make.  Therefore, with other Senators, I am happy to agree to the adjournment of the debate on Committee Stage.</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister of State for taking this issue so seriously.  I also thank Senators de B&uacute;rca and Boyle for bringing this important legislation before the House.  I appreciate the effort and work they have put into the Bill which aims to prohibit the involuntary administration of ECT.  I have read a fair amount about ECT but find it confusing that some psychiatrists think it is the be all and end all, while others see it as a last resort.  It is a barbaric process, but I am not a medic or psychiatrist.  I find it hard to understand the reason people must be strapped down and medicated to such a degree that they convulse, their blood pressure rises and heart rate is disturbed.  This therapy should be a last chance saloon.  I am <Col N="80" />very disturbed at the idea that people will lose their memory and about what this would mean to them and how vulnerable and fearful they must be at such a time.  I am disturbed, too, by the idea that people&rsquo;s spirits will be broken and they will no longer be the persons they were before they suffered from severe depression.  The issue must be given serious attention.  Therefore, I congratulate the Minister of State on taking the time to confer with all of the interest groups involved.  I look forward to contributing to the debate when the Bill is returned to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnMoloney"><NameTxt>Deputy John Moloney</NameTxt>
	<P>I thought it was a given that service users were already talking to me, but I acknowledge that I should have conveyed that information on a more formal basis.  I would like to outline the basic principles we should be following from here on.  I am asking for an adjournment of the debate on Committee Stage until March on the basis of what I propose.  Members should know that what I propose is not an empty exercise and that they have not wasted their time in coming to Dublin today.  An invitation will be issued from the Department to all service users and all those with an interest in this issue to submit their proposals before March and I will meet as many of them as possible.  Since my appointment, I have made a point of meeting at least five groups a week from the mental health or disability sector.  I now know most of the groups involved and it is a matter of making them aware of the purpose of this process.  I am initiating a process, whereby service users will be invited to come to the Oireachtas to make their case.  I will ensure we will have a suitable place, I hope the audiovisual room, where they can make their case before Members in order that we will all be properly briefed.  Until I came into this job, I did not know much about this sector, but that is not to say I know much more now.  We must all be given a full briefing on the issue which is currently before the Seanad but which will be put to the D&aacute;il by way of the mental health review in the new year.  I want to deal with the Bill in March.</P>
        <P>I would like to respond to the specific points raised by Senator Fitzgerald.  I agree that the idea is to be ready with capacity legislation on all of the reform programmes.  We should be thinking of devoting next year to a consideration of mental health issues.  There are many proposals we should continue to promote.  We must give total responsibility to the new director for the reform programme on a day-to-day basis, rather than to a Minister.  I do not wish to lay all of the blame on the new director, but it is important that both he and the 14 clinical directors are permitted to bring forward the reform programme in the next five years.  This means we must have an implementation plan with teeth.</P>
        <P>I have mentioned that we will have a meeting for service user executives on 22 December.  The Mental Health Commission is also preparing its report on its position which is expected in the period from 10 to 12 December.  It is important I receive everybody&rsquo;s position on the issue.  I recognise fully the call made by the Senator for the full involvement of service users and that will happen.  The process I envisage forms part of the reform of mental health services.  Everybody I meet in the House talks about the need to ensure the mental health service is on a level with acute services and that it receives the same level of support.  Since I came into the Department 12 months ago, I have received a clear message from the debate in both the Seanad and the Joint Committee on Health and Children that we need clear targets.  That is the reason I have set a timeframe, to which I have committed totally in order that we will bring forward the reappraisal of A Vision for Change in February.  On that day I want to acknowledge publicly where the reform programme is working well and to be honest and point to where it is not working well.  More importantly, I will challenge the regional directors who receive funding from the Department to demonstrate how the funding is being used in moving from the institutionalised model of mental health services to the community model.</P>
        <P>Leaving aside the important issue of ECT, the challenge for all of us is to ensure we will no longer have people living in our old psychiatric hospitals.  We need a real commitment in this <Col N="81" />regard if we want to ensure proper reform.  Today I met representatives of the Cl&uacute;id organisation and expect to meet representatives of the Irish Council for Social Housing shortly.  I am meeting these organisations to try to reduce the overall cost of delivering on A Vision for Change.  I want to involve the voluntary housing sector in moving at least 80% of patients from psychiatric hospitals into supported housing.  This is not a matter of trying to deliver reform on the cheap.  It is important that we recognise the HSE must be tied into this process.  Whoever leaves an old mental hospital must have the support of a community mental health nurse, occupational therapist or whatever service is required.  These supports cannot be separate from each other.</P>
        <P>Even if we had the best service in the world and the capital programme required, which we do not, we must still have people who are prepared to use the mental health services.  The biggest challenge we face is the removal of the stigma attached to mental health issues.  The past 15 months have not been wasted in this regard.  I watched the interview with Michael Murphy on Ryan Tubridy&rsquo;s show and attended his book launch and told him how courageous he was in speaking out.  I believe getting the media involved is important in helping to remove the stigma and have invited the newscasters to become involved in the process.  I am pleased to tell Senators that Ms Eileen Dunne and Mr. Michael Murphy came here to meet me a fortnight ago and have agreed to act as advisers when we meet editors in local radio stations some time in February in the hope of having a weekly programme on mental health issues to ensure we look after our mental well-being.  It is most important that we establish a service that will cover the issues that affect people.  We can talk all we want about money and the capital programme, but we want to ensure we deal with the basic issues involved.  Treatments must be provided and we must recognise the need to provide services for those who may not be able to speak for themselves.</P>
        <P>This is a two-way process in the House.  I recognise the genuineness of the Senator&rsquo;s position and ask her to recognise ours.  I also ask that the debate on Committee Stage be adjourned to give us an opportunity to come back to the House having fully deliberated on and listened to all of the various opinions expressed in this controversial debate.  If I were to make such a significant jump without being satisfied I had heard all of the professional voices, it would be a leap too far.  I, therefore, ask for a period of three months to continue our deliberations.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Martin Mansergh.  I wish to raise the matter of the western rail corridor.  I ask the Minister of State to make a statement on the funding for the corridor and outline the timeframe for completion of same. <Col N="82" /> There is much concern in the west that the funding will be pulled in next week&rsquo;s budget.  I hope the Minister of State will be able to inform me of the true state of affairs.</P>
        <P>Construction work is continuing on phase one of the corridor, the section running from Ennis to Athenry.  The enhancement of the section running from Athenry to Galway for the provision of commuter services to Galway is welcome.  I understand phase one is expected to be completed by January 2010 when there will be regular services between Galway and Limerick <i>via</i> Ennis.  New stations are expected to be opened at Sixmilebridge, Gort, Ardrahan and Craughwell.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister of State to confirm the progress made on that section of the railway.  When will services commence between Limerick and Athenry?  I note that a new station is expected to be opened in Oranmore early in 2010.  However, I understand the site location has not been confirmed.  The location for the station is shown in the development plan but it is not known if the site has been purchased.  I, therefore, ask the Minister of State to say when the station will open in Oranmore.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State is very familiar with the benefits of the western rail corridor.  It will improve inter-regional transport services and increase economic activity in villages and towns adjacent to the route from Limerick all the way up to Sligo.  That is the western rail corridor and it will increase access to towns and villages along the route shown on this map.  The region did not have such access previously and it will make a major difference to the economic life of the region.</P>

	<P>The corridor will encourage tourism and it will put smaller towns and villages adjacent to the rail line on the map.  The greatest benefit is it will be more environmentally friendly because there will be fewer cars on the road.  The corridor will also result in the provision of a new rail freight service which will take heavy goods vehicles off congested roads and it will be vital for balanced regional development.  The corridor has my full support as it will deliver many benefits.  I would like the Minister of State to confirm funding for the project is secure and to outline the timeframe for delivery.</P>
        <P>The West on Track community campaign has worked tirelessly to promote this project and push for the earliest delivery.  It stated in a press release on 10 October: &ldquo;We also warmly welcome the decision to introduce an allowance per tonne for rail freight in line with climate change objectives&rdquo;.  The group recognises the benefit of transferring freight from road to rail transport.  I would like the Minister of State to confirm the security of the funding and when the various phases will be delivered, including Ennis to Athenry and Athenry to Sligo.</P>

	<P>The Minister for Transport remains committed to the earliest delivery of the western rail corridor.  I have always been a great supporter of this project and attended a West on Track conference four or five years ago.  I have been in touch in various capacities with campaigners such as Fr. Miche&aacute;l Mac Gr&eacute;il since the late 1970s when I had an involvement in energy policy.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am pleased to advise the House that construction on phase 1 of the corridor, which runs between Ennis and Athenry, is complete and driver training and familiarisation began on 16 November.  Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann had intended to launch phase 1 on 8 January 2010 with full services commencing on 9 January 2010.  However, driver training and familiarisation has been on hold since 18 November due to flooding at a number of locations, a subject I discussed with the Senator earlier.  As a result, the opening of the line has been deferred and the company will confirm a new opening date when flood waters recede.  The opening of phase 1 of the corridor <Col N="83" />will mark an important milestone in the delivery of public transport infrastructure in the west, reconnecting Limerick, Ennis and Galway for the first time by rail for passenger services since the 1970s.  I look forward to taking a train from Limerick Junction, County Tipperary, to Galway.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State will be welcome.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank the Senator.  However, this is only the first phase of reopening the corridor which runs as far as Claremorris.  The immediate next step, following completion of phase 1, will be for Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann to undertake a detailed evaluation of phases 2 and 3 with a view to arriving at precise costs to undertake the works.  Following this, the Minister for Transport will seek to progress planning of these phases to ensure we can move speedily to construction at the earliest date once financial circumstances permit.</P>
        <P>The corridor is only one element of the investment being delivered to enhance transport infrastructure in the west.  More than &euro;1.4 billion has been invested in national roads in the region since 2000.  Despite the slowdown in the economy, more than &euro;180 million will be spent this year on improving and maintaining the region&rsquo;s national road infrastructure.  The beneficial impact of this investment is evident throughout the region in the elimination of major traffic bottlenecks, leading to shorter journey times and greater journey time certainty as well as to greater economic competitiveness, road safety and an improved quality of life for all.</P>
        <P>Work is continuing on the last part of the Dublin-Galway major inter-urban route on the N6 between Ballinasloe and Galway city, which was temporarily brought into service following the recent flooding.  Phase 2 of the Limerick southern ring road is nearing completion and work is ongoing on the N18 Gort-Crusheen bypass which forms part of the Atlantic road corridor.  More than &euro;100 million will be invested this year in non-national roads in the west.  This covers a wide range of projects, including such major works as the Shannon crossing, the R336 Connemara access road, the Athenry northern relief road and the western distributor road in Sligo.  In addition, the Minister is providing funding for an array of smaller but significant projects under Smarter Travel, Ireland&rsquo;s new sustainable transport policy, which he launched last February.  The west has benefited through a number of Smarter Travel schemes which the Minister agreed to support pending the establishment of new sustainability funds.  These include cycling and walking projects in counties Galway and Mayo as well as measures to promote bus travel and smaller sustainable transport projects in counties Galway, Mayo and Roscommon.</P>
        <P>I look forward to the commencement of rail services between Ennis and Athenry as soon as possible in the new year.  While the closure of the line in the mid-1970s represented the start of a challenging period for Ireland socially and economically, the opening of the line represents our confidence and commitment to a more prosperous future, notwithstanding the current difficult times.  It is fortunate that the land was preserved which meant no land purchase or compensation costs were incurred.  That made the project more viable.  The prospects for building further phases depend very much on the success of the phases that are open.  I have used the Limerick-Ennis line on a number of occasions and it has proved successful, the only fly in the ointment being the flooding problems.  If the Ennis-Galway phase is successful, that will encourage people to proceed further.</P>
        <P>Notwithstanding my earlier comments about roads investment, the railway takes people to Eyre Square in the heart of Galway city and no road can achieve that, particularly at peak commuter times.  I welcome the reconnecting of the rail network.  There will be knock-on benefits for the Limerick-Waterford line which has been under threat for some time and in which I have an interest.  People will want to travel from further afield to Galway and they will be able to do so by rail.  Rail is an efficient method of travel.  I can spend time reading and working which I cannot do to the same extent travelling by road.  It is environmentally friendly and I hope the corridor will be a further element in the renaissance of rail.  The Cork-Midleton <Col N="84" />spur recently opened and the link between Dunboyne and Dublin city is also being built, with a second phase to Navan due.  I will give my support to the corridor, even to the extent of using it.  I do not have information on the station in Oranmore.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>Is no information available on the station there?  I am delighted with the commitment in principle given by the Minister of State and his philosophy on the importance of rail transport, which I share.  However, I am concerned about his comment that progression towards phases 2 and 3 is dependent on how well services on the Ennis to Athenry line do.  We expect them to do very well.  However, I was contacted within the past few days by constituents who are outraged by the proposed timetable.  Five services are offered between Galway and Limerick at off-peak times, not at peak times.  It will take one hour and 55 minutes to get from Limerick to Galway city.  One could do the same trip by car in an hour and a half.  It will be unfair if the reason the line is unsuccessful is poor scheduling by CIE.  Will the Minister of State make a note of this and pass on the information to CIE?  The one point in favour of West on Track is that there was unanimity that there should not be a partial opening of services between Limerick and Athenry.  Everyone knew this would be a hot spot but services between Athenry and Tuam and Tuam and Sligo will be critical.  Is the Minister of State committed to the entire project from Limerick to Sligo?  Will he convey my concerns to CIE?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>I presume the Senator is not asking me at a personal level.  This forms part of an ambitious project between Limerick and Sligo but I do not think the Government has made a definite commitment in respect of the Sligo end.  That may be a long-term ambition, although one or two Ministers may have made a commitment to it.  I would be misleading the Senator in suggesting the Government as a whole had made such a commitment.  What I said does not represent an unqualified, immediate commitment to phases 2 and 3.</P>
        <P>I have experience of the system elsewhere and timetabling is crucial.  Services can be timetabled in order that a regional or intercity connection is provided or they are of use to commuters.  If we are to make real use of a railway line, it must serve commuters by providing an aid in getting to work.  I do not have details, unlike the Senator, but I would be surprised if there was not a train service arriving in Galway between 8 a.m. and 9 a.m. and leaving Galway between 5 p.m. and 7 p.m.  I am sure there will be a train; I cannot believe they would miss that trick.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>This information was brought to my attention, which is why I am sharing it with the Minister of State.  I refer also to the journey time of one hour and 55 minutes.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
