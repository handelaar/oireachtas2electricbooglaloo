	<P>I have notice from Senator Geraldine Feeney that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Health and Children to clarify the reason an expectant mother with private health insurance can only access a private room in a private hospital and not a private room in a public hospital.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Nicky McFadden of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Health and Children to outline the position in regard to accident and emergency and acute services at Mullingar General Hospital.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Maurice Cummins of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to ensure Mount Sion primary school, Waterford, retains its current teaching complement given the circumstances outlined in the school&rsquo;s appeal to the Department.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Paudie Coffey of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to outline the implications of recent budget cuts on staffing levels in primary schools with specific reference to Mount Sion primary school, Waterford city, which is an inner-city school serving large disadvantaged areas in the city, and the way in which he proposes to assist this school in maintaining adequate staffing resources to meet the needs of its pupils.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  As Senators Cummins&rsquo;s and Coffey&rsquo;s matters are similar, I suggest they share time.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>The Order of Business is No. 1, the Adoption Bill 2009 &mdash; Report Stage (resumed), to be taken at the conclusion of the Order of Business and to adjourn at 7 p.m., if not previously concluded.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>Last week I said we needed a debate on the scheduling of the work of this House for the remainder of the term.  I called for a vote on the matter but, unfortunately, it was defeated.  Today I shall move an amendment to the Order of Business proposing we have such a discussion.  I raise this point because it is extremely important that we ask about the Government&rsquo;s approach to the Seanad.</P>
        <P>I wish to raise some issues.  Previously there was a commitment that one third of all legislation would be initiated in the Seanad.  What are the plans for further legislation?  After all, that is our core job in the House and we are doing it today in respect of the Adoption Bill.</P>
        <P>I raise the issue of Ministers attending this House and how they deal with amendments and the business of the House.  I shall give an example to the Leader and ask him if he is satisfied with the approach highlighted.  We have been discussing the Adoption Bill for a number of days and have had detailed discussion on its content, reflecting the significant concerns abroad.  However, the Minister of State with responsibility for children and young people, Deputy Barry Andrews, has briefed <i>The Irish Times</i> on the detail of the problems he is encountering with the Vietnamese authorities before briefing this House.</P>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I raise, first the disrespect shown to the House; second, the lack of information given to the House; and third, the problems this causes for the many people involved in these adoptions who are greatly concerned about the matter.</P>
        <P>If the Minister of State had brought that information to this House it would have been helpful and we might have discussed it.  None of us wishes to exaggerate the difficulties or cause concern to the people caught up in this process.  That said, we want the debates in this House to be meaningful.  I believe the Minister of State should have briefed the House more fully, and not <i>The Irish Times</i>.</P>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Leader raise that with the Minister and other Ministers when they come to the Seanad?  They must take this House seriously, deal with the issues we raise and respond to the debates and points made on this side of the House.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Some weeks ago we called for a debate on the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA.  Unfortunately, that vote was defeated and it would have been a worthwhile debate, given what we heard last week from Dr. Somers in the Committee of Public Accounts.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.  Well said.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>It is quite clear there should have been a discussion in the House on NAMA.  Many Members of the House have a great deal to say about it.  Fine Gael has a position on the Government&rsquo;s recommendations in this area which we would welcome an opportunity to debate.  That is a debate we need to have which would be very relevant and of enormous concern to many people who are seeking loans from banks and are unable to get them.</P>
        <P>We hear today about &euro;17 million being given to consultants for reports on the HSE.  We have had discussions in the Seanad about the executive.  Can we have clarity from the Government on the future of the HSE?  There was talk about reform.  Where is it at and can we have a debate in the House on it?</P><Col N="461"/>
        <P>I could go on but the essential point is that I want a debate on the business of this House and how it is to be scheduled between now and June.  I would like the points I have raised to be dealt with by the Leader.</P>
        <P>It is very clear from its comments in recent days that the Green Party wants to keep Fianna F&aacute;il in Government, despite the public wanting to see a change in Government.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Subject to review.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>These are critical issues for the public, which we need an opportunity to debate so that we may talk in this House for the remainder of the term about the real issues such as unemployment and the health services.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I second Senator Fitzgerald&rsquo;s proposed amendment because it is important to do so.  In the last three or four sitting days the Leader gave a commitment to 22 different items for debate.  I certainly want to see how the order of this House is set.  Issues have been raised, such as Senator MacSharry&rsquo;s last week or the week before on the need for us to discuss Standing Orders and the way we order the House and do our business.  These are important issues.</P>
        <P>This House is under intense scrutiny.  Members should be mindful of the fact that today in the House of Commons, a man with a solid majority and in a safe position is having to resign.  It is important for people to recognise that we can look at the criticisms made about this House, many of them unfair.  We can talk about the number of days we sat, what we did, votes and all the rest and try to respond in a defensive manner.  That would be a major mistake.  We need to think strategically about this and deal with the big issues.  We should make demands of members of the Government about their commitment to this House and ensure we address the issue of reform.</P>
        <P>The Leader should appreciate that leadership is necessary in the Seanad to bring forward this initiative.  There is no place for any type of so-called cute hoorism.  We have seen and are seeing across the water that a political majority in a democracy may be swept away in a tide of public contempt or disdain, and we need to look at this.  This matter needs to be examined with a certain element of humility and certainly more humility than hubris in terms of defending ourselves.  Fair as well as unfair criticism is being made against us.  We are in public life and we should be accustomed to that.  We can take it and deal with it.  We can deal with each criticism as it arises but this is not the way to do it.  We need to look at the big issues and deal with legislation so that people may see us doing our work.</P>
        <P>The issue of NAMA is important for someone like me who does not take a party position on this.  I can listen to Deputy Richard Bruton and hear the sense of what he has to say.  I can listen to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, and hear the sense of what he has to say.  I can listen to outside commentators and hear the sense of what they have to say.  I am a firm believer that there is rarely one right answer to serious problems.  The Seanad needs to deal with this.  I do not see why the Minister, who is doing fine work on his tour of Europe and on which I compliment him, cannot have a conversation with Members of the Seanad on the pros and cons of NAMA, who will run it and how it will be administered.  I would like to ask Deputy Bruton who will run the banks if we take them over.</P>
        <P>There is a story in today&rsquo;s newspaper to the effect that extra people will have to be employed to run NAMA.  The same, I presume, would happen if we took over the banks.  Who would do these things?  How would these things work?  Where will the shareholders be after this?  How will the risk be managed?</P><Col N="462"/>
        <P>We have a job to do.  We had better do it immediately.  In seconding Senator Fitzgerald&rsquo;s amendment to the Order of Business, I believe NAMA would be a good place to start.  There are 20 items on the Order Paper.  When will we deal with those issues?  If we cannot deal with them we should say so.  The beginning of a week is a good time to deal with these matters.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad the Leader has found time to talk about our overseas development aid programme.  We need to have a discussion on this.  The most recent budget cut a further &euro;100 million off the aid programme.  This was in addition to cuts made in the previous ten months.  In that time, we cut the aid budget by &euro;255 million.  Despite Government promises on the international stage, we will not reach our targets unless the situation changes.</P>
        <P>I have been contacted by representatives of organisations throughout the country, who are very worried about the impact of these cuts, not merely on staff numbers but on programmes.  Last week, Concern said these cuts will lead to the cutting of 500 jobs.  The impact of this will be felt worldwide.  In Angola, for example, 20,000 homes will not receive training in food production.  In Haiti, 6,000 children will not receive education on hygiene issues.  The list goes on.  Throughout the world, people will be affected because of cuts in our aid programme.</P>
        <P>The programme for Government will be reviewed shortly.  I ask the Leader to impress upon the Minister and his Green Party colleagues the importance of looking again at our aid programme and trying to meet the commitments we made not too long ago.</P>
        <P>I agree with Senator O&rsquo;Toole that we can learn lessons from this morning&rsquo;s resignation of the Speaker of the House of Commons.  The Speaker clearly lost the confidence of the people because of the expenses issue.  This House is also in danger of losing the confidence, not merely of the people but also of politicians.  Last week, we had a debate on the adjournment of the House to facilitate a golf match.  This week, a Member of the House said on the radio that votes in the House were a waste of time and a joke, and a D&aacute;il candidate said his party colleagues should consider shutting down the Seanad.  Although some criticisms of the Seanad are valid, some clearly are not.  Nevertheless, confidence in the House is suffering and needs to be addressed.</P>
        <P>One person in this House can introduce legislation to reform the House, namely the Leader.  Until he introduces a programme of reform I suggest that he, like the Speaker of the House of Commons, should consider his position.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>That is unfair.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Senator Ann Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>I note the points raised and I agree with many of them.  The Seanad is under intense scrutiny.  I take umbrage at the suggestion that the Seanad is irrelevant and should be abolished.  The majority of Senators do an excellent job.  They are committed to their work on legislation at all stages.  I reject the suggestion that we are irrelevant.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is up to all of us, particularly the Leader, to review the situation, to make sure legislation comes to the Seanad and that Ministers are available to deal with it.  Otherwise, we might as well go out of existence.  I do not want that to happen.  I have been here for a very long time and feel I have done a very good job.  I speak for myself, as other Senators can speak for themselves.</P>
        <P>I feel vulnerable at this time and I do not know how we will come out of this difficulty.  Let us all work together.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Has Senator Ormonde spoken to her colleagues in Government?</P>

      <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Senator Ann Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>We are all, including Senator Coghlan, capable of doing a good job.  He should stand up and be counted, as we all should.  I have no doubt he will.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator should talk to the Government.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Senator Ann Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>The Seanad must fight for its role.  I want this reform to take place as quickly as possible.  We must show we are relevant, have a role to play and that we know our stuff.  We are professional people when we go out there and discuss issues, whatever the subject matter.  Members in the Seanad and the D&aacute;il are as good as anybody when it comes to speaking on issues.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Senator Ann Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>Let anyone out there deny that or take us on board because I am not in favour of stooping.  I hold my head high and I know I can deliver.  I intend to ensure the Seanad will hold, will be reformed and will be in existence for a very long time to come.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I strongly support the remarks of Senators Fitzgerald and O&rsquo;Toole regarding the role of this House and the scheduling of work and legislation.  As the Leader is aware, there was a time when more than one third of legislation was initiated in this House.  As speakers noted, NAMA is perhaps the most important subject matter with which we could and should deal at the moment.  Very serious and important matters are taking place.  It seems that two of the most important arms of the State are not speaking with the one voice in regard to NAMA.  It was proposed in the supplementary budget speech of the Minister for Finance that NAMA would be under the aegis of the National Treasury Management Agency, yet we now know from its leader, Dr. Somers, that it is outside the loop, when it is supposed to be at the heart of the process.</P>
        <P>We heard Dr. Somers express very serious negative sentiments before the Committee of Public Accounts late last week.  If the Government believes NAMA is the solution, it has a serious job to persuade and reassure the public, which is not of that mind.  It is very serious when Dr. Somers states he has no idea how NAMA will work.  He warned of the legal challenges which, he believes, are imminent.  He has no details of how many staff will be involved and his staff are not geared up.  He states they have no idea how to deal with bank restructuring and that they have not found a solution.  He spoke of significant dilemmas.  They have been taken by surprise.  He stated that the Minister&rsquo;s speech needs to be clarified.  It is amazing that the head of the National Treasury Management Agency states on the record that he only knows what he had read in the newspapers.  Where are we as a State?  This issue must be urgently addressed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>I join others in calling for a debate on NAMA.  We had a good debate during Fine Gael Private Members&rsquo; time the week before last, which gave us all an opportunity to put forward some thoughts on how it should be run.  There is no question that in principle it is the best way out of this situation.  It is ingenious that, with the issue of Government bonds, we will be able to buy the bad debts and those Government bonds can be exchanged for capital in the European Investment Bank.  The principle is ingenious and is the correct one.  I have discussed this with senior members of all parties and Independent Members in this and the other House and I believe that principle is correct.  However, the detail of how it will be done is difficult and unknown.  Our time would be best spent by bringing forward recommendations that should be included in that detail.</P><Col N="464"/>
        <P>While it is not possible always to have a debate on the economy or NAMA, we should use opportunities such as the Order of Business to put forward ideas if we have them.  Then, if appropriate, we could have an economic debate on a weekly basis.  In principle the measure is correct.</P>
        <P>In respect of the contribution at recent committees, it is a credit to the transparency of our political system that we have the privilege of being made aware of everything as it happens through the committees.  Dr. Somers made us aware of the many difficulties he foresees in pulling NAMA together.  I fundamentally believe the principle is correct and I think the international markets believe it is correct.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Is there a turf war going on?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>I also believe the detail will be very difficult.  As Dr. Somers stated, there will be many challenges, including legal challenges.  Just because something is challenging does not mean we should walk away from it.  We should rise to the challenge.  I know we can and will do that and this is what everybody in the Seanad and the D&aacute;il wants to do.  I am confident that if we use our time in these Houses to speak about the ideas we have to improve the detail and ensure it is correct, we will have made a valuable contribution.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the calls for a discussion on NAMA.  It is extremely worrying that Dr. Michael Somers has said he does not know how it will work.  He does not appear to have the staff or resources to deal with the role and appears to be pleading ignorance about it.  That is very worrying from the person supposed to run NAMA.  I would welcome the opportunity to talk on the issue because, on 10 February 2009, as the record will show, I suggested and gave some details of a proposed property management agency similar to NAMA.  It took the Government six weeks to catch up, but it seems to be getting it backwards and wrong.</P>
        <P>We need to be radical and nationalise the banks into one bank of Ireland and create the national property management agency to manage the property resources in the interest of the people.  I explained how that could be dealt with and how any constitutional impediment could be overcome.  However, now I hear it being said the situation will create a goldmine for lawyers.  That is rubbish.  Are the people in control of the State not aware we have an instrument in Seanad &Eacute;ireann whereby two thirds of the Members can pass a resolution referring this to the President, who can refer it to the Supreme Court so that it is proof?  Lawyers would then be wasting their time taking cases.</P>
        <P>The Adoption Bill is important legislation and many of us, including Senators Fitzgerald, Bacik and myself, have worked hard on it.  I do not agree with the trenchant criticism of the Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews.  I read what he said very carefully.  He was circumspect in the D&aacute;il, but he indicated the areas of his concern and the reason he was taking this Bill.  He is displaying a cautious attitude.  I do not see anything that he said in response to a query from <i>The Irish Times</i> that is substantially different or that provides substantial further information to what he put on the record here.  Carol Coulter is a very fine writer and expanded much further, but what she wrote were her views.  She pointed to the fact that both the United States and Sweden had also suspended relations because of the same kind of worries.  Therefore, we cannot blame the Minister of State on that, although we might blame him for other things.</P>
        <P>There has been a campaign of people writing to Members.  I got 200 e-mails.  I replied by circular to these e-mails, some of which were individual e-mails.  Most people replied politely and positively, but I received some very vicious and threatening e-mails I do not appreciate at <Col N="465"/>all.  Nobody will get me on their side through this kind of bullying.  When I said in my reply my secretary spent an inordinate amount of time dealing with the e-mails, I got a reply from a person in Montenotte saying &ldquo;Good luck to your secretary who will be kept busy for the foreseeable future answering all letters and e-mails.&rdquo;  This is an abuse.  People like that discredit their own campaigns.  I wrote back and said my secretary would not be kept busy for the foreseeable future because she had received instructions from me that all such correspondence should go straight, unanswered into the bin.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>Last week I raised an important issue, namely, a worrying situation with regard to the position in which many tenants are finding themselves, where the properties they are renting are being repossessed by the banks from their landlords.  I ask the Leader to arrange an early debate on the housing issue, specifically this issue.</P>
        <P>In the case I raised, after court proceedings, a repossession order and an ejection order, the tenants were the last to find out.  Arising from the attention I brought to the matter and having contacted Brendan Smith and James Barry at the Sheriff&rsquo;s Office and Gartlan Furey, the legal representatives of the Ulster Bank, the bank has now decided to enter into arrangements with the tenants to provide a tenancy agreement for them.  This is one way this House can be extremely influential.  If I did not have parliamentary privilege and did not have this forum in which to raise this issue last week, these people would have been evicted from their house and their possessions thrown on the street.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>As a former Member of the D&aacute;il and a former Minister of State, I find this House a very good forum for debate and for raising important issues on behalf of our 4.2 million people.  I make no apologies to the media or otherwise on the usefulness of this forum.  It is elected by a distinctive electorate who put us here to do a particular task and is clearly and unambiguously included in the Constitution.  Arising from my use of parliamentary privilege last week, it is no longer proposed to evict the young couple I mentioned from their tenancy in Dublin.  I say to anyone who has a problem that it is worth raising it in this forum.  Every Member of this House can and will raise issues pertaining to our electorate and to the people in general.  I am delighted I received a positive response to my representations in this case.  The Cathaoirleach allowed me to raise the matter last week and the Leader agreed to allow a debate on it in due course.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">When I went into a reception centre for immigrants in Waterford city yesterday to canvass those in the building and to advise them of their right to register for voting purposes, I was stopped at the door and advised that a letter had been received from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to the effect that canvassing was prohibited in the reception centre.  It seems that public representatives are not allowed to speak to the people inside and advise them of their rights.  I would like the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to explain why such a letter was sent out.  It is an absolute denial of democracy to prevent people from getting information about their democratic rights.  I said I would raise the matter in the Seanad and I am doing so today.  I hope the Leader of the House will let me know the situation in this regard.</P>
        <P>Fourteen weeks ago, workers at Waterford Crystal learned that their jobs were gone.  It was a devastating blow to the workers, their families and the people of Waterford.  It is absolutely disgraceful that the workers in question have not yet received their statutory redundancy payments.  I ask the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to address this wrong immediately.  This should not have happened to the Waterford Crystal workers.  They have been treated despicably by the Government since this issue first arose.  The least they can expect is to get their entitlements within a reasonable timeframe.  A period of 14 weeks is far too long.  I ask the T&aacute;naiste to address this issue as a matter of urgency.</P><Col N="466"/>
        <P Just="Left">It is regrettable that up to last week, the main Government party was the only party not to have submitted proposals for the reform of the Seanad.  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s suggestion that proposals on Seanad reform will be published at an early stage.  We would welcome a discussion on those proposals.  I hope a number of my party&rsquo;s Seanad reform proposals will be included when the Minister finally addresses this problem.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LarryButler"><NameTxt>Senator Larry Butler</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to highlight the problems being encountered by small businesses when they try to get loans from the banks.  I was glad to learn this morning that Bank of Ireland has made substantial provision for its bad debts over the coming year.  It is important to welcome the decision of the chairman of Bank of Ireland to stand down and to take responsibility for that bank&rsquo;s poor lending arrangements.</P>

	<P>Most of those who made lending decisions in the banks over recent years have gone.</P>

	<P>He is still on the board.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LarryButler"><NameTxt>Senator Larry Butler</NameTxt>
	<P>It is important that they have gone and that a new organisation is being put in place to deal with banking in the future.  Now that we have substantial capitalisation of the major banks, can the Leader arrange for a monthly report on the percentage of lending to small businesses to be submitted to the Minister for Finance?  That would be welcome.  It is important for the directors we have put in place to find out where the lending is going.  They should report to the Minister for Finance on the steps they are taking to ensure the money we have made available to recapitalise the banks is given to this country&rsquo;s small businesses and used for productive purposes.  That is vital.  I welcome what Bank of Ireland has done this morning. The markets have reacted in a significant way to the honest approach that has been taken.  That is what the markets will do if they know the bottom line.</P>

	<P>I agree in general with Senator Fitzgerald that as a matter of principle it is important Ministers make announcements to the Oireachtas and not first to the media, although I take on board what Senator Norris added to her comment.  Undoubtedly what Senators Fitzgerald, O&rsquo;Toole and others have said about the Seanad being under scrutiny is quite right.  We operate in a weak parliamentary system and if people see that our Parliament is weak at a time of crisis, when there is a struggle for resources, they will lose faith in our ability to make a difference.  This applies not only to Seanad&oacute;ir&iacute; but also to most Members of the D&aacute;il.  How often does Government substantially change direction on policy?  There is the occasional backbench revolt which works only because it is rare.  An rud is annamh is iontach.  We need to examine our system to see how when amendments to legislation are suggested they might be given serious consideration.  I am not talking about occasional tweaking but a serious intellectual engagement by Government with proposed ideas.</P>
        <P>We know what happens when changes to the Order of Business are put to a vote.  The Government must give leadership in this area by agreeing to have a debate on a specific date, at a specific time and entering that in a diary, rather than giving a general promise which in many cases comes to nothing.  In the case of the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, there was a debate, thanks to Fine Gael, which is to be commended for that.  I am sure, <Col N="467"/>however, that as the proposal moves forward there will be further calls for debate which should be heard.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I agree with Senator Hannigan and compliment the Fianna F&aacute;il Party on bringing forward the issue of overseas development aid on Private Members' time tomorrow night but we must hear something more than a recital of the Government&rsquo;s achievements in the past.  We will test whether the Government will give us chapter and verse on where the cuts are to be made because that is the critical issue.  We must ensure the cuts are not made <i>pro rata</i> because that could damage the most deserving areas and some seriously good causes.</P>
        <P>We have had very good debates in this House on stem cell research.  Professor Colin McGuckin, a very well-regarded stem cell researcher, called today on the Pat Kenny programme on RTE for a public-private initiative to store umbilical chord blood.  This would be a worthy topic for discussion in this House given that chord blood provides a one in four chance of a blood match for members of a family.  This is becoming more important due to the increased number of inter-racial couples.  Let us prove our worth and discuss such worthy proposals so these issues are properly ventilated not just in the media but in the Oireachtas.</P>

	<P>Many small businesses are having difficulty and the banks primarily are the villain of the piece.  Large businesses, some multinational, however, are using the downturn in the economy to cut wages.  I have raised this issue before.  I know of an individual working eight hours a day who is earning less than &euro;70 a week.  The person carries large responsibility in that employment.  The few lousy cent the person received for travelling from one location to another has been discontinued.  The extra pay on bank holidays and Sundays has been cut and the excuse given is that the company wants to preserve jobs.  Who is that company fooling?  It certainly is not fooling me.  I am gathering evidence on this matter and when I have compiled and completed it to the best of my ability I will present it to the powers that be to take immediate and effective action against those people.  It is bad enough that there is a world recession but when people use the recession to do down the small guy and gal I stand up and say &ldquo;stop&rdquo; because evil prevails when good men and women do nothing.</P>

I hear every day on the doorsteps that people are sick and tired of the fact that the only recipients of money from the Government at present are the banks.  Let us be straight and listen carefully to what Dr. Somers said.  We need no more covering up or pretence.  It is time the Government got it right and listened to all parties on this issue, including the proposal of Deputy Richard Bruton.</P>
        <P>As I speak, there is a mother armed with psychologists&rsquo; reports walking around Galway with her 12 year old autistic son looking for a place for him next September.  She is doing so because the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, has cut classes for those with mild learning difficulties.  The child has no place to go and his condition is too severe for him to enter mainstream education.  His psychologist has said his mother should look for a place for him in first year because he could not tolerate two changes in two consecutive years.  Who is to help this mother right now?</P>

Having campaigned around Dublin Central, it is certainly clear to me that the real concern of people in that constituency and others relates to the problems with the economy and jobs.  They are very fearful about job losses and about their future and that of their children.  This derives mainly from the considerable uncertainty associated with NAMA.  Dr. Michael Somers has really contributed to this debate.  We need a discussion on the issue.  In particular, we need to discuss the potential for NAMA to be challenged by developers.</P>

	<P>I support what Senator Fitzgerald said about an adoption matter.  One Bill on which the Seanad has had a particularly good and robust debate in recent weeks has been the Adoption Bill.  A number of us have been very active in tabling amendments.  The Minister of State has considered them seriously.  I really appreciate his consideration of many of the important amendments tabled by those of us on this side of the House.  While what the Minister of State told <i>The Irish Times</i> in today&rsquo;s interview with Carol Coulter goes beyond what he was certainly hinting to us in last week&rsquo;s debate, he was certainly hinting to us there were difficulties with Vietnam in particular, and that was the real reason for the delay.  However, he did not state the difficulties.  Many of us were sensitive to the fact that he might not have wanted to do so.  However, given that he has stated the difficulties in public in any event, it is a pity we could not have debated them in this House last week.  Irrespective of whether the issues concern the origin of the children, whether their parents have really given them up for adoption or whether they have done so under duress, they are very serious.</P>

We are all very mindful of our own history, in which dreadful things were done to children by way of adoption and adoptions carried out without proper consent.  I would welcome the Minister of State coming to the House to debate this further.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>I, too, support the calls for a debate on NAMA, the proposal for which seems to be half-baked given that those charged with the operation of the agency are unsure of the criteria and terms of reference under which they are expected to work.</P>
        <P>I ask the Leader to extend the debate to include the whole banking system and the manner in which the banks are demanding the mortgage repayments owed to them.  I am aware of a young family who have had their home repossessed.  They made an offer to the bank that they would rent the home from it.  That was not listened to and they were put out on the side of the road.  That is a very sad indictment of the system that has been allowed to develop where young families are becoming homeless on an almost daily basis.</P>
        <P>I draw the attention of the Leader to the area of social welfare.  The thousands of newly unemployed people who are filling the dole offices around the country are being forced to join long queues and are treated in a disgraceful manner.  I appreciate that the staff are overloaded with work, but these people are being sent from Billy to Jack to fill in forms, sent back to their employers who let them go and then back to the dole offices, only to find they might receive no entitlement for months.  These are people with young families who have bills to pay and have no income coming into their homes.  It is degrading and distressing for the individuals involved and their families.  There is major concern about this.  I ask the Leader to bring the Minister for Social and Family Affairs to the House to tell us how she proposes to address these long dole queues and give people back some pride instead of having them degraded in such a humiliating fashion in public areas.  We need to move on.  Let us be positive and give hope to these people.</P>
        <P>The Minister stated in the media yesterday that she will send out thousands of letters to young people aged between 18 and 24 who are on the dole, calling them into State offices to assist them by offering them opportunities for retraining and reskilling.  I welcome that development but I ask that a positive slant be put on the process.  Young people should not be brought in and interrogated or put under further pressure but they should be given hope and assistance through our State agencies and educational bodies.  That is the way forward.  We must give people back some pride because they are being degraded.  I ask the State to step in and I hope the Leader can help in that regard.</P>

I ask that the first thing the Leader does when the Minister gets home is to ask him to come to the House and tell us what he has been doing.  It is a good, interesting and important story.  What the international markets think of us is the most important thing for our prosperity at present.  If we cannot get money from them we are in serious trouble.

	<P>The Seanad has come in for a lot of criticism lately, some of it fair and some of it unfair.  In my experience, this House provides an excellent forum for exposing corruption and incompetence in Government, for scrutinising legislation and raising issues of public concern and public interest.  It has stood the test of time and Irish democracy would be poorer if the Seanad was not to continue its work.</P>
        <P>I support Senator Fitzgerald&rsquo;s call for a debate on the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA.  The Government has been receiving, at a cost of &euro;2 million, professional advice on the guarantee scheme and the recapitalisation of the banks.  Questions have been raised over the establishment of NAMA and how the Government thinks it will work but there have been no answers.  We got an answer from Dr. Michael Somers, however, when he said last week that this was new territory and he was unaware of how it would be set up and operated or how it would interact with the National Treasury Management Agency.  This is an indictment of the Minister for Finance.</P>
        <P>We now find a notice, published by the NTMA and seeking a tender, was carried in the <i>EU Journal</i>.  It was published on 12 May and the deadline for submissions was 25 May, a very brief period.  The tender is for services on the direction of the Minister for Finance, stating that the NTMA wishes to retain banking and financial advisory services to assist in its preparatory work in the establishment of NAMA, including an analysis of eligible assets, development of an appropriate valuation methodology for the assets, associated securities and associated deriva<Col N="471"/>tives, formulating the parameters of and execution methodology for a viability review, and the suitability of the proposed solutions in an Irish context.</P>
        <P>I am only referring to this because Dr. Michael Somers has admitted the NTMA does not know how to go about this.  It is seeking advice and it appears to me that the Minister for Finance does not know because he has subcontracted it to the NTMA.  There should be a debate in this House where the Minister for Finance can explain what is going on.</P>

	<P>I agree with Senator Ross and other colleagues that we should compliment the Minister for Finance on what he has done.  It was a pleasant surprise to hear this morning that our Government bonds have done so well.  I wish the Minister continued success today in Frankfurt and in Milan.  A number of advisers have travelled with him.  Perhaps they would be able to advise him as to how to set up the National Asset Management Agency.  That might encourage him to set out on the right track in that respect.</P>
        <P>I was upset to read today, as I am sure was every other Senator in this House, that &euro;17 million has been spent by the HSE on private consultants.  We have all received letters from parents who have sick children and who have been trying to ensure their children are allowed attend Crumlin hospital.  We have heard that two wards in that hospital are to be shut.  Some of the intensive care unit beds have been closed.  These parents have been told that only children who are to have emergency surgery will be accepted and that elective procedures are to be postponed.  One such procedure is an operation for a child who has only three chambers in their heart.  That operation has been called an elective procedure.  To my mind, an elective procedure is a hip or a knee replacement and not a procedure, the postponing of which will affect the life of a child.  This child will die if they do not have this operation.</P>
        <P>Now we have had the disgusting overspend of Professor Drumm on consultants.  I was outraged to read of that this morning.  A hospital unit in Athlone is funded by the people and no money is available to staff it.  There is an embargo on the recruitment of nurses and various therapists, while Professor Drumm is being allowed continue with this.  I passionately ask the Leader to ensure this is stopped and to find a way to get the Minister, Deputy Harney to listen.  This has to stop.</P>

I am pleased to inform the House that the Fianna F&aacute;il submission in this respect will be made to the Minister concerned within the next seven days.  Our submission is at an advanced stage.  We consulted widely on it with all the Members.  As I have said previously, almost 50% of the membership of this House comprise members of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party.  I have undertaken to consult widely with all colleagues in the group.  Work on the submission is at an advantaged stage.  I am pleased to inform the House, as I did the Minister last week, that we will ensure the submission is forwarded to him within the next seven days.</P>
        <P>I understand the Minister is also at an advanced stage in making up his mind on bringing before this House for our attention and before the Government for its attention a proposal on meaningful Seanad reform.

Such reform will ensure the workings of this House are moved forward into the 21st century in terms of meetings the necessary requirements.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As Seanad colleagues have said, this House has done the State a great service over the years.  It was not the Upper House of the Parliament for a one-liner, as I have often said previously.  Our predecessors worked very hard in it.  I am proud to say that last year 30% of all legislation enacted was initiated in this House and that 1,201 amendments proposed to Bills and legislation were accepted by the Ministers of the day.  This House has sat only two days fewer than the number of days sat by our colleagues in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  To put everything in perspective, there has never been a more productive Seanad in the history of Seanad &Eacute;ireann than this Seanad.  I thank and congratulate colleagues on all sides of the House on their co-operation in making this the hardest working Seanad in this history of the State.  I have served in these Houses for 27 years.</P>
        <P>Regarding legislation that is to come to the House, quite a number of Bills will be brought forward for our attention.  Senators Coghlan and MacSharry have called for the bringing forward of a Bill on everything related to the practice of auctioneering, and that is to be initiated in the House next Thursday.</P>
        <P>Today is the seventh day of deliberation on the Adoption Bill.  I congratulate very many colleagues who have spent many long and hard working hours to assist those who depend on them regarding the urgent issues that are being discussed and debated.  In any parliament, seven days is a large amount of time spent on deliberation, consultation, negotiation and communication with the Minister.  We in this House are proud to be able to assist the families who depend so much on the Adoption Bill by debating it on the floor of the House.</P>

This is about getting the banks to a position where they can start lending to these businesses and this is essential if we are to protect and create further jobs.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Every Member on all sides of this House can agree on that.  There are people here who are far more experienced in the banking world than I am, but I will give the longest amount of time that is required by colleagues to debate NAMA at the earliest opportunity.  Next week we will have the Finance Bill in the House and that may be an opportunity for people to make points.

	<P>Last week, Senator Leyden made a statement to the House which we were all very concerned about.  I congratulate the Senator on bringing it to our attention.  I am pleased to see there was a successful outcome and that there is a humane section in some of the banks regarding the issue that was brought to the attention of the House.  This shows the importance of the House in matters of urgency, which the Senator pointed out.</P>
        <P>Senator Cummins brought to my attention an issue regarding the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and candidates not being allowed to canvass.  This is very serious and I will contact the Office of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform immediately after the Order of Business and will return to the House on Thursday morning with an update.  I thank the Senator for bringing it to the House&rsquo;s attention.  Senator Cummins raised the fact that Waterford Crystal workers have not received their statutory redundancy benefits 14 weeks after they finished work.  This is unacceptable.  I fully agree with the sentiments and I will contact the Minister for an update on the situation in which these unfortunate workers find themselves.</P>
        <P>Senators Butler and Glynn brought to the House&rsquo;s attention the issue of banks lending to small and family sized businesses, banking for the future, and asked for a debate in the presence of the Minister for Finance.  In regard to the investment the Government has made in the banks, Senators Butler asked &mdash; Senator Ross also alluded to this issue &mdash; that the Government publish on a monthly basis the percentage of loans to small, medium and family businesses.  As we all know, those in small businesses give employment to 800,000 people.  That is a very good suggestion and I will pass it on the Minister.</P>
        <P>Senator Mullen welcomed the debate on overseas aid that will take place during Private Members&rsquo; time tomorrow night.  Senators Glynn and Coffey spoke on wage cuts, the elimination of bank holiday pay, small travel allocations for workers and the fact that employers use the downturn as a reason not to give a reasonable day&rsquo;s pay for a hard day&rsquo;s work.  Second Stage of the Finance Bill will be taken here on Thursday, 28 May and that will be an opportunity to point this out to the Minister.  I know Senators will avail of the opportunity to do this.</P>
        <P>Senator Healy Eames raised the issue of the mother and child.  I agree with the Cathaoirleach that if this matter were raised on the Adjournment Debate perhaps an update on this unfortunate, hard-pressed issue could be ascertained in a very speedy way.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>It will affect hundreds of people.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Coffey called for a debate with the Minister for Social and Family Affairs on entitlements and particularly the long wait and queues by unfortunate people for the dole.  The Minister is doing everything she possibly can in her power in this regard.  Yesterday&rsquo;s initiative to retrain and upskill 18 to 24 year olds is essential.  This is another very important issue on which the Minister could come to the House.  The Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Hanafin, is very supportive of coming to the House and I will pursue a debate on this matter in the coming weeks.  Senators Ross, Buttimer and McFadden congratulated the Minister for Finance on his great success in Europe and I have made a commitment on that.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Buttimer inquired about the proposed mid-term review of the programme for Government, the successes and challenges.  I have no difficulty in having that debated in the House, possibly after the Government has deliberated on it over the summer.  On our first or second day back after the summer recess there may be a very good opportunity for an all-day debate when we can express our opinions on this very pressing issue. Regarding Senator Buttimer&rsquo;s comments on party names and logos, as the Senator knows, this is down to the <Col N="475"/>directors of elections for the various parties and I do not want to get involved in that.  I have enough on my plate at present.</P>

    <Title>Adoption Bill 2009: Report Stage (Resumed) and Final Stage. </Title>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 68:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 62, to delete lines 33 to 37 and substitute the following:</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;(2) The High Court, in respect of <i>subsection (1)(b)</i>, in considering the fact that under the law of the state in which an adoption was effected, the adoption has been set aside, revoked, terminated, annulled or otherwise rendered void, shall review the status of the adoption order under the law of this state.  The High Court shall give a direction having regard for the welfare of the child as the first and paramount consideration.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This amendment seeks to substitute a new subsection (2) to section 92.  It relates to the procedure whereby an application may be made to the High Court to correct, amend or make an entry in the register of inter-country adoptions.  The substantive change the amendment would introduce is to provide that the High Court, in any such application, would give its direction having regard for the welfare of the child as the first and paramount consideration.</P>
        <P>This point was raised previously by Senator Fitzgerald in the debate on this Bill.  This is the underlying principle on which the whole Bill must be based.  We spoke earlier on the Order of Business about the Minister of State&rsquo;s comments to <i>The Irish Times</i>, as published in its edition today, in respect of the agreements with Vietnam in particular and the concern that in conducting an agreement with that jurisdiction, matters had come to his attention which meant he was not happy, I understand, in signing off on the agreement.  Certainly, those were matters relating very closely to the welfare of children.</P>
        <P>It is a matter of great concern to all of us to read these reports which I believe go beyond what was said in the House last week.  We were sensitive in our approach in the House last week because we believed there were things the Minister of State could not say about difficulties in the agreement with Vietnam.  What we read in <i>The Irish Times</i> today made it clear to us that particular issues had been raised in respect of fees that apparently are being paid to adoption agencies in Vietnam.  There are issues around consent, potentially the valid consents by birth parents in Vietnam.</P>
        <P>I see the Minister of State shaking his head so I would like to get some clarification from him for the Seanad record as to the exact nature of the concerns about the agreement with <Col N="477"/>Vietnam.  We have all read heart-rending e-mails from prospective adopters in Ireland who, understandably, are deeply distressed about the circumstances in which they find themselves.  In many cases they were in the final stages of having an adoption carried out and indeed understood they had children waiting for them in Vietnam, yet now are no longer in a position to proceed.  This is very distressing both for them and, very importantly, the children in Vietnam.  We need to know the position in respect of the agreement.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The welfare of the child as the first and paramount consideration is what guides us all in this.  It has been raised before in this debate, however, that had we had a constitutional amendment on this, it might have meant there would have been no need to have inserted it in every provision.  Given that we do not have an amendment to the Constitution which provides for that, it is especially important we insert it, where necessary, into provisions in the Bill and that is what Senator Norris and I have sought to do.  At a broader level, when we are looking at the welfare of the child, we need to know the particular issues that have made it difficult to finalise the adoption agreement with Vietnam.  The Minister of State is on the record in saying last week in the Seanad that he has trust in the agency in Vietnam with which Irish couples are dealing, namely, the Helping Hands Adoption and Mediation Agency.  I believe there is only one agency with which prospective Irish adopters are dealing.</P>
        <P>We need some clarity because the report in <i>The Irish Times</i> refers to difficulties in the USA and Sweden and issues raised in those countries.  These go to the core of the welfare of children and raise concerns about this and the position of birth parents in Vietnam.  We need to know the position for Irish prospective adopters and, perhaps more importantly, the position regarding the welfare of the children in Vietnam about whom we are all concerned.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment.  I expect the Minister of State will take the opportunity to put on the record of this House what he told <i>The Irish Times</i>.  The report by Carol Coulter is very good and I have no problem with it.  However, I have difficulty with the fact that the Minister of State was asked in the House on quite a number of occasions whether there were particular difficulties.  The Seanad, I believe, took it in good faith that he was trying to resolve particular difficulties, as I still do.  None the less, there are details in <i>The Irish Times</i> article that he did not put before this House when we were discussing this issue.  He did not confirm that national oversight in Vietnam was one of his concerns.  He did raise the issue of the level of fees paid by parents and where these went.  It is said in <i>The Irish Times</i> the Minister of State would like a closer relationship with the Helping Hands Adoption and Mediation Agency.  I am concerned prospective parents have read about these issues today, and yet the Seanad did not have the opportunity of having a reasonable and detailed discussion about these three issues because the Minister of State did not outline them as being among the difficulties he was having in concluding the agreement with Vietnam.</P>
        <P>Given that we have spent quite a number of days discussing the Adoption Bill in the House, I believe the Minister of State should have outlined those difficulties.  We should have had an opportunity to hear his concerns, as should the prospective parents, so that we might have teased out some of these issues and perhaps made some suggestions.  At least we should have been told that these were the barriers against the Minister of State concluding the agreement.  Everyone involved is very concerned about this and wants what Senators Norris and Bacik have in this amendment, namely, the best interests of the child as the first and paramount consideration.  I shall speak in a moment about the fact that we have not had the amendment to the Constitution on the protection of children&rsquo;s rights.  If that amendment were in place I believe that in some respects we would be having a very different type of Adoption Bill.  Several <Col N="478"/>of the provisions would be different, as the Minister of State has allowed, and I regret that the amendment is not in place prior to our discussion of this Adoption Bill.</P>
        <P>I want to point out the type of things parents are saying and I again ask the Minister of State to clarify the situation.  Perhaps it was not this Minister of State but rather previous incumbents who were negligent in looking at these agreements.  If it has taken so long to get clarity on the Vietnam bilateral agreement, what will happen, for example, to the bilateral agreements with Ethiopia and Russia?  Fine Gael gave the Minister of State an opportunity in an amendment, rejected on Committee Stage and which he might re-examine on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il, to be able to place a report before the Houses of the Oireachtas saying whether it was intended to conclude a particular bilateral agreement, the stage the negotiations were at and highlighting any difficulties.  That would have provided an opportunity to bring such matters to the attention of the Houses, alert Departments as to what needed to be done and the timeframe that would have been necessary.</P>
        <P>This is all concerned with the best interests of the child, which is a key point in this amendment.  A letter in <i>The Irish Times</i> from parents shows the types of questions they are asking:</P>
        <P LI="1">We have all known for the past five years the agreement would run out on May 1st, 2009.  Why was the draft bilateral, promised to the Vietnamese, only sent to them on March 6th 2009?  Why was a delegation, and not Mr. Andrews, himself, only sent to Vietnam in the week beginning April 20th 2008, just a week and a half before the deadline?  This is outrageous and this issue now needs to be addressed by the Government.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I will not quote the whole letter but it goes on to outline the impact this has had.  It may well be since the Minister of State has taken over this brief that he has highlighted this and that the resources of the Department are totally engaged in this respect.  I do not doubt for a minute the good intentions of the officials involved and the hard work they put in, but there are serious questions about whether an adequate timeframe was put in place before the deadline had expired to deal with the issues the Minister of State outlined to <i>The Irish Times</i> today and which he did not outline to this House.  He took the opportunity to make a statement last week and I ask him to do the same today giving the same detail that was given in <i>The Irish Times</i> article and of which we were not made aware during our detailed discussions in the House.  Can these issues be resolved?  The current lack of clarity leaves parents distressed and concerned whether they will be taken out of this limbo.  Given what has happened in recent weeks and whatever negotiations are taking place, can we expect more clarity?  When will the Minister of State go to Vietnam?  How does he plan to deal with this issue?</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister of State back to the House.  This will be our last chance to debate this Bill in the Seanad.  It is important, therefore, that the Minister of State comes clean on this issue so that couples are updated.  I support the amendment but I want to hear how couples will receive information from the Minister of State, given that the Bill will not be discussed in the Seanad after today.</P>
        <P>Will a bilateral agreement be made with Vietnam, will it be in place before the summer recess and when will the Minister of State visit that country?  Last week, he told me privately that he had some concerns about standards in Vietnam.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>I was speaking to the Senator in private.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>In the article in <i>The Irish Times</i> the Minister of State dealt with issues such as national oversight, fees and the Helping Hands agency.  I ask the Minister of State to share his observations with the House.  Why does he discuss these concerns with the <Col N="479"/>legal affairs editor of <i>The Irish Times</i> and not with legislators?  This brings the House into disrepute and puts the Seanad down.</P>
        <P>When we have left the House today, how will couples know what is happening?  How will the Minister of State communicate the day-by-day progress of the bilateral negotiations?  That is what these couples need in the interest of the babies they want to bring into their homes.  Couples need this information.  Where will it be made available to them?  Can we infer from the newspaper article that, because of his concerns, the Minister of State has chosen not to renew the agreement with Vietnam?  If so, why did he not tell the House?  We are all here in the interest of the child.  Why does he put couples through such misery?</P>
        <P>I reiterate my questions.  After today, how will couples know what is happening?  What means will the Minister of State choose to reach them?  Will a bilateral agreement be made with Vietnam and will it be in place before the summer recess?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I apologise to the House for my lateness.  I had a long-standing appointment to meet the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, Deputy Martin Cullen, on two very serious issues.  Senator Ivana Bacik kindly moved my amendment in my absence and there was a useful and interesting discussion on it.</P>
        <P>I hope the Minister of State can make some movement on this issue.  The amendment proposes that where an adoption has been rendered void by the state in which it is to take place, the High Court should review the status of the adoption order under the law of this State and not of any other.  The High Court should then give a direction implementing the welfare of the child.</P>
        <P>Specific arguments regarding the amendment have been made.  I would like to look at the wider context in which the amendment is set.  A significantly large number of people have invested emotionally in this area, embarked on the process but not actually achieved the adoption.  They are, naturally, very anxious.  They are at different stages along the road to adoption and they feel very passionately.  One understands that.  However, we are dealing with the welfare of the child.  If I had to choose &mdash; and it would be a judgment of Solomon &mdash; between the welfare of a child and the emotional needs of a parent, I would have to choose the welfare of the child.  It is for that reason we must listen carefully to what the Minister of State has said.</P>
        <P>This matter has already been raised with regard to the Minister of State&rsquo;s disclosure of material to <i>The Irish Times</i>.  I read the two articles and I remember them reasonably well.  I recall they were both written by Carol Coulter.  In reading one, I deduced that the Minister of State had been contacted by the writer of the article and had responded in a manner not unlike that in which he responded to this House.  I did not see a huge amount of information which was not either placed on the record of the House or could not be drawn by inference from what the Minister of State said.  All went back to the welfare of the child.</P>
        <P>Similar unease has been displayed by two other friendly jurisdictions.  I referred to this matter in the past week but I cannot quite remember where I did so.  It may have been in this House.  Both these jurisdictions, Sweden and the United States, are well disposed to the interests of children.  We are not alone in having these difficulties.</P>
        <P>When we debated the Bill on Wednesday last, I asked the Minister of State if the difficulties were at this end or principally at the Vietnamese end.  In these circumstances, the Minister of State must be a diplomat as well as a legislator.  He would probably not regard it as wise to make a blistering attack on the Vietnamese system while attempting to negotiate an agreement.  The lethargy on the Vietnamese side, if such it be, is not something the Minister of State can control immediately or effectively, beyond using his diplomatic skills.</P><Col N="480"/>
        <P>I understood from the debate on that day that a team from the Department had visited Vietnam three times in recent months.  I had the impression the Minister of State had been on one of those visits.  Apparently, this is not the case but I ask the Minister of State to clarify this point.  If he has not visited Vietnam, now may be the time to go.  He may agree that in the Orient the question of status can be quite important, irrelevant though it ought to be.  The Civil Service is dealing with this matter all the time but a visit by someone of the status of the Minister of State might help to unblock a logjam.</P>
        <P>The matters raised in the newspaper articles, especially the use of fees, have been adverted to by my colleagues.  I do not accuse any Irish people of this, but the article makes an implicit suggestion that there is some degree of unfairness to natural parents who have what they would regard as considerable sums of money dangled in front of them by orphanages.  That is a real and striking human condition.  As the welfare of the child is paramount, should we not consider those circumstances?  Would it not be a humane thing to support such families, see if they wish to stay together and discover why they are giving up children?  People no longer give up children in this environment.  What is so different about Vietnam?</P>

	<P>Those families should also be considered.  As human beings we must ask ourselves why so many children are being given up there but not here and what we can do in the best interests of the children.  I am not at all antagonistic and I understand the human feelings of people in this country who want children, but that is not sufficient.  It must be the welfare of the child.  I say that with the greatest respect to people who wish to adopt and I am quite sure several of them will do so.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State, in his comments to the House, was circumspect in the way in which he dealt with it.  He indicated that he was interested in the rights of the child.  On reflection, every person in the House would recognise the human feelings of adults, people who have a need to have children and particularly people who believe they had been on the path of getting children but then that was very cruelly taken away from them.  All this must be taken into account.  However, the welfare of the children and the circumstances in which they came up for adoption is paramount.</P>
        <P>Let us bear in mind we can all be very pious and sanctimonious here and we can all write and so on and succumb to the sometimes very civilised but sometimes very ignorant and blistering correspondence we receive from people who are desperate to have children.  I do not pull my punches in writing back to the people who are ignorant to me or who tell me that my secretary will spend the rest of her life answering their e-mails or letters.  No she will not and they are going straight into the bin where they belong.  However, how would the House feel if in ten years&rsquo; time a Government report, a statutory inquiry or an international commission were held and things emerged not to the advantage of the children?  How would people feel then?  They might believe we should have been cautious and circumspect.  It is the case that we must respect the feelings of the prospective parents, but we must also bear in mind the welfare of the children as paramount at the end of the day.</P>

	<P>I met representative associations last Friday and we discussed some of the issues that have been raised in the Seanad.  I also spoke to <i>The Irish Times</i> and the matter of fees and consents was mentioned.  We discussed the circumstances in which the Government made a decision last December based on a visit to Vietnam, the report arising from that visit and the circumstances in which the Government would continue with the process of seeking a bilateral agreement with Vietnam.  We were able to make the distinctions between the concerns about such issues as fees, consents etc. that were ventilated by other countries.  We made the distinction in the way adoptions occurred in Ireland and it is very important that one reads that very carefully.</P>
        <P>There is a danger in speaking in public on this very sensitive and emotive issue at this very sensitive and emotive time.  Nevertheless, the Americans compiled a report during the autumn setting out its concerns.  It would have had an influence in our decision not to roll over the existing bilateral agreement at that time.  It would have informed the way we were thinking in the autumn about how to approach this issue.  As Senator Norris correctly stated, at all times one must ensure the welfare of the child is paramount.  We are not on the same sheet on this issue, but the primary importance of the child&rsquo;s rights are always at the top of our considerations.</P>

	<P>I have answered the questions asked.  The distinction is that at the time we were considering this in the autumn, those issues were raised by another jurisdiction.  We were satisfied that we had safeguards in place, which I also underlined and to which I referred in the article that caused such upset.  We have safeguards in place.  I also mentioned that we seek relations with countries with which we have bilateral relations because adoptions would carry on anyway even if we did not have bilateral agreements.  That is the least attractive option as far as I am concerned.  There is a value in having a bilateral agreement in any case.</P><Col N="482"/>
        <P>I meant no offence to the House and I stated time and again that the process of having Committee Stage and Report Stage in the House has been very productive.  It has enhanced my knowledge of this area and the experience of the people who spoke in their professional capacity has been of great assistance to me.</P>
        <P>In respect of travel, I indicated that I will go at the earliest opportunity when I believe it will be useful to the process.  I underlined this point to the associations I met last Friday.  This remains the position and I am ready to go whenever I believe it will be useful to the process.  The underlying point is that the Government remains very anxious to have a bilateral agreement with the Vietnamese Government.</P>
        <P>I refer to the amendment under discussion and the background to the concerns raised.  We have safe and secure adoptions and once an adoption order is made, it is considered safe and secure.  The amendment suggests the High Court would have a review mechanism that would automatically kick in.  It shall review the status of the adoption under the law of this State where it has been annulled in another country.  There is already a right in the Act under section 49(3) for the adoption authority to refer any matter of law to the High Court.  The authority shall refer to the High Court for determination any question in respect of public policy arising with respect to entries in the register of inter-country adoption.  Section 19 states that the first and primary consideration shall be the best interests of children.  These matters are dealt with in the legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I am grateful to the Minister of State for giving a considered response.  Clearly, there are still issues the details of which we are not fully aware.  As I mentioned, we appreciate the sensitivities in this case and that the Minister cannot provide the full picture of what is taking place.  As the Minister remarked, we are all concerned about the welfare of the child, whether in Vietnam or here.  The welfare of the child is the paramount consideration.  We are also conscious of our history in Ireland and the problems in the past with adoption procedures not being robust and not having sufficient safeguards for the birth parents.  We are all very concerned to ensure no birth parents should give up a child for adoption under duress of any form.  This must be foremost in our minds.  We all very much support the principle behind the Bill and the principle enshrined in the Hague conference.  These points are all important.</P>
        <P>I accept the Minister of State&rsquo;s point that the provision to the effect that the welfare of the child is the first and paramount consideration is contained elsewhere, but it is still important that it is contained here.  Neither Senator Norris nor I propose to push the amendment, but we ask the Minister of State to consider whether it could be inserted in a more general provision elsewhere, perhaps in section 92.</P>
        <P>Some of the later amendments relate to the importance of tracing.  We are conscious of that need when talking about ensuring watertight adoption agreements are made with specific countries, that there is no duress and people give consent freely to relinquishing children.  The other side of this is we need to ensure tracing services are in place for children who have been adopted.  Later on they are often caused great distress because they cannot trace their birth parents.  This is one of the reasons we must ensure any agreements we make with other countries are robust and the systems in place in those countries have sufficient safeguards for the birth parents to ensure there is no duress, coercion or undue influence brought to bear on parents placing children for adoption.  We must bear all this in mind while at the same time recognising the distress of the prospective adopters here who are being left in an uncertain position.  However, I do not propose to push the amendment.</P>

        <P FLI="0">There is no provision for the development of post adoption services in the Bill.  The welfare of the child is at the heart of this amendment.  There is a real need for this amendment because there are situations and instances where the provision of post adoption services are vital to the welfare of the child.  I acknowledge the highly emotive aspect of this.  It can be an overwhelming experience to receive a child.  Therefore, the legislation should ensure that services are provided that acknowledge the integration of the child into the society it has come to.  This is important.</P>

	<P>I second the amendment and support it.  I know the Minister of State was angry earlier, but it was patronising to say the contribution of Senator Healy Eames was hysterical.

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>This is an important amendment.  Currently, adoption agencies provide intermediary information and tracing services to birth parents, adopted adults and adoptive families.  The legislation does not provide any legislative basis for this work.  We have had a number of discussions about the changing face of adoption, open adoptions, ongoing contact etc. and the legislation will become out of date quickly if we do not incorporate some of these aspects.  I understand the Minister of State is constrained constitutionally in terms of what he can do with regard to some of these aspects.  However, there is concern with regard to the issue of tracing because there is no legislative basis to provide services that currently operate.</P>
        <P>Many of the agencies working in this area believe the adoption authority, as well as having responsibility for adoption services, should also undertake research projects and activities on adoption and post adoption services.  There will be significant demand in the area of tracing, not just nationally, but internationally.  Therefore, I urge the Minister of State to consider accepting this amendment.  Will he indicate whether the amendment is one he will consider when the legislation goes to the D&aacute;il?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the amendment.  The development of post adoptive services needs a legislative basis.  Like almost everybody in the House, I have been contacted over the years by numerous people who needed to trace relatives, people who had been placed in various well-meaning adoption societies, particularly some of the Church of Ireland ones.  Many societies seem to have dumped their records for some reason or lost them or the agency has closed, with no attempt made to retrieve, preserve or transfer the records to a more sophisticated, mechanised method.  This has the effect of depriving people of a significant part of their emotional heritage and lineage.  Therefore, I support the amendment.</P>
        <P>I do not in any sense challenge the ruling of the Chair; I would not have the temerity to do so.  However, I notice that amendment No. 71 in my name, which proposed adding an additional provision, &ldquo;(<i>d</i>) undertaking or assisting in research project and activities relating to adoption and post adoption services;&rdquo;, has been ruled out of order because it did not arise from Committee proceedings.  If it did not arise from the Committee proceedings, it is a mystery to me how the amendment that survives on the Order Paper did, because it deals with precisely the same area and could not be more germane.  The mind of the Cathaoirleach is a mystery to me.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I feel that as amendment No. 69 was allowed, discussion of amendment No. 71 should also have been allowed.  If the Minister of State proposes to accept the idea of promoting the development of post adoption services, I put it to him &mdash; this shows my ingenuity &mdash; that among the areas that might be developed should be the undertaking of or assisting in research projects and activities related to adoption and post adoption.  That is development.  I am aware of the weight &ldquo;development&rdquo; can carry as a word and it is a word included in both amendments.  Therefore, there should be no constraint whatever on the Minister of State in his response in taking into account the question of research projects and activities relating to adoption, because they are germane and as relevant as the positive amendment we have been discussing.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the amendment.  Post adoption services will increase in importance.  There is a great deal of awareness of the need for adults adopted as children to be able to acquire information about their past, their birth parents and their lineage.  This is true for both national and international adoptions.  Therefore, post adoption services will be of increasing importance.  We have had difficulties in the past where records have been destroyed or gone missing.  This has made the situation difficult and distressing for adopted persons when they find they cannot access the information.  We need to ensure there is a statutory basis for services, to include the tracing services that must be encompassed in any sort of post adoption services.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>Before I speak in support of the amendment I wish to clarify for the Minister of State that I broke no confidence before he did so himself in <i>The Irish Times</i>.  I expect he will respect that.</P>
        <P>I support this amendment on the need to promote the development of post adoption services.  We all support the key issue, the welfare of the child.  If we are serious about the welfare of children being adopted, post adoption services should be put in place.  Otherwise, the circle is not closed.  The child is always at the centre of the assessment process.  The child&rsquo;s needs come first and the needs of the birth mother are second.  Only after these needs are taken care of do the wishes of the adoptive family come into play.  We speak over and over about the welfare of the child as if that is not primary in this jurisdiction.  It is the primary issue.  I know that categorically, having been through an adoption process assessment twice and from having spoken to many other adoptive couples.</P>
        <P>Once a child is placed for adoption, post adoption services will be needed.  One of the post-adoption services that will be critical in future will be the tracing service that may be needed by some people.  Other services may be needed sooner.  I refer to health information, for example.  It is critical we find a way of ensuring that post-adoption services are built into the legislation in some way.  There should not be a breakdown at the point of adoption.  We should complete the circle by ensuring the Bill accounts for the provision of post-adoption services.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>This amendment suggests the adoption authority should be involved in &ldquo;promoting the development of post adoption services&rdquo;.  The use of the word &ldquo;promoting&rdquo; tends to suggest something should be encouraged in some way, for example to ensure it happens.  The use of that word needs to be examined in the first instance.  It has been said many <Col N="485"/>times in this House that the assessment process is a tough one.  Support and information is given to parents during that exhaustive process.  Nobody who has a child in a natural way has to go through such a process.  Supports are available before an adoption occurs.  I have made it clear previously that the protection of the Child Care Act 1991, which applies to any child who is a citizen of this country, is afforded to children when an adoption occurs.  All children are treated in exactly the same way.  That is how adoption is understood in this country.  The psychological, health and child protection needs of a child who is being adopted are catered for under the Child Care Act 1991 in the same way as those of any other child.  We have to underline that point.  It is clear that there should be no distinction between adopted children and other children.  Under this legislation, when an adoption has taken place, the adoption authority and the HSE must be notified of it.  I accept the records of many adoption societies, which were compiled when Ireland was effecting adoptions as a sending state, are gathering dust.  Many of those records are not being well maintained.  I have met representatives of the adopted persons society to see if there is some way of maintaining or centralising such records.  Such a process would attract significant problems, but we are considering it nonetheless.  As I have already said, I will give further consideration to the issue of tracing, which was mentioned in the context of an earlier amendment.  I will reflect further on it when this Bill is being debated in the D&aacute;il.</P>

The Government amendment is proposed to replace references to &ldquo;Medical Practitioners Act 1978&rdquo; with &ldquo;Medical Practitioners Act 2007&rdquo;.  It is a technical amendment that arises because the register of medical practitioners referred to in section 98(3)(<i>d</i>), which was established under section 26 of the Medical Practitioners Act 1978, has been replaced by a new register established under section 43 of the Medical Practitioners Act 2007, as amended by the Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2007.

	<P>Amendments Nos. 80 and 81 are out of order as they involve a potential charge on the Exchequer.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I would be interested in an explanation for this as amendment No. 81 simply states: &ldquo;one shall be a person with direct personal experience of adoption, namely an adopted person&rdquo;.  It is simply a back-up.  The position will be filled and paid anyway.  I am astonished at this.  It defies common sense that the amendment could possibly create a charge on the Exchequer that does not already exist.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I will explain it as follows.  Let us suppose six people are to be appointed to the Seanad at a cost of &euro;50,000 each.  If there is an amendment stating that one of these shall be a Mormon, that could not be held to create a charge on the Exchequer because there is no additional cost.  It is simply qualifying who the person shall be.  With the greatest respect, a Chathaoirligh, I ask for your guidance in this matter because it may well be something I have not seen and the Minister of State&rsquo;s advisers may be able to comment through you or the Minister of State.  It seems to defy logic.  I am not defying the ruling of the Cathaoirleach; I am simply asking if it is possible to have an explanation.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.  The amendment simply states that one of the people shall be something or other.  I have just explained it in terms of six people nominated to the Seanad under legislation, each of which costs &euro;50,000.  If an amendment stated that one of them must be a Roman Catholic or one of them must be from Ulster, that is a qualification but it does not create a charge on the Exchequer.  I do not see how it possibly could.  It could not.  It is just absurd.  If the Cathaoirleach would permit some discussion of this technical point without discussing the amendment, perhaps my colleagues or the Minister of State could comment on it.</P>
      </Speaker>

      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendment No. 80 has been ruled out of order for the same reason.  I ask the Minister of State to consider these amendments when he brings this legislation to the D&aacute;il.  It is general practice now to include in such authorities people who are affected by legislation and to bring their experience on board when key decisions are being taken.  It is important, given the number of people who are adopted and the number experiencing inter-country adoptions, that amendment No. 80 be considered by the Minister of State and that such representatives be included if at all possible.  It may not, as Senator Norris has said, represent any extra cost to the Exchequer.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Where did this ruling come from?  It did not come from the Cathaoirleach; that is a polite fiction.  It must have come from the Department of Finance.  It does not know what it is talking about.  I agree with the point made by Senator Fitzgerald, but whatever the argument about amendment No. 80, which might appear to add additional personnel, mine does not.  It simply adds a qualification.  I really must ask for a proper explanation.  Otherwise the House is being treated with contempt.  Nothing could more clearly illustrate how idiotic it is to have this restriction on the Upper House of the Oireachtas.  I will not even go into the state of the country.  No one in the House, however challenged intellectually, could make a worse hames of the economy, including the Department of Finance.  I do not accept it and I want a ruling to which I can give some assent.  This is absurd.</P>

	<P>Whatever about the issue of a charge on the Exchequer, we are asked to consider the membership on the adoption authority of a person who has been adopted.  It is open to members of Fine Gael and the Labour Party to introduce this amendment in the D&aacute;il.  I do not mean any slight against the Seanad in that regard.  It is not for me to explain the issue of the charge on the Exchequer.  I have given no consideration to that issue.</P>

	<P>I support my colleague Senator Norris on this point.  It is far too easy to rule amendments out of order for reasons that do not stand up.  I do not blame the Minister of State for not being in a position to explain it, but this follows on from an earlier discussion <Col N="489"/>we had about the perceived relevance of the Seanad.  If rulings are to be made that certain amendments are not to be discussed because they are out of order, we need a reason for those decisions.

      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>The key point on this issue is the make-up of the membership of the adoption authority.  There should be at least one person who has been adopted or is a birth parent or adoptive parent.  I do not mind whether there is a net cost.  That is not the issue.  Can the Minister of State assure the House that the authority will have representatives with this unique experience on it?  Any mainstream parent or birth child would not necessarily have such experience.  If the Minister of State could ensure the authority had that type of membership, I would be happy.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DiarmuidWilson"><NameTxt>Senator Diarmuid Wilson</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Senator Norris with regard to this amendment, which is quite sensible.  I ask the Minister of State to consider changing this himself in the D&aacute;il rather than expecting members of the Opposition to put forward amendments.  It is sensible to ask that one member would be a person with direct personal experience of adoption, namely, an adopted person.  Who better than someone who has experienced this process him or herself?  It is quite sensible.  I ask the Minister of State to consider amending the Bill himself in this regard.</P>

	<P>It must go on the record that the Government spokesperson has said it is a good amendment.  He thinks it is correct and that it does not create a charge on the Exchequer, and he has asked the Minister of State to consider the issue.  That is an important point.  In light of this, we need to review our procedures in the House.  I say that with no disrespect to the Cathaoirleach or the staff of the House.  We want to play as vital a role as possible in the parliamentary procedures of this country.</P>

        <P FLI="0" el="5">I had a problem with the Bill as originally drafted because I did not know why members of local authorities were disqualified from the adoption board.

	<P>The proposed amendment would allow local authority members to be eligible for appointment as members of the authority or its committees.

        <P FLI="0" el="5">The International Adoption Association has a view on this.  Under current provisions, any support organisation may be required to become an accredited body, subject to oversight by the Adoption Board.  The association does not condone any practice that would be ill-informed or that would involve a lack of oversight.  We should recognise that it provides invaluable support and education for the adoptive community.  It feels it could be constrained by having to seek and maintain registration.  It is not clear why this incorporation would be required or the extent to which it would be required.  The association feels that any such requirement for registration in respect of non-direct arrangements for adoption could act to undermine democratic advocacy on behalf of the community.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment.  The support groups would find it difficult to continue with the work they are doing currently and would find some of these demands <Col N="491"/>too onerous.  We want high standards and regulation, however, so I would like to hear what the Minister of State has to say about any possible difficulties for advocacy bodies or lobbying groups if this provision remains in the legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FidelmaHealyEames"><NameTxt>Senator Fidelma Healy Eames</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Senator Fitzgerald.  These support and advocacy groups are critical to couples going through the adoption process.

      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>The amendment relates to section 151(1), which states, &ldquo;Without prejudice to the generality of <i>section 150</i>, the Minister shall make such regulations as he or she thinks appropriate for the purpose of ensuring that the activities specified in <i>sections 4 </i>and <i>5 </i>are carried on only by accredited bodies.&rdquo;  We all recognise that accredited bodies play a vital role.  We have all been under pressure as Oireachtas Members on this issue.  All the agencies have helped to keep people up to date in an area where it is difficult to disseminate information because we are negotiating with another jurisdiction.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The purpose of section 151 of the Bill is to enable the Minister to make regulations under the Act.  The purpose of those regulations is to regulate the activities of accredited bodies rather than to promote them.  An accredited body may apply to be registered for the activities related to the making of arrangements for the adoption of a child, including those activities specified in sections 4<i> </i>and 5.</P>

        <P>Amendment put and declared lost.</P>
        <P>Bill, as amended, received for final consideration.</P>
        <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill do now pass.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>This has been a long and detailed debate.  This Bill incorporates into Irish law the 1993 Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption.  Since Ireland ratified that convention, 16 years have elapsed so we have waited a long time for the legislation.  It is important that the Bill brings all aspects of legislation into line with the Hague Convention and brings us closer to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. </P>
        <P>When we are dealing with this area, the legislation before the House is just one aspect of adoption and huge issues arise on the implementation of the legislation, waiting lists for couples and the need for an agency other than the HSE to be involved.  The Minister of State indicated that he would support this.  During the debate we also raised important issues about guardianship, post-adoption services and the need for ongoing support for all involved in the adoption process.</P>
        <P>A key issue that came up in the debate was that of bilateral agreements.  At the conclusion of the debate, we are still in an unsatisfactory position as far as those agreements are concerned.  Fine Gael had suggested a mechanism by which the Minister would have to come back to the D&aacute;il or Seanad six months before the lapse of any bilateral agreement to inform the Houses about progress.  If such a measure had been in place for the Vietnamese situation, there would have been discussion at an earlier point on the issue.  It would have helped the Minister of State and I regret that he did not accept the amendment on that issue.</P>
        <P>This Bill leaves the House with a degree of uncertainty about the bilateral agreements with Vietnam, Ethiopia and Russia.  There is a great deal to be done by the Minister of State and <Col N="492"/>the Department on these agreements, given the inter-country nature of the work.  I hope the Minister of State is given the necessary resources.  I have no doubt that the demand on departmental resources in regard to concluding these agreements is extensive.  I hope progress will be reported on this issue when this legislation goes to the D&aacute;il.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State indicated that he would consider a range of amendments we put forward.  He more or less accepted a number of potential amendments but did not bring forward similar amendments and I regret that.  I am disappointed he did not do so but I hope they will be brought forward when the Bill is taken in the D&aacute;il.  They are useful and their inclusion would strengthen the legislation.</P>
        <P>A number of areas are not addressed in the legislation.  Given that we have had to wait 16 years for this legislation, to some degree, it deals with an era when adoption was dealt with somewhat differently.  The issues about contact, ongoing contact and tracing are not dealt with.  Given the changing face of adoption and the increasing number of inter-country adoptions, these issues will increase.  The fact that there is no legislative base for many of them is problematic and needs to be addressed.  One of the reasons some of these issues could not be addressed during this debate is that the amendment on the rights of the child was not brought forward by the Government.  If it had been, we would be dealing with some provisions of the legislation in a different way.</P>
        <P>I welcome the introduction of this Bill.  I regret more amendments were not accepted during this debate but I acknowledge the willingness of the Minister of State to bring forward such amendments when the Bill is taken in the D&aacute;il and l welcome his response to many of them.</P>
        <P>I regret that the Minister of State briefed <i>The Irish Times</i>  rather than this House on several aspects of the legislation.  We have already had a long discussion on that matter today and I will not repeat it.  There has been much debate recently on reform of this House.  If the Seanad, as well as the D&aacute;il and committees, is to be taken seriously, Opposition amendments must be accepted by the Government.  Senator Wilson spoke in favour of an amendment tabled by this side of the House.  I have had experience of the acceptance of Opposition amendments by some Ministers in committees over the years.  It is a mark of maturity to accept and incorporate in legislation amendments from the other side of the House.  That is what should happen in both Houses.  It strengthens democracy and the work of this House and lends increased credibility to the Houses.</P>
        <P>I look forward to seeing what further amendments the Minister of State will bring forward when the Bill is taken in the D&aacute;il.  I thank his officials for the time, energy and effort they put into preparing this legislation.  I hope they have success in concluding the bilateral agreements, which are of importance to many people and are a cause of great concern and deep emotional upset to families currently caught in this situation.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>With the greatest respect, I challenge the Cathaoirleach&rsquo;s view on that.  I have served here for 21 years and, traditionally, Members spoke, at some moderate length, particularly on an important Bill such as this one.  It would not be appropriate to close such provision and I am glad the Cathaoirleach, in his wisdom, did not do so.</P>
        <P>I welcome this Bill.  I believe everybody would agree that for Ireland finally to be brought into line with the Hague Convention in this respect must be a good measure.  Senator Fitzgerald <Col N="493"/>stated this clearly.  The Minister of State and the Civil Service can be complimented on doing that.  There are divided opinions about other aspects of the Bill.</P>
        <P>We have learned that considerable emotional charges surround this Bill.  This is understandable in a human sense.  In terms of the blunt instrument of a mass e-mail campaign &mdash; I hope the canvassing and lobbying groups will also learn a little bit from this &mdash; it is not intelligent to catch people who are on one&rsquo;s side in friendly fire.  That simply eliminates support or, perhaps, can even negative it.  This mass scattergun approach does not always help politics.  If the approach were more focused, that would help all of us.  I say that as somebody who loves to get a good brief.</P>
        <P>With regard to the Minister of State, I am not sure that there were any huge areas that were not at least stated or implied; I make that point to be positive.  I would like to place on record my gratitude to Carol Coulter for once again writing an absolutely excellent series of articles on this important subject in which she raised significant issues.</P>
        <P>I had to leave the Chamber briefly during which time I managed to put in ear plugs and listen to a contemporaneous debate on RTE Radio 1 on which a number of international experts were discussing this Bill and the Vietnamese situation.  The kinds of phrases used were about buying and selling children and whether this could happen.  This was the concern of the Americans and Swedes.  We would be well advised to take this into consideration.  The Bill presented a good opportunity for us to examine this idea and to make sure this does not happen.</P>
        <P>It should also be placed on record, because it was placed on record over the airwaves for the Irish public, that the Department and the Minister of State were not insensitive to the feelings of people.  A practical, professional approach was taken when Mr. Geoffrey Shannon, the leading authority in this country in this area, was sent, as one of the principal officers of the Department, as a member of a delegation to Vietnam to explore this situation.  That seems to be a proper, professional way to address this issue.  However, it may well be that the visit by a Minister would be helpful because of the way in which these matters are regarded in the Orient, the question of status, saving face and such matters.  I am glad that the Minister of State has given a commitment that he will go there.</P>
        <P>I was glad to take part in this debate and I learned a great deal from it.  There were some exciting amendments, including my own.  I got quite snotty occasionally, but I also learned a good deal from the passionate contributions of others.  It was interesting that many of the most passionate speakers were women.  The contributions were led by Senator Fitzgerald on this side, ably backed by Senator Healy Eames, Senator Bacik on our side, Senator Prendergast of the Labour Party and Senator Mary White of Fianna F&aacute;il.  I felt as in the title of a John McGahern novel &ldquo;Amongst Women&rdquo; and I  was very glad and comfortable to be among women.</P>
        <P>I welcome the passage of this Bill through the House.  It may not be perfect, but legislation rarely is.  Something most interesting occurred during this debate and I say this in a non-contentious way.  Senator Wilson, my good friend, whom I respect greatly, had the honesty to acknowledge that an amendment I put forward was a good one and that in his view &mdash; he was persuaded by the irrefutable logic of what I said &mdash; it did not create a charge on the Exchequer.  In terms of Seanad reform, we need to examine this method of the ruling out of amendments.  I thank my colleagues for informing me and opening my mind in as far as it can be opened.  I thank the Minister of State and his staff for passing what will be a positive step in safeguarding the welfare of children in this country.</P>

My main regret is that at the conclusion of the Bill in the Seanad, the bilateral agreement with Vietnam is not yet sorted.  For anybody involved in adoption this is intensely personal and private and is about the creation of families.  It is important that the Minister, I and everybody here learn much about not letting the bilateral agreements with the Russian Federation and Ethiopia end up in the same place as the one with Vietnam, and I ask the Minister to begin the preparatory work.  The post-placement records with the Russian Federation need to be concluded.  In his final words to the House, the Minister <Col N="495"/>gave an assurance that he will provide regular updates to the adoptive community until the bilateral agreements are sorted.  That would be most helpful.  I look forward to the conclusion of the Bill in the D&aacute;il.</P>

Senator Fitzgerald said it has taken a very long time to get this far.  As I said, the debate in the Seanad has been extremely helpful to me.  It has improved the legislation and widened our knowledge on this constantly developing area.  I, too, regret that the bilateral agreement with Vietnam has not been resolved and I remain committed to resolving it.</P>

      <Speaker pid="GeraldineFeeney"><NameTxt>Senator Geraldine Feeney</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for allowing me to raise this important issue and I thank the Minister for agreeing to take the Adjournment debate.  The matter I want to raise relates to expectant mothers, and the case I will deal with is in the Galway area.  An expectant mother cannot avail of private accommodation in a public hospital unless she has made a private contractual arrangement with a consultant obstetrician, even though she has private health insurance.  I use the phrase &ldquo;expectant mother&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;patient&rdquo; because pregnancy is not an illness.  Everybody will agree it is a confinement, if we want to have a term for it.  It has been brought to my attention that obstetrician-gynaecologists in the Galway area, and further afield, charge a fee of between &euro;2,000 and &euro;3,000 to deliver a baby &mdash; it may be even more in Dublin.  That must be paid by the mother although she pays her private health <Col N="496"/>insurance.  If she does not enter into an arrangement with the obstetrician to deliver her baby, she cannot avail of the private room.</P>
        <P>A survey reported that 50% of expectant mothers would prefer their babies to be delivered by a midwife but avail of a private room after having their babies.  This pilot scheme was carried out in Cavan and Drogheda.  Some 50% of eligible women would choose a midwifery-led service rather than a consultant-led service &mdash; there is a consultant-led service in place.  Similar initiatives in Cork and Dublin also demonstrated a strong demand.  There is evidence in these surveys that 50% of women would prefer their babies to be delivered by a midwife rather than an obstetrician-gynaecologist.</P>
        <P>I am familiar with the Health Act and because of its age it might be a little antiquated in that it did not allow for a public patient to have a private room.  Matters have moved on and women no longer stay in hospital as long after childbirth.  I know of a baby who was born in the Minister&rsquo;s constituency last Saturday and the mother and baby were out of hospital on Sunday.  If one had a normal delivery, one would stay three days in hospital but if one had a caesarian section, one would perhaps stay five days.</P>
        <P>An expectant mother should have a choice.  She should be able to decide that she wants a midwife to deliver her baby and to avail of a private room or that she wants an obstetrician-gynaecologist to deliver her baby and to avail of a private room.  It should not be one or the other.  It is a bit much for consultants to demand that their services should be used in order for a woman to avail of a private room.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>I am taking this Adjournment debate on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney.  I take this opportunity to congratulate Councillor Cormac Devlin on the birth of his first daughter last Saturday.  I believe the Senator was referring to Caoimhe Devlin.</P>
        <P>The Health Acts 1947 to 2008 set out the framework for the provision of public acute hospital services by, and on behalf of, the Health Service Executive.  The principal remit of public acute hospitals, including public maternity hospitals and units, is to provide hospital and maternity services to public patients.</P>
        <P>Any person ordinarily resident in the State is entitled to public hospital services on the basis of full eligibility or limited eligibility.  In the case of maternity services, expectant mothers are entitled to avail of free public hospital services.</P>
        <P>The health system also enables patients to be treated in a public hospital where they opt to be the private patient of a hospital consultant.  However, to protect access for public patients, the legislative framework limits the proportion of private activity which can be undertaken in public hospitals.  One of the Government&rsquo;s central objectives in negotiating the new hospital consultants&rsquo; contract was to improve access for public patients to public hospital services.</P>
        <P>One of the mechanisms used to control private activity in public hospitals is the bed designation system which was introduced in 1991.  Under this system, approximately four out of every five beds are designated for the use of public hospital patients.  The percentage of beds designated as public or private varies somewhat between individual hospitals.  This system allows for private patients requiring immediate admission to be accommodated in a publicly designated bed where no private bed is available.</P><Col N="497"/>
        <P>The proportion of private work which a hospital consultant may undertake is also subject to control.  The new consultant contract arrangements provide for a total prohibition on private practice for consultants holding the type A public-only contract.  Type B holders may undertake private activity in their employing hospital.  Type B and type C holders may undertake private activity off-site.  Approximately 560 of the 1,550 consultants who have accepted the new contract have opted for the public-only contract.  The new arrangements also provide for the enhanced management and strict monitoring of hospital consultants&rsquo; work to ensure the permitted ratio of private activity is not exceeded.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Health and Children is satisfied these new arrangements, with the other measures in place, will ensure greater equity of access for public patients and a proper balance between public and private activity in the public hospital system.</P>
        <P>Where a person wishes to avail of hospital services on a private basis, this is subject to their being under the care of an admitting consultant whose contract permits private practice and to a private bed being available at the time of admission.  In such circumstances, where a private bed is not available, a patient may still be admitted but will not be deemed to be a private patient in respect of hospital accommodation arrangements.</P>
        <P>The Minister asked me to emphasise the Government&rsquo;s commitment to protecting an appropriate proportion of public hospital capacity for public patients.  A consequence of this policy is that, although a private patient may wish to be accommodated in a private bed, it may not be possible to facilitate this in every case.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GeraldineFeeney"><NameTxt>Senator Geraldine Feeney</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State.  I do not believe an expectant mother will be able to get a private bed in a public hospital.  However, it is heartening to note that so many consultants have bought into the public contract rather than the public-private one.  A private patient may not get a private bed, although a consultant who takes on an expectant mother but who is not there for the delivery and the baby is delivered by a midwife still must be paid the fee.  That is a little unfair and is something at which we must look if we are ever amending legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>I raise this important matter because I need clarification from the Minister of State on the downgrading of services at the Midland Regional Hospital Mullingar and, indeed, at the Midland Regional Hospital Portlaoise.  There is a rumour that accident and emergency services at Mullingar hospital will operate from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. and not at weekends.  While it is a rumour, there is no smoke without fire.  Currently, I believe patients for CAT scanning services are being transferred from Portlaoise hospital to Naas General Hospital.  Patients from Longford and the greater Westmeath area will have to travel to the Midland Regional Hospital Tullamore in County Offaly, a hospital with which the Cathaoirleach is very familiar and which provides a great service.  However, it is already catering for a large area of County Offaly.</P>
        <P>In the cutbacks announced in the budget in April, 70 nursing posts have been lost to Mullingar hospital.  The Minister repeatedly said the old, vulnerable and the sick would not be affected by these cutbacks.  On the Order of Business, I referred to a newspaper article on the amount of money spent paying for consultancy services which Professor Drumm, in his wisdom, has brought in.  It is extraordinary that it is sick people who are being affected by these serious cutbacks and not the professionals or administrators who Professor Drumm, in his wisdom, has chosen to employ.</P><Col N="498"/>
        <P>I acknowledge the need for centres of excellence.  However, the Minister of State, coming from Dublin, might not appreciate the need we, at a regional level, have for acute hospitals.  We have accepted the fact cancer services must be provided at a centre of excellence and that there must be the numbers to deliver a good service.  However, I cannot stand over the downgrading of acute and accident and emergency services in Mullingar hospital.  We must provide a safe and good health service for the people of the midlands.  The National Health Service in the UK regrets having closed down so many of the cottage hospitals.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Since being elected, I have spoken in the Seanad on cancer services and on the failure to open a sexual assault unit in Mullingar.  The HSE tried to locate the sexual assault unit in Tullamore even though there are no gynaecological or obstetric services there.  I raised the issue of colposcopy services being moved to Tullamore even though there are no gynaecologic or obstetric services there.  The dermatologist has not been replaced in Mullingar hospital.  Staff, hospital consultants and politicians must always be on guard to ensure services are not withdrawn.  This is not something with which the nurses and doctors who are trying to run an excellent service in Mullingar hospital should have to deal in their daily work.</P>
        <?oasys _cl14.5- ?><P>I thank the Minister of State for taking the time to listen to me and ask him to convey my words to the Minister because I am sure the reply will not cover the issues I have raised.</P>
      
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>I am taking this Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney.  The Government has shown its commitment to the Midland Regional Hospital Mullingar through a series of capital improvements in recent years.  Stage one of the phase 2B capital development at Mullingar commenced in 2006 and is scheduled for completion shortly at a cost of &euro;23 million.  This phase of the project includes the fit-out of the existing ward shells to provide a new paediatric ward, a new day surgery-gynaecology ward, a new obstetric ward and a new medical ward, incorporating an acute stroke unit; refurbishment of the existing paediatric and obstetric wards to provide surgical and medical wards and a palliative care unit; and an extension of the existing facilities to accommodate an interim special care baby unit adjacent to the new paediatric ward.  I am pleased that these works have been completed and the ward areas are now fully operational</P>
        <P>In addition, approval was granted for the refurbishment of two further wards in the existing hospital, namely, medical-surgical and delivery-gynaecology wards.  This work is now completed and the wards are due to be commissioned shortly.  Completion of this phase of the project will see the bed complement increase from 215 to 244 and will enhance the range and level of services provided.</P>
        <P>In terms of activity levels in the current year emergency department presentations at Mullingar regional hospital were down by 7% to the end of March 2009 on the service plan target.  Emergency department admissions were up by 4% against target.  The HSE advises that 89% of those admitted from the emergency department at Mullingar to date in 2009 were admitted to a ward within six hours of the decision to admit having been made and that the remainder were admitted within 12 hours.  It advises that no person waited in excess of 12 hours to be admitted.  This compares very favourably with the performance of some other hospitals which have noticeably longer waiting times for admission from the emergency department.</P>
        <P>Outpatient activity was up considerably on the target for 2009, although in line with activity at the end of March 2008.  However, it should be noted that the target for 2009 had been reduced substantially to promote a reduction in the volume of return visits and to facilitate an <Col N="499"/>increase in the number of new patients seen.  I know the hospital will continue to focus on the best possible quality of care for all its patients.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>This is the reply I have received to all other points I have made in respect of every concern people in Mullingar have concerning services.  Although I acknowledge what the Minister of State and the Minister for Health and Children have said about a great deal of money having been spent, I asked a very direct, straight question to clarify the situation in respect of rumours of a downgrading or closure of accident and emergency facilities during the evenings and at weekends and that was not answered.

      <sTitle>School Staffing.</sTitle>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Andrews, to the House.</P>
        <P>Mount Sion primary school was the first Christian Brothers school founded by Blessed Edmund Ignatius Rice and the people of Waterford and the entire country are rightly very proud of it.  It has provided education for all classes and its commitment to newcomers of ethnic origin is consistent with the work undertaken by its founder.</P>
        <P>The school has appealed against its staffing allocation which, if implemented, will have devastating effects on staff and students alike and will result in the school having to struggle to provide the type of education which we expect and deserve today.  This appeal from Mount Sion is not based on history or sentimentality but on the knowledge that the school is providing a service to a group of children and their parents and guardians that enables them to make real progress.  Theirs is a worthy cause and I ask the Minister of State to make the correct decision and allow this school to continue its good work with the required number of staff.  This school is a beacon for education in the heart of Waterford&rsquo;s inner city and the proposed cuts to its staffing are unfair and unworkable.</P>
        <P>It appears that because in the period 30 September 2008 to 28 November 2008 the school, with 346 pupils, was one pupil short of the prescribed number, it is now to lose a mainstream <Col N="500"/>teacher even though from 1 December 2008 until the present its enrolment is in excess of the prescribed number, 347 pupils.  The projected enrolment figure for September 2009 is 358.  Some 30% of the school population is of newcomer status or ethnic origin.  Given that the school also stands to lose two language support teachers, the increase in class sizes arising from the loss of a mainstream class teacher will reduce learning opportunities for those children whose first language is not English.  Consequently, the extra burden of support placed on the class teacher will be to the detriment of the other children and the class.</P>
        <P>My colleague, Senator Paudie Coffey, will outline other reasons the appeal from this school should be upheld.  I ask the Minister to allow this school to continue to raise the attainment standards of its pupils.  To do this it needs to maintain its full complement of staff.  In the interests of fairness and equity, I ask that this school be afforded the same opportunities that pupils have in similar schools in Waterford city and I hope the Minister of State will provide a positive response to this appeal.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for attending to hear this Adjournment matter which I am glad to share with my colleague, Senator Maurice Cummins.  He has outlined the proud tradition of Mount Sion primary school in the heart of the inner city in Waterford which has provided an essential educational service for the boys of that area for many generations.  The nub of the issue concerns the enrolment figures.  From September to November 2008, as my colleague stated, there were 346 pupils enrolled, just one short of the prescribed number that would allow the school to retain its full complement of mainstream teachers.  A month later, in December 2008, the school had in excess of 347.  The enrolment figures that were returned to the Department contained one too few, but since then the figures have increased.  The enrolment for 2009 is 358 pupils.</P>
        <P>It defies logic that common sense cannot prevail on this occasion.  This is an area in which we can restore faith in politics and politicians.  The Minister of State, Deputy Andrews, is not the Minister for Education and Science but he has responsibility for children and young people and I know he has a deep understanding of the effect that this move to reduce the number of teachers in Mount Sion primary school will have across the range of classes, numbering more than 350 pupils.  This is an occasion where politicians can make a difference and can step in and intervene with the bureaucrats.  If the bureaucrats maintain that these children are to be treated according to the statistics, all of them will suffer because every class in Mount Sion primary school will have more than 30 pupils, and that is unacceptable.  As Senator Cummins noted, a significant percentage of the pupils are non-national in origin.  In addition, the school is disadvantaged and for that reason alone it has many pupils with special educational needs and learning difficulties.  It is important, therefore, that the number of class teachers is kept at a viable level so that all pupils can receive the education they deserve.</P>
        <P>I shall offer one example.  The school turned away two families that wished to enrol their sons in sixth class for this school year.  It did this on the basis that there were already 30 children in the class.  If it had been known these new ratios were to be introduced the school would have enrolled the boys but because it was not, Mount Sion will lose the extra class teacher.</P>
        <P>I appeal to the Minister of State to request the Minister for Education and Science to allow common sense to prevail, to let politics prevail over bureaucracy and statistics and allow Mount Sion school to maintain the number of teachers it has.  They do a marvellous job &mdash; I cannot over-emphasise the job they do &mdash; in inner-city Waterford in a large area of disadvantage in education.  I appeal to the Minister of State and am hopeful he will give me a positive response.  If not, I hope, in his role as Minister of State with responsibility for children and young people, <Col N="501"/>he will take the issue further with the Minister for Education and Science so that this school in inner-city Waterford will receive the support it deserves.</P>

The process has begun with the provision earlier this year of initial information on the allocation of mainstream classroom teachers to primary schools under the revised schedule for 2009-10.</P>
        <P>In terms of the position at individual primary school level, the key factor for determining the level of resources provided by the Department is the pupil enrolment at 30 September 2008.  The annual process of seeking this enrolment data from schools took place in the autumn and the data have since been received and processed in the Department, enabling the commencement of the processes by which teaching resources are allocated to schools for the school year that begins next September.  The Department has written to the primary schools that are projected to have a net loss or gain in classroom teaching posts in September 2009.</P>
        <P>As part of the Minister&rsquo;s efforts to ensure relevant information is openly available to the public, detailed information on the opening position for primary schools is now published on the Department&rsquo;s website.  This provisional list sets out the details on individual schools that, taken collectively, are projected to gain 128 posts and to lose 382 posts, a net reduction of 254.  It is the Minister&rsquo;s intention to have this information updated and ultimately to set out the final position when the allocation processes are completed.</P>
        <P>The final position for any one school will depend on a number of other factors such as additional posts for schools that are developing rapidly and posts allocated as a result of the appeals processes.  The operation of redeployment arrangements also impacts on the final position as a teacher can remain in his or her existing school where a suitable redeployment position does not exist.  The final staffing position for all schools will therefore not be known until the autumn.  At that stage the allocation process will be fully completed for mainstream classroom teachers and appeals to the staffing appeals board will have been considered.</P>
        <P>I understand that the school referred to by the Senators submitted an appeal to the primary staffing appeals board.  The board considered the school&rsquo;s submissions at its meeting on 14 May 2009 and has requested additional information before making its decision.  Following this process the school will be contacted with the outcome of the appeal decision.  The appeal board operates independently of the Department and its decision is final.  I thank the Senators again for providing me with the opportunity to address the House on this matter and to outline the current position.</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister for replying, but again it is a Pontius Pilate act to say the appeals board is an independent body.  As Senator Coffey stated, this is bureaucracy gone mad.  The figures are there to support the appeal and, while I expect that when the appeals board gets the further information it requires it will uphold this appeal, it is unfortunate the Minister could not come in and say Mount Sion is to maintain the same staffing level it had last year in view of the information that has been put before the appeals board.  I am disappointed in that regard but I hope that when the appeals board gets the further information, this will be a <i>fait accompli</i> and Mount Sion will get back its additional teachers.</P>

	<P>I, too, thank the Minister of State for his response.  However, we see the Government every day handing over important decisions such as this to independent bodies, whether they be the HSE, the National Roads Authority or whatever.  At times, it is a requirement to be independent, but I ask the Minister of State to take into account the fact that these are real children, not statistics.  Bureaucracy sometimes can overcome the common sense that should prevail in our communities.  I am sure Mount Sion primary school has already made a very good appeal with all the information the appeals board requires.  I ask the Minister of State, however, to take notice of that appeal and watch the outcome.  I am very hopeful the appeals board will make the right decision based on the information submitted and on the case Senator Cummins and I have made in the Seanad.</P>
        <P>If this appeal outcome is negative in any way, both of us will be back in all our powers to revisit this subject because an appeals board should not be overly bureaucratic.  This is where we can restore faith in politics.  The real facts should mean something.  We have presented some of them today, the Mount Sion board of management will present the full picture to the appeals board and I hope that, based on its merits, the school will retain its full complement of teachers.  If it does not, only the pupils of that disadvantaged area will suffer.  That is not something I can stand over and I shall revisit the matter if that happens.</P>
