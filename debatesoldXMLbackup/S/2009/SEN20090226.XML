      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>The Order of Business is No. 1, all-party motion on the conflict in the Middle East, to be taken at the conclusion of the Order of Business and to conclude not later than 1.30 p.m., spokespersons may speak for 12 minutes and all other Senators for seven minutes; and No. 1<i>a</i> Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Bill 2009 &mdash; Second Stage, to be taken at the conclusion of No. 1, but not before 8 p.m. and to conclude not later than 11 p.m., spokespersons may speak for 15 minutes and all other Senators for eight minutes, and Senators may share time by agreement of the House.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Leader to invite the relevant Minister to the House immediately to address the report in today&rsquo;s media which states that 20 children died in care.  I know from my background that these are the most vulnerable children.  They also can be the most difficult children to mind when they are in care.  The job done by social care workers and assistants looking after these children is incredibly stressful and difficult.  The fact that 20 children died while in the care of the State and there is no official way of inquiring into why this happened or what could have been done to prevent it is wrong.  Official Ireland is incredibly neglectful of children in care.  </P>
        <P>I read recently that a Minister neglected to read a report that he commissioned on child abuse and that is a symptom of the neglect by official Ireland of this section of society.  I have no doubts about the difficulties in minding these children, but they are very vulnerable and we should have a debate immediately in this House on the issue with the relevant Minister in attendance.</P>
        <P>This morning I walked past a picket for the first time in my life as, I am sure, did many Members of this House, even though many of us agree with the concerns of the people who are protesting.  This is another issue that will have to be discussed in detail here tonight.</P>
        <P>We should continue the debate on the economy.  I am not sure how many people in this House feel that we should congratulate Bank of Ireland&rsquo;s decision to take a clone from the board as a successor to Mr. Brian Goggin to resolve the crisis it is in.  It should have looked outside Bank of Ireland to choose a new CEO.  What we are watching in the banking sector and the economy is like a version of &ldquo;car crash TV&rdquo;.  We are watching things falling around us and there is a sense that nobody is in charge or that the people who are doing something are simply protecting their own interests.</P><Col N="148"/>
        <P>This debate must be moved on quickly.  There is an acknowledgement from the public that things are deteriorating faster than we expected, that we probably will have a budget soon after the local elections, that we probably will see an increase in taxation and we will have to see more cuts in the public finances to reduce our level of borrowing in the next couple of years.  I do not yet get the sense of urgency required from Government.  We should ask the Minister for Finance to come into this House and start talking in real terms about what is happening to the economy.  I do not get a sense from the Minister for Finance or the Taoiseach that they are taking on board the concerns about what is happening in the economy.  People may agree or disagree with what Mr. David Begg of ICTU is talking about when he puts forward its ten-point plan, but at least it is a plan.  I do not get a sense from the Government that it is prepared to discuss the economy in that type of detail.</P>
        <P>There is an acceptance that we will have to increase taxes.  What taxes we will increase is a matter for us, at the centre of our democracy, to debate.  There is a belief that there will be more public cutbacks which should also be debated in this House.  Too many people are calling for a so-called &ldquo;national government&rdquo;.  The Opposition is supposed to help out the Government.  I do not get the sense that there is anything to talk about.</P>

	<P>Senator Twomey, without interruption.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no sense that the Government is taking that debate seriously.  If Senator Jim Walsh wants us to listen to his proposals, I would be more than willing to do so but put those proposals on the table.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Our ranks have been depleted this morning.  As Senator Twomey said, it gives none of us any pleasure to walk past people picketing as we come in to do our jobs.  As I said previously, if we are to deal with the serious challenges we face, then no matter how much sympathy we feel with those who believe the measures taken are disproportionate or unfair in some respects, the answer cannot be to strike.  This is a time for solidarity.  As I said previously, compensatory gestures may need to be made in the future whereby the injustices in respect of the measures taken, sometimes in great haste and which are perhaps accidental are incidental, will be rectified.  However, the answer must be for us all to show leadership by showing solidarity.  As I said previously, striking is not the way to go.</P>
        <P>As politicians, we must set an example and start a debate so the people realise that nobody will be exempt from the sacrifices which must be made.  I have asked previously whether anybody should receive a salary which is part or completely funded from public money of more than &euro;150,000 if the situation is as serious as people say it is.  Journalists and presenters in RTE &mdash; celebrities &mdash; are paid a multiple of &euro;150,000 despite the fact there is no obvious place for them to go.  It is not completely in response to the law of the market that they are paid such excessive salaries.  Everything must be looked at.</P>
        <P>We all resent the fact that in Britain a man who oversaw a massive catastrophe in his bank will now retire on &pound;600,000 or so per year.  We need serious, fresh thinking outside the box.  Major sacrifices will have to be made disproportionately at the higher level of income.  However, that does not justify a single strike in the meantime given the challenges we all face.</P>
        <P>A person in authority in the United Nations Fund for Population Activities, speaking at the colloquium held last month in Mexico City, declared that the breakdown of traditional families far from being a crisis was actually a triumph for human rights.  This gentleman, Arie Hoekman, denounced the idea that high rates of divorce and out of wedlock births represent a social crisis <Col N="149"/>claiming instead that they represent the triumph of human rights against patriarchy.  This is the type of ideology which sets itself up against what is good for the human person for the sake of a political goal.  At the same time, a new UK Government report acknowledges the problems associated with the departure from the traditional family model.</P>
        <P>At a time of economic challenge, should we not think and work smarter not harder?  Should we not try to support the family in a particular way because it is the family which will inculcate the values we need to deal with a time of crisis, values of solidarity, self-denial and so on?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Incest and self-abuse.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Senator seeking a debate on that?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.  None of us who supports the traditional family will deny that, tragically and outrageously, there have been occasions when the traditional family has let people down.  However, what we want to do is to promote what works best most of the time for the sake of the most vulnerable people in our society.  We must not be afraid to depart from political correctness and fear of media or of other forces in vindicating that.</P>
        <P>The reason I raise this issue is that our overseas aid budget which has been slashed so dramatically and so unacceptably none the less envisages large sums of money going to that very same organisation, the United Nations Fund for Population Activities.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I read in this morning&rsquo;s newspaper that the constitutionality of a section of the Charities Bill has been called into question.  The section provides that the sale of mass cards shall be unlawful unless an association with a recognised body &mdash; in this case the Catholic Church &mdash; can be shown.  What happens from now on is a matter for the President and the Council of State but I wish to make it quite clear as someone who proposed an amendment to prevent the sale of bogus mass cards and who was very happy to see the Government come forward with a very specific prescriptive amendment to remedy the mischief currently operating, that it is very much in the spirit of the guarantees in Article 44 of the Constitution on the free protection and practice of religion that we would act to protect people in the community from being defrauded.</P>
        <P Just="Left">People who want to give a mass card to somebody at a time of bereavement or illness are entitled to expect that the offering they make is given to a priest who will say a mass.  That would be of interest to people of faith and people who do not have faith because it is a very sensitive issue.  It is a gesture of generosity and it should not be abused by fraudsters.  That is the mischief the legislation seeks to remedy.  I hope we will be able to deal with that mischief in legislation.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="150"/>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Senator Michael McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>Like Senator Twomey, it gave me no pleasure to walk past the picket by the CPSU this morning.  However, I did so in the belief that we were coming into this House to debate the issue.  I hope we will have a good, healthy debate this evening, exchange views with those on the other side of the House and then vote on the legislation.  That is why we are here.</P>
        <P>I refer to the CPSU and the unfairness of the pension levy and the view my party has taken on it.  The pension levy is a pay cut or a tax by any other name.  The Government is legally prohibited from introducing a tax between budgets.  This is the only way it can introduce a pay cut by the back door.</P>
        <P>People accept we all need to put our shoulders to the wheel to ensure the public finances are restored to the levels they were at last year and the year before that.  We all know the pain needs to be shared and that people from a wide cross-section of society need to come together to do that.  However, the social partnership talks are essential to that process.  That model, which was quite good and served this country well during the 1980s, was effectively abandoned by the Government.  The pension levy was introduced at the last minute and could not possibly have been sold to the unions at 2 o&rsquo;clock or 3 o&rsquo;clock in the morning.  I ask the Leader to use his good offices to ensure the voices of the 3,000 members of the Garda Representative Association who protested yesterday and the thousands of members of the CPSU who are protesting today will be heard at some level in Government.</P>
        <P>We are witnessing a seismic realignment of the political landscape.  The core Fianna F&aacute;il vote, as evidenced from the recent opinion poll, is being eaten into because of unpopular decisions.  That may well be what happens when a government is in power for 12 consecutive years.  There may be a level of arrogance which blinds government.  The Government should listen to its own people if it will not listen to the Opposition. Grassroots Fianna F&aacute;il people are up in arms over this as is the ordinary, hard-pressed and hardworking family which is struggling to pay a mortgage used to buy a house, the price of which was overinflated because of the property bubble.  The Government was warned time and again about the property bubble by political leaders, leaders of the trade union movement and economists but they were not listened to.</P>
        <P>I urge that we return to the social partnership model and that the plans to introduce the pension levy be abandoned because of its unfairness.  I hope some element of commonsense will prevail.  It is not good enough for the Government to say it will tweak elements of the legislation.  That is not good enough for the thousands of young garda&iacute;, nurses and teachers, some of whom are being let go because of the announcement by the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, two weeks ago to cut &euro;9 million in the special educational needs area.  At a time of economic difficulty, it is the most vulnerable who should be most protected, but, unfortunately, the Government has gone after the most vulnerable and that is unforgivable.</P>
        <P>The appointment of a successor to Mr. Brian Goggin from the board of the Bank of Ireland, which was announced yesterday, is appalling.  It sends out a message that one of its own is now at the helm of that bank.  Have we learned anything since last September?  Have the banks any idea of how offended people are and how betrayed they feel?  What will take place in this House tonight and tomorrow is nothing short of treason &mdash; it is treason by any name.  It is a pay cut and a levy.  However, we still see the same banking practices and the same people being appointed to senior positions, and that is not good enough.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Two weeks ago I raised the issue of the sports capital programme.  The Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, Deputy Cullen, is the only Minister in Cabinet who is anti-rural Ireland.  He abolished the first-time buyer's grant and increased development charges for one-off rural <Col N="151"/>houses by as much as 400% or 500% and cost people who are building them approximately &euro;10,000.  The same Minister, not to mention the fact that he oversaw the e-voting fiasco that cost &euro;50 million, has now decided to abandon the national sports capital programme.  Two weeks ago I asked the Leader what would become of the money that will be given to the Department from lotto funding.  If the programme does not exist for 2009, what will happen to that funding?</P>
        <P>Is it true that the moneys reaped from the pension levy will go to recapitalise and bail out the banks?  If that is the case, young garda&iacute;, nurses and teachers will pay for 30 years for the greed of capitalist bankers and developers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarkDaly"><NameTxt>Senator Mark Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Senator Mullen on the issue of mass cards.  It is important people receiving mass cards are assured they are genuine.  I hope the President and the Council of State will ensure the legislation is constitutional and that if it contains an error, that that will be rectified.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Since the days of <i>Punch</i> vilifying the great Daniel O&rsquo;Connell, the British media has done very little in the way of serving this nation.  Today on Sky News the media followed that tradition and reported that today&rsquo;s strike was caused due to worker dissatisfaction with the pension levy and mismanagement in Allied Irish Banks.  The reporter compounded the error with regard to the bank by repeating it, when she should of course have referred to mismanagement in Anglo Irish Bank.  I spoke to the editor in London who said that the error will be rectified at 11 a.m., but the damage has been done.  The <i>Financial Times</i> made the same error yesterday.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We all know that Allied Irish Banks is probably one of the best run banks in the country.  It could do better, but it is certainly not Anglo Irish Bank.  Media at home and abroad must be careful to be accurate in their reporting.  I ask the Leader to ensure that if any Member hears such reports, he or she should ensure they are rectified.  This must be done because financial markets react instantaneously to such news.  If they believe Allied Irish Banks is mismanaged, they will act accordingly.  I ask the Leader to raise this matter with the Taoiseach.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Leader organise a broad debate to sum up the many different discussions and themes in which we have engaged in recent months?  I ask him to organise a debate entitled Ireland 2016.  We are approaching a historic anniversary and the Leader should provide a forum that will allow Members to articulate the type of country and society we want when we reach that point.</P>
        <P>I am convinced our country will get through the difficulties it is facing and that our finest days lie ahead.  However, we should take a look at other countries that have got through similar difficulties &mdash; for example, Sweden and how it managed its economy and society in the 1990s.  One thing Sweden had that we lack was a collective vision regarding what the country would be like at the end of its journey.  This meant that people asked to make a sacrifice could see a gain in the future or see how others were making a similar sacrifice.</P>
        <P>The Oireachtas could provide an important discipline for generating that vision.  We face a future that will involve lower public spending, higher taxation and higher unemployment.  If the country is to get through that, it must have a collective vision of a successful future.  This Chamber could provide a superb forum that allows all of us to contribute to that.</P>
        <P>I will conclude by commenting, like my colleagues, on the tough experience many of us had this morning in walking through the pickets.  I believe my role is best served in trying to provide a solution to the issues in here rather than outside.  It is great to see so many others make this same point this morning.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="152"/>
      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I will begin where Senator Donohoe left off.  We passed the pickets on our way in here this morning.  However, rarely a day passes when we do not pass a picket on our way into the House as there are often pickets on important issues.  On the specific issue today, people must realise that, while there is a &euro;2 billion shortfall this year, there is a projected shortfall of many more billion for the coming years.  While the issue today is tough to deal with and implement, we must consider the national interest.  We are here to do that, even though we too face the pension levy.  The issue is as difficult for us as it is for many on the picket lines.  It is only through being here working through the issues and trying to support Government at this difficult time internationally that we will find a path to a better future for the country.</P>
        <P>Will the Leader invite the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment or the Minister for Foreign Affairs, whichever is relevant, to the House to discuss the ongoing threat from the new American Administration, in terms of President Obama&rsquo;s move to try to protect American industries by ensuring that companies do not avail of better tax regimes in other countries?  Putting it simply, Ireland has been the recipient of a staggering amount of American investment.</P>
        <P>I would like the opportunity to discuss the issue with the relevant Minister so that we ensure we lobby and our voices are heard in America with regard to how important American investment is for us.  We should also remind America how important we are for it.  It is not a one-way street and it is important we send a strong message that we welcome what we have received and would welcome further investment.  We also welcome the opportunity for Ireland to invest in America.  We must bring home to the American Administration that it must remain a two-way street and we must lobby confidently and strongly to get that message across, particularly now that legislation is being drafted in America that might threaten our economic situation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Leader arrange for the Minister for Finance to come to the House?  The Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Martin Mansergh, has been to the House for various debates and, while he is a man of great ability, he is not the real McCoy.  We desperately need the Minister for Finance to come and listen to our opinions on various matters, not just the Bill we will discuss tonight, for which he may be in the House.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>Last night when the Fine Gael motion on banking was being debated, the Minister of State was in attendance for all of it and that has been the tendency.  It is indicative of the fact we are not being listened to that, while the motion on banking was being debated and promises and aspirations for a new dawn in banking were being made, at that same moment, at 6 p.m. last night, the appointment of the new chief executive of the Bank of Ireland was being announced.  This is possibly the most disgraceful appointment in the business world in living memory partly because it was a political, national and commercial imperative that Bank of Ireland did not appoint an insider.  It was a devastating blow to those who wished to revive the fortunes and morale of and confidence in the banks when this man was appointed.  This is no reflection on him.  He is an insider.</P>
        <P>Let me state this to the Leader.  The appointment was made not by the Minister but by exactly the same cabal of people who made prior appointments in the Bank of Ireland.  The chairman was the governor of the Bank of Ireland.  The governor rang the Minister to keep him in touch with what was going on and told him that this was the best appointment and they were going to appoint him.  This is a terrible blow to those of us who wish to see confidence in banking restored.  Mr. Goggin is gone and Mr. Boucher, son of Brian, is appointed.</P>

      </Speaker><Col N="153"/>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>I apologise, but the new man is son of Brian.  He is almost a duplicate or a clone who will implement similar policies and who is deeply imbedded not only in the banking culture but in the Bank of Ireland culture.</P>
        <P>It was even more devastating to read <i>The Irish Times</i> this morning and see my view confirmed that the new chief executive oversaw the growth of the bank&rsquo;s Irish development and land bank loans to &euro;7.1 billion.  In other words, the man being put in place is the same one who is partly responsible for and who endorsed from the board those toxic loans which have devastated the country and have left the economy in bits.  I beg the Leader to bring the Minister for Finance to the House to hear what we have to say about this&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;because he has got an input into this.  He has two members on the board.  Were they asleep or were they doing his bidding?  If they were doing his bidding, the Government might as well give up imposing a new culture on the banks.  This is the alarming lesson we have from this appointment.  We are going absolutely nowhere if this type of thing continues.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I share the discomfort of other Members with regard to passing the picket this morning of the Civil Public and Services Union.  We have a responsibility to be in the House.  This is not an all-out strike.  I am a member of SIPTU and no instructions were received from other unions not to pass the picket.  The staff on duty were aware of this and were very conscious and understanding of our position because we have a responsibility to be and speak in this House.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, could not be here last night because the Bill was going through the other House.  He was on duty all day and I appreciate that.  Will the Leader organise a discussion on the timely intervention and interesting ideas put forward by the former Taoiseach, Garret FitzGerald, on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; this morning?  He appealed to all parties, particularly his former party, to adopt a more constructive approach on the national finances.  It would be worthwhile to have a discussion on the difficulties facing the country and I ask the Leader for such a debate as early as possible and to invite the Minister for Finance.</P>
        <P>I was in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann in 1981 when Garret FitzGerald&rsquo;s Minister for Finance, John Bruton, brought forward the most unlikely tax on children&rsquo;s shoes.  I hope something more innovative&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>We all wish to see matters coming right quickly in the banking sector.  What say, if any, did the Government have on the appointment of the new man in the Bank of Ireland?  We were given to understand that through the appointment of the public interest directors, of which there are two with others to be appointed, we would have a say in this.  The problem is the growth of the wonky loan books they have.  Here we have the man who directed the growth of that loan book within that institution being appointed to the top job.  I have no doubt he is an excellent banker but what kind of signal are we sending out?</P>
        <P>The Financial Regulator has discovered the breach of market abuse regulations at Anglo Irish Bank.  Surely this could have been discovered, and perhaps was discovered, by that office prior to now.  What did they do and when did they know?  This has not been revealed.  Here we have the Financial Regulator seeming to arrive at the scene of the crime, breathless so to speak, after all the main players are off the pitch.  Is this a ruse or a distraction designed to serve some other purpose?</P>
        <P>Will the Leader confirm to the House whether the powers of the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement are wide enough to investigate all financial institutions?  Specifically, I have in mind building societies because of the concealment that went on with regard to Irish Nationwide and how it provided assistance and temporary cover for massive loans to keep them off audited accounts.  The Director of Corporate Enforcement is doing an excellent job and I hope he has enough staff, which was a problem in the past.  I have the utmost faith <Col N="155"/>and confidence in the office however I do not think it has the power in law to go near a building society.</P>
        <P>I agree with the comments and sentiments of all other Senators with regard to the picket outside the gate.  We are in here to do our job honestly and honourably and this is what we are doing.  I have total sympathy for them also because the Government could not have meant to hit &mdash; I hope it did not and that it will be tweaked &mdash; people on salaries as low as some of those people are on.</P>

	<P>We, the political class, have no moral authority unless we give leadership.  If we find it uncomfortable to pass a civilised picket like that of the Civil Public and Services Union this morning, how will we cope with the much less civilised pickets we will face before this terrible time is over in Ireland?  Before Christmas I predicted there would be 500,000 unemployed.  I called for a state of emergency, a national Government and national consensus.  I repeat all these calls.</P>
        <P>I sat in on the debates on the pensions levy in this House and the D&aacute;il yesterday.  The debates have an unreal and phony feel; it is like the phony war of 1939 &mdash; the Molotov-Ribbentrop plan.  The war has not even started.  Already the cries are going up that we should not make it worse than it is and that we should think of our international reputation.  The mistake we made from the beginning was not telling the truth to the people or stating how bad it is.  Nothing frightens the international markets as much as a country lying about its economic condition.  What reassures them is an admission that we are in a terrible place and dealing with it.</P>
        <P>I deplore the remarks of Senator Leyden on Mr. John Bruton.  What we need is the kind of the steel shown by politicians of both main parties, men like Lemass, John Bruton and Paddy Cooney.  It is some of this kind of steel we will need before this period is over.</P>
        <P>I deplore and condemn An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for marching the streets of Dublin.  The garda&iacute; do not just comprise any group in society but are role models for our people.  They have no business being on the streets at a difficult time of incipient civil unrest like this.  We politicians, the political class, the garda&iacute; and responsible people in society have an obligation to stand firm and stop posturing.  We are not Quakers and cannot be friends to all and enemies to none.  Far too many politicians in both Houses are behaving as if they were Quakers.  We will have to toughen up and be ready to take the harsh measures, and we will have to lead from the front.  We should start taking cuts and index them to the continuing cuts because there will be more in the public and private sectors.  It is time we toughened up and took as a role model the Chief of Staff of the Irish Defence Forces, Lieutenant Dermot Earley, who told his men some days ago that they would do their duty in the event of public unrest and public striking.  We should do the same.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to move an amendment to the Order of Business such that we can take No. 24, motion No. 33, today in addition to No. 1.  It is a call for a rolling debate on the economy.  It is perfectly obvious once again that this is principally what we are discussing.</P><Col N="156"/>
        <P>Before I say a few words on the economy, I would like to raise another related matter, that is, the closure of a number of facilities nationally using health and safety and governance issues as a mask to do in those facilities for the most vulnerable people.  Senator Twomey rightly stated 20 children died while in the care of the State.  Nobody I know of died in an old people&rsquo;s home from neglect or abuse.  We raised in the House the matter of the closure of Bethany House.  We were given very equivocal answers and there was supposed to be a meeting about it.  Some of those affected are effectively being sentenced to death because they will be put into hospital beds, to which they will be confined.  We know their lives will be shortened.  What is being used as an excuse is flaking paint and the odd dripping trap.</P>
        <P>The same is the case with another home that is being closed.  Today we read about the closure of Clonturk House for the blind in north Dublin.  The closure is being masked as necessary on grounds of health and safety but some of the residents have lived in the home for 60 years.  The residents will be disturbed and put out.  Behind this there is a property deal.  It worries me that health and safety and good governance issues can be used in some instances by people who would not recognise such issues if they came and sat on top of their heads, in order to evict vulnerable people.  That is absolutely wrong.</P>
        <P>With regard to the economy, where was the Department of Finance?  Was it asleep at the wheel?  Did nobody predict any of the events that are occurring?  I have lunch with a friend of mine who is a bank manager, a nephew of the writer James Joyce.  He used to ask regularly how is it that the Department of Finance is getting the figures wrong all the time, including estimates for income, tax and expenditure.  Did it not notice what was coming down the tracks?  Who are the top people in the Department and what are they doing?</P>
        <P>It is insane to be promoting people who are apparently implicated in the colossal failure of a bank.  However, this is nothing new.  Five years ago, I spoke in this House about the rewards for failure.  When people made a complete hames of British companies, they were got rid of but they got &pound;1.5 million as a result.  This is happening again and this is why I am calling for a rolling debate on the economy.</P>
        <P>Let us not kid ourselves that there will be any great exercise in democracy tonight.  Not a single amendment will be accepted and the Bill will be guillotined, as it was in the other House.  This is what is wrong: we are tinkering at the edges.  I agree with Senator Harris that this is a national emergency and we need to confront it solidly, head on and with a coherent strategy.</P>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>That, undoubtedly, involves a budget.  We should have one within the next month and we should address the tax issue.</P>
        <P>I am blistered with e-mails from people pointing out the anomalies, inequities and injustices that have alienated the people.  They are asking for a tax and stating they will pay it if everybody does.  The super-rich, in particular, should be targeted, and we in the House should be targeted also because we are comfortable here.  There should not be tinkering with legislation that we are not even allowed to amend.</P>
        <P>I listened to the interview this morning with respect.  The former Taoiseach, Dr. FitzGerald, was a most distinguished politician.  He did encounter a few banana skins and presided over a Government that came down because of an unwise tax proposal that was not sold to the people.  He had his personal debt expunged by a particular bank and recently retired from a hedge fund.  Let us have a debate on hedge funds.  I spoke with a friend and financial advisor yesterday at lunchtime and asked him to explain hedge funds.  He said the process involved is like putting <Col N="157"/>a bet against a football team, which would actually damage the prospects of that football team.  That is a kind of national treason also.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I would be very much in favour of a real debate on the economy.  Let us have all the facts.  I never heard of the new CEO of the Bank of Ireland until this morning.  We are not even allowed to know how much he is getting.  That is astonishing to me and provocative to people.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I regret the cutbacks to overseas development aid.  They were probably unnecessary because the budget contracts income.  We were giving a percentage, which is naturally contracting in any case.  I would have been happy to leave it at that.  That would have meant that ordinary people would not feel that their money was being splashed around and we would have been giving a proportion that we could afford.  The figure should remain as a percentage.</P>
        <P>I am extremely glad the UN Population Fund is being supported by the Government.  Long may this continue.  It is talking sense about population, which is the biggest problem this planet has ever faced.  We should have some moral leadership in this regard.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Yesterday morning I was coming to Leinster House via a different route and at a different hour from usual.  I was coming through D&uacute;n Laoghaire at 9 a.m. and saw a queue along the main street.  I asked why it was there at that hour and when I proceeded further I noticed it was a queue for the social welfare office.  People in D&uacute;n Laoghaire were queuing up for the dole.  This really struck home given that they were queuing in an economically well-off area.</P>
        <P>As a politician, I am an action woman.  I do not just philosophise but get up and do things.  I want to talk this morning about action.  The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment should address urgently the issue of prompt payment to companies.  Cash flow and credit are the lifeblood of companies and when the cash flow is cut off from companies, they die and people lose their jobs.  I am here as a politician.  I was nominated by the Irish Exporters Association because of my co-creation with Connie Doody of a company that now employs 200 people in Navan.</P>

      </Speaker><Col N="158"/>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>Prompt payment is a huge issue.  There is no doubt there is an economic and financial crisis and there are many impacts locally.  Behind the headlines hundreds of companies are being deprived of prompt payment by major companies and in many cases by State and semi-State companies.  I have received information from ISME that suppliers are waiting on average 68 days to get payment for the goods and services they provide and, in many cases, it is the State and semi-State companies that are at fault.  It has never been the case that companies had to wait 68 days for payment.  We introduced prompt payment legislation in 1997 and in 2002 the European Union introduced regulations to ensure payments were made within 30 days.  Companies, however, are contracting out of the legislation and regulations.  I call on the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to introduce legislation to provide for mandatory payment of invoices by all companies, State, semi-State and private, within 30 days.  If companies are deprived of cash flow and they are not paid for their services that adds to their day-to-day running costs.</P>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and if I were Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment I would demand that companies, including State and semi-State companies, pay their suppliers on time.  According to anecdotal evidence, State companies are re-invoicing companies after approximately 30 or 40 days, which creates another delay.  That is a hidden crime.</P>

The people who are outside the gates of Leinster House today, the people who marched last Saturday and those who are agitated all over the country are not agitated or marching because they do not believe there is a problem.  They know there is a problem and a need for cutbacks, but what offends them is the lack of fairness.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I formally second the proposition by Senator Norris that we amend Standing Orders to have a rolling debate on the economy every day for an hour.  It is not fair that we have not got to the tax exiles or the people with exorbitant salaries and bonuses.  It is not fair that we have not got to those with privilege and wealth.  If the Government starts with privilege, wealth and those at the top, it would be acceptable.  Then we would have the national consensus Senator Harris correctly identified that we need.  We cannot have that consensus predicated on unfairness, a lack of philosophy or direction.  I put it to the Leader that we should have a rolling debate&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>That is all right.  I listened to the comments of many speakers and it is evident we are still on the blame game.  I want to get away from that.  Of course we have to blame the banks and the Financial Regulator who misrepresented the solvency of the bank.  They have damaged the reputation of this country but let us get away from that.  I would welcome an ongoing debate on the economy where the points raised by many speakers could be discussed at length.</P>
        <P>I do not know what fairness is anymore.  I do not understand the word &ldquo;fair&rdquo; because it keeps changing with the mood of whatever new statement comes out.  It changes by the day.  I do not believe for a minute that the Opposition would call any budget that is introduced fair, because that is in our nature.  It will not be fair because the Opposition will want to object to it in some way.  Let us get that phoniness out of the way.</P>
        <P>I spoke previously about the need for an ongoing debate on societal change &mdash; Senator Donohoe referred to the matter again this morning.  Society and work are changing.  I spoke this morning to a lady who is now working a three-day week.  I asked her how she is spending the other two days and she explained that she intends to help a very ill neighbour who lives down the road.  What a lovely concept is coming out of this difficulty.  Perhaps it is time for us to look at society.  No matter what area of life a person is in, he or she has pain and we should work together.  That is all I ask.  I do not want any more negativity, which is prevalent.  We must try to bring hope.  Everybody has different concepts of how the future will shape up but let us try to work it out together.</P>
        <P>I agree totally that we should have an ongoing discussion on the economy.  I agree that there is a need to tease out and have further discussion on many points raised by Senator O&rsquo;Reilly.</P><Col N="160"/>

      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not sure it is particularly responsible of us to talk about the appointment of the chief executive of one of our important banks, especially when we do not know anything about the man.  I certainly do not know whether he is the right man for the job, but I have not seen any argument proffered by the other side except that it would be better to have somebody from the outside.  I would like to hear of a bank anywhere in the world that is not in financial difficulties or in bad straits.  I am not sure that one can source somebody from a bank that is in a healthy state and that made all the right policy decisions to avoid the current global financial crisis.  We must be measured in the way we treat this issue because what we say can be taken on board by people outside and that sets a tone that could undermine somebody who may well turn out to be a very good chief executive of the bank.  I do not know, but it is up to the people who run the banks to make that decision.  We need to get back to that rather than be so judgmental and pretend that we are experts in every field when that is not the case.</P>
        <P>Concern has been expressed in different quarters about the people on picket duty outside the gates of Leinster House, but I do not share that concern.  I am one of the people who is affected by the levy.  I do not like it but I accept that it is necessary.  I accept that it is probably insufficient and inadequate to address the extreme fiscal position in this country.  My concern is with the people who are unemployed, some of whom may not be paid today or tomorrow because people have chosen to go on strike rather than work.  My concerns are also with those people in the private sector who are worried about whether they will have a job next month or in six or 12 months.</P>
        <P>I have tabled a motion regarding the legal profession.  Not many Opposition Members will stand up and purport to be on the side of the underprivileged and tackle the privileged.  A number of my colleagues said they will support the motion and I ask Opposition Senators to do so as well.  I told Senator Twomey that I am prepared to sign a motion if he and Senator Kelly will table it regarding the exorbitant consultants&rsquo; fees and the unsustainable wages they will be paid.  It is wrong and it was a bad decision, which needs to be reversed.  We all need to get real about this and I am appealing to everyone to do this in a cohesive, cross-party way in order that we send a signal that greed and selfishness in society must stop and that we must move towards supporting each other and towards community trust if we are to solve this problem.  That is the solidarity and realism we need and we do not need people in unions on gross, exorbitant salaries who are protecting those salaries rather than the people they purport to represent because this is where they see a vulnerability.</P>

	<P>This issue is about fairness and not about public versus private sector workers, as has been stated by Senators McCarthy, Norris and O&rsquo;Reilly.  It is about whether people are paying their fair share and the workers outside Leinster House are representative of the least well-off sectors of our society.  It is vital that we take them along with us but we will not do so in the current strife unless they can see an element of transparency and fairness in what everybody is being asked to pay.  Pitting public service and private sector workers against each other is not on.  We are all aware of job losses and we regret every job loss because of the impact that has on communities.  This is all about fairness and marching ahead together to better times.</P>
        <P>I compliment Senator Mary White on her suggestion to ensure Departments pay on time.  I have a related concern, which I would like the Leader to address.  Companies, unfortunately, have had to make redundancy payments.  The Government says it will pay its contribution to such payments within eight weeks but officials are miles behind because they are snowed under with requests for tax relief on redundancy claims.  This, in turn, makes companies less sure of their finances and more people are being made redundant because of cash flow issues.  It is important not only to ensure the Government pays on time for the work done by private sector companies, but also that requests for tax relief on redundancy payments are processed as quickly as possible.  Will the Leader bring that to the attention of the Minister for Finance?</P>

      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek the agreement of the House to call the Minister for Finance at 10.50 p.m. to respond to contributions on Second Stage of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Bill.  I forgot to include that in my earlier proposal.</P>
        <P>Senators Twomey, Mullen and Norris called on the Minister for Health and Children to come to the House to discuss the report in the media that 20 children have died in the care of the State.  This is an alarming statistic and I have no difficulty setting time aside for this.  I would like to know more about the difficulties organisations representing the blind are experiencing, which was raised by Senator Norris.  The National Council for the Blind is my favourite charity and the Taoiseach is very supportive of this organisation.  Not having one&rsquo;s sight is one of the greatest difficulties one can experience in life and I would like to do whatever I can in this regard.  If a debate is needed to assist this organisation, I will be only too pleased to seek the support of colleagues for it to take place.</P>
        <P>Senators Twomey, Mullen, McCarthy, Daly, Donohoe, Keaveney, Leyden, Coghlan, Harris, Norris, Reilly, Ormonde, Walsh and Hannigan expressed their views on the economy and called for a debate on it.  Since the House resumed last September, we have had a debate on the economy or banking every week.  Last night, we had a debate on banking and tonight we will debate Second Stage of legislation relating to the economy and banking while the remaining Stages will be debated all day tomorrow.  I have always sought the support of the Minister for Finance and the Minister of State at the Department of Finance to come to the House in order that Senators can make their views known.  In fairness to the Minister, he was in the D&aacute;il, as Senator Leyden said, to take Committee and Remaining Stages of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Bill all day yesterday and it was impossible for him to be in two places at the one time.  The Minister of State attended the House and he listened to all the contributions.  He has relayed the views of Members to the Government every time he has attended the House.</P><Col N="162"/>
        <P>It is not a pleasure to see working colleagues of ours picketing and I wish everyone well.  Every man, woman and child in Ireland looks forward to the day everyone returns to the social partnership table.  Colleagues have stated the Government did not give the deliberations long enough.  A lengthy period of five weeks was provided but we do not have the luxury of time, which is running out quickly, and that is why legislation is before the House late tonight and all day tomorrow.  Many colleagues in public life have outlined the difficulties being experienced, as did a former Taoiseach on radio earlier.  He stated it was twice as bad now as the challenge he faced in 1981.  One must listen to this man because he was the last leader of Fine Gael to get a mandate from the people 27 years ago.  We must listen when a person gets a mandate and I listened attentively to his comments and took them on board.</P>
        <P>I look forward to social partnership resuming because it is the cornerstone on which we built the economy and we will rebuild it.  As President Barack Obama said, when the depth of the problem is understood, the master plan can be put in place and we are starting to see that happen.  I refer to a number of facts because some people may misunderstand that 38% of our working population do not pay income tax and 50% of all income tax is paid by 6.5% of taxpayers.  When people say everyone must make a contribution, it is the same for everyone on this occasion.  With regard to the various welfare payments provided to those who need them when they become unemployed, fall ill or find themselves in unfortunate circumstances, Ireland has never been found wanting.  We are one of the world leaders in looking after the underprivileged and social welfare recipients.  We are proud of that and we make no apologies to anyone for it.  The problem currently is unprecedented and global and until the economies of America and our nearest neighbour, the UK, become buoyant again, our economy will face a serious challenge for, perhaps, one or two years.</P>
        <P>As I said, I look forward to a return to social partnership.  From the Government&rsquo;s point of view, it is gratifying to work in the partnership process with Mr. David Begg, who we all admire and who has the admiration and trust of the people.  I look forward to taking part in the near future.</P>
        <P>Senator Mullen referred to the Charities Bill and the issue of genuine, sincere people who purchase mass cards to take to removals and funerals and to have masses said for their dearly departed friends and relatives.  People&rsquo;s trust must be protected by the State.  If another amendment must be made, let us re-introduce the Bill and do so.</P>

        <P>There will be a 10% reduction in the amount of overseas aid, but we must borrow 90% of it in total.  Given the sincerity and commitment of the people, we have never been found wanting in our provision of overseas aid.  However, all of it, more than &euro;600 million, must be borrowed to maintain our commitment to the underprivileged of the world.</P>
        <P>Senator McCarthy referred to the sports capital programme.  Although it has been temporarily suspended, it has often been of considerable help to every club and parish.  I would like to believe that the programme&rsquo;s funds and those of the lotto are being returned to the Exchequer to help the underprivileged and the marginalised.</P>
        <P>Senator Donohoe called for a special debate entitled, &ldquo;Ireland: 2016&rdquo;.  As it would be timely, I suggest holding it after St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day, as our ambassadors will have travelled around the world and met their counterparts.  Listening to colleagues&rsquo; opinions, we could determine how <Col N="163"/>to move forward using a five-year or seven-year plan.  Hopes for 2016 are still alive in terms of plans to celebrate properly the heroes who gave us our country, our freedom of speech and our predecessors&rsquo; freedom to achieve.</P>
        <P>Senator Keaveney asked for the T&aacute;naiste to attend the House concerning US investment in Ireland.  While I addressed much of this matter in my response yesterday, I will reiterate the fact that the manner in which our nation remains attractive competitively is up to us.  If we stay competitive, we will hold investment.</P>

        <P>In response to Senator Ross, I will endeavour to arrange for the attendance of the Minister for Finance during the debate today on the Bill.  I have noted Senator Leyden&rsquo;s comments on the former Taoiseach and have made my opinions known.</P>
        <P>Senator Norris called for a debate on hedge funds.  I would have no difficulty with his raising the matter with the Minister today and all day tomorrow.  If a special debate is necessary, I am sure it can be arranged, given our weekly discussions on the economy.</P>
        <P>Senators Mary White and Hannigan discussed taking action regarding the cash flow to private companies, especially small companies.  The Government must take the lead and State and semi-State companies must pay on invoices within a reasonable time.  None of us or our friends is getting paid on the 30-day mark.  Rather, people are getting paid after 45 days.  If the State does not pay, it is not taking the lead.  Never was that lead more necessary than now, as a business&rsquo; life blood is its cash flow.  We all agree that, for the past 12 months, the banks have not been playing their part&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>I move:</P>
        <P LI="1">That Seanad &Eacute;ireann urges the Irish Government to continue its support for moves to establish an independent international investigation into alleged violations of international humanitarian law during Israel&rsquo;s military action in Gaza including the use of white phosphorus in densely inhabited civilian areas, the use of DIME munitions and the shelling of the UN facilities, including schools, which were being used as places of sanctuary by Palestinian civilians as well as the question of collective punishment and to maintain discussions with the representatives of countries such as Belgium, Cyprus, Sweden and Portugal who have also supported this move and that the independent international investigation also investigate the indiscriminate rocket attacks on civilians perpetrated by Hamas and others, the alleged storage of munitions in civilian locations and the allegations of the shooting of innocent Palestinians by Hamas, the alleged use of civilians as human shields by any actor and the alleged firing of rockets from positions adjacent to UN facilities, to schools and hospitals, furthermore, that Seanad &Eacute;ireann calls for a freeze on all settlement activity in line with international law, supports a two state solution to the Israeli Palestinian conflict with the objective of the State of Israel and an independent Palestinian State living side by side in peace and security and urges the Government to continue to fully support such resolution of the conflict and to take all appropriate steps in the UN, at EU level and in its bilateral international relations to promote and achieve such resolution; supports the International Quartet (EU, USA, Russia and the UN) in its work, and other initiatives to resolve the <Col N="165"/>conflict; welcomes the appointment by President Obama of George Mitchell as his Middle East peace envoy; calls on Iran to end its opposition to a 2 state solution; commends the initiative taken by Egypt to mediate a durable ceasefire between Israel and Hamas; and urges all sides to fully co-operate with UNRWA to facilitate the provision by it in Gaza of humanitarian relief.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PeterPowerFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Peter Power</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to address the Seanad on the situation in the Middle East following the ending of the Israeli military campaign in Gaza which began on 27 December 2008.  The Seanad had a useful discussion last week on the implications of the Gaza crisis for efforts to pursue an agreed two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.  My colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dick Roche, delivered a comprehensive address to Members setting out the Government&rsquo;s views on the current situation in the Middle East.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Instead of repeating what my colleague said, I propose to deal with several aspects of the Gaza crisis, including its implications for the overall peace process, which are raised in the all-party motion before the House today.  The three-week war in Gaza was a profound tragedy, not only for the affected population in the Gaza Strip itself but for the region as a whole.  Its repercussions are likely to be felt for a considerable time.  Senators are aware of the clear and consistent position articulated by the Minister for Foreign Affairs on behalf of the Government throughout the crisis, condemning the disproportionate nature of the Israeli military actions in Gaza as well as the totally unjustified and indiscriminate firing of rockets by Hamas and other Palestinian militants against the population of southern Israel.</P>
        <P>It is clear that very serious offences and, almost certainly, violations of international humanitarian law were committed by both sides during the conflict.  The report issued by Amnesty International earlier this week presented compelling evidence in this regard.  The Government has already clearly set out its views that no investigation is needed to ascertain that Hamas and all other militant groups guilty of launching Qassam and other rockets from Gaza into southern Israel on a completely indiscriminate basis have violated international humanitarian law.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The evidence regarding the use of white phosphorus and other highly offensive weapons such as Flechette tank shells by the Israeli defence forces is also extremely strong.  The Minister, Deputy Martin, spoke with Mr. John Ging of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, UNRWA, on the day the agency&rsquo;s headquarters in Gaza city were shelled and set on fire by Israeli forces.  Mr. Ging, who is a former Irish Army officer and is well experienced in weapons and munitions systems, was in no doubt about the use of white phosphorus on that occasion.  The use of such weaponry in a densely populated area such as Gaza is completely unacceptable, is a violation of international humanitarian law and raises serious questions regarding the conduct of the Israeli military campaign in Gaza which its Government will have to address.</P>
        <P>The Minister, Deputy Martin, on behalf of the Government, has been consistent in calling for all the serious incidents of the Gaza war, such as those documented in the Amnesty International report, to be the subject of a proper independent international investigation.  The Government welcomes the panel of inquiry established by the UN Secretary General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, to investigate those incidents where UN facilities were attacked or the scene of serious incidents.  An internal Israeli investigation is also under way but for this to be credible, it must involve independent international experts.  The ultimate goal is that there should be accountability where it is clearly demonstrated that violations of international law or serious war crimes have occurred.  We owe this to all the innocent victims of the Gaza conflict to ensure that we do not witness again the types of appalling scenes which appeared in the media during the war.</P><Col N="166"/>
        <P>In light of the evidence of what occurred in Gaza there have been many calls, including by Members of this and the other House, for Ireland to review its diplomatic relations with Israel or to push at European Union level for a suspension of the association agreement with Israel.  I fully understand why so many people, both in Ireland and internationally, have been prompted to make this call.  However, it is important to restate the reasons that any such rupturing or downgrading of our relations with Israel would be counterproductive.</P>
        <P>The Government has long made it clear that it is opposed to proposals for trade, diplomatic, cultural, academic, sporting or other forms of boycott against Israel.  The reality is that we maintain diplomatic and economic relations with many countries and Governments without implying any approval of particular policies.  We must be conscious, from our own national experience, of the importance of dialogue and keeping channels of dialogue open, even with those with whom we have major disagreements.  The Gaza conflict has provided visible demonstration, if such proof were needed, that dialogue and compromise, not military solutions, remain the only way to advance the cause of peace in the Middle East.  More than ever, we must encourage and support Israeli and Palestinian political leaders in their efforts to negotiate a settlement based on a two-state solution.  A policy of boycotts or exclusion would clearly not contribute to that process.</P>
        <P>Similarly, calls for a European Union trade boycott of Israel are neither practicable nor advisable.  It is clear that such a proposal would not have any prospect of attracting the necessary consensus within the Union at this time.  At the same time, recent events in Gaza have clearly demonstrated that the Government was correct to argue that there must be a linkage between overall developments in the peace process and any question of an upgrade in the European Union&rsquo;s relations with Israel.  The Government continues to argue that proceeding with an upgrade in European Union-Israel relations at present would convey the wrong political signal and would not be readily understood by European public opinion.  However, we will be pleased to move ahead at the appropriate political juncture.  In this regard, it is obvious that we must await the process of Government formation under way in Israel and hope the new Administration which emerges will abide by Israel&rsquo;s international commitments, including those arising under the road map.  It is also important that any eventual upgrade of relations with Israel should be paralleled by similar steps with the Palestinian Authority, as proposed by the Minister, Deputy Martin, and his Cypriot colleague, the Foreign Minister, Mr. Kyprianou, to the General Affairs and External Relations Council last December.</P>
        <P>The overwhelming strategic priority, and the prism through which we must constantly view all events in the Middle East, remains progress towards achieving a negotiated two-state solution between Israel and the Palestinians.  As stated by the Minister of State, Deputy Roche, in this Chamber last week, no matter how ghastly the events in Gaza, and however much we need to give attention to their continuing aftermath, nobody can doubt that in the long run, the only way to avert a repeat of the appalling scenes witnessed in Gaza is to work actively to assist the reaching of a comprehensive peace between Israel and its neighbours.  We must keep before us at all times the vision of two states living side-by-side in peace.</P>
        <P>The immediate priority, however, is the situation on the ground in Gaza where the humanitarian situation remains urgent following the ending of the conflict.  Efforts are continuing to put in place a durable ceasefire, following the unilateral cessation of hostilities by Israel and Hamas on 18 January.  I commend the Egyptian Government on taking a lead role in efforts to produce a sustainable and urgently needed ceasefire which would open the way for full and effective implementation of Resolution 1860 adopted by the UN Security Council on 8 January.  The <i>de facto </i>ceasefire now in place remains extremely fragile and has been subject to a series <Col N="167"/>of comparatively low-level breaches which nonetheless underline the urgency of the Egyptian-led efforts.</P>
        <P>The indirect talks under way in Cairo are also addressing the crucial issues of the full and sustainable opening of border crossings and intra-Palestinian reconciliation.  It is unacceptable, almost six weeks after the end of the conflict, that border crossings into Gaza have not been opened, and kept open, on a predictable and regular basis.  This is an absolutely vital step to address the serious humanitarian and reconstruction needs in Gaza.  It is difficult, if not impossible, to fathom what possible justification there can be on Israel&rsquo;s part for not allowing items like paper and pasta to be brought in by humanitarian agencies such as UNRWA, whose life-saving role throughout the recent crisis I wish to acknowledge.  The Government again strongly urges Israel to remove the unjustified restrictions on humanitarian and commercial traffic into Gaza.  This should include the necessary materials to allow for reconstruction of Gaza, including homes, economic infrastructure and utilities.</P>
        <P>The promotion of intra-Palestinian reconciliation is also crucially important if the humanitarian situation in Gaza is to be effectively addressed and appropriate workable arrangements put in place to allow the full opening of border crossings.  Beyond that, we must nurture and be suitably supportive of all efforts under way at achieving intra-Palestinian reconciliation as early progress in reviving overall peace efforts is unlikely to be achieved in the absence of such reconciliation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Important discussions mediated by the Egyptian Government are taking place today in Cairo between representatives of the Palestinian Authority and Hamas.  In the event that these negotiations were to yield agreement on the formation of a new Palestinian national consensus government, the EU must be ready to respond flexibly and imaginatively.  The important criterion to apply to such a development will be to judge any such government by its programme and its actions rather than solely by its composition or the rhetoric of its elements.  All these issues will be addressed at the reconstruction conference on Gaza which will take place in Sharm-el-Sheik in Egypt next Monday, 2 March.  The conference is being jointly convened and chaired by the Governments of Egypt and Norway, the latter in its role as chair of the <i>ad hoc</i> liaison committee on the Palestinian territories.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Martin, will represent Ireland at the conference, which is also due to be attended by UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, President Sarkozy, the new US Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, and Prime Minister Berlusconi of Italy.  The conference is intended to provide clear political support for the Palestinian people in the aftermath of the Gaza war as well as address the daunting reconstruction needs in Gaza, an initial assessment of which is due to be presented by the United Nations at the conference.</P>
        <P>Ireland provided &euro;500,000 in humanitarian assistance last month to assist the people of Gaza and a further substantial package of humanitarian assistance is planned and will be announced by the Minister at the conference.  Irish Aid is providing a comprehensive programme of support for the Palestinian people that totalled &euro;8.6 million in 2008, double the amount provided in 2005.  This included a contribution of &euro;1.5 million for fuel for Gaza&rsquo;s power plant as well as core funding of &euro;3.8 million to UNRWA, whose vital role in the provision of basic services for Palestinian refugees I have acknowledged.</P>
        <P>The EU and the European Commission, which collectively remains the largest donor to the Palestinian people, will also be represented at the conference where Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner will outline the substantial humanitarian assistance, amounting to &euro;90 million, provided by the Commission and member states in the immediate aftermath of the Gaza conflict.  The Czech Presidency will also speak on behalf of the EU, outlining the concerns of the EU regarding the current situation in Gaza and reaffirming EU willingness to support actively all <Col N="168"/>efforts to relaunch overall peace efforts.  In official level discussions in preparation for the conference that took place in Brussels, Ireland has insisted that any common EU statement must be clear in urging the full and sustained reopening of border crossings as an immediate and unconditional priority.  Obviously, this point will also be reiterated in the national statement which the Minister for Foreign Affairs will deliver at the conference.</P>
        <P>There are indications that a meeting of the Quartet, comprising the EU, US, Russia and the UN, may also take place <i>en marge </i>of the conference next Monday.  If it occurs, such a meeting would be a welcome development in helping to focus discussions not only on the immediate needs in Gaza but also on the urgency of relaunching the process of dialogue between Israel and the Palestinian Authority, which has been interrupted since the Gaza conflict and the intervening Israeli general election.  We need to get back to a position where credible peace talks between Israel, the Palestinians and Israel&rsquo;s neighbours can be resumed at the earliest opportunity.</P>
        <P>There are considerable obstacles to be overcome before we get to that point.  A new government must emerge in Israel, which we hope will, and we will have to encourage to, adhere to its previous commitments, including those made at Annapolis on the implementation of the Quartet road map.  It is of great concern to note the continuing failure on Israel&rsquo;s part to cease the expansion of new settlements in the Palestinian occupied territories, with recently announced plans for new settlements at Adam and also the expansion of the controversial E1 settlement.  As the motion notes, such expansion is contrary to international law and must cease if it is not to prejudice the outcome of the final status negotiations.</P>
        <P>Ireland will strongly urge the new Israeli Government, whatever its make-up, to desist from all those actions, including expansion of settlements, restrictions on movement and the continuing economic blockade of Gaza which conflict with the goal of a negotiated and viable two-state solution and which ultimately only serve to undermine all those on the Palestinian and Arab side working to achieve such an outcome.</P>
        <P>It will also be important for the EU to re-engage actively in furthering regional peace efforts and working closely with international partners, including those in the Arab world, to advance important initiatives such as the Arab peace initiative launched in 2002.  The clear desire within the region for such a stronger EU engagement was clearly evident and outlined to the Minister for Foreign Affairs during his recent visit to Syria, Lebanon and the United Arab Emirates at the start of this month.  The EU must also be more active within the framework of the Quartet in ensuring full compliance by all sides with road map commitments.  Ireland will continue working to encourage a positive response on the EU&rsquo;s part to any new Palestinian unity government that may emerge in the coming weeks.</P>
        <P>The US remains an indispensable player in the Middle East and it is clearly encouraging that the Obama Administration has shown such clear evidence of willingness to bring new thinking and new commitment to the US Government&rsquo;s vital role in supporting the peace effort.  President Obama&rsquo;s stated intention to pursue peace in the Middle East &ldquo;actively and aggressively&rdquo; is one that has been very warmly received by all those who support such peace efforts.  The appointment of Senator George Mitchell as US Middle East Envoy is also an inspired choice which demonstrates seriousness of intent.  We know well from our experience of the Good Friday Agreement negotiations the undoubted skills and invaluable experience that Senator Mitchell will bring to this role.</P>
        <P>It would be unwise not to recognise the very many priorities and challenges which face President Obama and his Administration, including within the region where the President has made clear his desire to review policy and pursue the opportunities that may exist for improved <Col N="169"/>bilateral relations with Iran, a crucial regional player.  The EU is engaged in dialogue with Iran regarding the many concerns over the country&rsquo;s nuclear programme and any improved dialogue between the US and Iran can obviously only assist in addressing these major concerns which exist on the part of the international community as a whole.  Such efforts will hopefully form part of a broader regional peace effort since it is possible that the clear opportunity which now exists to pursue a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict may not be unlimited.  It is therefore all the more urgent that Ireland and our EU partners work as closely as possible with the US and Arab partners in the coming months to ensure that this vital opportunity that now exists is not squandered.  On behalf of the Government, I am happy to commend this motion to the House.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his comprehensive report.  The cross-party motion demonstrates that when the problem is far from this country we can reach consensus while we have difficulty doing so with many of our own problems.  Despite the other problems we have in this country, we have an interest in adding our voice to the member states of the EU and the EU itself in trying to foster a solution in the Middle East.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The motion refers to a number of issues, the first of which is the action of the Israeli forces in Gaza in January.  The preliminary issue is the justification for the invasion under international law.  Then the proportionality of the actions taken must be considered.  These ultimately resulted in more than 1,000 civilian deaths, an extraordinary level of injuries, mass destruction of property and what appears to be collective punishment of the entire population.  In commenting on this subject, the role of Europe and the European Union has not been as effective, although it is a major donor to the area.  That is because of the structure of the foreign representation.  I do not apologise for making the point that the Lisbon treaty, which we will revisit in the autumn, is important because there are provisions in it relating to the Presidency of the Council and a foreign affairs delegate which are fundamental to Europe's having a more coherent foreign policy on this subject, as it does on so many others.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In regard to the actions of the Israeli army in Gaza, the country has serious questions to answer about breaches of international law.  It is useful to review very briefly the provisions of the Geneva Convention, particularly the first additional protocol to that convention, in respect of protecting civilians in occupied territories.  It specifically provides that protected persons must not be exposed to coercion, torture, collective punishment, reprisals, use as human shields and acts of terrorism, pillage or hostage taking.</P>
        <P>In terms of the military actions taken, it provides that everything feasible must be done to verify that the objects intended for the attack are not civilian or in any way subject to special protection under international human law.  The attacks are prohibited if they may be expected to cause incidental loss of civilian life or damage to civilian targets which would be excessive in comparison to the military advantage anticipated.  One must judge the balance of the requirement in the motion to have an independent international investigation of the violations of international humanitarian law during this military action in Gaza.  I fully support the approach of the Government and the collective action of the different parties represented here.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In its latest report, Amnesty International has highlighted some of the serious issues that have arisen.  It has noted the matter of proportionality, the enormous cost in human life and how an entire population has been affected by this action.  It continues to be affected by the economic blockade which has been referred to by the Minister of State.</P>
        <P>I will provide some quotes so that I am not just giving my own views.  Mr. Henry Siegman is the director of the US Middle East Project in New York, which is in the context of the Council on Foreign Relations.  I served on the committee of that project at one point.  Mr. Siegman is a research professor at the Sir Joseph Hotung Middle East Programme, School of Oriental and <Col N="170"/>African Studies, University of London.  He is also a former executive director of the American Jewish Congress and of the Synagogue Council of America so he can speak as a friend of Israel.  I take his views as being authoritative on this question.</P>
        <P>In an article published on 17 April 2008, he indicates that in terms of international peace efforts in the Middle East, the problem primarily responsible for the impasse is not faced up to.  He states:</P>
        <P LI="1">. . . for all the sins attributable to the Palestinians &mdash; and they are legion, including inept and corrupt leadership, failed institution-building and the murderous violence of rejectionist groups &mdash; there is no prospect for a viable, sovereign Palestinian state, primarily because Israel&rsquo;s various governments, from 1967 until today, have never had the intention of allowing such a state to come into being.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">It would be one thing if Israeli Governments had insisted on delaying a Palestinian state until certain security concerns had been dealt with.  But no government serious about a two-state solution to the conflict would have pursued, without letup, the theft and fragmentation of Palestinian lands, which even a child understands makes Palestinian statehood impossible.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">Given the overwhelming disproportion of power between the occupier and the occupied, it is hardly surprising that Israeli Governments and their military and security establishments found it difficult to resist the acquisition of Palestinian land.  What is astounding is that the international community, pretending to believe Israel&rsquo;s claim that it is the victim and its occupied subjects the aggressors, has allowed this devastating dispossession to continue and the law of the jungle to prevail.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">As long as Israel knows that by delaying the peace process it buys time to create facts on the ground, and that the international community will continue to indulge Israel&rsquo;s pretense that its desire for a two-state solution is being frustrated by the Palestinians, no new peace initiative can succeed and the dispossession of the Palestinian people will indeed become irreversible.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">There can be no greater delusion on the part of the Western countries weighed down by guilt about the Holocaust than the belief that accommodating such an outcome would be an act of friendship to the Jewish people.  The abandonment of the Palestinians now is surely not an atonement for the abandonment of European Jews 70 years ago, nor will it serve the security of the state of Israel and its people.</P>
        <P FLI="0">He continues, &ldquo;Time and again, this history has shown that the less opposition Israel encounters from its friends in the West for its dispossession of the Palestinians, the more uncompromising its behaviour.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>In regard to the recent Gaza invasion, Mr. Siegman, as an authoritative source, states in the <i>London Review of Books</i>:</P>
        <P LI="1">I am not aware of a single major American newspaper, radio station or TV channel whose coverage of the assault on Gaza questions [the Israeli] version of events.  Criticism of Israel&rsquo;s actions, if any . . . has focused instead on whether the IDF&rsquo;s carnage is proportional to the threat it sought to counter, and whether it is taking adequate measures to prevent civilian casualties.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">Middle East peacemaking has been smothered in deceptive euphemisms, so let me state bluntly that each of these claims is a lie.  Israel, not Hamas, violated the truce: Hamas undertook to stop firing rockets into Israel; in return, Israel was to ease its throttlehold on Gaza.  In fact, during the truce, it tightened it further.  This was confirmed not only by every neutral <Col N="171"/>international observer and NGO on the scene but by Brigadier General (Res.) Shmuel Zakai, a former commander of the IDF&rsquo;s Gaza division.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The article continues:</P>
        <P LI="1">The truce, which began in June last year and was due for renewal in December, required both parties to refrain from violent action against the other.  Hamas had to cease its rocket assaults and prevent the firing of rockets by other groups such as Islamic Jihad . . . and Israel had to put a stop to its targeted assassinations and military incursions.  This understanding was seriously violated on 4 November, when the IDF entered Gaza and killed six members of Hamas.  Hamas responded by launching Qassam rockets and Grad missiles.  Even so, it offered to extend the truce, but only on condition that Israel ended its blockade.  Israel refused.  It could have met its obligation to protect its citizens by agreeing to ease the blockade, but it did not even try.  It cannot be said that Israel launched its assault to protect its citizens from rockets.  It did so to protect its right to continue the strangulation of Gaza&rsquo;s population.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">Everyone seems to have forgotten that Hamas declared an end to suicide bombings and rocket fire when it decided to join the Palestinian political process, and largely stuck to it for more than a year.  Bush publicly welcomed that decision, citing it as an example of the success of his campaign for democracy in the Middle East . . . When Hamas unexpectedly won the election, Israel and the US immediately sought to delegitimise the result and embraced Mahmoud Abbas, the head of Fatah, who until then had been dismissed by Israel&rsquo;s leaders as a &ldquo;plucked chicken&rdquo;.  They armed and trained his security forces to overthrow Hamas; and when Hamas . . . pre-empted this violent attempt to reverse the result of the first honest democratic election in the modern Middle East, Israel and the Bush Administration imposed the blockade.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I wish to cite a final quotation from this gentleman on the effect of the invasion.  He states:</P>
        <P LI="1">Anthony Cordesman, one of the most reliable military analysts of the Middle East, and a friend of Israel, argued in a 9 January report for the Center for Strategic and International Studies that the tactical advantages of continuing the operation in Gaza were outweighed by the strategic cost &mdash; and were probably no greater than any gains Israel may have made early in the war in selective strikes on key Hamas facilities.  &lsquo;Has Israel somehow blundered into a steadily escalating war without a clear strategic goal, or at least one it can credibly achieve?&rsquo; he asks.  &lsquo;Will Israel end in empowering an enemy in political terms that it defeated in tactical terms?  Will Israel&rsquo;s actions seriously damage the US position in the region, any hope of peace, as well as moderate Arab regimes and voices in the process?  To be blunt, the answer so far seems to be yes.&rsquo;  Cordesman concludes that &lsquo;any leader can take a tough stand and claim that tactical gains are a meaningful victory.  If this is all that Olmert, Livni and Barak have for an answer, then they have disgraced themselves and damaged their country and their friends.&rsquo;</P>
        <P FLI="0">In citing those quotations I quoted from people who are friends of Israel, who are Jewish and who wish to make their contribution to a peaceful solution in the Middle East.  The motion before the House touches on all these issues and the promotion of the two-state solution in Israel.  Before Europe can play its full role in this process, it must fully understand the background and acknowledge the respective positions of the different parties, including Hamas.  This represents an objective view of the problem, but it also highlights just how intricate it is.</P>
        <P>I commend the motion to the House and welcome that it is a cross-party one.  We endorse what the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Martin, has done in regard to these issues, how <Col N="172"/>he has articulated a view on the investigations into the violations in Gaza, promoted the two-state solution and welcomed the involvement of George Mitchell as the Middle East peace envoy.  I commend the motion to the House.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Senator Ann Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State.  I am also pleased to speak on this motion on the conflict in the Middle East.  Like everyone else I was shocked by the recent events there and the impact they have had on the efforts to bring about peace.  During the three-week war in Gaza no respect was shown for human rights and ground and air assaults caused untold human misery resulting in more than 1,000 deaths.  Local infrastructure was devastated and many families lost all their possessions.  The United Nations school and humanitarian facilities were bombed, total disregard was shown for the United Nations flag and attacks were made on personnel and local headquarters.  I was delighted the Minister, Deputy Martin, in his statement fully and forcefully condemned such acts.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We have had this discussion already at a meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs during which a motion was unanimously agreed to support moves to establish an independent international investigation into the alleged violations of international humanitarian law during Israel&rsquo;s military action in Gaza, including the use of munitions in a densely populated area, which is banned internationally.</P>
        <P>Hamas must also tell its supporters to stop the shameful indiscriminate rocket attacks on the people of Israel.  Alleged storage of munitions in civilian locations has also been noted.  It is vital that both sides now show restraint.  I am delighted that the joint motion supports the two-state solution with the objective of the state of Israel and the independent Palestinian state living side by side in peace and security.</P>
        <P>I welcome the strong position taken by the Irish Government to give full support to a resolution of that conflict and to bring about peace in the region.  The Minister met key players at the highest level in the United States and at EU level, including Israel, Lebanon and Syria, to try to promote and achieve such a resolution and to support the cause for peace.</P>
        <P>The appointment by President Obama of George Mitchell as the Middle East peace envoy is to be welcomed.  As we know from our experience, the manner in which he brokered peace in Northern Ireland shows his doggedness and patience.  We know he is the right person for the job.  Ireland will be very supportive of that appointment.</P>
        <P>We must do everything we can, along with our European partners, to support those people &mdash; men, women and children &mdash; who are now blockaded in Gaza and to press on Israel to open up its borders and roadblocks to allow deliveries of building construction material and agricultural goods into the territory in order that Gaza can be rebuilt.</P>
        <P>Ireland is willing to do all in its power to ensure we never again see a repeat of the horrific and awful atrocities we saw on our television screens in recent months.  People must move away from conflict and violence and show a real commitment to peace.</P>
        <P>I welcome this motion which was discussed at length at a meeting of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and which received cross-party support.  I am pleased to endorse the motion and commend it to the House today.</P>

	<P>Is mian liom bu&iacute;ochas a ghabh&aacute;il leis an Seanad&oacute;ir Ormonde as a cuid ama a roinnt liom agus cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire.  T&aacute; &aacute;thas orm go bhfuil r&uacute;n comh<Col N="173"/>ph&aacute;irt&iacute; &aacute; phl&eacute; againn ar an &aacute;bhar thar a bheith t&aacute;bhachtach seo.  Le tamall fada, ar Riar na hOibre gach maidin, bh&iacute; seans againn labhairt faoi seo ach n&iacute; raibh seans againn labhairt faoi le haontas.  Ag amharc siar ar stair na h&Eacute;ireann, n&iacute;l aon amhras ach go bhfuil macalla le feice&aacute;il sa chuid sin den domhan ina bhfuil an choimhlint f&oacute;s ann agus go bhfuil daoine ag fulaingt go rialta.  T&aacute; s&uacute;il agam go gcabhr&oacute;idh &aacute;r nguth, is cuma c&eacute; chomh beag agus at&aacute; s&eacute;, i sl&iacute; &eacute;igin teacht ar r&eacute;iteach &eacute;igin a mbeidh daoine s&aacute;sta leis.</P>
        <P>Ireland has a particularly noble and honourable status in international affairs when it comes to human rights.  Ireland took a particularly independent sovereign stance on the Falklands conflict.  It was suggested we would suffer for it and that we were out of line.  Interestingly, we did not because the line we took became the main focus for a solution and a cessation of hostilities.</P>
        <P>Because we are seen as an honest broker with no particular vested interest in most of these issues and because we were not a colonising power, it is amazing how other nations, diplomats and politicians look to us for a more neutral and less tied position to an existing national policy.  This was particularly evident in the comments of the Minister, Deputy Martin, other Government spokespersons and Opposition spokespersons.  It was evident there was a unified and united approach to this conflict.  That is the only way what we say will have some authority and power.  We should not have a tale of division among ourselves but should be able to express ourselves in the manner in which we did.</P>
        <P>I do not contribute to the notion we should break off diplomatic relations with Israel.  At this stage I do not contribute to the notion there should be trade sanctions.  I do not genuinely believe that is the road forward.  When such methods have been employed in the past as an instrument or weapon, invariably they have not worked.</P>

	<P>What about South Africa?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The situation in South Africa and the apartheid movement was a totally different situation from the type of conflict we are talking about.  If I were to look for a comparable situation, and I know it is far apart, I would look to the North of Ireland, where we were trying to bring about reconciliation between two communities.  At the end of the day, the only way we succeeded in doing so was by having everybody inside the tent and not having one section outside.  The problem is that Hamas has been kept outside the tent.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It must be borne in mind that Hamas got a majority vote in the elections.  Prior to that, the American administration had made it quite clear it would accept the will of the people.  It does not matter.  We can downgrade or minimise that fact, or point to the arguments as to why Hamas should not be inside the tent.  The difficulty with that is when one does not allow it to have a political input, invariably one creates a vacuum, which is invariably filled by a military solution.  That is what has happened.</P>
        <P>We met some Palestinian representatives here from the Palestinian friendship body we have within the House.  I understood their position and I was not trying to take sides in these internal matters because the situation is very difficult.  The first question I asked the Fatah representative was if he favoured a unity government.  I did not get an outright &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;.  Instead, I got explanations.  I genuinely believe the only hope we have is to unite the Palestinian people themselves and recognise their voice as expressed in the ballot box.</P>
        <P>I am prepared to say that no hostilities of a military nature are acceptable in that situation.  However, Hamas finds itself in vacuum.  Unless one was made of stone and tied to an agenda by chains, there is no way one could justify the brutality and butchery visited by Israel on the Palestinian people.  I am not going to discuss Israel&rsquo;s use of illegal weapons but, rather, the sheer brutality of wiping out whole families, most of whom were civilians with no connection <Col N="174"/>whatsoever to any military unit in Gaza.  It was sheer brutality.  I still believe one element of the solution to the conflict is for Israel to be held accountable for the crimes it committed during those hostilities.  It is not acceptable.</P>
        <P>What worried me most was the timing of the brutality.  There were two elections pending.  There was an election pending in America and the almost certain demise of President Reagan&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;who was closely tied to Israel.  There was also an election within Israel itself.  Nothing will convince me that the confluence of those two elections did not have a bearing on the timing of the conflict.  Somebody tried to prove they were prepared to employ strong-arm tactics.  </P>

      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>It does not take from the terrible tragedies of the Israeli people who suffered from the rockets.</P>
        <P>Israel lost the battle.  As a result of that there has been an outcry throughout the world, even from its own friends.  The information it puts out is no longer seen as credible.  Even when it bombed a United Nations centre, it denied it at first, then agreed that perhaps bombs were dropped in close proximity and then tried to suggest there was terrorist activity.  Israel has no credibility left.</P>
        <P>Allowing for the terrible things that have happened, one must now get down to dialogue.  There is a time when one must draw a line in the sand, even though Israel must be held accountable for what it did.  Any democrat and person committed to democratic concepts must say that whatever terrible things happened in the past, we must now move forward.  Perhaps there can be a unity Government.</P>
        <P>I trust President Obama.  He is working against a terrible backdrop because the commercial, political and media influence of Israel within America is almost insurmountable.  That is the problem.  I have a feeling President Obama is an idealist and believes in human rights.  His own history and background will make him think very deeply.</P>
        <P>I fully commend the Government for its stance and the document we received today from the Minister of State gives me significant hope that we still have the neutral, independent, sovereign approach and think first of human rights, the helpless and the vulnerable.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and that this motion has become an all-party motion and will pass unanimously without a vote through this House, with the support of all elements.  It originated in the foreign affairs committee, proposed by myself and seconded by Deputy Michael D. Higgins.  It took some negotiation to get it through and elements were added with which I do not entirely agree.</P>
        <P>Sadly, I do not believe in a two-state solution.  That idea is finished and we must wake up to that fact.  It is not going to happen, partly for the reasons outlined by Senator Eugene Regan&rsquo;s magisterial contribution, which mentioned the words of a distinguished Israeli academic, Professor Seigman, who acknowledged that the idea of a Palestinian state has been made inoperable by the actions of the Israeli Government since.  It knows that and is prepared for the consequences.  It will not happen.  The only possibility is a federated situation where the Palestinians continue with their religious and ethnic identity and the Israelis with theirs.</P><Col N="175"/>
        <P>It wearies me to have, once again, to put my credentials before the House, as I had to do when I opposed the war in Iraq and had to say I am not anti-American.  I am not anti-Semitic.  Nobody should dare to suggest I am and I will tell the House why.  I was of assistance to the Israeli Government in securing the conviction of Ivan Demjanjuk, the Nazi concentration camp war criminal.  I was instrumental in helping to establish an Israeli Embassy here when the official Irish attitude was rather against it.  I campaigned for the human rights of the Jewish minority in the former Soviet Union and, in particular, for the release of people such as Anatoly Shcharansky.  In that case, I bitterly regret what I did.  I wish he was still stuck in the Soviet Union, or in the ruins of it, because that is where he thoroughly deserves to be.  I cannot imagine a more nasty, narrow, xenophobic and racist person, who has contributed disastrously to the texture of Israeli public life.</P>
        <P>I know the area very well and for many years I spent four months of the year there.  I lived with an Israeli citizen, whom I honour, because he has put his life in danger.  He has been shot at, stabbed and jailed for reaching out across the preconceptions of his own cultural identity to assist the downtrodden Palestinian people.  That is the real test of human rights, not just rewarding the people who look like oneself and share the same interests.</P>
        <P>As a result of the stand I have taken on the principle of human rights regarding the Palestinians, I have received a torrent of mail, some of which is very abusive and personal.  Even in the columns of newspapers correspondents have sought to rub my nose in my own sexual orientation and have asked how someone such as myself supports human rights for Hamas and the Palestinians and how long I, as a gay man, would last there.  That is a total irrelevancy.  In all these countries, from Iran to Iraq to Gaza, I have raised the persecution of gay people, which occurs.  However, I also listened with great interest when I raised the situation with the late Benazir Bhutto.  She said that this will come but that it is an unfolding story and it is not on the agenda at the moment.  If one understands cultural difference and the different rate at which societies progress in their understanding of the complexity of human nature, one must accept that, bitter pill though it may be.</P>
        <P>I will still stand up for the human rights of gay people in Iran, Iraq, Gaza or wherever, but that will not inhibit me from saying there is no justification for slaughtering people.  However backward they are in their understanding of society and its realities, they still have a right to be protected by international human rights covenants. These have been consistently violated.</P>
        <P>It may be a pity that the two-state solution is now so problematic as not to be worth bothering with.  It will have to be a federated solution which will take a great deal of working out.</P>
        <P>There is balance in this and there was much negotiation to get it through.  The balance is not entirely fair.  At the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, we listened to another distinguished Israeli Jewish academic, Professor Ilan Papp&eacute;, who warned specifically against this attempt to produce what is seen in the West as even-handed treatment because there is no even-handedness about the situation.  The Palestinians, who are totally guiltless in the situation, are paying the price for European crimes.  In particular, if one looks at the response of the German Government, the Palestinians are being forced to pay the price of the Germans&rsquo; guilty conscience about the Holocaust.  The Holocaust is a very sensitive subject.  This was such an enormous human catastrophe that it has become the inheritance not only of the Jewish people, who were the principal targets, but of humanity as a whole.  There were other targets, including gay people, gypsies, the Roma, intellectuals, left wing people and so on, but it was overwhelmingly anti-Semitic.</P>
        <P>Each year I go to the Holocaust memorial, now held in the Mansion House, and it is immensely moving.  It is the most dignified commemoration which pays tribute to the human spirit and expresses the horror of humanity about what was done in Europe.  At the last memor<Col N="176"/>ial I attended some weeks ago in the Mansion House, there was reference to the unique character of the Holocaust, the bureaucratic approach, the single-mindedness and the way in which people were depersonalised by the bureaucratic machine.  I am sorry to say that is what is happening in Israel as we speak.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I speak as a friend of Israel in solidarity with people like Ezra Yitzhak Nawi, Professor Siegman and the wonderfully courageous eight or ten Jewish Irish citizens who spoke out in the columns of <i>The Irish Times </i>against this because what is happening is a blasphemy against the ethos of Judaism, including the toast one makes to health and to life, <i>L&rsquo;Chaim</i>, and to the idea that whoever saves one human life saves the universe and whoever kills one person kills the universe.  This ethos regarding life has been vitiated by the present Government.</P>
        <P>It was horrifying for me to listen to the spokesperson from Olmert, from whom I expected nothing else because I know the man and his brother.  Tzipi Livni is a disgrace not just to the human race but to womanhood.  She said we will crush them with an iron fist.  Did she realise the resonances there?</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>There are war crimes and there is no equity.  After much thought, I have come to the point where I say &ldquo;No&rdquo; to certain propositions which are easy for liberal people to agree to, for example, that there is an equal right to live in peace for the people in the settlements and in Palestine.  There is not.  I do not wish them any harm but there is not an equal moral right.  If one invades, colonises, tramples on and strangles people, how dare one claim a right to peace.  Are they never to assert themselves, to struggle and to survive?  Are they to just die?  That is what is being asked of them.  There are 1.5 million people in an area the size of greater Dublin, 50% of whom are under 15 years of age.</P>
        <P>These people have had massive amounts of American supplied munitions dumped on them, including white phosphorus.  The Israelis never admitted they used it but they equivocated and said that whatever weapons were used were used under the rules of international law, but they were not.  There is a total proscription on the use of white phosphorus in populated areas where there will, inevitably, be civilian casualties.  The evidence is there, the fragments have been collected and they have been chemically analysed.  They used it in circumstances where there was an inevitable causation of massive civilian casualties.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We know that dense inert metal explosive, DIME, munitions were used.  They are horrendous, fiendish things.  The Americans and the Israelis deliberately and provocatively used Gaza as a laboratory to test new and fiendish weaponry.  That explains the autopsies which are coming out of the hospitals in Gaza.  People have almost no external injuries but when they are opened for a full autopsy, their entire internal organ structures are fried, cooked to a blackened crisp.  Nothing like this has been seen before.  This is what I call a war crime.</P>
        <P>I would like something stronger from the Minister, for example, for the two demands of Amnesty International to be met, namely, that there should be the immediate establishment of an independent investigation under the UN Security Council into allegations of war crimes by all sides and that those found responsible should be brought to justice, perhaps to the International Court of Justice, and that there should be an arms embargo on both sides by the world, in particular the United States which has been supplying most of these arms.</P>
        <P>It is very important that we speak out strongly, and I say this from my intimate knowledge of Israeli society, my love of that land and of its people.  The Israeli people, by and large, are in total and complete denial.  I understand that; it is an understandable human response.  My father was English and he died when I was six years of age.  I only saw him three times so he was not in a position to do too much damage.  I was brought up by my Irish family, an old Gaelic Irish family, but they were very pro-British.  I had it inculcated in me that the British <Col N="177"/>Empire was the greatest thing that ever happened, that it was responsible for world civilisation and so on.  Then I went to school and discovered the Famine, evictions and the penal laws.  It was appalling, deeply distressing and painful, but I had to live with it.  It prepared me for Bloody Sunday when people were murdered by the British Army.  At the beginning, I did not believe it, nor did the RTE reports which said the IRA had fired first, but we then discovered it did not.  Then there was that dreadful cover-up by Lord Widgery and then Denning said that we could not accept the authorities would lie because that was an appalling vista.  Appalling vistas must be faced by us and by the Israeli people as well, but they are not being faced.</P>
        <P>We should look at the situation of that wonderful Palestinian doctor who treated Israeli people.  Three of his children were killed and he was hysterical.  The next day at a press conference in Israel he spoke Hebrew and discussed the event but he was set upon by the Israelis who said it was not true, that he was responsible and that his family had fired.  It is total denial and we owe it to them to ensure this denial ends.</P>
        <P>The use of white phosphorus and DIME munitions are clear war crimes.  Dr. Clonan also stated: &ldquo;While military analysts have come to accept breaches of the Geneva conventions on the part of militant groups such as Hamas, the sheer scale, premeditation and prosecution of war crimes by the Israeli general staff in Gaza beggars belief.&rdquo; For that reason, we need to establish an investigation.  That is all I ask for.</P>
      
        <P>It is astonishing we are talking of upgrading the external association agreement.  What must the Israelis do before somebody raises the issue of human rights?  I am not talking about an embargo, but that barbarous and brutal war could have been switched off in five seconds if we had inhibited the 75% of Israeli produce imported into the European Union.  Instead, what do we do but upgrade the agreement.</P>
        <P>We were talking this morning about the financial situation, where we rewarded failure.  We are now in the business of rewarding the systematic and deliberate abuse of human rights by the Israelis.  They should stop lying.  I call on the Israeli Ambassador to stop lying.  He comes out with guff such as the Palestinians do nothing with the greenhouses the Israelis left to them.  The Israelis strangled any question of exports.  I have seen those greenhouses and have seen the mounds of rotting vegetables because the Israelis will not let even one tomato out.</P>
        <P>I will not praise the Egyptians either.  They were using poison gas to kill people in the tunnels.  They were stopping children from coming to Europe for medical treatment.  Why praise these kinds of people for the dastardly way in which they behave?  Nobody recognised Hamas although they were elected.  What about democracy?  They were elected and then we illegally kept money from them.  We allowed the people to be strangled and starved.</P>
        <P>In one of O&rsquo;Casey&rsquo;s great plays depicting the situation during the revolutionary period in Ireland, one of the characters, a British Pommy, complained that Irish irregulars coming out without uniforms and sniping was not cricket.  The response was to ask whether he wanted us to come out in our pelts and throw stones.  That, apparently, is all we have left to the Palestinians.  I regret anybody who is hit by a stone, but I understand it.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>Today&rsquo;s motion was moved in a spirit of consensus and countersigned by leaders of the various groups.  However, it is important that the impression does not go out that the whole House thinks collectively on this just because the attitude of the Government is being expressed in the debate.  Within the country there are people with a different perspective on events in the Middle East.</P>
        <P>We must acknowledge that Israel is a democracy, although a somewhat diminished democracy since its recent election.  It is the only democracy in that part of the world and the real tragedy is that it has diminished its moral standing through its actions in recent times.  It is a <Col N="178"/>country with obvious military and technological superiority over the people with whom it shares the region.  While it has had a tragic history since its foundation in the late 1940s, it sees Israelis as a people under siege.  A mirror image has also been created, of Israel as a country that has lived in a constant state of belligerence that has blinded it from moral principles that should apply to a democratic state with obvious advantages in that part of the world.</P>
        <P>The actions in Gaza were a cynical exercise, conducted with at least some type of tacit approval from Israel&rsquo;s patron state in the form of the United States, being conducted in the lamest period of a lame duck presidency and only stopped on the night of the inauguration of a new president.  It is obvious this was a well-thought out, prepared move to settle scores and on those grounds, it cannot be politically justified.</P>
        <P>It is also the case that the political changes have mirrored the constant state of belligerence in which it has wrapped itself.  The recent election results in Israel were profoundly depressing.  It is a country that seems to have lost any semblance of a progressive political force, where the once dominant Labour Party that founded the State of Israel and introduced principles of collective farming in the form of kibbutz, is now reduced to fourth place, behind three right-wing parties, where attempts were made within the political system to bar Arab political parties from participating in the election, but where, at the least, the judicial system sees through such naked political posturing.</P>
        <P>I hope whatever international pressure possible is put on the new Administration in Israel, but we are now faced with an Israeli Prime Minister who has shown himself to be immune to such pressure in the past.  I hope there can be a reconsideration of events in the region.  I do not see a change occurring in the short term whereby Israel will lose its military and technological advantage.  I hope an internal debate takes place within Israel on how its government&rsquo;s actions over the past number of years have undermined its credibility in the world.  Credibility exists with regard to a continuation of the State of Israel and the promotion of democracy in the region, but always on the basis that the weapons of war cannot be used to achieve particular political ends.</P>
        <P>Protests against Israel&rsquo;s actions have taken place throughout the world, including in Ireland.  Elements within those protests are obviously anti-Israeli and some are anti-American and there have been actions such as the burning of Israeli flags.  That type of intolerance is unacceptable.  By the same token, the principle of indiscriminately firing shells and using other weapons by any group of people, from whatever territory, must be condemned in any debate.  Hamas has been and is wrong in its policy of using missiles.  Israel is also wrong, probably to a greater extent, because its weapons are of a higher grade and precision.</P>
        <P>What is most upsetting about the moral position of Israel is that it chose, in presenting a public relations front during recent events in the Gaza Strip, to say it was engaged in a humane war.  Israelis rang people up and sent around leaflets to warn people bombings would take place in their local communities and to warn them what buildings to go to for shelter.  In our history, when we saw organisations like the Provisional IRA use such tactics, we rightly decried them as morally worthless.  It makes no difference to any group of people to get notice of bombings.  Being bombed is morally unacceptable and I hope that is the message that comes out from this House.</P>
        <P>While we support the State of Israel and recognise the need for a democratic and progressive State of Israel, we cannot accept its recent actions.  On those grounds, I hope a positive message of both support and appropriate condemnation goes out with regard to what we have seen in the Middle East in recent months.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>As we discuss this topic here, talks are continuing on the formation of a new government in Israel.  This comes just weeks after one of the worst series of atrocities carried out against the Palestinian people in the past 40 years.  We in the Labour Party have consistently condemned the actions taken, which are contrary to the principles of international law.  Anyone who has read our party website recently will know our MEP for the Dublin area, Proinsias De Rossa, visited Gaza recently and has given a clear account of the devastation caused in the area.</P>
        <P>Many people in the Chamber have also spent time in the area, although perhaps not since the bombings.  Senator Norris was in Gaza as recently as last year with a delegation that also included Senator Daly.  They are, therefore, very aware of the issues in that territory.  It is important that all sides now work together to ensure the ceasefire currently in place holds.  The Labour Party supports the motion today because it will send out a clear message from the House that it supports what all sides are doing to maintain and formalise the ceasefire.</P>
        <P>In any conflict, the cessation of violence is the essential step to achieving a lasting and permanent resolution.  We want to express our support for the talks being mediated by Egypt, involving an array of Palestinian political groups.  I am glad to note that in recent days there appears to have been a positive move from Hamas and Fatah to improve relations with each other.  It is hoped that this is setting the mood for a successful outcome to the Egyptian talks.  It could lead to a more unified position from the Palestinians when it comes to dealing with the Israeli Government.  If this were to occur it could be a significant breakthrough.  Many times in the past we have seen that any disagreement within the ranks of the Palestinians can be used by others to divide and conquer.  Having broad support for any policy across the Palestinian people could be a very positive breakthrough.</P>
        <P>I hope the announcement that the US will send $900 million in aid to the Gaza Strip will help to concentrate minds.  Let us be in no doubt that if we can come up with solutions the international community will not be found wanting with regard to putting more money into this area if a firm settlement with Israel is agreed.  In the past, too much of the aid going to the territories has been wasted and all interests need to recognise the importance of unity.</P>
        <P>I heard the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Power, speak about the commitments that Irish Aid has made in recent years.  I am aware that potentially the Irish Aid programme could be hit by cutbacks but I reiterate our support for anything the Minister of State does to ensure aid goes towards the Palestinian people.  If an agreement can be found it will be money very well spent.  Nobody in this country would want to see us shy away from commitments to the people or from providing help to the Palestinians.</P>
        <P>Next week&rsquo;s donor conference in Egypt offers significant opportunities.  I am glad to see that it is the first visit to the Middle East by a senior member of the new Obama Administration as Hillary Clinton will be there, as will our Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Martin.  This is good news because there is a pressing need for a full reopening of Gaza&rsquo;s border crossing with Israel and they can help to put on pressure.</P>
        <P>I pass on my party&rsquo;s best wishes to those involved in the talks on the formation of a new Government which are taking place in Tel Aviv.  President Shimon Perez has a very difficult task negotiating a stable coalition in Israel, bearing in mind the complex political landscape that exists there.  It seems likely that Kadima led by Tzipi Livni or Likud led by Benjamin Netanyahu will lead the country&rsquo;s next Government.  Whoever comes to power will have to take on board other parties in coalition, and we all appreciate the difficulties this will bring.</P>
        <P>The outcome of the process must lead to a Government that is united in its determination to agree a just and lasting peace with the Palestinians.  While I am in no way expressing support for any particular candidate, I was encouraged by Tzipi Livni&rsquo;s description of the recent election <Col N="180"/>results as the expression of a new social movement.  Despite the repeatedly militaristic approach taken by Israel, there is a significant rump within that state which opposes the current occupation of Palestinian lands.</P>
        <P>The voice of the radicals has held too much sway and if Ms Livni&rsquo;s analysis is correct, whoever assumes the premiership will have to reflect the moderate element that currently exists within Israeli society at large, which would be good news.  We need the force of reason to defeat the force of militarism.  Our hope is that the new Israeli Government will work for peace and we all wish the negotiators in Israel and Egypt well in their endeavours.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EoghanHarris"><NameTxt>Senator Eoghan Harris</NameTxt>
	<P>I am tempted to vote against the resolution because of the provocative nature of assumptions made with regard to use of phosphorus in statements about schools being bombed, which now are admitted not to have been bombed, but broadly because the motion calls for a two-state solution I will reluctantly support it.</P>
        <P>I want to talk about the wider hinterland of the Israeli question that involves us in Ireland and in Europe, as it affects the increasingly large and militant Muslim minorities in Europe, and the impact it will have on European politics.  In particular I want to talk about the sinister shift in European opinion away from supporting a democratic state and a benign gaze being turned to what by any standard is a gangster organisation, namely, Hamas, the equivalent of the continuity IRA or the real IRA in Palestinian terms.  Fatah has been noticeably silent, failed to give it any support and did as little as possible because Fatah knows, as we know in Ireland, that those in Hamas are fundamentalist and barbaric extremists who are no help to their people.</P>
        <P>The Jewish state, which is smaller than Munster, is surrounded by a hostile Arab land mass the size of the continental United States and has not known peace in 60 years.  If Israel were any other small democratic state, surrounded by a ring of repressive states intent on its destruction, it would be supported by the people and Parliament of Ireland, as it was before the Irish left succeeded in polluting public opinion.</P>

	<P>The political class and media class in Ireland and Europe take the side of fundamentalist Islamic groups like Hamas, who want to return to Sharia law, that is the law of the barbarian, against the democratically elected Government of Israel.  This will have huge and most likely lethal strategic consequences, not only for the prospect of peace in the Middle East, but for how we in Europe define ourselves and our core values in the face of the challenge from Islam.</P>
        <P>Against the background of the isolation of Israel by the European left, the propaganda campaign against Israel following the Gaza operation is one more polluted stream flowing into a large river of anti-Israel propaganda.  These campaigns are provably different in depth and volume from campaigns conducted against states such as Darfur, Zimbabwe and North Korea. <Col N="181"/> We are told we cannot call this obsessive interest with Israel, the single focus and monomania about Israel on the part of the Irish left, anti-Semitism.  However, if a political passion is directed exclusively at the only Jewish state on earth, what are we to call it?  If this peculiar passion is not to be called anti-Semitism, and so focused are the European and Irish left on Israel that it deserves a special name, what name shall we call this obsession with the Israeli state?</P>
        <P>What are we to call the benign face that the European left turns towards Hamas?  Senators should go to the library, find the Yale Law Journal and look up what Hamas&rsquo;s charter states.  Article 13 states: &ldquo;Initiatives, and so-called peaceful solutions and international conferences, are in contradiction to the principles of the Islamic Resistance Movement&rdquo; and &ldquo;There is no solution for the Palestinian question except through Jihad&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>These are not just words and I do not take documents as definitive.  Gangsterism rules Hamas and Hamas shows its gangsterism in its actions.  After taking over Gaza it went on a rampage that killed more than 600 Palestinians, mostly supporters of Fatah.  A few weeks ago, it determined to introduce Islamic punishments to the Strip, including amputations, stonings and crucifixions.  It used its poor people as fodder for their fanatical ideology much as the Border provos used young men and suborned them into various factions of the IRA with the same cult of death and martyrdom.</P>
        <P>As some of my fellow Senators and politicians from both Houses seem to imagine, Hamas is not some kind of benign Sinn F&eacute;in branch with a peace process in the background, it is a client of a larger radical, Islamic conspiracy, with Iran in the background and with large militant European minorities prepared to do the footwork within Europe.</P>
        <P>How did it happen that the European liberal left turned its face away from the state of Israel under pressure and turned a benign face towards Hamas?  The sad answer is that it is the result of what Julian Benda called &ldquo;la trahison des clercs&rdquo;, the treason of the intellectuals.  In recent years, the campaign was led mostly by academic leftists and their supporters in the mass media who managed to shift the entire focus of the debate using television images of the previous two wars.  These images of dead children were available also during the Second World War.  I am no more stony-hearted than anybody else, but the images of dead German children did not deflect the Soviets, Americans or British from their sustained campaign to reduce Germany&rsquo;s civilian population to its knees to end the barbarism of Nazism.</P>
        <P>The television images in the past two wars &mdash; the Lebanon war and the recent incursion &mdash; have been used by the anti-Israeli left in Europe to move the debate away from the legitimate right of Israel to exist towards neutral ground where Hamas is seen as some kind of branch of Sinn F&eacute;in or a legitimate organisation.  That is a profound shift in public discourse and not a good shift.  It is the beginning of the kind of appeasement we saw in the 1930s.  Goebbels and the Germans would not have got away with shifting blame from the Nazis by pointing to the so-called lack of proportionality in the conduct of the Second World War.  In fact, the Germans suffered ten times as many casualties as the British &mdash; 600,000 Germans against 60,000 British civilians, some of whom were from Derry.  Goebbels and the Germans would not have been able to persuade Americans to boycott Britain because of alleged war crimes committed in the bombing of Hamburg, Dresden or Berlin.  However, that is precisely what has happened in the Israel-Hamas propaganda war.</P>
        <P>War is being waged all right.  However, it is being waged not just in Israel and the Middle East but also in Europe, including Ireland, not just by means of suicide bombing but also by gross propaganda.  To stand up against this propaganda, as I am doing today, is not simply about defending the tiny, democratic, open, law-based society of Israel, it is also about standing up for the common values we cherish in Ireland and across the European Union.  It is about <Col N="182"/>standing up against the <i>trahison des clercs</i>, the tenured radicals in our universities with permanent and pensionable jobs who betrayed their high calling to the truth by allowing and applauding the pressure on a democratic state and the rise of a gangster faction in Gaza.</P>
        <P>What is going on?  What is the special <i>animus </i>against Israel?  Why are so many academics so filled with bile and bigotry?  The answer is that Israel is only the canary in the mine showing a deeper and more profound crisis in western values and western democracy, a crisis which sees the grandsons and granddaughters of those who put 6 million Jews to death return to the sins of their fathers.</P>
        <P>How would one feel if one were a French, Italian or Venezuelan Jew?  I ask the Senators, who live in the city of Leopold Bloom, to engage in an act of moral empathy, not just with the people of Palestine but with Jews across the world.  How would a British Jew feel going to bed at night if he knew prominent Jews got death threats every day?  The students at the University of Oxford want to make it a Jew-free zone.  How would one feel as a Jew if one lived in a European city?  A Swedish school has refused to accept Jewish students.  In France, synagogues are attacked and bombed.  How would one feel if one were a Jew in a Latin American country after the onslaught against the Venezuelan Jewish community by left-wing President Hugo Chavez?  I cannot understand how Senators can be so insensitive to the isolation not only of Israel but also of Israeli Jews.</P>
        <P>This isolation is not good.  The left that surrendered to Hitler is doing another disservice by isolating Israel morally and politically.  When one isolates Israel, the iron enters its soul.  The Israelis have little to lose.  For 2,000 years we persecuted them and tried to finish them off.  They will die standing and would be right to do so rather than give in.  We, as Members of a democratic Parliament, should be standing with that democracy and not with our gangster enemies.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews.  His father, David Andrews, former Minister for Foreign Affairs, and his late uncle, Niall Andrews, were very committed to and involved in the Middle East.  David Andrews is now the president of the Irish Red Cross and has played a very important role in that organisation&rsquo;s work in Gaza, the West Bank and the region as a whole.</P>
        <P>I am convenor of the Friends of Palestine organisation in the Oireachtas.  It is one of the best represented groups in the House and has members from all parties and all sides.  The group works to assist in the establishment of an independent Palestinian state and to ensure the existence of a free and safe Israel, both working together in parallel.  This is the ambition and hope.</P>
        <P>The late, great Brian Lenihan, former Minister for Foreign Affairs, was the first foreign minister in the European Union to support a two-state solution allowing for an independent Palestinian state and the support of Israel.  He is well regarded in the region for his support for the cause.</P>
        <P>As convenor of Friends of Palestine and as one who is not an enemy of Israel, I led a delegation to the West Bank, Jerusalem, Ramallah and Hebron in 2005.  I was accompanied by the current Minister for the Environment Heritage and Local Government, Deputy John Gormley, leader of the Green Party, Deputy Eamon Gilmore, leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh, a prominent member of Sinn F&eacute;in, Senator John Paul Phelan of Fine Gael and the late Tony Gregory.  We met all the different agents in the region and I was very impressed by Ireland&rsquo;s support for the cause and by the university in Bethlehem, a city of historic importance, especially to Christians.  The surrounding of that city by a 30-foot concrete wall has turned it into an enclave and has prevented it from making economic progress.  In <Col N="183"/>Ramallah we were confronted by two Israeli soldiers who aimed their automatic guns at us because we were accompanied by Palestinians.  The area in Ramallah in question has been settled, especially by people from Brooklyn in the United States.  They should be removed from that city, which is mainly Palestinian.</P>
        <P>Ireland has a very proud record in providing support and aid to the region and it is well respected.  However, the region has been divided by the new Berlin Wall erected by the Israelis which goes right through Palestinian territory.  This has resulted in the provocation of the Palestinians in light of the occupation of the West Bank.  It is reported that a further 430 acres are being occupied by Israeli settlers.</P>
        <P>I witnessed at first hand the way settlers are brought into Palestinian territories and the way in which the Palestinians are walked upon.  It is unbelievable.  The operation that happened in Gaza was a further incitement and a slaughter of the innocent.  Some 1,300 were slaughtered.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I condemn Hamas for aiming rockets at Israel.  Its doing so is provocative and resulted in an over-the-top response by Israel in advance of the Israeli elections.  The response was politically motivated and the result was that Palestinians were slaughtered in Gaza.  The area is absolutely decimated and I welcome the fact that the Government, including the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Martin, and the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Power, have allocated a further &euro;500,000 to assist in the region, despite the fact that we are experiencing a very difficult economic downturn.  Our circumstances pale into insignificance by comparison with those of the Palestinians.  A total of 500,000 people reside in an area smaller than the size of counties Leitrim or Roscommon.  It is an open prison and it cries out for justice and fair play.</P>
        <P>I do not support the work or objectives of Hamas but its representatives were democratically elected.  I call for the reunification of Fatah and Hamas.  There should be only one voice for the Palestinian people.  It is a question of &ldquo;divide and conquer&rdquo;, the same approach that was adopted in the past in respect of issues here in Ireland.</P>
        <P>There is no single spokesperson for the Palestinian cause.  Gaza is occupied and supported by Hamas, the powerful body in that region.  The West Bank is under the control of Fatah, which was also elected.  The link between those regions must be ensured if a viable Palestinian state is to be created.</P>
        <P>President Obama has sent Mr. George Mitchell to work as a mediator in the region with Mr. Tony Blair.  The two men actually worked with the Fianna F&aacute;il leadership, including former Taoisigh Mr. Albert Reynolds, Mr. Charles Haughey and Deputy Bertie Ahern, to bring about a solution in Northern Ireland.  When bearing in mind the role of Mr. Gerry Adams and all those involved in Northern Ireland, one must acknowledge that Mr. Blair and Mr. Mitchell played a very important role.  It is a great symbol of hope and encouragement that these two mediators are in the Middle East.  I hope they bring about a lasting solution to the conflict.</P>
        <P>There will be a solution sometime but, in the meantime, more innocent victims will be lost.  I am pleased to have an opportunity to contribute to this cross-party debate.  I welcome that we have different viewpoints in this House, and rightly so.  This is a democracy and we have a right to express our views in an honest and genuine way.  I respect everyone&rsquo;s views in that regard and hope we will bring about a peaceful and honourable solution in this region.  I hope for a two-state solution, namely, Israel and Palestine working together in the interest of peace and harmony.</P>

    <Title>Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Bill 2009: Second Stage.</Title>
        <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>This Bill has been brought forward in light of the unprecedented economic challenges now facing our country.  The world economy is in deep recession, a recession which has no parallel in modern times, and which is linked to a serious crisis in the international financial markets that has had profound effects around the world.</P>
        <P>Industrial production in the United States fell by approximately 8% in December.  In Germany, it fell by 12% in 2008.  In the United Kingdom, industrial production dropped by approximately 9%.  The economy of Japan, which relies heavily on exports, is in acute difficulties.  Many of the 2004 European Union accession countries of central and eastern Europe, which enjoyed high growth, are equally exposed to the global downturn.</P>
        <P>Unemployment is also increasing.  In the US, the rate has increased to 7.6% of the workforce with approximately 600,000 people losing their jobs in the month of January alone.  In the euro area, average unemployment is now 8%.</P>
        <P>As a small trading nation, Ireland is heavily exposed to those international developments.  In 2008, our GDP declined by approximately 1.4%.  In 2009, GDP is projected to contract by<?oasys _jy ?>4%, which would be the sharpest decline in activity on record.  A further reduction in activity is forecast for 2010.</P>
        <P>The rise in unemployment, which is affecting people throughout the country, underlines the serious social impact of what is happening.  No one can ignore those developments.  The Government has had to take clear and decisive action in the national interest, and needs to go on doing so for as long as is necessary.  The economic sea change has had a very negative impact on the budgetary arithmetic.  We have seen an exponential increase in the budget deficit and in Government borrowing that must be reined in.</P>
        <P>The Government must borrow &euro;18 billion this year at far steeper interest rates to finance capital spending and also to meet the current budget deficit.  The national debt is likely to rise to more than 45% of GNP, and spending on interest costs will come to &euro;4.5 billion, or 12% of total tax revenue in 2009.  In short, Ireland is fighting to recover its economic stability in the face of an exceptional combination of circumstances.  The economic independence we have enjoyed through times that were often very challenging in other ways could be at risk if we further put off the decisions that need to be made now.  Painful decisions must be implemented as a matter of urgency.  Otherwise, the public finances and the level of public debt will become unsustainable, and control will pass out of our hands.</P>
        <P>The stabilisation pact agreed with the social partners pointed to the urgent need to manage the public finances over five years through a combination of tax and expenditure measures, with an expenditure adjustment of the order of &euro;2 billion required immediately in 2009.  The need to eliminate the current budget deficit by 2013 has been set out in the fiscal plan submitted to the European Commission.</P>
        <P>Regrettably, it was not possible to reach agreement in the social partnership framework on the details of the required measures in the time available, and the unions were not in a position to agree to the pension-related deduction for public service workers.  The Government therefore had to take action in the national interest and without delay.  I understand perfectly the difficulties of the trade unions and the reaction of their members but I believe social partnership, which I have always strongly defended, not least in this House, still has an important role to play in resolving our difficulties.</P><Col N="185"/>
        <P>This Bill provides for measures to reduce or control public expenditure.  These are the pension-related deduction on the total earnings of all public servants to realise &euro;1,160 million in 2009 and &euro;1,350 million in a full year.  The deduction applies at 3% on the first &euro;15,000, 6% on the next &euro;5,000 and 10% on the remainder, which amounts to 7.5% on average; the reduction in fees for certain professional services to realise savings of &euro;67 million in 2009 and &euro;80 million in a full year; the changes in the early child care supplement to reduce the payment from &euro;1,104 to &euro;996 per annum and to set a new age limit for payment of five years, to realise savings of &euro;51 million in 2009 and &euro;77 million in a full year; and the deferral of certain payments under the farm waste management scheme.</P>
        <P>I do not accept the argument that the pension-related deduction to be paid by the non-commercial public sector is &ldquo;unfair&rdquo;, because it singles out the public sector from the rest of the workforce.  A number of sectors within the economy have to make a contribution to the adjustment measures, which are now so urgently required.  It is not just about the public service.  The ambit of the Bill is wider than that, and that should be acknowledged.  Measures past and to come relating to a broadening of the tax base and the raising of further revenue and also further substantial economies in expenditure will all be needed to redress the situation.</P>
        <P>Having said that, the public service pay and pensions bill has to be part of the measures taken, given its relative size, and of the overall balance.  Public servants have significant pension benefits.  Those benefits are higher than for many in the private sector and those benefits are secure, particularly when viewed against the recent severe loss in value suffered by many private sector pension plans.  In light of that and the overall budgetary position, the Bill proposes that all public servants serving on or appointed after 1 March 2009 will have an additional pension-related deduction from their annual pay with effect from 1 March 2009.</P>
    <HtmlBk SectId="3" />
        <P>My Government colleagues and I, who naturally are included in this, as are Oireachtas Members, are well aware of the important role played by the public service and are conscious of the natural concerns of public servants regarding this measure.  However, the situation requires that we all have to be prepared to contribute, particularly those in established positions with the benefit of job security.</P>
        <P>The claim has been widely made that the pension deduction falls too heavily on the lower paid, but this is not the case.  The deduction is progressive, as people on higher incomes will continue to pay proportionately more than those on lower incomes. For example, taking account of all taxes and other mandatory stoppages such as income tax, PRSI, standard pension contribution, the health and income levies and the new pension-related deduction, an unmarried public servant earning &euro;20,000 a year &mdash; and no full-time employee earns less &mdash; will pay 11% of his gross income in total deductions when the new deduction is introduced.  An equivalent public servant earning &euro;100,000 a year will pay total deductions of 43%.  It is claimed the deduction should not apply to non-pensionable pay.  However, it must do so to achieve the public expenditure savings the country needs at this time.  No additional pension benefits arise from the deduction and it does not alter the pensionability of these elements of pay.</P>
        <P>A number of specific issues are worth addressing.  I will explain the integration system whereby pensions are calculated for public service employees insured for full PRSI who are members of public service pension schemes.  The Commission on Public Service Pensions made recommendations on the treatment of part-time employees and employees on lower levels of pay.  With effect from 20 December 2001, the pension system for part-time employees was modified to a <i>pro rata</i> basis by reference to the remuneration of whole-time employees.  This has the effect of improving the benefits payable to part-time employees who are fully insured.  With effect from 1 January 2004, a new system of calculating pensions for employees insured for full PRSI was introduced.  This delivers increased pensions to members of public service <Col N="186"/>pension schemes whose full-time salary is less than three and one third times the contributory State pension, CSP.  Currently, this amounts to some &euro;40,000.</P>
        <P>The new integration formula takes into account the value of the CSP in calculating occupational pensions.  The method of calculating a pension for public service employees who qualify for benefits on or after 1 January 2004 is as follows: (a) for that part of the employee&rsquo;s pensionable remuneration which is less than or equal to three and one third times the current rate of CSP, one two hundredths of pensionable  remuneration multiplied by the number of years of reckonable service plus (b) for any part of the employee&rsquo;s pensionable remuneration which exceeds three and one third times CSP, one eightieth of pensionable remuneration multiplied by the number of years of reckonable service.  The maximum number of years of reckonable service is 40.  The new formula is used in all cases of retirement on or after 1 January 2004.  In addition, pensions in course of payment on 1 January 2004 were revised by reference to the new formula in cases where this produced an improvement for the pensioner.</P>
        <P>The revised system improved the position for people on lower rates of pay and ensured every person who meets the requirements of the pension scheme will receive an occupational pension, regardless of income.  A good example is someone on low pay with a full 40 years service.  Under the previous system, he or she might have received little or no occupational benefit but he or she will now receive two fifths or 20% of his or her final salary as an occupational pension benefit, in addition to his or her State pension.  The new integration system ensures every person who meets the eligibility criteria of the pension scheme receives an occupational pension, regardless of income, and this will not change following the introduction of the Bill.</P>
        <P>With respect to other claims that public servants can receive, on retirement, benefits that are worth less than the contributions they will make, there are considerable in-service benefits.  If a public servant dies in-service, his or her family receives a death gratuity, which is a minimum of one year&rsquo;s pay.  In addition, a pension may be paid to the public servant&rsquo;s spouse and dependent children, where the public servant was a member of the spouses and children scheme.  These valuable features of public service employment are rarely mentioned.  Public servants also receive a pension lump sum, which is a tax free payment made on retirement that equals three eightieths of the final salary of the retiring officer for each year of service.  Someone retiring with 40 years service and a final salary of &euro;50,000 would receive &euro;75,000.</P>
        <P>It has been said that those earning &euro;30,000 would pay a higher percentage of their salary than those earning &euro;45,000.  It must be understood this is due to the operation of tax relief.  If one takes a wider view and looks at the overall picture, a person on &euro;45,000 pays 29% to the State in tax, levies and the pension deduction, while a colleague on &euro;30,000 only pays 21% in total.  The overall system is progressive and this is as it should be.  It is important the figures are stated clearly. For someone earning &euro;20,000 a year, the net reduction in take home pay as a result of the Bill is &euro;11 per week.  For someone on &euro;50,000, which is close to the average salary in the public service, the reduction is &euro;38 per week.  It is recognised that these are real changes and that it will not be an easy adjustment for any of us, but this necessary adjustment has to be seen in the context of the situation facing our national finances and the economy.</P>
        <P>The Government has taken the decision that this deduction is not related to the scale and extent of one&rsquo;s public service pension benefits, which are, in any event, unique to each individual.  The value or expected value of these is a direct function of length of service, grade and pay scale and is indirectly related to personal familial circumstances, age and career expectations. It would not be sensible to attempt to quantify or cost these for the public service, and then try to relate the deduction to this quantification.</P><Col N="187"/>
        <P>Many people working in other sectors of the economy have had to face pay cuts, shorter working weeks and, unfortunately, redundancy.  Those still at work, many of whom had made pension provision, have seen the value of their pension reduced because of the devastating effects experienced by investments in equity markets.  Against that background, it is reasonable that the Government and those in a position of secure, pensionable employment and with Government guaranteed pensions, make their contributions towards addressing both today&rsquo;s difficulties and the long-term sustainability challenges facing public service pensions.</P>
        <P>I will refer to the Bill&rsquo;s provisions.  The Bill includes recitals, which follow the Long Title, and link its provisions to the current economic and financial challenges facing the State.  Section 1 of the Bill defines &ldquo;public service body&rdquo; as the Civil Service, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Permanent Defence Force, local authorities, the Health Service Executive, the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland and vocational educational committees.  The definition encompasses primary and secondary schools, third level institutions, and the non-commercial semi-State bodies where a public service pension scheme exists or may be made.</P>
        <P>&ldquo;Public servants&rdquo; are defined as office holders or employees of public service bodies.  Members of either House of the Oireachtas, members of the European Parliament, and qualifying office holders such as Ministers, the Attorney General, the Ceann Comhairle, the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, the Cathaoirleach and Ministers of State are also covered by the Bill.  Under the Constitution, the President and members of the Judiciary cannot be included in this measure.  &ldquo;Remuneration&rdquo; is defined as total earnings, including allowances, overtime or any other like payment, payable by or on behalf of a public service body to a public servant for his or her services as a public servant.  This definition draws on the definitions in the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.  Under these definitions, the deduction shall be made from the remuneration accruing from 1 March 2009 at the rates decided &mdash; a 3% deduction on the first &euro;15,000, 6% on the next &euro;5,000, and 10% on the remainder.  The deduction will not be paid by those with no entitlement to a public service pension.  In this context, three conditions broadly apply.  A person must be a public servant, must be working in a public service body and must be a member of a public service pension scheme or analogous arrangement.</P>
        <P>Section 4 provides that regulations are to be made relating to the deduction and collection arrangements and the deductions are to be paid into the Exchequer in accordance with the directions of the Minister.</P>
        <P>Section 5 provides that public servants, except the Permanent Defence Force which has particular terms and conditions, who have less than two years service on 1 March 2009 may before 1 April 2009 terminate their employment without giving notice, if they do not wish to make the deduction.  Deductions are to be repaid to those who leave the public service with no preserved pension benefit, that is, with fewer than two years service.  The Bill provides that no additional pension benefit is conferred by the deduction.  The Minister for Finance has power under section 8 to exempt certain groups from the deduction or to modify its extent if he is satisfied they are materially distinguished by some particular aspect of their employment terms from others subject to the deduction.</P>
        <P>The Government has decided that not only public service employees should contribute to tackling the serious problem of the deterioration in the public finances through a deduction from their remuneration, in that professionals providing services to the Government should also contribute their fair share through an 8% reduction in fees.  A twin track approach will be taken to secure this reduction.  To secure value for money, administrative steps will be taken by Departments and public bodies that engage the services of professionals through a public procurement process or that engage professional services on a scale of fees.  For professionals such as those engaged under the General Medical Services, GMS, scheme who traditionally <Col N="188"/>have had their fees and contracts determined through negotiation, this legislation provides for a separate process for reducing their fees.</P>
        <P>All Departments and public bodies under their aegis will be written to and instructed to revise the scale of fees for legal services downward by 8% from 1 March.  The Departments will also be required to review the notice and change provisions of all contracts for all professional services to give notice of a reduction in fees for services of an amount equivalent to 8% from 1 March.  Professionals who are unhappy with this approach will be given the option of withdrawing from their contracts and ending their provision of services.</P>
        <P>Sections 9 to 11 provide for a process of consultation, which will allow the Minister for Health and Children or any other Minister to determine payments for professional services in the case of contracts of indefinite duration, such as those under the GMS.  In the interests of fairness, the relevant Minister will be required to take account of the opinions of the professionals involved, their contracts, expenses and obligations and the exceptionally serious situation facing the public finances.</P>
        <P>The reduction of 8% in professional fees will be secured administratively for other professional services engaged on a scale of fees or on foot of a public procurement process to secure best value for money.  Departments and public bodies under their aegis will be required to review the notice and change provisions of all contracts for all professional services to give notice of a reduction in fees for services of an amount equivalent to 8% from 1 March.  Professionals who are unhappy with this approach will be given the option of withdrawing from their contracts and ending the provision of services.</P>
        <P>The savings will be made by reducing the Voted allocation for the Departments and bodies concerned in the Revised Estimates Volume when it is published.  I trust that all professionals who have and continue to enjoy the benefit of a substantial contribution to their incomes from taxpayer funds will fully co-operate with the steps being taken by the Government in the exceptional situation in which we find ourselves.</P>
        <P>Section 12 facilitates the payment of grants under the scheme of investment aid for farm waste management on a phased basis.</P>
        <P>An annual review of the operation of the measures in the Bill is provided for in section 13.  This will involve consideration of whether the Bill&rsquo;s provisions continue to be necessary and the making of findings as the Minister believes appropriate.  A report of the review will be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.  It is considered wise to make this provision when introducing measures applying to some 330,000 people.</P>
        <P>Section 15 was introduced on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il.  This &ldquo;removal of doubts&rdquo; provision is similar to a provision in the Public Service Superannuation (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2004 and provides an avenue for dispute resolution in respect of whether a person comes within the scope of that Act.  The consultation referred to could, for example, be with another Minister or the Attorney General.</P>
        <P>The Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 and the Income Tax (Employments) (Consolidated) Regulations 2001 will be amended by section 16 to ensure the tax deductibility of the payment.  Public servants paying the new pension contribution will be treated for tax purposes in the same way as those making pension contributions in the private sector.  Contributions will be deducted from gross pay by employers before income tax, PRSI and health levies are calculated.  As such, pension contributions will be effectively relieved of tax at the marginal rate.  Public servants making additional voluntary contributions or other pension contributions will not be brought above the relevant Revenue limits as a result of the deduction.</P><Col N="189"/>
        <P>The Government decided the new pension-related deduction would apply to local authority staff.  It was also agreed that, to realise savings to the Exchequer, it is necessary to amend the Local Government Fund legislation.  Section 4 of the Local Government Act 1998 requires that the Exchequer contribution to the fund be increased annually in line with inflation.  Accordingly, section 17 of the Bill repeals section 4 of the 1998 Act and introduces a new provision under which the annual allocation is agreed between the Ministers for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and Finance.</P>
        <P>It is proposed under section 18 to amend the social welfare legislation that is the statutory basis for the early child care supplement, ECS, to provide for a reduction in the age limit for eligibility for the payment from five and a half years to five years and a reduction in the annual sum from &euro;1,104 to &euro;996.  These changes will result in savings of some &euro;77 million in a full year.</P>
        <P>When the ECS was first introduced in 2006, the age limit for eligibility was set at six years, the age at which school attendance becomes compulsory.  This was a generous approach, but most children start school between the ages of four and five years.  Given that the payment is specifically targeted towards parents caring for preschool children, it is considered the payment will continue to meet its target and to represent an important direct support for those parents.</P>
        <P>Following the enactment of this legislation and the imposition of the pension-related deduction, the Minister for Finance will make the necessary savings each year by bringing the proceeds to account as appropriations-in-aid for departmental Votes.  The net Exchequer grants for the health and education sectors and the Local Government Fund will be reduced by the amount of the contribution, with the proceeds of the deduction remaining with the relevant bodies and agencies.  The funding of these sectors will remain unchanged.  For 2009, the changes will be made in the forthcoming Revised Estimates Volume.</P>
        <P>The Bill asks public servants, professionals and other members of the community to contribute to the required expenditure measures.  It must be seen in a context in which all of those who are able to do so must shoulder some of the burden of solving the current national difficulties.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

	<P>As the Minister of State is well aware, there has been widespread opposition to the levy, which is considered to be inherently unfair, given the way in which it strikes at people on the lower income levels in the public and civil service.  The public views it as another piecemeal reaction by the Government to a serious financial crisis in the economy.  In acquiring some of the funding being sought by the Minister, the Civil Service and public service were easy targets.</P>
        <P>This is an income levy, not a pension levy, and is unrelated to pensions.  It is purely a means of taking additional income from civil and public servants.  How can calling it a pension levy be justified?  A public or civil servant may earn a significant income from over-time payments or allowances, which have no bearing on his or her pension upon retirement, but he or she must pay the levy on that income regardless.  It should be called what it is, namely, an income levy and not a pension levy.  This should be cleared up, as the truth is not being told.</P>
        <P>It was expected the Government&rsquo;s reaction would comprise a broader base and that more people would be asked to contribute.  We expected other taxes and reductions in services to be considered, but that has not been the case.  We have been told that an bord snip is considering the issues.  However, given the rate at which the finances are deteriorating, if the Government has plans to introduce further cuts, tax increases or borrowings, there is an urgent need for more open debate with those who represent the public, namely, the Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas, regarding what is happening.</P><Col N="190"/>
        <P>A sentence omitted from the Minister of State&rsquo;s speech to this House this evening, but which was included in the Minister for Finance&rsquo;s contribution to the other House, stated that he envisages that growth will regress for the next three years.  It is expected that growth will regress in our economy this year by 6% but hopefully this will not recur in 2010 or 2011.  Has the Department of Finance considered the impact on the economy were such a regression to take place over the next three years?  I refer to regression of 6% this year and to making projections for 2010 and 2011.  Only one year ago to the day, the former Minister for Finance and present Taoiseach, Deputy Cowen, envisaged growth rates of 2.5% for 2009 and higher growth rates for 2010 and 2011.  Consequently, for Members and the public to understand what will happen over the next couple of years, the Department of Finance should perform due diligence on the economy.  It should consider different rates of growth regression over the next couple of years so that we can understand the problem.</P>
        <P>This year the Government will be obliged to borrow &euro;30 billion.  The gap between Government expenditure and income will be at least &euro;20 billion and tax revenue will be &euro;10 billion lower than anticipated.  As for the Government&rsquo;s response that has appeared in the public domain thus far, namely, its two-four-four formation of &euro;2 billion this year, &euro;4 billion next year and &euro;4 billion in 2011, I noted in last night&rsquo;s debate that it is exactly the same as someone whose spending has gone out of control and who only makes the basic repayment on his or her credit card.  Even the Minister of State himself has noted that the interest on what we are borrowing at present is approaching &euro;4.5 billion.  Government debt is ratcheting up at an unbelievable rate and will reach more than 45% of GDP by the end of this year.  Shades of the 1970s are returning in this regard and that is what led us into such trouble in the 1980s.  We are selling off the family silver in that we are selling off the good name of Ireland Incorporated.  Essentially, we are running up debt rather than examining what has gone wrong with our expenditure.</P>
        <P>This worries me, because the Government is not in a position to have its debt reach 100% of GNP by the end of 2011, which was the point it reached in the 1980s.  This is because personal debt also is running at that level.  By personal debt, I mean that which has been incurred by ordinary men and women, who have borrowed for houses, mortgages and cars.  Their personal debt also is running at approximately 100% of GNP.  If one combines the ratcheting up our borrowing and the fact that our GNP is falling every year, which means we will reach that 100% figure faster, and if taxes are not increased or if Government spending is not controlled, the Government deficit also will accelerate and we could be borrowing &euro;23 billion this year, &euro;25 billion next year and an unknown quantity thereafter.  The problem with this financial crisis is that we do not know.  While I do not believe that anyone claims to be an expert and it is difficult to know what the final outcomes will be, the more information that can be made available to the public and exchanged between Members, the more realistic we can become regarding our position at the end of this year and the year after and the better we can face up to what has happened to our economy.</P>
        <P>At the outset of the Celtic tiger and possibly during the first five years of the Fianna F&aacute;il-Progressive Democrats Government, growth was focused on exports.  At some point during the lifetime of that Government, it switched to being driven by consumption within the internal market, which led to accelerated borrowing on everyone&rsquo;s part.  Although the Government received enormous tax takes, what did it do with them?  Government spending on public services accelerated at twice the rate of the growth level within the rest of the economy.  Public spending had gone out of control, while at the same time people were borrowing all around them.</P><Col N="191"/>
        <P>We are faced essentially with an economic crash in Ireland and I do not believe the figures as to what must be done to restore competitiveness in our economy have sunk home.  Ministers appear on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; or &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; and talk about restoring competitiveness in our economy, as well as preserving or creating jobs.  By the same token, however, this applies across the economies on this island.  Members should forget about Eastern Europe, as I have repeatedly pointed out the difference in pay between hospital consultants north and south of the Border.  This also applies to nursing staff and senior administration staff within the HSE, as an unbelievable difference exists between the pay of staff who provide health services on either side of the Border.  We are an indigenous group of people north and south of the Border, more or less.  However, the cost of providing such services is huge.</P>
        <P>If, for instance, one considers the minimum wage and the cost of labour within the hospitality industry, there are matters one must discuss.  While I do not know what we will do, we must talk about such issues.  I spoke to a hotelier who told me that costs for labour in the hospitality industry in the Republic are approximately 30% higher than in Northern Ireland.  The impact is that people from the United Kingdom and Ireland will begin to take their holiday and weekend breaks in Northern Ireland.  People will no longer go north of the Border simply for their shopping.  We are not facing up to such enormous contradictions between the two economies that share this island and I have not discerned suggestions from the Government as to how we may resolve this problem.  Although the economy went mad for a couple of years, it is not a bad economy and actually is quite solid.  However, if we are to correct the underlying problems, they must be dealt with quickly and we must be reasonable in respect of how we do so.  We must stay away from the piecemeal measures we have seen thus far.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This financial crisis also constitutes an enormous political crisis, although this issue has not quite entered the heads of the Government.  The Minister of State has stated that everyone is suffering in this regard and that the more income one makes, the more one pays.  Nevertheless, there are a few minor measures that would make little or no difference to the actual outcome, but which would make the entire picture look different.  Can Members imagine how the public or international investors would have felt if two or three senior executives at Anglo Irish Bank had been led out of their headquarters in handcuffs on the morning of the Garda raid?  When this happened at Enron in the United States, where people were marched out by federal officers in handcuffs facing charges of white-collar crime, it had a dramatic effect.  Although it made no difference to the outcome, it made a great difference to people&rsquo;s perceptions that something was being done in their name.</P>
        <P>The Bill proposes taking what to the Minister of State are small amounts of money from people on low incomes.  However, no consideration has been given to the case of retired civil servants who, having retired from the Civil Service, are appointed to new jobs within the public and Civil Service and are paid a wage for their new job, while collecting their pension for their previous jobs.  Ministers also do this and ministerial pensions are generous, to say the least.  Even our ex-Taoiseach is engaged in this practice.  He has a substantial pension and still draws a Deputy&rsquo;s salary as a public servant.  While I accept this is only a minor matter, such measures also should have been included in this legislation.  The Government should consider these matters because this simply constitutes another form of double payment that people are making to themselves and it should be taken into account.  While the Minister of State might say that the amounts involved would be very small and would not be worth the Government&rsquo;s while, it would make a difference to perceptions regarding our common suffering in this respect.</P>
        <P>The actions taken by the Government are striking people&rsquo;s pay packets without effectively addressing the problems they are apparently designed to tackle.  For example, I have called on several occasions for the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, to come to the House and tell us whether she agrees that there are too many administrators in the Health <Col N="192"/>Service Executive.  Since her announcement that she intends to reduce staffing in the health service by 1,000, we have had the director of finance at the Health Service Executive and various Ministers speaking about this initiative on the radio.  All that is happening, however, is that beds are being closed in hospitals throughout the State, home help services are being scaled back and people are being told they will no longer be able to access physiotherapists and other health care professionals because the funding is not available.  The cutbacks taking place in the health service are quite savage.  For example, Wexford General Hospital has lost 10% of its beds.  In the meantime, however, not one administrator, let alone 1,000, has been removed.  This is the type of injustice that will turn the public completely against the Government.  There is little evidence that its actions are carefully considered.  The changes being made are relatively easy to implement but they will have little positive impact in the long term.  The same applies in the case of many of the cutbacks in education.  Again, the relatively easy options are being taken but these actions target the wrong people.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am disappointed that my time is almost up as I hoped to obtain answers from the Minister of State to the questions which were put to him in the other House.  How does the Government propose to stabilise the public finances?  Will we have a broad debate in both Houses on how this will be achieved?  What does the Government intend to do about the failure of the repeatedly promised reform agenda throughout the public service?  What does it propose to do in the area of jobs protection?  There is much talk but few concrete proposals as to how employment will be protected in the mainstream economy as distinct from the Civil Service and public service.  The debate on job losses tends to degenerate into a question of private sector versus public sector.  I am not in favour of that type of dichotomy.  However, there are large numbers of jobs in the mainstream economy which also require protection.  The Government has offered promises in this regard but no policy details.</P>

	<P>This Bill does exactly what it says on the tin.  It is interesting to hear Opposition Members set out all the actions the Government must take to restore our economy, yet they will not support the effort which is clearly in this Bill to do exactly that.  This is despite the inclusion in the Title of the Bill of the words &ldquo;emergency&rdquo; and &ldquo;public interest&rdquo;, which is an accurate reflection of the nature and objectives of the legislation.</P>
        <P>I begin by acknowledging the excellent work performed by the public service through the decades.  Since the foundation of the State, it has been true to its founding principles.  The State would not be in the position it is today were it not for the good work of the public service through the difficulties of the Depression years, the Emergency years and through the 1950s.  It was Dr. Whitaker and Se&aacute;n Lemass, working together, who started us on the road to economic recovery in the 1960s.  In recognising the value of the public service, I merely offer what is due.  Public service workers are a fine group and I am proud to be an elected member of that group.  I strive always to do my best in that role, just as I see others in the public service performing their duties in a highly professional manner.</P>
        <P>There has always been a benchmark between the public service and the wider economy.  It was never intended that any member of the public service should be significantly better or worse off than a comparable employee in the private sector.  The objective was always that there be equivalence.  That equivalence must now be judged in the light of our current economic difficulties.  None of us takes pleasure in these measures and we all wish we were in a different position.  However, we are where we are.  Current challenges arise not because of the actions of the Government but as a consequence of international events.  It was clearly stated by the Government that a downturn in the construction industry was expected.  This was factored into its considerations.  There was talk for many months of a soft landing and how we should prepare <Col N="193"/>for that.  That soft landing would have happened had events not overtaken us.  Developments in the international economy have put us in a position far worse than any of us could possibly have anticipated.</P>
        <P>The Government is taking the measures outlined in this Bill in order to redress an immediate imbalance in the public finances.  It is not possible for any state to borrow on a continuing basis as much as we will need to borrow on a day-to-day basis this year.  Therefore, we have taken immediate action to ensure that, over time, we will once again be in a fiscally sound position.  This legislation represents the beginning of that process.  As such, I welcome its introduction.  This Bill results from not a knee-jerk reaction but rather a proper assessment of the situation which involved, as much as possible, an effort to bring the social partners with us and to ensure all parties were on board.</P>
        <P>The reality is that 1,000 jobs are being lost every day.  We must match that reality with appropriate supportive actions.  There can be no question of waiting until everything is perfect before we accept what must be done.  There is little point in focusing exclusively on what has happened in the banking system.  Nobody can deny that serious, probably criminal, abuses have taken place.  However, that does not mean we can wait until the world is perfect before implementing measures that require to be implemented immediately.  There is a tendency for people to say that while they accept there must be changes in taxation, reduced spending and increased levies, those changes must not affect them personally.</P>
        <P>Unfortunately, we are not in a position to look at it that way.  Everybody must share the pain but this is being done in a progressive way.  A person on the average industrial wage pays very little income tax.  While workers here are liable for no tax on the first &euro;18,000 of their earnings, their counterparts in the United Kingdom pay tax on all income above &euro;6,800.  In the case of a worker on the average industrial wage, who will pay social insurance and some tax, the net tax wedge after the transfer of other funding from the State is a negative position.  In other words, such a person, in either the public or private service, is receiving more money from the Exchequer through State supports than he or she must hand over in tax and social insurance.</P>
        <P>Earlier today, the President of the European Central Bank, Mr. Jean-Claude Trichet, pronounced his belief that Ireland has the strength to ride out the economic downturn and that we are well placed to benefit from the eventual recovery in the global economy.   Unfortunately, there has been much negative comment on our economy, particularly from commentators who look to the City of London as their model.  It is surprising they should do so given that this is where we can find the people who are partially responsible for current difficulties.  The pride of the Lehman Brothers, the call of the masters of the universe, have been shown to be false.  These people thought they knew everything but their world has collapsed around them.  That was inevitable.  It is disingenuous for such people to talk down the Irish economy.  They are utterly incorrect in their pronouncements.</P>
        <P>In response to suggestions that Ireland may default on its debt, Mr. Trichet said he would &ldquo;not comment on absurd assumptions&rdquo;.  He asserted full confidence in the Government to make the appropriate policy choices to convince everyone that there will be &ldquo;a sustainable handling of the fiscal policy&rdquo;.  He went on to say he trusted the Government and the Minister for Finance to operate the appropriate fiscal policy to prove we are acting prudently.  The President of the European Central Bank thinks we are on the correct path and we are.  I hope we are not talking only about cuts because we are aware that we must re-engage with the social partners as soon as possible.  Social partnership has been hugely beneficial in bringing Ireland to where it is and we will need social partnership again because we are certainly not getting support from the Opposition.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Social partnership has proved to be hugely beneficial and, if we need to make adjustments, it is incumbent on us to ensure that when this passes over us we remember those who made the cuts, the savings and the sacrifices.  Some 120,000 people marched and they genuinely felt that something needed to be done.  We must take action, it is very easy to make a decision when one has no choice.</P>
        <P>This Government has started on a programme of economic recovery.  It reduced Government expenditure in July 2008 because it saw tax revenue falling sharply.  The budget brought forward measures to stabilise the public finances.  The Government introduced a system whereby bank deposits were guaranteed.  We published a plan for a medium-term recovery, Building Ireland&rsquo;s Smart Economy.  It was the right thing to do to invest at a time when it is more difficult but necessary.  We did this in the 1960s when we invested in education and it paid off to a great extent.  We nationalised Anglo Irish Bank because it was systemic to the Irish economy and not, as was stated by the Labour spokesperson on finance, because the bank was a friend of Fianna F&aacute;il.  Words take flight and they have meaning.  With the international markets as nervous as they are now, it did this country no service to suggest the Government would nationalise the bank because its friends were involved.  This put us at some point lower than a banana republic.  We continue to engage with the social partners and I hope that process re-opens.</P>
        <P>The measures taken now and those that will be taken will be seen as the steps that took us closer to recovery.  The current Swedish Prime Minister, who was finance minister in the 1990s when Sweden had a banking crisis, told the country that it needed to cut pay by 4% and increase taxation by 4%.  Within three years Sweden had started on the road to recovery.  In good times people forget the bad and in bad times people forget the good.  We are less than one year into this recession and it feels like ten years already.</P>
        <P>We are starting from a base from which we can work well.  One part of this is our tax base, which is solid but, over time, we will need to spread the tax base.  Some 38% of workers are entirely exempt from income tax.  The top 20% pay 77% of all income tax.  It is not iniquitous to have a progressive tax system, it is just.  Some 2.5% of the top income payers pay one third of all income tax.  The top 6.5% pay half of all income tax and the top 12.5% pay two thirds.  This proves that we are committed to fairness and equity.  We have also made suggestions on reductions of 8% in fees.  This is only right when the economy is slowing down and I am sure it will be taken on board.  There is a ready acceptance that something needs to be done and we are doing it.  There is also a reduction of &euro;100 on the &euro;1,100 social welfare payment to parents of children up to the age of six years.  This is correct and when there is deflation in the economy social welfare payments have had a significant increase this year, beyond the 3% increase and including the extra 2% of deflation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The actions we are taking are the first steps on the road to recovery and I call on the Opposition to play its part in supporting them.  It is ironic when we think back to the 1980s.  Despite the fact that a Government fell in 1981 on taxing children&rsquo;s shoes, when Fine Gael went back into government in 1982 there was public acceptance of the need for fiscal prudence.  It was one of Fine Gael&rsquo;s best results.  I accept that people find it hard to accept the initial pain.  In the full and certain knowledge that this Government is totally committed to fairness and equity and to the idea that all should share the burden equally, an idea to which the Taoiseach is committed, we will benefit and the Opposition would benefit if it took on board the reality that the public is sensible enough to know, namely that we are doing our best for <Col N="195"/>the economy.  The Opposition should come on board and support the Government in what is a national emergency to ensure we put our finances on a sound footing.  We are losing 1,000 jobs per day and we must get back.  If the President of the ECB said we were on the right path, who am I to say we are not?  I am certain that we are.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to share time with the Senator Quinn.  I welcome the Minister of State but with lukewarm enthusiasm.  I listened with interest to Senator Ross, who has led this debate in this House and on the back page of his newspaper, this morning when he said it would be an indication of the Government&rsquo;s seriousness if the Minister for Finance, Deputy Lenihan, came to the House.  He did not intend disrespect to the Minister of State.  He appealed to the Minister for Finance to do so and hoped the Minister of State would not take the debate because that would be an indication the Government was rushing this legislation through.  There are other indications, both in the structure of the speech and in its delivery, that suggest this is the case.</P>
        <P>I have just come from Trinity College, where I was speaking on a motion about the attitude of the Roman Catholic church to sexuality.  In one curious way this seems to fit into that debate.  If one makes an acronym of the Bill, the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Bill, it becomes FEMITPIB, which almost sounds like the female condom.  One could see this as the tax or revenue equivalent of such an instrument because its workings are completely uncertain.  There are various views on whether it is an income levy or a tax; it seems to straddle both.  One of the problems is that it is very unfair.  People would accept legislation if it was fair but this patently is not and the language of the Minister of State makes it clear it is a matter of indifference to the Government whether it is fair.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">9 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Money is being extracted from people who simply cannot afford to pay it.  There is plenty of anecdotal evidence.  I am prepared to pay and many people who can afford it are prepared to pay.  A woman who was recently separated, left with three children, is a civil servant and approached MABS for advice.  She is living on that advice and does not have enough money to go to the cinema once a month or to buy a packet of cigarettes once a week.  What is she to do?  She will have to borrow the money and she is in a trap.  That is madness, in my humble opinion.  All Members have received e-mails.  I received one from a man who says he will emigrate, such is the impact on him.  He would be prepared to pay an increase in taxation.  Why do we not have that?  He suggests there will be unrest if tax is imposed on top of a levy.  That is one of the problems, it is a piecemeal approach.  The Government was not sure about the most basic elements.  Two Cabinet Ministers contradicted each other as to whether this applied to gross or net income.  At least the Minister of State has spelled out that it applies to gross income.  At least we have that degree of certainty but it is not much to rely on in this kind of crisis.  The Minister of State indicated the kind of crisis in the language used, which is quite apocalyptic.  He refers to exceptional circumstances.  There is certainly an awareness of that critical situation.</P>
      
        <P>One of my correspondents has stated that a tax increase would be preferred.  There is a suggestion of a 4% increase in 2009, which would yield &euro;1.48 billion, 3% in 2010 yielding &euro;1.01 billion and 4% in 2011 yielding &euro;1.53 billion.  That would produce the &euro;4 billion from the PAYE system.  There is a suggestion for a draconian 95% on anybody getting over &euro;400,000.  That is what happened in Britain in the 1970s and we may have to squeeze the fat cats.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State&rsquo;s speech was fatally dull and the figures were anaesthetising when they were separated from the apocalyptic language.  His speech referred to an exponential increase in the budget deficit.  If it is a budgetary problem, let us have a budget.  We need a comprehensive approach to the matter.</P>

	<P>The Minister of State spoke about using figures from the Department of Finance, but when did the Department of Finance last get any figures right?  I cannot remember, as the Department seems to be permanently wrong.  Where were those people for the past seven years?</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>As we are firing people from the banks, how about firing a few people from the Department of Finance?  There is also the matter of the social partners.  It is obscene that people are taking 3% or 6% pay increases and saying they got them under the agreement.  Nobody should be taking an increase of any kind, private or public.  That should be made clear before we start taking anything from people.  We can do that afterwards.  I do not know how anybody would have the brass neck, in these circumstances, to take any pay increase.  Although they are legally entitled to it, they are not morally entitled to it.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State indicated:</P>
        <P LI="1">For example, taking account of all taxes and other mandatory stoppages such as income tax, PRSI, standard pension contribution, the health and income levies and the new pension-related deduction, an unmarried public servant earning &euro;20,000 a year &mdash; and no full-time employee earns less &mdash; will pay 11% of his gross income in total deductions when the new deduction is introduced.  An equivalent public servant earning &euro;100,000 a year will pay total deductions of 43%.</P>
        <P FLI="0">These are all percentages and there is no understanding of the impact on somebody living on the barest margins of a 1% increase.  Issues are being compared mathematically, arithmetically and in a Dickensian way that shows no comprehension of the human reality underneath.  I find that distressing.</P>
        <P>Considering the language in the speech, we have the same phrase time and again along the lines, &ldquo;It has been said that someone earning &euro;30,000 will pay a higher percentage of their salary than somebody earning &euro;45,000.&rdquo;  It is as if by stating, &ldquo;It has been said&rdquo; the Government is excused from a proper explanation.  The explanation we get is that it must be understood that this is due to the operation of tax relief.  Big bloody deal, as it still pinches the people.  Stating the mechanism by which it is done does not prove that it is fair, just, appropriate or acceptable from the people&rsquo;s perspective.  I do not believe for one minute that it will be accepted.</P>
        <P>I made a very restrained intervention when the Minister of State stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">Against that background, the Government those in secure pensionable employment and with Government-guaranteed pensions to make their contribution towards addressing both today&rsquo;s difficulties, and the longer-term sustainability challenges facing public service pensions. . . .</P>
        <P FLI="0">That does not mean anything.  It is completely absurd and total nonsense.  Although he probably did not hear me, I asked the Minister of State if we could have a verb.  I am rather partial to verbs and an occasional verb here and there does tend to help make sense of a sentence.</P>

	<P>I am referring to page ten of the Minister of State&rsquo;s script, in which he deals with section 1.  He spoke about the definitions of public service bodies as &ldquo;the Civil Service, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Permanent Defence Force, local authorities, the Health Service Executive, the Central Bank&rdquo;.  In this regard I draw the Minister of State&rsquo;s attention to a case from the Supreme Court, the Central Bank of Ireland <i>v</i>. Martin Leo Gildea from 14 March 1997.  In the judgment, the Supreme Court found as follows concerning the status of the defendant:</P>
        <P LI="1">He is not a member of the staff of any of the organs of State created by the Constitution and accorded a role in the constitutional order separate and distinct from the three organs of Government, Legislative, Executive and Judicial, such as the Attorney General.  He is not a civil servant in any of the Departments responsible to the individual Ministers who constitute the Government and hence is not a &ldquo;civil servant of the Government&rdquo; and thus a person &ldquo;employed [...] under the State.&rdquo;  He is employed by a body which has been created by statute, the powers of which, however essential they may be to the functioning of the State, can be removed from them at any stage by the Oireachtas.  He is thus in no different position from those employed in a vast range of what have come to be called &ldquo;semi-State bodies&rdquo;, the employees of which may, by specific legislative provision, be deemed to be civil servants but who, in the absence of any such provision, are not to be so regarded.</P>
        <P FLI="0">It seems from this that the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland should not be mentioned in the body but put in the Schedule, where one finds all the other semi-State bodies to which the court refers.  It seems this mis-classification is a result of a desire to fine the employees of the Central Bank.  I have put down an amendment to remedy this difficulty.  I look forward to hearing what the Minister of State has to say about this and many other matters.</P><Col N="198"/>
        <P>The Minister of State should address a real financial issue, the fact that rents in central Dublin are skyrocketing under the reviews.  We have an absurd position in that rents can only be reviewed upwards.  People like Pia Bang are going bust and getting out.  The city is full of shuttered shops and we must consider the issue.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Norris for allowing me to share time with him.  I met a widow at Christmas whose husband died some years ago.  She received practically no pension this Christmas.  Those with guaranteed pensions and those who are State employees have something very valuable.  I have just used the word &ldquo;guaranteed&rdquo; but such pensions and jobs are not guaranteed because if this country goes bankrupt, even pension and dole cheques could bounce.  The public does not realise the very serious position we are in.</P>
        <P>Senator Hanafin spoke of Mr. Trichet, whose speech I attended today.  He spoke with great confidence about Ireland but we do not realise the serious nature of our position.  We must tackle our serious budget deficit.  The Government has indicated there must be cuts in expenditure, leading to measures like this.  We will have a pension levy now and there will be an increase in taxation next year.</P>
        <P>I appreciate the Minister of State&rsquo;s indication that this Bill has been brought forward in light of the unprecedented economic challenges now facing the country.  He also indicated that painful decisions must be implemented as a matter of urgency.  We are taking one bite now, which is hoped to save us approximately &euro;2 billion, and we will wait until later this year or next year for the Commission on Taxation to tell us when the next steps will be taken.  If this is a serious matter, I do not understand why we are not taking the necessary steps now.  The country was ready for this last October and last month.</P>
        <P>In business, if there are tough decisions to be made and a crisis is to be faced, one can go to the employees, open the books and indicate how serious the problems are and how tough medicine must be taken.  I have found that generally that medicine will be accepted, as long as it seems fair and even-handed.  That is not understood by the Government.</P>
        <P>Our economic position is worsening and we need massive budget cuts.  The Government is going about these spending cuts in the wrong way.  Taking small bites &mdash; such as the pension levy on public sector workers &mdash; is not the best strategy on its own.  The Government has indicated the wealthy will have to take a hit further down the line when the Commission on Taxation reports later in the year but they are not being seen to be hit now.  Therein lies the problem.  Those in the public sector believe they are being unfairly targeted and consider there is an imbalance in that not everybody is being hit.  If everybody was seen to bear an equal part of the burden, people would be much more supportive.  The PAYE tax marches of the 1980s were based on the idea that PAYE workers were bearing more than their fair share of correction in the public finances.  People were scared about the future in 1987 and they were willing to take cuts if they believed they were fair.  That situation has not changed.  People still want a fair deal.</P>
        <P>Our deficit is more than &euro;20 billion.  The Government proposes to save &euro;2 billion this year, &euro;4 billion the year after and so forth.  It would have been much fairer to start with a reduced deficit now of, say, &euro;5 billion when people were willing to accept it.  It would have been seen to be fair and everybody would be playing a role in addressing it.  Amazingly, the T&aacute;naiste said yesterday the public finances are &ldquo;under control&rdquo; and ruled out further spending cuts or changes to the tax regime until next year&rsquo;s budget.  She said, &ldquo;spending cuts of &euro;2 billion this year have been found and the Government is working on a plan to reduce spending by &euro;4 billion next year&rdquo;.  Where is the urgency in that?  Is she the only person in Ireland or the world who believes this?  The only possible explanation I can think of for this sort of talk is that it is <Col N="199"/>for international consumption.  We need action now, sooner rather than later, rather than this sort of attitude.  The Government needs to spell out to all of us how bad our situation is.</P>
        <P>I heard Mr. Trichet speak today and I believe he was being too optimistic because we can see what is happening elsewhere.  Peter Sutherland pointed out in an article in <i>The Irish Times </i>the day before yesterday that there is an unexpected inequality when it comes to the present tax system and that less than 10% of taxpayers contribute half of all income taxes.  In regard to most if not all of those earning above &euro;70,000 a year, we will need to adopt a new realism because the required tax rises and the scale of them will be much greater than heretofore.  Cuts such as the pension levy will not be enough.</P>
        <P>I read a European Commission document published last week which estimates the pension levy will save only 0.5% of GDP on an annualised basis.  That is a long way from the Government&rsquo;s objective and prediction of a saving of 1.4% of GDP.  The Government argues our percentage of national debt is not as bad as it was for instance in the 1980s and that is correct.  That is such a complacent attitude to take that it is plainly not the issue.  Our real debt is the issue.  The situation is very serious but that message is not being conveyed to the public.  People can only get a view of the real situation by reading more.</P>
        <P>A recent article in the<i> Financial Times</i> states that &ldquo;Last week speculators bet on an Irish default, and these bets made it more expensive for Ireland to refinance its debt, thus threatening to turn into a self-fulfilling prophecy&rdquo;.  The comment by the financial historian Niall<?oasys _jy ?>Ferguson was different.  He said:</P>
        <P LI="1">Europe&rsquo;s prospects could get a whole lot worse this year, to the extent that it could be very, very hard indeed to keep the euro zone together. . .</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">There will be howling anguish, all kinds of pain, conflict between Germans and the others.  It&rsquo;s going to get very uncomfortable indeed.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I cite these comments because there is a belief that because we are in the eurozone we are safe and that everything is all right.  We cannot rely on the euro being able to hold the countries in the eurozone together, if we are the ones who are defaulting.</P>

What if a person goes to cash his or her social welfare cheque next year and it bounces?  What happens if one&rsquo;s dole payment bounces?  What happens if a person goes to pay for his or her groceries by cheque but the grocer says he cannot accept it because the cheque the customer gave him last week bounced?  I hate threatening these things but there is a danger that countries can go bankrupt.  We need to solve this crisis and to do so fairly quickly.  The citizens of Ireland will take the tough medicine now, but the Government should not ask them to take minor medicine now, heavier medicine next year and heavier medicine the year after.  If we take the tough medicine now and get it over with, I believe we can get the economy back on track.  </P>

	<P>How can the Government hope to get any support for its measures if people do not know how bad the situation is, if they are told that the public finances are, as was said by the T&aacute;naiste yesterday, &ldquo;under control&rdquo; and they see taxes allocated in an unfair manner?  The Government needs to show leadership and implement fair steps now across the public and private sector.  These have to be harsher otherwise we will not have a functioning economy very soon.</P><Col N="200"/>
        <P>I suggest the Bill does not go far enough.  I listened to Mr. Trichet speak today and of course I accept that we can succeed.  I do not want to sound negative.  I am optimistic and I think I am realistic.  I believe we can succeed, but we have to spell out the scale of problem.  If a doctor tells a person he or she will become very ill or die if he or she does not take some nasty medicine, he or she would take the medicine rather than become very ill or die.  The Government has to tell us that the economy is in a very difficult situation, that it is very ill, so to speak, but that the medicine we could take will make it better, that it will be difficult to take but if we take it now, we will find the economy will be in a healthy state next year.  I encourage the Minister of State to take those steps.</P>

	<P>I wish to share some of my time with Senator Harris.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>That is agreed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Senator Ivor Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>The measures contained in the Bill are exceptional and we should acknowledge that the road we are travelling without the support of the social partners is not of our choice alone.  The economic and financial difficulties facing the Government are different in nature from anything we have ever experienced previously and that is the reason exceptional measures are necessary.  The measures are designed to bring order and help balance our public finances.  It reflects the determination of this side of the House to implement Government decisions, albeit painful ones, but failure to act decisively would be negligence on our part.  We must take a responsible and sensible view of the grim reality that prevails.  By and large there is agreement on the need to take exceptional action by those who understand the difficulties that confront us.  The Taoiseach, T&aacute;naiste, Minister for Finance and Government colleagues have consulted widely, there has been careful assessment of the extent of our problems and recognition of the exceptional effort it will take to improve the situation.</P>
        <P>It is difficult for the ordinary man or woman, young or old, to understand the seriousness of the situation.  Unless there is an understanding and an appreciation of the facts, the general public will continue to express their dismay, which will fuel further anxiety and alarm.  I ask the Minister of State to put into the public domain a clear and succinct picture of the scale of the problem and the recovery plan.  An important part of the plan is the recovery period.  Like the previous speaker and others, I believe the recovery period should be short and sharp.</P>
        <P>In layman&rsquo;s language, this year the Government&rsquo;s outgoings will be approximately &euro;55 billion, our income is expected to be approximately &euro;37 billion, leaving a shortfall of approximately &euro;18 billion.  The question is from where can we get the &euro;18 billion required.  Like most people who find their outgoings exceed their income, they check how they can rebalance outgoings with income.  We can foolishly and solely travel the road to increase our income and let our outgoings continue regardless.  I will quickly explore increasing our income side.  Do we do more business with our trading partners or do we generate billions of euro in additional taxes?  The sad reality is that those countries with which we trade are all going through an exceptionally turbulent period and at this time there is no extra business to generate the level of extra income required.  Our tax take is decreasing.  Unemployment and social welfare demands are increasing at a time when our financial institutions need billions of euro of taxpayers&rsquo; money to keep our banking sector operational.  The reality check of our current situation is that the economy is simply not providing us with the resources required to meet the demands the community as whole are placing on it to the extent of an &euro;18 billion shortfall this year alone, which will have to be borrowed.</P>
        <P>There must be an appreciation of this fact and an acceptance by all to resolve our difficulties with widespread public consensus.  As a first step, this Bill calls on a number of sectors to help <Col N="201"/>resolve our difficulties with one of the primary areas being public service pay and pensions.  Given the relative size of the Government&rsquo;s &euro;55 billion outgoings and its shortfall in income of &euro;18 billion, this is the right first step.  I believe the public will sign up to an acceptance to resolve our difficulties in a fair, open and transparent fashion, once the new coping classes of the lower and middle income earners are not being burdened much more than the higher income groups.  A mechanism should be put in place so that everyone feels part of the plan and shares some level of the pain.  There is an acceptance by the majority of people to participate.  The Minister of State, in referring to the pensions, said: &ldquo;The deduction is progressive, as people on higher incomes will continue to pay proportionately more than those on lower incomes.&rdquo;  It is very important to get this message out as my concern is the escalation of social and industrial unrest.  With social and industrial unrest there is no gain, only pain.</P>
        <P>We are at a point in our history where our ability to come together in difficult times has never been more important.  The answers to our difficulties are not beyond our reach.  We should not underestimate our challenge or overstate our difficulties, but face them together with unity of purpose, firmness of resolve and a belief in our ability to overcome difficulties, succeed and remain positive.</P>
        <P>In the recent past, Ireland has proved it is capable of enormous success on the world stage.  We have achieved success beyond measure and beyond the expected capacity of a nation of our size.  The sober, cold and stark reality is that the global recession has weakened our position, public confidence is shaken and the level of uncertainty is frightening.  It is our responsibility and duty as Members of this House to confront this challenge boldly, restore hope and confidence, take charge of our future and make the difficult choices to restore our economy.</P>
        <P>Now is the time for a universal commitment by all the people to help each other so that we can pull ourselves out of the current difficulties.  We all have a stake in each other&rsquo;s commitment and success because the more each individual succeeds, the more Ireland succeeds.  Together we can and will resolve our current difficulties.  It requires change and sacrifice by all.  We have never been afraid to adapt to changing circumstances.  We owe it to ourselves and to future generations to rebuild and recover.  In our recovery we will emerge a stronger, more progressive and more prosperous nation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EoghanHarris"><NameTxt>Senator Eoghan Harris</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Callely and wish to develop one of his most important points which is the need to draw people in.  I will not discuss gloom and doom tonight.  The Minister of State, like the entire Cabinet, is showing the signs of the long days and nights.  I do not know from where they get their stamina; they certainly earn their few bob.</P>
        <P>I appeal to the Minister of State, because he will understand, that the recovery programme or fightback be tailored to the national psyche.  We are not Swedes or Germans or people who like the long haul.  The genius of Irish people is in improvisation.  One will see in any town or village in Ireland that people hate being told that Monday five months from now, they are going to lift the boat from the harbour or do something else.  I have seen people in west Cork do that in one night in a hurry with pontoons because they want to get on with it.  We are bored by plans such as giving up smoking in March 2015.  That is not us.</P>
        <P>The two letters &ldquo;FF&rdquo; should stand for &ldquo;Fast, fast&rdquo;.  Everything should be faster.  What we particularly need to do is draw people in to a national programme of recovery that suits the Irish psyche.  Our people should be drawn in by small measures.  The young generation could be drawn in by putting a penny on every text.  The banks should be required to supply free textbooks to schools for the next ten years to pay back some money.  We should do imaginative things such as leaving the unfinished Anglo Irish Bank headquarters on the Liffey unfinished as a monument to everything that went wrong.  We should forget about school uniforms for a <Col N="202"/>while and they should not be mandatory so as to lift that burden from people.  We should ask retired teachers to come back and act as special needs teachers.</P>
        <P>There are many things we can do.  There should be a designated Minister to do imaginative things to draw people in as they were drawn in during the Emergency.  This may not sound fashionable but the people of Ireland actually enjoyed the Emergency.  There is an upside to the current situation.  The recession is a grim reaper and is exposing a lot of the fat-cattery, so to speak, that went on in this country.  A lot of reform is going on and a lot of good stuff is happening.</P>
        <P>We should draw in young, middle aged and older people.  Why not ask old age pensioners if they want to pay a voluntary fare of &euro;1 on public transport provided it is linked to a job?  I know many elderly people and old age pensioners who would be happy to give a euro if they thought it would create a job in the private sector.  We should start linking these levies.  I think there should be many more of them and the Government did not cut deep enough.</P>
        <P>Above all, it is very wrong that the Government intends to draw this pain out.  It is bad and I appeal to the Minister of State to talk to his colleagues about it.  The pain should not be extended over four or five years.  Irish people get bored and annoyed by these long timescales.  Let us have the misery over with now, and fast.  The hard stuff should be done over the next two years.  Let us really live with tight belts buckled tight now.  Let us not drag it out.  We should have more levies and an increase in taxation.</P>
        <P>I heard Cathal MacCoille on RTE the other morning and he was effectively appealing to the T&aacute;naiste to get on with the job, stop drifting and dig in deep.  He is speaking for many of us.  Many people would rather get it over with now than drag it out.  We are not Germans.  We do not want 30-year plans.</P>

	<P>Bravo.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Senator Michael McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State.  People throughout the country are sitting around kitchen tables discussing the downturn in our economic fortunes.  Many of them have lost their jobs and those of them who were not unlucky enough to lose their jobs are earning much less.  They are still paying the same bills, struggling to pay mortgages, send children to school and trying to make ends meet.  There is a whole generation of people who have never had to countenance such a situation</P>
        <P>There are people who never had to seriously consider emigration.  There are people who do not realise what the tax rates were.  I went to school back in the 1980s when income tax was at 60%, interest rates were 22% and thousands of people were leaving our shores every week to seek better pay and conditions in other countries.  The country was in an economic mess.</P>
        <P Just="Left">For the first time ever, we are now in a situation that I believe is, quite frankly, much worse than obtained in the 1980s.  If one considers what people have had since and the level of personal debt, there are major pressures on people nowadays.  It is probably the most serious financial and economic crisis this country has ever witnessed.  There are many aspects of this Bill that merit vigorous and long debate.  It would be impossible in the short timeframe we have in this debate to make a lot of points so I will only make a few.</P>
        <P>The pension levy should be called what it actually is, which is a tax and a pay cut.  That is precisely what it is.  I made this point on the Order of Business.  The Government is legally prohibited from introducing a tax without introducing a budget.  Therefore, it introduced a pay cut or tax and called it a pension levy.  What this debate requires to begin with is a level of honesty.  Let us be honest with people.  This is a tax and not a pension levy.  It is a pay cut for thousands of public sector workers.</P><Col N="203"/>
        <P>We need not forget these are the very same people who were subjected to an income levy in the budget last October.  It is the second blow many of these workers have been dealt.  It is very regrettable that public sector workers have been singled out and targeted by this Government.  The income levy itself made a mockery of the social partnership process and the talks.  It was introduced at the eleventh hour.  There was no consultation.  In fact, some social partners were outside Government buildings late that morning and did not even get the courtesy of a visit from a Minister.</P>
        <P>It was put on the table and in all reason and reality could not possibly have been dealt with by any degree of debate.  It did not merit any level of attention because it was introduced so late.  The situation was to take it or leave it.  It was Hobson&rsquo;s choice.  There is a complete absence of fairness or balance in the pension levy and pay cut.  There is a wide body of belief that we are in deep economic trouble and a major effort is required by all to get us out of this mess.  A fair and balanced effort is required, but unfortunately this Bill is not it.</P>
        <P>Why are the people who have caused the turmoil not affected by this taxation?  Why are they getting off scot free?  Why are they not included in the remit of this legislation?  A common mantra among many Ministers is that we are all in this together.  If we are all in this together, where are the bank executives, the board executives, the property developers and the people who got us into this mess in the first place?  If we are all in this together, why is the chief executive officer of Bank of Ireland earning just under &euro;2 million per annum and why does he not pay a levy?  Why does he not pay a tax, albeit he is on a much lamented reduction from &euro;3 million to &euro;2 million?  Why is a public sector worker earning one eighth of what the CEO of Bank of Ireland earns paying &euro;1,000 in pension levy, which is actually a pay cut?  If we are all in this together, why is the Government not touching the 6,500 self-administered pension schemes which attract huge tax relief?  A national consensus could be reached and if we are to get out of this mess, it must be reached.  However, I would not hold out much prospect for economic recovery if there is not a genuine attempt to bring everybody on board.</P>
        <P>The week prior to this announcement, the Taoiseach said, albeit in the heat of the moment in the Lower House, that it was his way or the highway.  In many ways, that describes how this whole issue was approached.  The 11th hour Hobson&rsquo;s choice has aggravated people and has made them justifiably angry.</P>
        <P>There were a number of high profile comments from people in IBEC.  As Senator Norris rightly pointed out on the Order of Business last week, on Monday of last week a stockbroker from Davys had the temerity and the cheek to suggest that because there was negative inflation and prices had come down, we should reduce social welfare.  That is from a stockbroker who will never have to countenance living on just over &euro;200 per week.  He had the cheek to start to dictate to those on social welfare.  IBEC&rsquo;s solution was almost as ridiculous, that is, put more people on the dole and that will get us out of this mess.</P>
        <P>The much lauded speech the Taoiseach made to the Dublin Chamber of Commerce this night three weeks ago, which was partially broadcast on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; the following day, was a rousing one and received many plaudits from commentators.  Why did the Taoiseach not display the same level of enthusiasm and command of his belief in either the D&aacute;il or the Seanad?  The Dublin Chamber of Commerce is not an appropriate forum to start to explain our way out of the current difficult situation.</P>
        <P>Why have tax cuts over the past ten or 12 years favoured the super wealthy?  Why do we allow people who have made millions of euro from being Irish to avail of generous tax schemes whereby they do not contribute one single cent and behave like Cinderella, flying out of the country at 12 a.m.?  They can fly off to Washington and sing at Barrack Obama&rsquo;s inauguration, but I do not consider that patriotic, I consider it treason.</P><Col N="204"/>
        <P>Why did the Minister for Education and Science announce &euro;9 million in cuts in special education two weeks ago?  If we are serious about putting our shoulders to the wheel and expect the public to support cuts, we should not go into a special needs classroom and sack the teacher, or pick on the most vulnerable people in our society.  Any measures required to bring us out of this economic mess require fairness and balance.  There is a marked absence of fairness in all this.  Those who contributed most to this problem should be the ones to contribute most to the solution.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The march last Saturday, organised by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, when more than 100,000 people took to the streets of Dublin, the march by 3,000 members of the GRA yesterday &mdash; like it or lump it, that is democracy and they are entitled to air their views &mdash; the picket this morning by the CPSU and the level of support from private sector workers remind us that the wedge the Government has tried to drive between public and private sector workers has not worked.  That is a good thing in the sense that workers have united in the spirit of unity for fairness and balance.  It suits people to imply that public and private sector workers live on different planets.</P>
        <P>The bankers, the people who lent recklessly and irresponsibly, incentivised by generous salaries and bonuses, have yet to be held accountable.  We have bailed them out and they have not yet returned any guarantees.  There does not seem to be a system of accountability whereby those people have suffered.  I do not say that lightly.  I mean it in terms of accountability, that is, with salaries capped and no bonuses.</P>
        <P>Does the Minister realise that if a young garda is asked to do overtime by a chief superintendent, he or she is obliged to do it?  If he or she refuses, he or she is subjected to disciplinary action.  If a garda is around Trinity College at 2 a.m. or 3 a.m. dealing with a couple of drunken yobs, the money he or she earns for that hour will be subject to this levy.  The money he or she earns is not pensionable but it is now subject to pension levy.  Does the Minister accept that is unconstitutional?  Has the Government taken legal advice on this?  Has the Government any shame?  Has it any word of hope to offer the young teacher, the young nurse or the young garda who negotiated a mortgage in the past two to three years based on earnings which did not allow for the 1% income levy or the pension levy?</P>
        <P>Another example of the unfairness of this tax is that somebody earning &euro;37,000 will be required to pay &euro;1,960 in this pension levy, that is, tax cut, while somebody earning &euro;40,000 will pay &euro;1,622.50.  Does the Minister believe that is fair?  Does he accept that we will starve this country of a decent public service, whether the health service, with young nurses and midwives, or the police force?  Is he giving an advantage to criminals, who will now see a public sector police force that is not being given the resources it needs and a recruitment campaign that effectively has been abandoned?</P>
        <P>When will we see a jobs creation strategy and a jobs protection strategy from this Government?  In the past 12 months, more than 145,000 people have lost jobs.  If this is the first instalment in the Government trying to restore public finances, it has fallen at the first fence.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Senator Fiona O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  I listened to Senator McCarthy and I have no doubt he is very sincere in his concerns about those people he mentioned who took out mortgages based on certain levels of earnings.  It is all very well to make the case for those people and he is right to do so, but just as important are the 145,000 people who have lost their jobs and who must also make mortgage repayments.  Senator McCarthy is making an either-or case for people in the private sector or the public sector.  The difficulty is that we face a very grave situation.</P><Col N="205"/>
        <P>It has been very interesting to listen to the speakers.  The contributions got better as they went along.  Senator Quinn&rsquo;s contribution, in particular, was very good.  Senator Callely followed it with a great contribution, but Senator Harris took the biscuit altogether with a terrific contribution.  The case has been made for having somebody from the Seanad at the Cabinet table.  I would like to see Senator Harris there because he is full of bright ideas about how to save money.  He was also right in regard to this sense of a wartime spirit.  Talking to people around the country, there is a palpable sense that they are prepared to have tax increases because they want&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>

	<P>The Government has just ruled them out for this year.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Senator Fiona O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>If Senator Bacik would allow me to speak without interruption, I would come to the point.  As Senator Harris said, we must grasp this nettle fast and furiously.  It is not that long ago since the devastation of the 1980s.  None of us wants to go back to the 1980s.  In those years, if one could get the fare to leave the country, one would do so but things are so bad globally now there is nowhere to go and we must stay put and make the most of it.  That means dealing with this problem fast and furiously.  The Government must arrest the decline in the public finances.</P>
        <P>This is an important first measure.  The reaction is somewhat understandable, given the growth in the economy and the increases everybody got used to on a year on year basis, in particular those in the public sector.  People in the public sector were well rewarded as a result of benchmarking and because they enjoy job security, they have been asked to make a contribution.  Nobody likes to see a decrease in his or her income but the reality is we are in a terrible situation.  I applaud the Government for having the bottle to ask these people to take this measure.  I agree with those who say we need to see tax increases and the Minister has also said this.  It is never wise for a Minister for Finance to indicate there will be tax increases if they are not going to be fairly immediate.  The idea that he is going to wait until the next budget to implement the tax increases he mentioned yesterday is not wise.  I agree we need to deal with this quickly.  There is a sense in the public mood of the anger and annoyance of people.  They are facing into the unknown and when facing into the unknown, into uncertainty and into a declining financial income, they want to see tough measures and they want to see them fast.  Senator Quinn used a very good analogy about when one is ill, one does not want a slow and lingering death but, despite how unpalatable the medicine might be, one wants to take it so that one&rsquo;s recovery will be all the quicker and one will be able and adapted to deal with a recovery when it comes.  This is the reason the Government needs to respond to the public need for action in dealing with the finances.  This Bill is an important first step but the second half will be to look at how to expand the tax base.  My party, which is now in decline, has never espoused increases in taxation, particularly on labour.  However, we are in a situation where we need to expand the tax base in some shape or form.  We cannot deny and continue to spend in the way we are doing without increasing the tax base in some shape or form and it needs to be done.</P>
        <P>People need to be honest about what price they themselves are prepared to pay.  The trade unions are doing a very good job of using this argument of unfairness but I do not accept it.  If people look at the broader picture it is a progressive measure and all progressive tax measures are much fairer.  It should be on the basis of one&rsquo;s ability to pay and this is what is outlined in the Bill.</P><Col N="206"/>
        <P>I wish to make a point about the wartime spirit which has been referred to.  I do not think the Opposition has an easy job.  Members of the Opposition know they must be responsible because the day will come when they will be in Government.  However, when the Opposition is trying to show that sense of responsibility it will see the political advantage and will make overtures towards public sector workers at the moment and say this proposal is not good enough and is unfair but the Opposition is not saying what it would do.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>It never worried the Senator when she was in Opposition.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FionnaOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Senator Fiona O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>The fact the Leader of the Opposition had indicated there was a flight of capital and that the banks would be nationalised is not very good for the national interest abroad.  People sitting at market desks in international finance offices will say the Leader of the Opposition thinks the banks are going to be nationalised, let us just sell.  The Opposition has to think about the long-term interests of the country rather than just the political advantage that can be gleaned from a difficult situation like this.  We need to see that wartime spirit of working together.  I notice a different tone around the D&aacute;il in particular this week.  People in business are now getting on to politicians to say we should work together in dealing with this.  It is time we came together and dealt with this situation.</P>
        <P>I listened to the points made by Senator McCarthy.  It is grand to whinge about what is going wrong and about what measures should be taken but it is never said what measure they will take and there is a responsibility to do so.  It is not easy to be asking people to take cuts in their income but because it is in the national interest it must be done.</P>
        <P>Because of this wartime spirit and because it is so expensive now for Ireland to borrow money in the markets, the Government should consider issuing patriot bonds because Irish people want to see their country survive and thrive.  If it was made easy for people to buy these bonds I am sure older people in particular who might have a few pounds available would buy them if they were not crippled by inheritance tax.  Asking Irish people to invest in their own country has worked before and it has worked in other countries and we need to consider measures such as this.</P>

	<P>Like all the other speakers I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  He has been very faithful to this House.  I was going to refer to him as a man of the House but that would not be too kind given his status now.  Senator Norris referred to his speech being rather dull which may be the fault of the figures and the situation.  I refer instead to the speeches he wrote himself in a previous existence and supplied to people who were then in his position.  Senator Norris quoted Senator Ross who bemoaned the fact on the Order of Business today that we would not have the Minister for Finance in the House this evening.  He referred to the Minister for Finance as the real McCoy and did not think the Minister of State fitted the bill.  If I may say so in a kind way, I think this Minister of State is the real McCoy.</P>
        <P>I will move on to deal with this measure.  The watchword must be fairness and balance.  This pension levy must be fair in respect of people&rsquo;s ability to pay and this must be the acid test.  However, I think it starts too low.  It does not meet all the tests in regard to being fair and balanced.  I would have something to say about the public bodies and the reduction in professional fees.  It is not that I do not welcome a reduction in fees and value for money and <Col N="207"/>reducing costs, but it is the method proposed in section 9 of the Bill that I refer to.  There is no doubt that in our time, this is a unique crisis.  The national finances are sadly in a mess.  Of course we are all in this together to save our economy.  These are truly exceptional circumstances.  In a sense this is too easy a first step perhaps, it lacks comprehensiveness and it is missing an overall dimension.  I assure Senator Hanafin who referred to the Opposition as not being interested or committed to social partnership that of course we are and he might learn more of that tomorrow.  My party in particular and the Opposition in general is in touch with all the social partners and we are totally committed to fairness.  This Bill should provide for a review in the short term.  We hope we will not languish in this state of affairs forever.</P>
        <P>I can identify with much of what was stated by previous speakers.  Senator Quinn spoke about small bites.  However, small bites are not enough when the Government should have more front-loaded measures.  Senator O&rsquo;Malley referred to tough medicine and perhaps we should have this rather than the drip drip we seem to have.  Any good business model has a good comprehensive plan.  This measure lacks this with regard to an economic recovery plan.</P>
        <P>Like other speakers, I enjoyed Senator Harris and we always do.  He struck a chord when he spoke about drawing in people.  Of course he is correct.  Everybody wants to get on with it, we are all playing on the same side with regard to our economy, gaining stability in our banks and moving forward as quickly as we can.  I particularly liked his proposal and I am sure people would measure up to their patriotic duty.  Senator Harris spoke about retired teachers being willing to step into the breach and become special needs teachers or fitting the bill in whatever other respects they could and should and I have no doubt they would.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Malley gave us on this side of the House a slight lecture on responsibility.  I assure her and I think it is patently obvious that Deputy Richard Bruton&rsquo;s middle name is &ldquo;responsibility&rdquo;.  It is stamped all over us and the leader of our party, Deputy Enda Kenny.  I spoke here one day on something Senator O&rsquo;Malley touched on, namely, a national bond.  Call it what one will, a national recovery bond or whatever, I am sure people in our diaspora throughout the world would contribute to such a bond.  Senator O&rsquo;Toole spoke about such a bond approximately one month ago and I supported him at the time.  I felt a bond could come from the other side of the social partnership.  Several bonds could be put in place and they would all do well.  Perhaps this is what is needed.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State spoke about the Government needing to borrow &euro;18 billion this year at steep interest rates to finance capital spending.  He stated the national debt would rise to more than 45% of GNP and spending on interest costs will come to &euro;4.5 billion or 12% of total tax revenue in 2009.  These are frightening figures.  I have thought always, as I am sure have most Senators, that the first basic rule in economics is that we must cut our cloth according to our measure.  With regard to this, we know now that less than 10% of those paying income tax pay half of all of the income tax collected.  In recent days, I was surprised to learn we have 6,000 citizens&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I am sure a measure could be put in place by the Department of Finance or the Revenue Commissioners.  I feel many of these people want to contribute.  I would like to think they would.</P>

	<P>People on the other side of the House spoke about fast and furious action being needed and grasping the nettle.  I could not agree more with them.  This is what is needed.  However, what we have seen here, in particular during recent months, is Government by report.  It is waiting for the Commission on Taxation and for everything without making a proper decision.</P>
        <P>When it did make a decision it was on a levy which is unjust and unfair.  I am getting weary of people on the other side of the House lecturing the Opposition on responsibility when they should be offering an apology to the people for the reckless policies which they adopted and which brought the country to its knees where it is at the present time.</P>
        <P>Section 1 of the Bill states the President, the Judiciary, military judges and the CEOs of semi-State bodies, who are on greater wages than the Taoiseach, are excluded from the levy.  If one wants just and fair policies one must start at the top and not at the bottom which is what we see with regard to this levy.  There is no overall plan from the Government.  We hear of more taxes coming and of the possibility of the introduction of third-level fees.  We have drip feed all the time instead of the Government coming out and telling us what is the position and what is the plan for the coming years.  This is what the people want.</P>
        <P>My nominating body is the ICPSA which includes the Army and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Today, I met with them and they are very unhappy.  They believe it is an unfair levy and that it is unjust.  I will not repeat what Senator McCarthy stated but he mentioned some of the anomalies they raised.  They have members who are up in arms with regard to commitments given for mortgages based on salaries.</P>
        <P>We heard there will be tweaking of the system for the lower paid in the public service.  Where is the tweaking?  We did not receive it in the D&aacute;il.  Will we have it here on Committee Stage?  I doubt it.  We are misleading the people and those working in the public service by mentioning tweaking.  This is typical of Government action over recent years.  It drip feeds everything instead of coming out and giving the people hope for the future by producing a plan which people will be able to accept and not introducing a policy such as this which is so unfair.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>The figures in front of us are stark.  Of the &euro;55 billion we intend to spend in 2009, &euro;20 billion will go on social welfare, &euro;20 billion on public sector pay alone and only &euro;15 billion will go to all other services.  Our expectation, which could yet prove to be very optimistic, is that at best we will raise &euro;37 billion in tax this year.  We are getting used to using the word &ldquo;billion&rdquo; without putting it in its proper numeric context, which is &euro;1,000 million.  On the surface, the gap is &euro;18 billion.  In the October budget we decided to cut public expenditure by &euro;2 billion, raise additional taxes by &euro;2 billion and secure the rest through borrowing for capital expenditure.</P>
        <P>The Exchequer returns for November and December were even more disappointing and resulted in a shortfall of a further &euro;2 billion and the Government has taken direct action to try to alleviate this.  This shortfall is in public expenditure which means we must look at the main area of public expenditure to see how it can be alleviated.  Public sector pay is the option chosen by the Government but it could have done so in a number of ways such as through a pay cut or a reduction in numbers, as proposed by Fine Gael which seeks a reduction of at least 5,000 in the public sector.</P>
        <P>The mechanism the Government is using is a levy on public sector pensions.  There is no doubt we need to tackle the long-term costs of public sector pensions.  We in this Chamber and many in the political system benefit from a system of pensions which is hard to justify and is far from sustainable.  Everyone in the political system must take cognisance of the ballooning cost of pensions.  The reality is that, on average, the cost of a public sector pension is not met <Col N="209"/>as economically as the cost of a private sector pension.  The proposed mechanism allows pensions to be maintained and protects the interests of existing pensioners.  A pay cut, which probably would have been more honest, would have meant pensions would be reduced in the future and existing pensioners would have their entitlements reduced.  Perhaps that would have been a better approach but the current proposal is perhaps more honest in terms of reducing the public pay bill.</P>
      
        <P>The public sector pay bill is at its current level because public sector workers&rsquo; incomes were well below those of private sector workers in the past.  Processes such as benchmarking helped redress the imbalance but we did not try to redress it as private sector workers&rsquo; wages decreased by comparison with those of public sector workers.  A comparison between public sector workers here and in the North, where the proportion of GDP is 60%, will show many equivalent grades in the North are on a far lower level of pay, albeit with a lower cost of living.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">10 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>We must recognise the proposed formula is to maintain as many jobs in the public sector as possible and to achieve the true cost of employing public sector staff and of providing pensions in the future.  Obvious anomalies arise as a result of the standard and higher rates of taxation and the circumstances arising from pre-1995 and post-1995 pay arrangements.  If it were possible to create a formula to deal with these now, it would certainly be preferable, but I am confident that in the course of the coming months, by way of the White Paper on Pensions and the subsequent budget, we will get rid of the anomalies.  If one judges every public sector employee by way of a paper exercise, one will note that Department of Finance figures show the new levy, added to existing levies, PRSI and taxation, results in progressivity with regard to total reductions in pay.</P>
        <P>The difficulty is that we need to make public sector workers subject to the kinds of fiscal changes that are required.  I have heard Opposition parties state they have answers, particularly for making savings of &euro;2 billion.  Arguments were made, certainly by the trade unions, that the way to address the shortfall is solely by means of taxation, but there is a problem with that argument.</P>

	<P>I saw the ten points and went on record as saying I welcome most of them.  The idea that the shortfall in question and all subsequent shortfalls, including the &euro;4 billion at the end of this year and the following year, and the &euro;3.5 billion at the end of the year thereafter, can be met by that formula if tax receipts remain constant is not very honest.  The reality is that this year&rsquo;s budget will largely consist of new taxation measures because there is no way out of the predicament.  By doing so, we will get rid of many of the anomalies that arise in respect of the public service levy.</P>
        <P>The fear is that tax revenue may not be constant and that we might be dealing with bigger revenue holes than exist at present.  If the Opposition parties are not prepared to address that, the dissent we see at present may, unfortunately, be amplified because of irresponsible politics.  It is easy at this time, which must be accepted as the most difficult fiscal period the country has ever faced, to do nothing, say nothing and play to a Visitors Gallery by saying what people want to hear.</P>
        <P>The essential point is that this measure is only the first of a series that must be made by whoever is in government over the next decade to correct our public finances.  If one believes this can be done easily and without upsetting many citizens by decreasing the standard of living <Col N="210"/>they are enjoying and have enjoyed, one is not being honest with the people.  Until we come to terms with the health of our public finances, we will not come close to securing the public buy-in that is needed.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I will begin with one figure, that is, one out of ten.  Every member of the Government should listen to the news tonight and examine the results of the opinion poll tomorrow because we have clearly failed to make it known across the floor that the Government measures are neither understood, accepted nor supported by the vast majority of people.  It seems desperately useless, therefore, for Members to blame the Opposition parties and others for this.  Can someone explain to me how nine out of ten people could be wrong?  It reminds me of Abraham Lincoln&rsquo;s statement that one can fool all the people some of the time, and some of the people all the time, but not all the people all the time.  It just does not work and the reality is very simple. </P>
        <P>I hear Members state every day they are not receiving support from the Opposition, mainly Fine Gael.  When did the Government speak to Fine Gael?  When did it indicate the problem and its proposals to Fine Gael and request the party&rsquo;s views?  It seems Fine Gael is more than ready to offer support.  The same applies to the social partners, who do not know what the Government wants.  They were in the middle of negotiations with the Government that began with a phrase to the effect that all sectors of society should contribute in accordance with their ability to do so, and that the most vulnerable, low-paid etc. should be insulated against the worst effects.  People said this was a very fair way to start and that they should get down to business.  I listened to Senator Boyle talking about people not understanding the issues.  How can the people outside the gate today understand why the wealthy people in the private sector are not being taxed?</P>
        <P>I want the Minster of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, to think about my next question.  I do not want him to respond because he will not give me the answer.  The people on strike today and others know about the private sector because they have sons, daughters, wives and husbands who have lost jobs and who have taken salary cuts, but they also know that more than half of the 1.3 million private sector employees are in safe, secure, comfortable jobs.  That is the reality and if I am wrong I will eat my hat.  If somebody can give me figures to show I am even partially wrong, I will do so.  My question is whether we cannot introduce a tax such that everybody earning over &euro;80,000 or &euro;90,000 per annum, in both the public and private sectors, would be subject to a new third rate of taxation.  Why will the Government not do so?  The reason is very clear &mdash; there is extraordinary dishonesty such that the Government will not use the word &ldquo;taxation&rdquo;.  Its members cannot get it out of their mouths and they use the terms &ldquo;income levy&rdquo; and &ldquo;pension levy&rdquo;.  It is a misnomer to refer to the proposed measure as a levy because the moneys that accrue will not go towards paying pensions but into the Exchequer.</P>
        <P>I know a little about what I am talking because I sat for five years on the Commission on Public Service Pensions, which was referred to by the Minister of State&rsquo;s colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Mansergh.  The reality is that we did value it and get a costing on it.  We also required that it would be actuarially adjusted.  At that time it was felt that the cost of public sector pensions was approximately 18%.  Nowadays they are saying it is approximately 25%.  If one takes the normal employers&rsquo; contribution of 10% out of it then we know what we should put in to pay for it.  We can come to those figures.</P><Col N="211"/>
        <P>Society is fragmented because nobody knows what the Government is doing.  Currently, one person in ten supports the Government.  That is the lowest figure in my time in politics and I am sure in the time of the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern.  If the Government will not listen to me it should listen to the people.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I echo Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s words because I, too, watched the news at 9 p.m. and the one in ten figure stood out starkly for me, as it is doing for people all around the country tonight.  Clearly, there is a lack of confidence in what the Government is doing to tackle the enormous economic downturn and problem we are facing.  There is a will among people to share the burden.  All of us want to play our part in trying to bring about an economic recovery.  That includes Members on both sides of this House and of all shades of political opinion in the country.</P>
        <P>What we are not seeing from the Government is any leadership or sense of strategic planning to get us through this economic recession and to point us towards recovery.  Instead, we are seeing some piecemeal measures.  In fact, Senator Boyle referred earlier to the Bill before us as an introductory measure, the start of a series of measures.  Where is the series?  Where is some sense from the Government of the shape and structure the series will take in the coming months or years?  We just do not know.</P>
        <P>The ICTU has done us all a favour in putting forward a coherent ten-point plan.  It said itself that it is flawed, that it is by no means perfect, but at least it is based on a model of recovery that was used in Sweden.  Many of us heard the architect of that plan, the Swedish policymaker, speak about it and he said the main point of the plan was that it hurt all interest groups &mdash; that everybody complained.  He knew then that it would be more effective that way.  It was fair and it had general application.  That is exactly what we are not seeing from the Government&rsquo;s Bill before us tonight.  We are seeing a mere tweaking of cost cutting in this plan but what we are not seeing, as Senator O&rsquo;Toole said, is any honesty about the need to raise revenue by raising taxes through a progressive taxation system that hits the rich and those on high incomes, both in the public and private sector.</P>
        <P>I have put on record previously the fact that I approve in principle of the need for public servants to pay a levy, if one wants to call it that, in recognition of the fact that we have secure pensions.  What I do not approve of is the inequitable application of the levy to those on very low incomes in the public service.  All of us on higher incomes should be paying something more than those who do not have security of tenure and the benefit of a public sector pension.  I do not believe the low paid, namely, nurses, firefighters and those on entry level in the Civil Service, those we saw out on pickets from the CPSU today, should pay a levy of 3% or even 6%.  The threshold should have been set higher.</P>
        <P>The Government had to tweak what it called the 1% levy &mdash; the income tax measure that was introduced last year &mdash; to exempt those earning below a certain amount.  I do not know whether the Minister is listening but it is fair to say that his colleagues said initially there would be no tweaking of the 1% levy and there was subsequently a tweaking.  It is unfortunate that people then came to expect when the pension levy was introduced that there would be some tweaking or adjustment.  There is some indication in section 8 that an exemption can be provided if the Minister so wishes.  There is an uncertainty about the application of the levy.</P>
        <P>I have been approached by people who work in the public sector who do not have security of tenure, who are on fixed-term contracts but who get some payment in lieu of pension and therefore will be covered by the legislation.  They are concerned about having to pay a levy on very low incomes.  Clearly, it will hit them more than it will hit those of us on higher incomes in the public service.  What we need is a more coherent plan, one that will impact fairly and equitably on all sectors of society, especially the higher paid.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LarryButler"><NameTxt>Senator Larry Butler</NameTxt>
	<P>Nobody likes to contribute more than he or she has to, regardless of how the economy is functioning.  The Government has made the first step in making us fulfil our obligations.  If one considers how other countries have been handling the downturn in their economies, it is apparent they have handled it in a way that is not very different from what we are trying to do.</P>
        <P>On the one hand we are trying to deal with a banking crisis and on the other we are trying to deal with the public finances.  We have put together a small package of measures that we intend to implement in the next two to three years.  We decided to tackle the problem over a specified period.  We have a plan.</P>
        <P>If we were to administer a sharp shock to the economy we would destroy it.  We are already taking &euro;2 billion out of it through the taxation levy and we are taking a further &euro;2 billion through budget taxation measures.  A total of &euro;4 billion will come out of the economy this year.  If we were to take any stronger measures than that we would shock the economy into a worse situation than we are in currently.</P>
        <P>It is important that the public sector is now going to play a major role in fighting back and helping the economy to recover because 350,000 people are unemployed.  People who have secure jobs are paying only a small percentage &mdash; 4.5% &mdash; towards a pension.  If they were in the private sector they would be paying 25%.  They are still well below the mark in terms of what they are paying towards their pensions and they have guaranteed pensions.  Waterford Glass employees who paid into a pension for 40 years found themselves with no pension.  Public sector employees have secure jobs with secure pensions and that is why they are asked to pay a contribution.</P>
        <P>I am concerned that people are making a fuss about such a small contribution, which is what it is.  We need &euro;16 billion to breach the gap and this is a small contribution towards that amount.  It is very welcome and necessary and we must be seen to do that.  The social partners are on the street and not playing their part to ensure the economy recovers.  When things were good they were playing ball and everything was working well.  They were represented on this board and that board, but where are they now that we need them?  They are like the snow; they are gone.  They walked away when we needed to make a decision to bring in revenue and they left their members high and dry.  That is not taking responsibility.</P>
        <P>Problems are evident in various industries in the private sector.  For every person in the public sector, two or three people in the private sector are supporting their jobs.  We are not living in the real world if we do not realise that.  We need to put a plan in place that will work.  The banking sector will have to be dealt with after that.  Any economic recovery will require a good banking sector.  We need to move quickly on that.  We have to be cautious also because every day we can see that banking shares have gone to the floor in Ireland, London and New York.  We therefore may have to consider nationalising all our banks.  I would not rule that out.  That may be an important step on the road to ensuring security of the banking system.  It is an option but I am not a banker and I would like the present banking system to continue as it is.</P>
        <P>It is important that the social partners return to talks as soon as possible and that they produce a plan.  We have an overall plan and it is important to bring the social partners back in to support it.  Senator Harris proposed a national bond to get people involved in other ways to support the economy.  That could be a good way to put the nation first.  People would like to make a contribution and the cost of the bond could be pitched as low as &euro;10.  People could make small contributions to the bond, which would demonstrate their solidarity with the State and that everybody was working together to solve our problems.  I am grateful for the opportunity to make a contribution and I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <?oasys _cl14.5- ?><Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Senator Brendan Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share time with Senators McFadden and Fitzgerald.  The so-called pension levy is clearly unfair.  It is targeted at one group of workers in our economy only.  It does not target the people who caused the problems or those who benefited most from the Celtic tiger area.  It will hurt people on low to middle incomes who can ill-afford to pay, yet it does not target the wealthiest in our society.  For example, medical professionals, many of whom are among the wealthiest in our society and can charge what they like, are not being asked to contribute.  A friend of mine who attends a private consultant for a debilitating condition recently found the fee for a follow up visit had increased from &euro;100 to &euro;150, a 50% increase.</P>
        <P>RTE celebrities and bankers and developers are not being asked to pay the levy.  It is justified by Government spokespersons on the basis that public servants have great pensions for which they do not pay and they are guaranteed jobs for life, while private sectors workers are losing their jobs.   However, many public servants such as those working for local authorities and the Health Service Executive in lower grades have dreadful pensions.  The levy pits one group of workers against another.  I agree with Senator Harris that we need to pull all sectors of the economy and society together in the effort.  People are willing to play their part but there is no fairness in this measure.  The levy does not bring the people together with a sense of solidarity and it represents a missed opportunity in that regard.  If people could see all sectors of the economy were sharing the burden, they would accept and play their part.</P>
        <P>The Labour Party is opposed to this measure not because of an association with, or loyalty to, the public service or the unions but because of its inherent unfairness.  While workers in the private sector have lost their jobs, not everyone has and many are in secure and well-paid employment an are not being asked to contribute, which is clearly unfair.  I am amazed that despite this obvious unfairness, the Government continues to argue otherwise and I have heard more of the same from many Members on the Government side in this debate.  The lack of logic in this matter is baffling.  The leader of the Labour Party stated earlier that our party would facilitate the bringing forward of a budget, if required, to introduce fairer measures.  The Minister should do what needs to be done and introduce hard measures.  However, he should make them fair.  Let us do this together.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Ryan for sharing time.  I seek clarification on two issues.  Will gratuities paid to Army personnel be affected by the levy?  These people work all their lives serving the State.  I also have serious concerns about the position of retained firemen.  These are among the low paid public servants to whom Senator Ryan referred.  They are heroic men and women who are called out at all hours.  Their retainer is low and it would be most unfair if it were levied.</P>
        <P>I resent the lecturing of the Opposition during the debate and I am sick of it.  Will the Minister of State ask his party colleagues and Senator Boyle to stop lecturing the Opposition because we do not deserve it?  As far back as last July, Deputy Bruton made proposals and offered solidarity with wise and good support.  Senator Butler referred to the workers in Waterford Wedgwood who will lose their pensions.  The company asked the Government for a loan only last year when money was available but it was refused.  The Senator should not pay lip service to those who have lost their jobs, given the cost of this to the State.</P>

	<P>I welcome Senator Boyle&rsquo;s statement that there are anomalies in the legislation.  If the Government parties accept this, why were they not rectified?  Why were the amendments tabled by Fine Gael not accepted in the D&aacute;il?  It is disgraceful for a Member on the Government side to admit there are anomalies, say they will be corrected some time over the coming year and expect those who are subject to them to put up with them.</P>
        <P>Senator Boyle also stated Fine Gael was playing to the gallery and it had not put forward hard proposals.  That is nonsensical.  At this time of national crisis, the Government parties should examine the proposals made by Fine Gael because they are tough and do not play to the gallery.  However, we did not receive a respectful hearing from the Government on any of them.  Government Members should not mention national partnership when they have not reached out or reacted to the proposals made in good faith by us.  They should not say we are playing to the gallery because we are not and we have put forward tough, constructive proposals.  We were the first to suggest a pay freeze in the public sector, which is not easy to recommend.  That is tough medicine for the public sector and it was tough for Deputy Bruton to propose this.  The proposals deserve respect because they are proactive and constructive.</P>
        <P>This is a time of national crisis and the political system is under severe scrutiny.  It has been found wanting but this is a two-way street and the Government must respond to constructive proposals.  It is extraordinarily distressing when going house to house to meet the number of people who have lost their jobs or who are on a two-day or a three-day week and who do not know how they will cope.  The major problem is not the levy <i>per se</i> but the context in which it is being sold.  It is not perceived as fair and equitable because a package of measures has not been introduced across the board.  People will not experience it as being fair and they do not believe every sector is being targeted.</P>
        <P>The Commission on Taxation&rsquo;s work should be brought forward as we need a comprehensive package of measures, not the current drip feed.  Everyone should be asked to sacrifice and to play a part.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, to the House and commend him.  While I cannot divulge any information concerning my parliamentary practice, his proposals floated at our meetings have always been constructive.  I also commend him on his openness and willingness to have a dialogue at national level.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senators Feeney and Cummins and I were among seven of the candidates nominated by the Irish Conference of Professional and Service Associations, ICPSA, to contest the 2002 and 2007 Seanad elections.  We met in Buswell&rsquo;s Hotel today to discuss the body&rsquo;s concerns.  As the Senators selected by the ICPSA and elected by councillors, TDs and Senators, and as Fianna F&aacute;il members, it is our responsibility to articulate the ICPSA&rsquo;s concerns on the Bill.  It is better that we speak inside the Oireachtas than speak into it from the outside.</P>
        <P>The ICPSA is not a member of ICTU and has no voice in terms of a national partnership.  It depends on its representatives and organisations to table its opinions.  The ICPSA has expressed to us its deep concern about the proposals and is asking for a refinement, to say the least.  It believes that the proposals are unfair and inequitable and target the wrong people.  Had I the choice, I would choose to increase the top rate, the next rate and possibly another rate of tax to encompass everyone in the private and public sectors.  It would be fair and equitable and would not separate the public and private services.</P>
        <P>Given the number of issues addressed in our discussion today, the ICPSA has received many representations.  It has been inundated concerning those on low incomes who must pay the 1% levy and the new rate.  As they have taken out mortgages, have educational costs and so on, this is a serious issue.  Will the Minister of State examine the overall package to try to alleviate the difficulties being experienced by low paid public servants?</P>
        <P>Many people resent the Judiciary&rsquo;s exclusion from the Bill under Article 35 of the Constitution.  While we cannot discuss the Judiciary, I do not know why we cannot vote on a constitutional amendment on 5 June.</P>

They should not be above reproach.  If they wanted to take a case against it, no one would be able to hear the proceedings.  We are the arbitrators in this regard and it would be a productive measure.</P>
        <P>Some time ago, I proposed the bond that has been mentioned today and approved by SIPTU.  A low rate, ten-year investment and-or pension bond worth &euro;10 billion would be raised by the public for those without pensions.  Its contributors&rsquo; means should not be investigated.  Doing so would lead to its collapse.  A new approach is necessary.  Since Anglo Irish Bank is at our disposal, we have a vehicle through which to raise money to assist the State.  The money is available.</P>
        <P>PDFORRA has asked for the tax bands to be considered and believes that the levy is a blunt instrument.  The body has been inundated with representations in that regard.  The AGSI, which has never before received so many calls from its members, has expressed a deep concern about the situation.  Given the fact that they are defending the State, it is concerned that the levy will affect its members.</P>

	<P>I thank Senator Leyden.  The Bill is neither fair nor enough.  The Government has succeeded, in an extraordinary ham-handed way, in creating a new class of victims, which it need not have done had it a balanced package.  It is not enough.  The world markets, impartial and independent observers, do not believe that we will get enough money from the Bill to scratch the surface.  Next year, we will need to raise at least &euro;4 billion, but probably much more.  Introducing a complete package now would have been more realistic.  This would have included not only public service cuts, but also other expenditure cuts and the tax measures that everyone believes are necessary.  Instead, we have a group of victims that can evoke public sympathy and justifiably plead that they are carrying an untimely burden on their shoulders.</P>
        <P>Why could we not have introduced the necessary taxation measures in respect of other people?  Why could we not have introduced public expenditure cuts?  The feeble excuse is that we are waiting for the Commission on Taxation.  We do not need to wait for commissions.  The feeble excuse in terms of public expenditure is that we are waiting for &ldquo;An Bord Snip&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>Before I sit down, why does the Government refuse to consider the sale of State assets?  Mr. Peter Sutherland or someone stated that capital expenditure must be cut.  Why could we not sell the ESB or Bord G&aacute;is?  Billions of euro in capital that we could sell are locked up in both.  While it is not a palatable suggestion, these are not palatable times.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, to the House and thank the Cathaoirleach for the opportunity to speak on this Bill.</P>
        <P>I wish to refer to two groups that, so far, have not featured much in the debate.  The first group comprises people working for low pay in the private sector.  They have clerical jobs in banks or multinational companies.  They work in the construction sector and are worried that they will not be able to work for much longer.  A considerable amount of tonight&rsquo;s discussion has been on garda&iacute;, nurses, social workers and so on.  There is no doubt that those groups must be represented and supported.</P>
        <P>However, Members must keep in mind others who work in the private sector and who provide the capacity that allows the entire economy to continue ticking over.  The reason this group must be mentioned tonight is because the one thing they will need and will rely on Members to provide for them to maintain their incomes and jobs is sound public finances.  If there is one lesson that can be learned from the experience of other countries that have turned themselves out of the difficulties into which we now face, it is getting the public finances under control quickly in order that there is confidence for people who are living in our economy to spend and for those who live outside of our economy and businesses inside the economy to invest in it.</P>
        <P>The other group to which I wish to refer briefly are the financial markets.  For obvious reasons, whenever anyone talks about the financial markets, there is a sharp intake of breath.  We talk about their greed, avarice and so on.  However, we do not often talk about how often <Col N="217"/>they have been correct in respect of some of the issues Members have discussed in this House. I will provide the analogy of the banking sector.  For the past year, the Government and different people associated with it have been saying there is no problem with the banks, that everything is under control and nothing is going on that we will not be able to handle at some point in the future.  During that period, the financial markets considered what was happening with the banks and decided not to believe us.  The share prices plummeted month after month and that assessment has turned out to be correct.  That is the assessment upon which we are acting and the analogy, unfortunately, on which Members now must draw, pertains to what is happening to our standing within the financial markets at present.  While I have raised this point in this House in recent weeks, the financial markets currently believe it is a safer bet to buy Israeli Government debt or debt from Thailand, Malaysia or similar countries than it is to buy Irish Government debt.  The implications are so great for our country that they require radical and strong action and I wish to emphasise three points in this regard.</P>
        <P>There has been a great deal of discussion in this House about the need for an overall plan for the economy, the need to find &euro;2 billion worth of savings this year, &euro;4 billion next year and &euro;4 billion the year after.  I have to hand the document from which all those figures come.  It is entitled Addendum to the Irish Stability Programme: Update, and was published in January 2009.  I encourage every Member to read it.  I particularly encourage them to read page 5 of that document which contains the table on which everything is based.  I will examine some of the economic assumptions on which this plan is based.  It assumes that next year, in 2010, gross national product, GNP, will contract by 1% and that it will grow by 2% the year after.  It assumes that unemployment this year will peak at 9% and at 10% the year after and that it will begin to fall the year after that.  Many Members within this House have observed that the economic conditions we face are far worse than what is laid out here.  I have an awful fear, which I must raise in this House, that the figure of &euro;16.5 billion that everyone is discussing is based on a document and a strategy that repeats the mistakes Members have debated for so long, namely, that one comes up with an assumption to allow one to get through this year, this month or the next budget.</P>
        <P>Three measures are required in this regard.  First, there is a need for complete honesty with the people and, more importantly, with ourselves about the true state of the economy, the our society and the dangers that lie ahead.  I do not say this with any joy but I am convinced the assumptions upon which Members are basing their debate at present will not stand up and, unfortunately, that some of them are too optimistic.</P>
        <P>Second, we must have a more buoyant and determined outlook as to what we are going to do.  I am not an accountant.  Before I entered this House, my profession in the private sector was as a salesman and I was proud to be one.  When contemplating a hole in my figures, I did not think in the first instance about how I was going to pare back.  My first instinct was to ascertain how I would create the activity and business that would allow such figures to be filled.  I am convinced that the piece of work that must happen alongside this measure is to identify what parts of our economy and what industries can be developed and guided that will deliver the requisite tax revenue to ensure essential services are provided and to ensure our taxation levels are on a par with maintaining a spirit of enterprise within our country and on a par with allowing us to have a spirit of social solidarity.  What worries me so much is that having examined the aforementioned document that guides Government thinking, none of this is present at all.  None of that is clear.</P>
        <P>I wish to conclude with some words I heard President Obama speak in his address last night.  He used one phrase that struck me, when he said, &ldquo;We cannot afford to govern out of anger <Col N="218"/>or yield to the politics of the moment&rdquo;.  Obviously, this is highly true of America and is even more so of Ireland.  The situation we face is of the utmost gravity.  While there is a need to be honest with the people, there is a far greater need to be honest with ourselves about where matters stand.  We must acknowledge the situation we are in.  Undoubtedly, public expenditure will be cut and taxation and unemployment will rise.  We must be honest with ourselves that such things will happen.  However, together with such measures, there must be an absolute, rigid and unrelenting determination from all Members of this House, but especially from the Government, which has the privilege to lead, to come up with the ideas that will fill the holes in this document.  While this can be done, if we do not, our national morale and economy will be strangled.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GeraldineFeeney"><NameTxt>Senator Geraldine Feeney</NameTxt>
	<P>Very well.  It is regrettable that I cannot share with Senator Walsh but I wish to put my contribution on the record of the House.  Like Senators Leyden and Cummins, I attended the meeting of our nominating body this afternoon and my two colleagues have outlined what transpired at it.  I will approach it from a particular point of relevance to the Irish Conference of Professional and Service Associations.  The current discontent within the ranks of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na at all levels and within the Defence Forces is related to the perceived unfairness of the pension levy.  However, it also stems from understandable frustration among many fine men and women, good public servants, who wear the uniform with distinction but who are excluded from trade union membership.  As members of a representative body rather than a union, members of the AGSI and the GRA, together with the Defence Forces, are banned from striking and all take an oath to serve the country.  The exclusion of garda&iacute; and soldiers from trade union membership is based on an historic view of the special position of those entrusted with upholding public order.  However, in Ireland, where social partnership has played such a crucial role in shaping public policy, I consider it to be wrong that a group of public servants are excluded from a process which has profound implications for their terms and conditions of employment.</P>
        <P>They cannot participate in broader industrial mechanisms and have no recourse to the machinery of the State, including the Labour Relations Commission, the rights commissioner service and the Labour Court.  I believe it is time for a rethink and it should not be beyond the imagination of the State to devise a mechanism which would allow garda&iacute; and soldiers the right to collective representation and negotiation and grant access to the industrial relations machinery of the State without compromising national security, law and order or the maintenance of essential services.  I apologise for not welcoming the Minister of State, because of the minor kerfuffle at the outset of my contribution, and I do so now.  Perhaps the Government might consider a high level working party to bring forward recommendations.</P><Col N="219"/>
        <P>I agree with Members who suggested an amendment to the Constitution to deal with the issue of the remuneration of judges.  Consideration should be given to changing the Article which provides protection to the salaries of the Judiciary.  I am confident the latter would not be found wanting in this regard.  I have spoken to several judges who are willing to play their part at this difficult time of economic crisis.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Is that agreed?  Agreed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank the Minister of State for sharing time.  At a time when we are faced with a very difficult fiscal position, I am not enamoured by the behaviour of some of the social partners.  I will return to that presently.  According to the Government, our revenue will fall back to something like &euro;37 billion this year.  Goodbody Stockbrokers estimates it will be &euro;33 billion.  Our projected current expenditure, on the other hand, is &euro;20 billion for public sector pay, &euro;20 billion for social welfare and &euro;15 billion for non-pay areas.  This leaves a deficit, according to Government figures, of &euro;18 billion.  If one accepts the prediction from Goodbody Stockbrokers, the deficit will be &euro;22 billion.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As a compromise, I will assume a shortfall of &euro;20 billion.  Therefore, we must reduce the public sector pay bill by &euro;6 billion to &euro;14 billion, and this must be done as a matter of urgency.  As such, it is my proposition that this Bill takes us in the right direction but that we must accelerate savings in the public sector pay bill in order to reduce it to &euro;14 billion.  Some &euro;2 billion must be saved from the social welfare budget, which I acknowledge will be difficult to achieve in a situation of growing unemployment.  If we are to make an additional reduction of &euro;2 billion in the non-pay area, we will achieve a saving of some &euro;10 billion, reducing our expenditure to &euro;45 billion.</P>
        <P>I understand the public sector pay bill was &euro;8.8 billion in 2000.  If one increases that at a compound rate of 4% for the last decade, one arrives at a figure of &euro;13 billion.  That is the target for which we should aim.  I referred to the social partners, who walked out of the talks, because they are part of the problem and part of the creation of the problem.  I refer specifically to the benchmarking payments that were made across the public sector.  I accept that I make this point with the benefit of hindsight.  We were all pleased to avail of those salary increases at the time.  However, we must recognise that we went too far and paid ourselves too much, in both the public and private sectors.  This must be corrected as a matter of urgency.  There is a responsibility on the social partners to play their part in correcting what can now be seen definitively as a mistake that is adding to our problems.</P>
        <P>The proposed pension levy is progressive.  I utterly reject the claims it will impact on the lower paid to an unfair extent.  Those on &euro;15,000 will lose &euro;450 per annum; a person earning &euro;25,000 will make a contribution of &euro;1,250; workers earning &euro;45,000 will pay &euro;3,250; and a person on &euro;105,000 will pay &euro;9,250.  This represents a progressive system.  On retirement, a person on a salary of &euro;60,000 will receive a pension of 50% of salary, or &euro;30,000 per annum.  If that worker is making a 15% pension contribution, as we in these Houses are, he or she will pay &euro;9,000 per year.  Over 40 years, this equates to &euro;360,000.  Such a pension would cost a private sector worker &euro;1.1 million.</P>
        <P>If we are to move in the direction of salvaging this country, we must go further than we have done in this legislation.  Everybody must accept this requirement and play their part.  We must deal with public expenditure as a matter of priority.  At the same time, we must be careful <Col N="220"/>about taking more tax out of the productive sector of the economy.  That is where the jobs will be saved and where more jobs will be created for the future.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senators on all sides of the House for their contributions to this exceptionally constructive and stimulating debate.  There are various formulae of words that can be used on such occasions but in everything I say, I try not to gloss over what I consider to be an exceptionally grave situation.  Members will find reflections of this in my opening contribution.  At the same time, one must not overlook the many strong positives remaining in this society and economy.  We must look not only to fill holes but to find positive initiatives we can take to encourage economic activity and inspire people.  Senator Harris made several suggestions in this regard.  There are others, including those set out in the Government&rsquo;s framework document, Building Ireland&rsquo;s Smart Economy.</P>
        <P>Although it would not be entirely accurate to describe it as a pension levy, the core of the Bill is what I would describe as a pension-related levy.  It relates to the cost of pensions and the advantage enjoyed by public servants in this regard.  For people who reach the end of their career at a senior level, in particular, we have seen striking examples of how advantageous are the pension arrangements.  Broadly speaking, taking all deductions into account, the levy is progressive.  The provisions of the Bill apply not only to public servants but also to professionals and the farming sector.</P>
        <P>I heard an interesting radio interview this morning with a former Taoiseach, Mr. Garret FitzGerald, which dealt with some of the issues which the various political parties might not necessarily wish to stress.  Mr. FitzGerald made the valid point that our tax system is exceptionally favourable by European standards to low and middle-income earners, which is fine when revenue is flowing in through stamp duty, corporation tax and capital taxes.  We have all benefited from this in the past, but we are now in a situation where we must broaden the tax base.</P>
        <P>One of the threads that underlined Senator Harris&rsquo;s contribution and those of several other Members was the question of whether all the pain should be imposed in one fell swoop or whether it should be spread out.  I am of the view that no matter how virtuous we had been in the past, economically speaking, and no matter how ruthless we might be now in terms of doing anything and everything to try to close the gap in short order, we could not get out of the woods in a short timeframe.  We are dealing not only with a national problem but with a global one.  I understand Senator Harris&rsquo;s frustration and what he said about the psyche in terms of appealing to public opinion, with all of which I agree.  However, in substance, would it achieve the aim of getting us out of the woods?  I contend it would not.  No country is even close to getting out of the woods at the moment.  I have never had anything to do with the Judiciary, but whether one is a member of the Judiciary or the Legislature, we come from a particular standpoint and, to a limited degree, we have self-interests and one must make corrections for that.  While there are Oireachtas Members of various ages who may be under financial pressure, we are not the section of the community under the most financial pressure at present.  There are large sections of the community that would be in no position to bear that and we must proceed by stages.  As quickly as we can, through the Commission on Taxation, the McCarthy committee and other mechanisms, we must define where we are going and what we must do.  The case of those who were protesting outside the gates could not be summarised as suggesting that the Government is not hitting them half hard enough.  They may be saying that there are certain sections of society, perhaps a relatively small number of people, that are not being hit hard enough.  The Government may be right or wrong but it has taken the view that we must pace ourselves.  This crisis will not be over in the short term, regardless of what we do.  We <Col N="221"/>must pace ourselves, try to contain the situation and correct the situation.  This is an important part of what we are doing.  It is important to the minimum confidence that we need to pass and enact this legislation.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>Once that has happened, I hope it will be possible to get around the table with the social partners and discuss the broad framework further.  It is not the view of everyone in this House but, broadly speaking, social partnership has served the country very well.  I do not want to accuse the Government of which I am a member of being unreasonable but it was a bridge too far to expect the unions to underwrite something like the pension levy.  They must make their protest; the Government must do what it must do.  I want to see the social partners continue to engage.  That is one reason, among others, that I do not follow the suggestion made by Senator Ross about privatising ESB and Bord G&aacute;is.  I like the idea of public service and I defended it in the other House too.  We should not abandon the ethos of that but I should abandon speaking further because the Cathaoirleach is looking at me.</P>
