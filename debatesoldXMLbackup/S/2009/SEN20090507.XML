	<P>I have notice from Senator John Paul Phelan that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to clarify if he is prepared to reverse his decision to cut the ancillary grant for Protestant education; and to make a statement on the matter.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Liam Twomey of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Health and Children to seek reassurance from the HSE that the accident and emergency department at Wexford General Hospital will continue to operate on a 24/7 basis, and if there are any plans to change these hours in the future.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food to clarify the position of farmers finishing REPS 3 after 13 May 2009; and if he would consider providing an extension of one month to the REPS 4 closing date.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Frances Fitzgerald of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Health and Children to outline the details of the way in which the new scheme to provide a child care place for three year old children will function, payment methods, the number of available places and the level of uptake in the scheme which she expects from child care providers.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">I regard the matters raised by Senators Phelan, Twomey and &Oacute; Domhnaill as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senator Fitzgerald may give notice on another day of the matter she wishes to raise.</P>

	<P>Yesterday in the House, the impartial role of individuals working for the public broadcasting service and other media interests was raised.  It probably warrants a debate to see how much this affects people&rsquo;s day to day work, given the scandalous remarks that were made.  For instance, if we look at some of the people who work for the public broadcaster, they include Miriam O&rsquo;Callaghan whose brother is running for Fianna F&aacute;il in the local elections.  Ryan Tubridy has two first cousins who are Members of the D&aacute;il.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>It is on the Order of Business.  We can say that the person who was political editor of the <i>Irish Independent</i> prior to the general election got a job with the Government after the general election.  Some of the political correspondents who currently work in Leinster House are either married to or connected to close family members who are standing <Col N="303"/>for Fianna F&aacute;il in the coming elections.  Never once in all the years these individuals have been doing their work has this side of the House accused them of being biased, partial or unfit to carry out their jobs because those with whom they are connected are running for or hold office with Fianna F&aacute;il.  The Leader of this House should apologise on behalf of Fianna F&aacute;il for the remarks that were made about George Lee in this House yesterday.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>If we need to have a debate on that, the Leader should facilitate it.  That sort of blackguarding is an insult to democracy.  We should be bigger and more open than that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Twomey has made some fair points.  I thought he was going off on a tangent at the beginning, which I did not like.  However, I certainly think it is a point worth making &mdash; that we in political life accept those coming into it.  It must be a good thing if people at the top of their careers choose to serve as public representatives, and that should be welcomed.  It is important to note, however, that there was an implication coming from the most recent reproach to that band of people that in some way this was a unique move.  There are people in this House and the other House who opted to enter public life when they were at the top of their careers.  They include solicitors, barristers, accountants and business people, all of whom could be earning more money outside public life.  It is important not to get carried away with the view that because one person is coming into public life at the moment it is something unique, because it is not.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Thankfully, there are many people who bring with them to these Houses what they have learned outside.  Whether they come from the media, the public sector or elsewhere they should be welcomed.  It is a most discouraging and demoralising aspect of our work that when those about to leave second or third level education are asked about their future careers, the number who choose public representation is negligible.  It does not even get on the radar.  I have been criticised for saying in the House before that it is because we do not do our business properly.  It goes back to things like Seanad reform, which is part of it.  Good things need to be pointed up and others need to be reformed.</P>
        <P>It is important that we would welcome people into public life.  A week ago, the newspapers were full of comments about people having their jobs kept open for them when they were in public life.  The recent recruit from RTE made it quite clear that his job was being protected, as it should be.  In a democracy, every public or private workplace should rejoice and support any member of their workforce who opts for public representation.  That is the responsibility on all of us, in the public and private sectors, and in all parties and none.  The points made by Senator Twomey are correct.  People have moved into public life before from various backgrounds.  We accept them and recognise their good offices.  People do a job and get on with it.  We need to make an opening for people to opt for and make a career in public representation.  I would certainly like a debate on that issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>The prediction that the European Central Bank is set to reduce interest rates by a further 0.25% today to just 1%, which is its lowest ever level, is welcome news for many hard-pressed home owners.  It could lead to an approximate saving of &euro;40 for them each month if the reduction is passed on.  It is vital that it is passed on because we are in <Col N="304"/>danger of witnessing more people having to give up their homes because they cannot afford them.  At the moment, our social housing lists are as high as they have been at any time during the past 40 years.  Before Se&aacute;n Lemass&rsquo;s leadership led to change in modern Ireland in the early 1960s, there were 60,000 people on the social housing lists.  Even after the boom of the Celtic tiger years and the biggest house building programme in the history of the State, 60,000 people are still looking for houses.  It is a failure on the part of the Government.  The further additional cuts that have been announced recently mean that these figures will increase further.  The Leader should request the Minister to attend the House to explain exactly what he will do to tackle the area of social housing before it spirals out of control.</P>
        <P>I commend the ESRI on its report on job discrimination in Ireland. The report shows that people with foreign-sounding surnames have only half the chance of getting job interviews compared with those with Irish-sounding surnames.  This is despite having the same qualifications.  The rate is high compared with other countries and, as the author points out, more information needs to be given to employers on this issue.  Discrimination in the workplace needs to be tackled.  To get the country out of this mess, we must ensure we have the best qualified people for the job.  It does not matter whether they are applying for factory jobs in the west or office jobs in Dublin, no one should get a job based on their name, who their father was or who their brother is.  It should be purely down to their ability to do the job.  I therefore ask the Leader to arrange a debate on workplace discrimination.  Since one third of the Fianna F&aacute;il Ministers of State, and half Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s Cabinet members, are descendants of politicians, I ask for that debate to include the dangers of nepotism.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>It is called a family commitment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>I would also be interested in a debate on the dangers of nepotism.</P>
        <P>I join other speakers in calling for a debate on the media, including their influence, fairness and how they are perceived.  Whoever makes the decision to enter public life deserves the respect and thanks of all citizens because it takes great courage to put one&rsquo;s name forward.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Absolutely.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>Having said that, however, when people put their names forward, one cannot blame people for commenting on that, whether they are from the Government or Opposition side of the House.  It is legitimate to question one&rsquo;s reasons for entering political life as well as one&rsquo;s policies.  In that regard, we do not have to name he who must not be mentioned.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Senator mean George Lee?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>However, it would certainly explain the robustness and eagerness with which certain headlines may have been distributed in the past.  Without naming him or being disrespectful to the person in question, it is a legitimate question at this point.</P>

	<P>Shoot the messenger.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>

	<P>Allow Senator MacSharry to continue without interruption, please.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>While I do not know whether it is appropriate for the House to debate issues related to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, the issue of naming people in the House needs to be debated in open session.  An objective analysis of the record will prove that in the seven years since I entered the House, the Chair&rsquo;s rulings on which names may be mentioned in the House, which Senators may refer to individuals by name as well as the issues and times at which people may be referred to by name have been inconsistent.  A highly selective approach has been taken to picking up on Senators who refer to individuals outside the House by name. </P>
        <P>Members will be aware that I have been particularly critical of individuals in the Health Service Executive who have responsibility for sums of money equivalent to 47% of annual revenue from taxation, which will amount to &euro;34 billion this year.  The third party individuals I have named in the House have been in control of the budget of the Health Service Executive, an organisation which does not operate in the same way as semi-State bodies such as Bord G&aacute;is which has a commercial mandate and responsibility under the Gas Acts.  It is perfectly legitimate for Senators to refer to such individuals by name in the context of our work in representing the public interest.  It is not our role to appease the Chair by complying with rulings made on the basis of opinions expressed by the individuals who advise the Chair.  I say this with the greatest respect.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Senator Maurice Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator is being unfair. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>We must have an open debate. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Chair has made rulings on naming individuals who are not present in the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>While I have the most profound respect for the Cathaoirleach, the Leas-Chathaoirleach and all the staff of the Houses, the level of inconsistency and selectivity evident in rulings on the naming of individuals outside the Chamber needs to be addressed.  I would welcome an open debate on the issue.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I concur with the views expressed by Senators Twomey and O&rsquo;Toole.  As one who is not given to naming individuals, I do not propose to do so now.  As speakers, including Senator MacSharry, have noted, however, as democrats we should very much welcome people who are prepared to dedicate themselves to public service.  Everyone, irrespective of his or her walk of life, has talents.  It behoves Members not to denigrate the efforts of individuals in the public arena who are dedicated to public service and show themselves willing to have a shot at serving in public life in these Houses.  On the contrary, Senators should welcome diverse talents.  Given his experience as a Member of both Houses, I am sure the Leader, on mature reflection, will agree that it is essential for the good and health of our democracy that people are prepared to dedicate themselves to public service and public life and I ask him to respond.  If a debate on the issue is necessary, so be it.</P>
        <P>Yesterday, I referred to Sceilg Mhich&iacute;l, an outstanding and world famous heritage site which is the subject of some controversy.  As Senators will be aware, a tragic death occurred on the island recently.  At least three boats ply for hire from Portmagee, all of which are licensed by the Department of Transport to take passengers.  Despite the danger involved in this activity at certain times of the year &mdash; the landing place on Sceilg Mhich&iacute;l is also very dangerous &mdash; I understand that no one is prohibited from landing on the island.  The State must improve on the arrangements that are in place in this regard.  It is ludicrous that both the Department of <Col N="306"/>the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the Office of Public Works have a role on the island.  I plead with the Leader again to have the matter rectified.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Senator John Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>Given that recessions are by definition temporary downturns, I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on the economy, focusing on the apparent positive signs in world economies.  I am cognisant that the European Central Bank is expected to reduce the lending rate to 1%, markets in the United States are strongly forward, the credit default market for Irish bonds has returned significantly, indicating confidence in Irish bonds, while the price of oil is increasing and consumer sentiment is improving.  I contrast these trends with the views of economists.  It is said that economics is the dismal science and, as others have noted, economists have successfully predicted 14 of the past three recessions.  I recall that one prominent economist, an individual who has gained greater prominence in recent days, stated on the &ldquo;Six One News&rdquo; that the current recession is never-ending.  We all know that the tide will come in again.  For this reason, the debate on the economy should focus on jobs.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to make a couple of positive points which will require me to mention names but only for the purposes of identifying specific cases in a positive manner.  I very strongly welcome the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of Louise O&rsquo;Keeffe.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid=""><NameTxt>Senators</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Ms O&rsquo;Keeffe is a remarkable and courageous woman who was let down by the machinery of the State.  The State and church engaged in a nasty form of evasion of their clear responsibility to this woman who had demonstrated that she had been abused.  I welcome the decision by the Supreme Court to refuse to grant costs to the State as any other decision would have bankrupted Ms O&rsquo;Keeffe.  Yesterday was a very good day for democracy and for the rights of the individual.  Senators on all sides spoke out about this case. </P>
        <P>RTE, which has been the subject of criticism, broadcasts some wonderful, life-enhancing programmes.  For example, its recent documentary about Chuck Feeney, a person of whom we can be extremely proud, was wonderfully positive.  Mr. Feeney is a selfless, remarkable man who used the enormous wealth he had accrued throughout his business career to invest positively and anonymously in doing the things the Government should have done, including investing in third level education and infrastructure.  The critical matter was that Mr. Feeney examined these projects carefully before&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>Senators must refrain from referring by name to individuals outside the House. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>It would be impossible to refer to the example I am giving without mentioning the name of the individual in question.  I do not do so in a critical sense. </P>
        <P>I think I can refer to another Member of the House by name.  I am very pleased my colleague on this side, Senator John Paul Phelan, raised the circumstances facing Protestant schools, an issue I briefly referred to the other day.  I hesitate to raise this matter because I come from the Protestant community and I do not wish to be associated with&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The matter has been selected for discussion on the Adjournment. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand that.  I welcome the decision to select it for debate because it has a much more powerful effect if the issue is raised by somebody who is not a member of the Protestant community.  This shows the value of the House.</P>
<Col N="307"/>
        <P>I call for a debate on human rights in the international context, particularly in light of the appalling events in Afghanistan where more than 100 innocent civilians were blown to pieces by United States forces.  This is the type of incident I and many of my colleagues, including on the Government side, objected to when the Israelis were implicated in similar activities in Gaza.  It shows that even someone like President Obama finds turning around the ship of state a lengthy process.</P>
        <P>Tragically, if the United States and the Soviet Union, as it was then known, had made a moral investment and showed concern for human rights 20, 30 or 40 years ago, they might have jointly intervened on behalf of the unfortunate people, particularly women, of Afghanistan.</P>

	<P>Does the Senator have a question for the Leader?</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask for a debate on human rights to take into account circumstances analogous to those in Gaza that are still occurring, even under the Obama administration, in Afghanistan where the great powers played out a game, at long distance and to the disadvantage of that country&rsquo;s people, which inspired the Taliban and resulted in the negative aspects of extreme, fanatical religious positions.  </P>

	<P>I concur with the previous speaker&rsquo;s comments on the Supreme Court decision in the case of Ms Louise O&rsquo;Keeffe.  I warmly welcome the decision and congratulate Ms O&rsquo;Keeffe on her success.</P>
        <P>I support the view on human rights and on the situation which prevails in Afghanistan.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I ask the Leader to arrange for the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Barry Andrews, to come before the House in the next number of days, whenever it can be fitted into his schedule, to brief us on matters regarding inter-country adoption, the difficulties and issues he is being advised on and how he intends to address and overcome these.  I ask for that to be accommodated as soon as we can fit it into our schedule and the Minister of State, Deputy Andrews, can fit it into his.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P Just="Left">I wish to raise my concern about the application of the public service recruitment embargo, particularly its application by the HSE and the impact on front line staff, which includes first responders and nursing staff.  It is with regret I learn the INO is talking about strike action at its annual conference.  I put it to the Leader that we all know these are challenging and difficult times, but we know by working together we can address these challenges and reach consensus and we know in today&rsquo;s society it is best to avoid industrial action.  I ask that the mechanisms of the State are made available in the best interests of patient care and for the Leader to keep the House advised and briefed on that matter.</P>

	<P>I welcome the decision of our sister body in the Czech Republic, the Czech Senate or <i>haute chambre</i>, to approve the Lisbon treaty.  It leaves Ireland as the odd man out in Europe regarding Lisbon.  In connection with this, Mr. Lech Walesa was invited to speak at the recent conference of Libertas in Rome, and allegedly, according to <i>The Irish Times</i> and the Polish press, was paid &euro;50,000 by Libertas.  We were led to believe he was lending his support to that organisation.  That subterfuge has been exposed by the Polish media.  The case also shows something about the organisation and it has, in this instance, lost all credibility.</P>
        <P>The son of Mr. Walesa, who is a candidate in the Polish elections, said his father disagrees with Libertas, its opinion and how it works, but he understood it exists.  That is a complete denial and refutation of what we were led to believe, namely, that this was an endorsement of that organisation by Mr. Walesa, and the House should take note of that.</P>
<Col N="308"/>
        <P>In being the odd man out in Europe on Lisbon, we are also the odd man out in Europe on the economy and it is interesting how time flies.  It is one year since Deputy Brian Cowen became Taoiseach and this is one of the legacies of his stewardship over that year.  Unemployment has doubled, we have the largest drop in GNP in Europe and we have doubled our national debt.  One of the commitments of the Government and the Taoiseach, Deputy Cowen, who was the then Minister for Finance, before the last election was to make Ireland debt-free.</P>

	<P>Does the Senator have a question for the Leader?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, I have two questions for the Leader.  I have mentioned issues of political corruption and competence.  There is a serious question of political incompetence and we are paying the price for it.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Taoiseach, Deputy Cowen, does not have a mandate from the country one year after his elevation to that position.  He does not seem to have a mandate from his coalition partners, given the statements of the Minister, Eamon Ryan, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy John Gormley, and Senator Dan Boyle.  It increasingly seems as if he does not have a mandate from his own party.  At this juncture, and given the perilous state of our economy and that lack of mandate, is it not time for the Taoiseach and Government to consider, after the European and local elections, having a general election and making a clean sweep of the political process?</P>
        <P>I ask the Leader to clarify if he has a coalition partner in the Green Party, in light of the statements made by the Minister, Deputy Gormley, the Minister, Eoin Ryan&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCartyFF"><NameTxt>Senator John Carty</NameTxt>
	<P>On a point of order, I do not think Senator Regan is entitled to say Eoin Ryan, MEP, issued a statement.  He has mentioned his name twice.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Leader to address that because it is of fundamental importance in how we go forward.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I concur fully with the comments of Senator O&rsquo;Toole regarding welcoming people into the political profession.  Undoubtedly, while there is tremendous cynicism about politics across the country, most people who interact with politicians will acknowledge privately that most politicians are hardworking, genuine and earnest about what they do.  We need people from all strata of society, walks of life and professions to enhance the collective debate and cross-fertilisation of ideas within these Houses.  I welcome anybody coming into it.</P>
        <P>There is a second issue which we, as politicians, need to confront, namely, partisanship within the media generally.  We are living in a country which perhaps takes a greater interest in politics than do other countries.  We have a tradition of that and, therefore, it is appropriate that people from all walks of life, including the media, have their own political views.  However, some people in that profession channel and promote those views against the interest of the system in which we operate and perhaps abuse their position.  I attended a conference three years ago in UCD regarding the Defamation Bill at which the media were extremely well represented.  All the newspapers and other media outlets were there.  The secretary of the NUJ, as I recall, said at the time he was concerned about the deterioration in the standard of media reporting, which followed the downward spiral in Britain.</P>
        <P>I asked two weeks ago for a debate on this issue because undoubtedly there are elements within the <i>Irish Independent </i>group and RTE whose partisanship when reporting issues is totally blighted.  We need to get to a situation where people, when looking at reporting, get it objectively.<b> </b> I have no difficulty with people in the media giving their own opinions once it is done <Col N="309"/>under the banner of opinions or comment.  They are entitled to do that, but when we are receiving reporting across the spectrum of the media, it should come across in an objective, rather than a subjective, way.  This is not happening and is corrosive to the system.  It is undermining good initiatives being taken and politics in general, not just the Government but all politicians who are getting it on the doorsteps.  I know that from talking to people in the Opposition.  We need to stand up as a group and challenge and take that on.</P>
        <P>We should have a debate on the economy.  It is simplistic for Senator Regan to put forward his views.  One will not read in the media, for example, that there has been no property bubble in Germany and residential property there has&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The German economy will shrink by 5% despite that.  Will the Leader allow for a debate on the entire spectrum of the global economic downturn?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>We must have an objective debate.  We all must endeavour to support the initiatives being taken, which are the only initiatives that can arrest the downturn and position us to avail of the upturn when it comes.  I call for such a debate as soon as possible.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Callely&rsquo;s call for the Minister of State with responsibility for children, Deputy Barry Andrews, to come to the House to clarify the Government position on inter-country adoption.  The amount of foot-dragging and indecisiveness on this issue is causing great concern and distress to families in this State and abroad.  Urgent clarification is required.</P>
        <P>Many local authorities are struggling to provide the services they are obliged to deliver.  One might go so far as to say they have an unfunded mandate at the front line of communities.  Will the Leader allow for a debate on local government reform, as has been called for in this House on many occasions?  Candidates from all parties are currently knocking on doors throughout the State and are receiving varied receptions.  There should be encouragement for those who are prepared to enter public life and public service.  It is disappointing to see elements of the media and politicians themselves attempting to undermine or discourage them.  This is not good for democracy and politics and is something from which we should all refrain.  Fine Gael is delighted to have Mr. George Lee as its candidate in the Dublin South by-election.  Such endeavours should be encouraged by Members on all sides of the House.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There is a strong need for local government reform so that we can restructure the services it provides and introduce new efficiencies.  Attempts to improve local government in the past ten years have not been successful.  This is evident in the numbers of front-line staff being let go on a daily basis in local authorities throughout the State while the layers of management remain in place.  Increasingly, there is nobody to whom to delegate the important work that must be done, even though the expenditure involved remains substantial.  I call for a debate on this issue with specific focus on the proposals for directly elected mayors.  This is fine in principle and should be encouraged.  However, I am concerned at the lack of detail provided.  What powers will these mayors have and what will be their remit?  How will they undertake their duties, either with or against the county or city executive?  All these issues must be clarified.  We have heard certain names being touted as potential candidates for these positions in various locations.  Some of these names are a cause for alarm, such as that of the former Taoiseach, <Col N="310"/>Deputy Bertie Ahern.  The latter has done enough damage to the economy and I would hate to see him do the same to Dublin city.</P>

	<P>When is it proposed to bring the Adoption Bill 2009 back before the House?  Inter-country adoption has become a distressing issue for hundreds if not thousands of Irish families.  Procrastination, bad governance and poor leadership on the part of the Government have brought us to this situation.  When will it allay the fears of the many people who have adopted young children from abroad or wish to do so?</P>
        <P>Will the Leader allow time for a debate on the economy?  At a time when hundreds of thousands of our fellow citizens are losing their jobs, we are debating the candidacy of George Lee.  Mr. Lee merely reported on the recession; he did not create it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>

	<P>We must have a debate on the Government&rsquo;s jobs creation policy, its vision for creating indigenous employment and how best we can get people off the unemployment register and back to work.  Yesterday was the first occasion since her appointment that the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment came to the House.</P>
        <P>Will the Leader agree to a debate on the broad issue of politics and democracy?  For many people today, politicians are the lowest form of life in our society.  This inaccurate perception is a consequence of bad decisions on the part of the Government and of its failure to implement the changes it promised to deliver.  I will not name those concerned but at least seven people, including former RTE employees, former Independent Network News journalists and former political correspondents, are employed by the Government as spin doctors.  We on this side of the House have never complained about these appointments &mdash; I will not name them out of respect for the Chair.

	<P>I have two questions.  Will the Leader apologise to the House for the remarks that were made yesterday?  Second, will he allow a debate at the earliest opportunity on the role of alcohol in Irish society?  I understand the Leader will this month celebrate his 50th anniversary as a pioneer.  That is a tremendous achievement for which he deserves great credit.  Alcohol is the most widely used and most harmful drug in our society.  A debate is required as a matter of urgency.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Leader allow time for a debate on human rights?  Perhaps he will consider facilitating a regular debate on this topic.</P>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a universal issue which applies not merely to one race of people.  Human rights denied or abused diminishes all of humanity.</P>
        <P>The slaughter of innocents in Afghanistan cries out for justice.  However, instead of justice for the survivors, the incident will be filed under some type of military term and that will be the end of it.  Even though our voice is not always heard, if we do not speak up, we are party, to some extent, to what is happening.  Anybody who saw the television pictures and heard the shocking story of the entire family, including four or five children, that was wiped out cannot but be shocked.  These people were merely sheltering from the bombing raid.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Events in Afghanistan have gone off the radar in recent times.  Were it not for those courageous journalists and camera men who are prepared to go into war zones, we might never have heard about what happened there.  Those who dropped the bombs may have been well intentioned in so far as their policies are concerned, but such an approach is counter-productive.  This event will serve to feed terrorism by providing propaganda to the Taliban and others who are engaged in terrorist activity.  Above all, however, it has devastated an entire community.  The Secretary of State, Ms Hillary Clinton, seemed genuinely shocked when acknowledging that a mistake was made.  That is certainly different from what we got from the previous administration.  She seemed to be attempting to put down a marker that such incidents are unacceptable.</P>
        <P>The people of Afghanistan will not know that a debate on their situation is taking place in this House.  However, such a debate may contribute to an awareness of this issue and to the eventual attainment of justice for these unfortunate people.</P>

	<P>Last evening, while canvassing for Senator Paschal Donohoe in Dublin Central, I came across a number of people who have serious difficulties with their mortgages.  I encountered the same anger of which Senator Walsh spoke.  Considering that we have bailed out these banks, I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on fixed-rate mortgages.  One lady, who has lost her job, told me it would cost her &euro;11,000 in penalties to change from a fixed rate mortgage.  This is a crime.</P>
<Col N="312"/>
        <P Just="Left">In my constituency, which is also the Leader&rsquo;s constituency, a small business owner told me that since the bailout of the banks his bank charges have increased.  What is going on?  People are put to the pin of their collars trying to make ends meet.  The Government has the power to impose levies on banks to discourage them from ripping off our people, especially with regard to fixed-rate mortgages.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LarryButler"><NameTxt>Senator Larry Butler</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the Senators who called for debate on the economy.  However, I would like to see a three-way debate on the economy.  A full day should be given to this matter and the Minister for Finance, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, and the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources could come to the House in turn.</P>
        <P>We had a very good debate on the motion on energy tabled by the Independent Senators yesterday.  Energy could be the cornerstone of an improved economy.  The debate I call for would require the attendance of the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  It would tie the strands of power and job creation together.</P>
        <P>A new company was featured on Pat Kenny&rsquo;s radio programme today.  This company has found that Ireland is very rich in energy, which we should exploit over the next three to five years.  We could be self-sufficient in energy and even export it.  This could take us out of the situation in which we find ourselves.</P>
        <P>I ask the Leader to consider a three-way debate on the economy.  I know it will be difficult to arrange for three Ministers to come to the House on a single day.  The three Ministers could attend for separate sessions in the morning, afternoon and evening.  I support the call for a debate on the economy because I consider it to be urgent.</P>

	<P>We look forward to debating issues on the doorsteps with the electorate.  They will decide.  Every country has been touched by the ravages of the current downturn.  We are no different.  We are an open and small economy and are probably worst hit in that regard.  We are also the economy which can come back the quickest.  I look forward to the rebound starting in the United States.  We are very fortunate that Mr. Barack Obama became President of the United States when the world was looking for someone to give hope.  What he has done in his first 100 days is a shining example to us legislators who want to do what we can on behalf of our people.</P>
<Col N="313"/>
        <P>Senator Hannigan referred to the likelihood of the European Central Bank cutting the rate by 0.25% today.  That is to be welcomed as a help to hard-pressed mortgage payers who are looking forward to it.  Since last October, interest rates have been reduced by 3.25%.  This is unprecedented in the history of the European Central Bank.  It is the one great helping hand to economies throughout the world and those giving employment.  Interest rates have substantially reduced from the bad old days of the 1980s when our colleagues on the other side of the House were in power and we paid interest rates of 18% and 19%.  The present downturn is the worst since the 1930s, but in terms of banking and interest rates we are on a horse of a different colour.</P>
        <P>I can have the ESRI report and job creation included in the debate on the economy which has been called for and to which I will allude in a moment.</P>
        <P>Senator Marc MacSharry referred to the Standing Order regarding the naming of individuals outside the House.  I assure Senator MacSharry that I will bring his concerns to the attention of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges at our next sitting.  Between now and next week, I will consider his request for a debate on this issue.  Senators may make written submissions to the CPP.  If they feel this Standing Order should be revisited, we can consider that.</P>
        <P>Senator Coghlan raised the difficulties experienced at the world famous heritage attraction in the kingdom of Kerry.  I fully support his call for the provision of an iron rail for the safety of tourists.  It would not take away from the historical importance of the site and should be considered.</P>
        <P>Senators Hanafin, Buttimer, Walsh and Butler called for a debate on the economy.  Senator Butler called for a three-way debate with the Minister for Finance, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, and the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  This is a very good idea.  It would not be possible in the next two weeks during which the Finance Bill will be debated in the D&aacute;il, or on 26 and 27 May when it will be debated in this House.  During the debate on the Finance Bill, colleagues will have ample opportunity to express their views on the economy.  Leaders of the groups could then decide on a programme for June, when we return after the elections, and consider the proposal for a three-way debate.</P>
        <P>Senators Norris and Callely offered their congratulations regarding yesterday&rsquo;s Supreme Court decision.  Everyone was very pleased that this courageous person was given the decision by the court yesterday.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I refer to the outstanding television documentary on Chuck Feeney who played a significant part with the Government and particularly the Department of Education and Science in the substantial investment made to the city of Limerick and all the universities and educational institutes throughout the country.  The former Taoiseach, Albert Reynolds, a former constituency colleague, was particularly very friendly with him and he had Mr. Feeney&rsquo;s 100% confidence.  I refer also to the former Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, and Ed Walsh in the University of Limerick in respect of what they have achieved and what has been achieved by this man&rsquo;s generosity, which I hope is never forgotten by the generations to come in Ireland, particularly at such a difficult time in fundraising or getting funds.  In this regard Mr. Feeney made a massive contribution from his life&rsquo;s wealth to the underprivileged and the future generations of the world.</P>
        <P>Senators Norris and &Oacute; Murch&uacute; requested a debate on human rights issues, particularly in Afghanistan, to which I can accede.  Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; called for justice for those unfortunate people and I have no difficulty in allocating time for a debate in this area.</P>
        <P>Senators Callely, Coffey and Buttimer expressed concerns and called for the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Barry Andrews, to come to the <Col N="314"/>House.  Senator Callely has been very forceful on this matter for a considerable period.  I am pleased to inform the House that the Minister of State, Deputy Andrews, will return to the House with the Adoption Bill next Wednesday.  Colleagues will be looking forward to making their contribution for those anxiously awaiting the decision in this area.</P>
        <P>Senator Regan spoke of developments in the Czech Republic and its support for the Lisbon treaty.  We are the only country that has not supported it.  The development in the Czech Republic is another step in the right direction and, hopefully, later on or at the end of this year the Irish people will have a chance to review the situation to see how we can support it also.</P>
        <P>I offer our congratulations on the Taoiseach being appointed to office one year ago today.  I offer my congratulations on behalf of the House to the Taoiseach and wish him well in the coming years.  It has been a most difficult year for the Taoiseach.  No one could say he got a honeymoon time in office.  It could not have been a more difficult time.  If I were to take advice from anyone who had experience of a downturn, who better than our colleagues on the opposite side of the House, including Senator Regan, to give that advice?</P>

    <Title>Companies (Amendment) Bill 2009: Second Stage (Resumed). </Title>
        <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Senator Brendan Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>At present section 23 of the Companies Act 1990 allows a person to refuse to disclose what he or she considers to be privileged information to the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement.  Based on this, legal privileges were claimed in the Anglo Irish Bank case and the ODCE was not permitted to appoint a retired High Court judge to adjudicate on the matter of privilege claimed.  The Bill proposes a change which would enable the ODCE to seize privileged information provided it maintains the confidentiality of the information until such time as a court determines if the information is protected by legal privilege.  It also allows the appointment of a suitably qualified, independent person to prepare a report on the disputed information.  The Bill addresses the issues arising from the Anglo Irish Bank case so we generally welcome it.  However, one area causes me some difficulty.  Section 40 of the Companies Act 1990 states:  &ldquo;An officer of a company who authorises or permits the ... company to enter into a transaction or arrangement knowing or having reasonable cause to believe that the company was thereby contravening section 31 shall be guilty of an offence.&rdquo;  Section 31 restricts the giving by a company of loans and guarantees to its directors.  It seems that the Bill&rsquo;s proposed amendment to the law will make each officer of the company guilty of an offence irrespective of their actions or knowledge of any wrongdoing.  As I said, I have some difficulty with the proposed change because it risks criminalising an officer of the company even if he or she had no part in or knowledge of any wrongdoing.  I ask the Minister to comment on this and perhaps to reconsider it.</P>
        <P>Under company law, companies in general and banks have different obligations for disclosure.  I do not know why this is so.  Section 42 of the Companies Act 1990 requires companies in general to disclose in their annual accounts details of certain transactions, including loans to directors and connected persons, but banks are only obliged to disclose aggregated data on such loans where amounts were still outstanding at the end of the financial year.  The Bill removes this anomaly by providing that loans made to directors of companies that are licensed banks shall be treated in the same way as loans made by any other company.  All loans above a certain threshold to individual directors will have to be disclosed separately in the annual accounts rather than in an aggregated form.  This is important, as we saw with the Anglo Irish Bank and Mr. Sean FitzPatrick affair.  In future, the maximum amount outstanding during the year will be disclosed and not simply the amount outstanding at the end of the financial year.  These provisions are to be welcomed.</P>
        <P>The Bill also proposes a change to the requirement that an Ireland-registered company has at least one director who is resident in Ireland.  The Bill replaces this by requiring at least one director who is resident in a member state of the EEA.  This change was required by the European Commission to comply with EU law.  It is understandable and reasonable.</P>
        <P>Apart from the one reservation I mentioned, which might manifest itself in an amendment on Committee Stage, I, on behalf of the Labour Party, am happy enough with the broad thrust of the Bill.  Before Committee Stage, we will look closely at the detailed wording of the Bill and we will likely return with several amendments.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Billy Kelleher.  He has been here a number of times already and it is my pleasure to welcome him again today.  I also welcome the Bill, which contains a number of sensible provisions that will clear up grey areas in the law on loans to company directors and some other areas of company law.  The Opposition parties welcome the Bill because they recognise it is good and necessary legislation.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCartyFF"><NameTxt>Senator John Carty</NameTxt>
	<P>In the light of the recent controversy at Anglo Irish Bank, much more transparency is needed in loans that companies make to their directors and associates.  Section 2 of the Bill places the onus on the company director to declare any interest he or she has in actual or proposed contracts with their company.  This information is to be held in a book of declarations which the Director of Corporate Enforcement can access at any time.  I hope the book will be looked at and checked out regularly.  Currently, directors are not required to show any contractual interests they have, so the proposal is a welcome development.  Politicians in the Seanad and the other House are subject to a requirement to fill in a questionnaire each year about what property, shares etc. we have and this information is put in the public domain.  We have to go before our peers every four to five years and they judge what we have or have not done and whether we have got moneys illegally or otherwise.  When we consider the amount of money the State spends on inquiries, tribunals etc., it beggars belief that people in financial institutions handle a lot more money without anybody knowing about it.  If it was not for the global downturn and recession, we would probably never hear or know anything about it.  The Bill will, for the first time, put loans made to directors of licensed banks on an equal footing with loans made by non-banking companies.  There is a strong argument to be made that this should always have been the case, but it is nevertheless a positive step forward.  To prevent any future misrepresentation of the loan amounts owed by directors of licensed banks, annual accounts will show the maximum amount outstanding during the year and not simply the sum owed at the end of the year, as has been the case previously.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Bill also covers connected persons.  Previous events have shown that friends and associates of those in licensed banks can be privy to soft loans with unusually lenient terms and conditions.  It has created tremendous anger among the people that such practices have gone on.  People in high places got loans at very low interest rates while smaller borrowers had to give huge commitments to the banks and other lending institutions.  Indeed, people had to hand over all their documentation regarding their ownership of their property.  I can only say that sharp practices went on.  I note from Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s comments yesterday that, back in the Middle Ages, guys in Venice and other parts of the civilised world at the time would probably have been hung for dealing with getting loans and borrowing money in this way.  The Bill increases the amount of information connected persons are required to disclose.  Like directors, they are required to disclose the maximum amount outstanding during the year.</P>
        <P>I welcome the fact that the Bill gives the Director of Corporate Enforcement the right to access the register of loans to directors and connected persons so enforcement action can be taken if necessary.  Section 9 requires licensed banks to prepare an annual statement that relates to their register of loans to directors.  This statement must be made available before the company&rsquo;s AGM.  It is important that people have access to this information.  This is a sound provision because it will ensure that all relevant shareholders are informed about the position with directors&rsquo; loans.  It will be an offence for companies, banks and their directors not to comply with the requirement of disclosure of loans to directors and connected persons.  The Bill clarifies the Director of Corporate Enforcement&rsquo;s right to access third party records that relate to a company under investigation.  The Director of Corporate Enforcement will also be able to seek from the court an extension of the period of a search warrant, and the Bill provides for the removal of paper and electronic information from premises that are searched.  I hope these measures will not have to be called for too often, but they are essential if the Director of Corporate Enforcement is to carry out the duties of that office effectively.</P>
        <P>We are aware that a wide-ranging analysis of company law is well advanced and the Minister intends to publish significant legislation containing 1,250 sections next year.  I hope this will <Col N="318"/>happen and that all aspects of the Companies (Amendment) Bill will be included in it.  I welcome the Bill and look forward to the larger one when it comes to the House next year.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank my colleague, Senator Coghlan, for yielding to me.  I welcome the Bill which is appropriate and timely.  It brings us into the computer age and takes into account all the outflow of these terrible financial scandals but it is a bit late in the day.  It is a pity we did not wake up earlier and act in this regard previously, in particular in respect of this shameful business of loans.  Much of this comes after the Anglo Irish Bank debacle.</P>
        <P>I was a director of a number of companies but never took anything out of them even though they were commercially successful.  I had loans but the loans in which I was involved were ones I made to keep the companies afloat.  I eventually got them back.  It is quite extraordinary that there is a complete lack of regulation and that people are allowed to launder loans by taking them off the books for a period of time to conceal them.  That is very close to fraud and is a very dangerous practice.  I hope this Bill will seal that off.</P>
        <P>I am glad there is a possibility of investigating officers, acting on behalf of the regulator, to go into organisations.  It is a certain invasion of legal protections in terms of privilege between professional persons and clients but, in these circumstances, it is necessary.</P>
        <P>One thing which is not really addressed in the Bill is the bonuses paid to directors and senior personnel.  These must be made legally performance related.  It is completely absurd to reward people for failure, which happens.  On the front page of <i>The Irish Times</i> today there is an article about investors wanting a say on the pay of Irish firms&rsquo; top executives.  In Britain, resolutions on executive pay are quite normal but in this country, they seem not to be.</P>
        <P>I find it astonishing that a Bank of Ireland spokesman can say it is covered by the general report.  There is only one vote on it so one must vote against the entire series of accounts or leave any question of inappropriate remuneration out of the game.  That should be addressed.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This is an important Bill which is too late, although it may prevent things from happening in the future.  It is quite wrong for people to milk their own companies.  This is especially scandalous when they are building societies because they started off as mutual societies for the benefit of people but turned into some kind of casinos operated in the interests of some of the principals involved.  That is quite wrong.  Again, I thank Senator Coghlan for facilitating me.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State and wish him well with his new responsibilities.  I have no doubt he will deal with all matters comprehensively and competently.  I welcome the contents of this Bill but will comment on what it should also have contained.  Like Senators Norris, Ryan and Cannon, everyone on this side of the House welcome this measure in light of recent developments.</P>
        <P>There have been so many furtive transfers and dealings which were deliberately kept under the radar that the matter had to be addressed.  There is no place in Irish company life for the dubious activities we have witnessed recently.  It does not reflect any credit on Irish society that some directors of companies &mdash; in some instances, very large companies &mdash; ran them as if they were personal fiefdoms without any regard for the law or the fact a company is a separate body in law.  For that reason, as well as the manner in which share registers were maintained in some instances, I very much welcome the Bill.  I hope the Director of Corporate Enforcement will be able to be strict in regard to the manner in which the new register of directors&rsquo; loans is kept to ensure it is kept in a satisfactory manner.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I agree very much with the remarks of Senator O&rsquo;Toole who spoke about light touch regulation which we realise does not work.  He chaired the audit review group and spoke about directors&rsquo; compliance statements.  I agree with what he said about that issue.  All material <Col N="319"/>matters must be included.  He also spoke about the Company Law Review Group about which I will speak in a minute.</P>
        <P>I tabled a Private Members&rsquo; Bill, the Credit Institutions (Financial Support) (Amendment) Bill 2009.  Under current law, the ability of the Director of Corporate Enforcement is being impeded.  How does he deal with an entity which is not a company?  That is why we tabled this Private Members&rsquo; Bill which, I accept, was done in a rush.  It may not be adequate but it would be very acceptable to us if it was taken and improved.  If not, we believe we must table an amendment to this Bill on Committee Stage to cover that point.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The T&aacute;naiste indicated her intention to bring forward this legislation amending the Companies Acts to increase the powers of the Director of Corporate Enforcement which we very much welcome in regard to transparency, loans to directors and powers to enforce compliance.  However, I do not believe these promised measures go far enough in that they prevent the director from investigating building societies or credit unions.  While there has been an indication of an intention to close this loophole, we believe strongly this cannot wait for another day because very often legislation is not brought into the House quickly.  I look forward to the Minister of State&rsquo;s comments on this.  Once this Bill is passed and if this issue is not dealt with, perhaps it will be allowed to rest.</P>
        <P>We are all aware of the very disturbing allegations about Anglo Irish Bank, Irish Life &amp; Permanent and Irish Nationwide, which is a building society.  The Director of Corporate Enforcement is currently actively engaged in Anglo Irish Bank but is prevented from doing cross-checking because he cannot go near Irish Nationwide in regard to those loan transfers which were deliberately kept under the radar.  There is no excuse for such a large section of the financial sector to be excluded from investigation when such a <i>prima facie</i> case exists, as at present.  For that reason we are most anxious that this anomalous position be dealt with quickly.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In passing, I compliment  the Oireachtas Library &amp; Research Service on its wonderful work on the Bills Digest on this item of intended law, published yesterday, which Members have probably seen.  Page two of the document refers to the working group on company law compliance and enforcement under the chairmanship of Michael McDowell, senior counsel, a former Minister.  The working group found that compliance with company regulation was generally low, which is another reason we need this measure.  I found this document informative.  I hope to digest it further before Committee Stage.  I found the requirement of corporate compliance outlined in the document interesting.  I wish to refer specifically to another part of the document, which I thought I had marked but I must not have done so.</P>

Instead of being individually listed, aggregate information on all such loans must be appended to the annual accounts.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LarryButler"><NameTxt>Senator Larry Butler</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I also welcome the introduction of this Bill.  It is overdue in terms of what has happened in our financial and banking services during the past few months.  Members of the public were very annoyed at the manner in which directors&rsquo; loans and so forth were dealt with.  I welcome the Bill in addressing that.</P>
        <P>It is one step to bring legislation through the House and enact it but we must act on foot of it and put the necessary governance structures in place in the banking and financial sector.  That is the aspect about which I have the greatest concern.  The governance structures in place up to now have not been sufficient in terms of enforcing the provisions of the existing legislation.</P>
        <P>That was evident in Anglo Irish Bank where directors&rsquo; loans were not disclosed and large amounts of money were transferred from it to another organisation.  When drafting legislation we must guard against such practices happening in the future.  While we can tightly draft this legislation, if there is not an authority in place to govern and enforce it, it will be worthless.  While we are doing a good job today, unless we ensure the Central Bank and Financial Regulator play their role and the necessary governance structures and checks and balances in the banking sector are in place, the legislation will be worthless.  I am convinced of that.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The reorganising of the banks at this time presents a great opportunity to put the necessary governance structures in place to enforce this legislation.  It will cost money to do so, in the same way as it costs money to run anything, but it will be well worth it.  We depend internationally on financial transactions into and out of this country and we have a large financial services sector.  A great deal of ground was lost in terms of the progress made in that sector and there has been a great loss of confidence in it internationally.  This legislation presents an opportunity for us to restore confidence in it internationally.  We need to do that.</P>
        <P>This Bill is necessary.  It provides that future loans to directors of companies that are licensed banks will be treated in the same way as non-banking companies.  Specifically, all loans above a minimum threshold to each individual named director will have to be disclosed separately in the annual accounts as opposed to the aggregate format.  The maximum amount outstanding during the year, not simply the amount outstanding at the end of the financial year, will also have to be disclosed.  These were the types of practices that took place in the financial services sector.  The practices that were allowed to develop were loose and sloppy and the services were not doing the job for which they were set up in the first instance.</P>
        <P>I do not have much more to say on the Bill.  Previous speakers made good points.  In terms of the requirement in respect of a register and a pre-AGM statement, the Bill retains the requirement for the statutory register of banks of relevant loans because of its value as a source to update the data on current loans.  However, there is no value in providing duplicate information for shareholders.  The Bill provides for pre-AGM statements, which are needed.  Shareholders need to be informed.  Unless a shareholder is given full disclosure of such matters by the chairman or managing director of the company, it is not tenable for shareholders to allow a company to continue in business.  They need to be given the full picture.  The effectiveness of <Col N="321"/>the legislation will depend on the governance structures within a company or organisation covered by it.</P>
        <P>I have completed what I have to say.  It was brief but important.  I thank the Minister of State for bringing the Bill to the House.  It has been well teased out here.  We have time in this House to ensure we carefully read the Bill to ensure it contains the right provisions to deal with our financial services.  I impress on the Minister of State to ensure that any legislation introduced is underpinned by the necessary governance structures within an organisation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Kelleher.  I also welcome the proposed changes in the Bill.  It comes on the back of the shocking revelations that a bank had concealed from public scrutiny huge loans granted to a former chairman for eight years.  The Bill closes a legal loophole that allowed bank directors to keep their individual borrowings secret from the Financial Regulator and sets strict limits on the amount that may be borrowed by bank directors.  </P>
        <P>Company law has in the past treated banks differently from other businesses in recording loans to directors.  The Companies Act 1990 limits loans from businesses to their directors to 10% of the company&rsquo;s assets.  Until now, banks have been exempt from detailed disclosure but were required to record the aggregate total of loans to directors at the end of the year.  This situation could not continue.  As has been shown by all the recent scandals, policing the 10% rule has been next to impossible for the authorities.</P>
        <P>This Bill specifies that all loans above the threshold to each individual named director will have to be disclosed separately in the annual accounts.  I also am pleased to note that the liability of directors has been amended by making every director of every company that contravenes the Bill severally and individually liable for the contravention as the current legislation provides that liability is confined to the directors who approved contravening loans to other directors.  Second, the Bill will make it an offence for companies and their directors to fail to comply with the disclosure provisions regarding loans and material interests of directors in company contracts.</P>
        <P>The Director of Corporate Enforcement will now have a right to access third party records relating to a company under investigation.  The 2008 report of the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement showed a 22% rise in alleged breaches of company law which in many cases involved directors&rsquo; loans where borrowings were used for improper impersonal benefit amounting to &euro;134 million last year, a four-fold increase on 2007.

	<P>I welcome the Second Stage contributions from Senators as they have been very helpful and insightful.  I was a Member of this House from 1993 to 1997 and I endorse the view that this House allows for broad, reflective debate at times and some very interesting points were raised by Senators on all sides.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I remind Senators that the Bill is very focused and aims to deal with a limited number of issues requiring immediate attention.  Some of the company law suggestions made by Senators are not directly related to these urgent issues and therefore I consider that any positive response should await the major company law reform and consolidation Bill which is being drafted and is to be published next year.  This is a significant undertaking containing approximately 1,200 sections.  It will consolidate all company law.  There have been broad discussions with the stakeholders and the Government will be bringing the Bill forward as soon as possible but it is a significant undertaking by the Department and by all those who have been consulted.</P>
<Col N="322"/>
        <P Just="Left">The T&aacute;naiste is still actively considering a number of the issues upon which there were divided views in the Company Law Review Group, for instance, the question of the directors&rsquo; compliance statement which was raised by Senator O&rsquo;Toole yesterday.  The T&aacute;naiste will bring her resulting legislative proposals to Government before the major Bill is published.  It will be ultimately for the House to consider and adopt the final legislative proposals.</P>
        <P>The contributions by Senators Cannon, Callely, Norris, Coghlan and Butler touched on financial regulatory matters that properly fall within the remit of the Minister for Finance.  I will ensure these comments are brought to his attention for his consideration and that of his officials.  Senators will be aware that the Minister for Finance has announced his intention to bring forward proposals for a revised regulatory framework for the financial sector.  It is acknowledged that the financial services sector is of critical and strategic importance in the broader economy.  Approximately 25,000 people are directly employed in the financial services sector and the Government wants to ensure there are proper and appropriate regulatory frameworks in place.  There has been broad discussion about this issue and the Government does not intend to have a knee-jerk reaction to issues that have been raised in other jurisdictions particularly in the United States.  We are aiming for a calm, rational analysis of the need for changes in regulation while at the same time being conscious that this country, as a global, open trading economy, is competing in the international markets and that financial services are very mobile.  We must still be able to protect our integrity and assure investors and markets that the systems and regulations in place here are appropriate and will stand up to scrutiny.  However, this is an issue for another day in the context of regulation of the financial services.</P>
        <P>In response to the point raised by Senator Cannon yesterday and Senator Coghlan today, that the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement should have a role with regard to the activities of building societies and credit unions, the T&aacute;naiste and I hold the view that the regulation of these financial services sectors rests with and should remain the responsibility of the Financial Regulator.</P>
        <P>Senators Callely and Boyle raised issues relating to the disclosure of loans to connected persons.  Section 26<b> </b>of the Companies Act 1990 defines connected persons for the purpose of Part 3 of that Act, the Part which deals with transactions involving directors.  This definition includes the directors&rsquo; parents, brothers, sisters or children.  As the T&aacute;naiste explained yesterday, the Financial Regulator is empowered under the Central Bank Acts to require more detailed disclosures in the accounts of loans made to persons connected to directors of licensed banks.  It must be remembered that company law covers all companies and only a limited number of companies are licensed banks.  We need to be aware that this Bill must encompass all companies and is not just specifically for the areas referred to by some Senators.  The provisions of this Bill accommodate the position whereby the Financial Regulator can, if considered appropriate, use a refined definition which will be solely appropriate to companies which are licensed banks.</P>
        <P>Senator Boyle raised some fundamental questions about the nature of directors&rsquo; loans and the purposes for which they are given.  These provisions fall to be further examined in the reform and consolidation Bill as previously mentioned.</P>
        <P>I refer to the point raised by Senator Ryan in connection with section 40.  Is the Senator suggesting it could criminalise officers?</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>Yes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Kelleher</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a defence system allowed under section 383 of the Companies Act 1963.  The purpose of this section 40 is to make that provision more robust, to make people <Col N="323"/>accountable and answerable.  Previously, there was a necessity to prove the officer knowingly or wilfully authorised or permitted the default in question but now the onus will be on the officer and there is a defence allowable under section 383 of the Companies Act 1963.  I hope this clarifies the issue for the Senator.</P>
        <P>In response to queries from Senator Callely about consultation with stakeholders, the urgency of introducing this legislation meant that only limited consultation was possible.  I can confirm that with regard to loans to bank directors issues, the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, the Department of Finance and the Financial Regulator were the main offices consulted.  With regard to amendments to Part 2 of the 1990 Act and other provisions granting access to registers, the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement was also consulted.</P>
        <P>The European Commission, the Companies Registration Office, the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners were consulted about provisions regarding the Irish registered non-resident companies.  Deputy Coghlan also referred to the McDowell report of 1999.  It has to be acknowledged that when that report was published initially only 13% of companies were in compliance with the Companies Registration Office but that percentage has now increased to 90%.  On foot of that report the Government set up the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement.</P>

	<P>I appreciate that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Kelleher</NameTxt>
	<P>The report was acted upon.</P>
        <P>Amendments are proposed in two areas of the Bill.  I am not giving a hostage to fortune but this is the Oireachtas where legislation is decided upon and everybody&rsquo;s opinion is valued here.  This is where legislation can be refined and examined in greater detail and the Government will be willing to listen to arguments that stand up to scrutiny and which would improve the legislation.  I refer to those proposed amendments with regard to the issue of the Irish registered non-resident companies and the amendment of section 40 in Part 2 of the 1990 Act.</P>
        <P>The country is in very challenging times with regard to the economy.  There are difficulties to deal with such as rising unemployment and a drop in exports and we are under severe pressure.  However, we must address the issue of banking.  The banks are under huge pressure and this is not because of any internal context but rather as a result of the broader international global credit crisis which has afflicted all modernised economies.  It is critical to have structurally sound banks which can access credit on the wholesale money markets and provide it to first-time buyers and small and medium-sized businesses.</P>
        <P>It is important we do not put out these bland statements on the purpose of the Government&rsquo;s support of the banks through the bank guarantee, which was of critical importance to the State and the functioning of the economy on 29 September 2008.  If we had not brought that forward at that time, we could have been in a very precarious position because a collapse of any one of the major financial institutions that are of systemic importance would have had a knock-on effect on the broader economy.  That was of great importance.  Some people and parties have views on that but it was genuinely brought forward with one aim, to support and avoid a systemic collapse of the banking system in this country.  At the time it was acknowledged internationally by everybody that it was a brave and courageous decision and, more important, it was the right decision.</P>
        <P>We then went further in having broader due diligence of the banks.  There was the nationalisation of Anglo Irish Bank for the reasons pointed out at the time by the Minister for Finance because of issues that arose in the context of undermining confidence due to certain activities.  That is why that bank was nationalised.  We then had the whole area of the capitalisation of the banks.</P>
      </Speaker>
<Col N="324"/>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not complete yet.  Only one bank has been recapitalised.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Kelleher</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, but we are in the process and it is important that we temper our language in these debates to point out that the Government is not capitalising banks for the sake of giving them money to support the developers.  It is to ensure we have a working financial system in this country.  I use any forum to point out that the Government is fundamental about ensuring we have working banks in place.  Every country is grappling with this major difficulty of impaired assets.  It is not unique to Ireland but has happened across all modern economies.  It started first with the collapse of Lehman Brothers and the sub-prime market in the USA and it has spread across the world.  The simplistic argument that has been put forward that we are just giving a few bob to the banks so they can look after developers is fundamentally unfair to what the Government is trying to do.  More important, when Senators and Deputies raise the issue of lack of credit to mortgage holders and small and medium sized businesses to go about their daily business, it does not stack up.</P>

	<P>The banks are not helping small businesses.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Kelleher</NameTxt>
	<P>We must support the policy of ensuring we have a financially viable and credible banking system.  The banks have a fundamental role to play in this.  I said this publicly on numerous occasions in my previous role.  There is a new relationship between the Irish banks and people through the bank guarantee and support through the capitalisation.  We must encourage the banks to open up and allow commercial lending to small and medium-sized businesses.  The idea of retracting and retrenching overdraft and short-term loan facilities to businesses is not acceptable.  I urge, as should every Senator, the banks to accept that.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Kelleher</NameTxt>

	<P>I had one only last week.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Kelleher</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a new and detailed relationship between the State, the people and the Irish banking system.  I urge banks to reflect on that.  We all know that banks are challenged because of the internal and international difficulties but they have a fundamental role and we are supporting them so they can provide credit.  We must have a mature debate on why we are dealing with the banks.  We must have that functioning system in place and there must be credibility.  That is why it is important that, in the context of the broader issues as discussed by the Minister for Finance in his review of the regulation of the financial services sector, we have regulation that is appropriate and acceptable and that stands up to international scrutiny.  It is critical to the financial services sector and the economy that we do not move these services offshore.  They are mobile and can move quite quickly if they are overburdened so appropriate regulation is required.</P>
        <P>I thank the Senators and look forward to the discussions on Committee Stage.  While we all spoke about the broader issues, this legislation is specific.  It was brought forward to address some of the issues raised by Senators.  I am confident that when it comes out the other side it will allow for more scrutiny and enforcement to ensure there is integrity in the areas to which the Bill refers.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister.  I am sorry that the Minister for Education and Science is not here to discuss this very important issue which has raised its head in recent months.  For the sake of a saving which is paltry in the context of the current crisis, the Minister has taken a course of action that will disproportionately and deeply affect a particular community.  In the haste to cut and run, he found what he supposed was a soft target and saved the grand total of &euro;2.8 million.  Rashly, he has overturned an established settlement and angered a community.  I do not accuse the Minister of ill-intent but rather a lack of reflection and rash action, and I urge him to take time to reflect more carefully on whether this is a saving we can afford.</P>
        <P>Since the foundation of the State, men and women of goodwill of all parties have striven to ensure that this nation would be a comfortable and welcoming home to all its citizens.  At times we have failed in our duty to the Protestant community in this regard, but on the whole a young and poor country did its best.  One of the success stories has been the recognition and support given to those schools which reflect the faith and values of our minorities.  When the then Minister, Donogh O&rsquo;Malley, introduced free education he understood that, for it to be a real rather than notional achievement, special regard would have to be given to those churches whose membership was spread thinly but more or less evenly throughout the State.</P>
        <P>Our Constitution separates church and State but it also recognises the role of faith in society and the central right of parents to have their children educated in schools that share their values.  As Deputy Hanafin said when she was Minister for Education and Science, &ldquo;Since the foundation of the State, all parties and all Governments have supported such schools, largely to protect choice and the ethos of minorities.&rdquo;  The attack by the Minister, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, on Protestant schools will have consequences which will make that choice more notional than practical.  We will see a reduction in teacher numbers, an increase in class sizes, a diminution of subject choice and, ultimately, an increase in fees.  The corrosive effect on the quality of education being offered by schools which today are excellent would be disastrous.</P>
        <P>The Minister is quoted as saying he sees no reason that Protestant fee-paying schools should be treated differently from Roman Catholic ones.  If that is his position, he needs to think again.  Does he truly believe the same variety of school choice is available to Protestant parents as to those who send their children to Clongowes Wood College or Blackrock College?  What about Wexford, Offaly, Laois, Clare, Tipperary, Kerry, Mayo, Leitrim, Longford and Westmeath?  Half the counties in the Republic have no Protestant secondary schools.  Does the Minister really believe this is analogous to Roman Catholic schools?</P>
        <P>Outside the family, schools are the most important vehicle that exists for a minority to maintain its confessional identity and cohesion as a faith community.  If this State is to be truly pluralist and value diversity in practice and not simply in theory, it cannot afford to be so careless in its treatment of Protestant schools.</P>
<Col N="326"/>
        <P Just="Left">There are those who welcome this measure.  There are those who see it as a victory for a change in the organisation of Irish education.  Before being flattered by siren voices, I advise the Minister to examine the sources of such support and then to sup with a long spoon.  Some hope this move presages the first in a series that would question the role of faith in our schools of any colour.  We have heard the usual suspects advocate the nationalisation and standardisation of all our schools.  They call for the destruction of denominational education as sectarian and out of step with modernity.  They disingenuously persuade us that excluding religion from our schools is a neutral choice rather than the explicit value judgment that it is.  These most illiberal of liberals would take choice from the hands of parents where it properly resides, and give it over to a single State apparatus.  The separation of church and State protects the state from theocracy but also protects the churches from the interference of the State.  By extension, it protects the religion and practice of the citizen from control of the State.  Just as we do not want the State in our bedrooms nor do we want it in our churches.  Pluralism does not lie in the suppression of all difference and a McDonald&rsquo;s system of schooling, always the same everywhere.  Difference is not dissonance.  In the life of a nation as in music, variety of notes, tones and pitch makes for melody and true harmony.  Pluralism is in the happy and respectful co-existence of diversity.  I was in Gorey recently where there are five thriving primary schools, two Catholic, one Church of Ireland, a gaelscoil and an Educate Together.  That is the joy of our parent-led system which can offer real value choice to parents.  I believe that with time this kind of choice will extend across the country and give us an even better and more vibrant educational system.</P>
        <P Just="Left">That will only happen if the Minister and this Government commit to the value of diversity.  It will only happen if the Minister believes the ethos of a school is intrinsic to it and is just as important as maths or physics in a child&rsquo;s education.  As Dean Inge said, &ldquo;The aim of education is the knowledge not of fact, but of values&rdquo;.  For many Protestant parents, clearly the ethos of the school their children attend is far from a tack-on or a mere adjunct but lies at the core of the education they wish for their offspring.  I urge the Minister to think again and respect the needs of these parents and children.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to comment briefly on this issue, which is very important.  We have been through recessions before and we have all made sacrifices before.  It has been accepted always that the Protestant minority in this country has a particular ethos which has been protected since the foundation of this State despite all the trials and tribulations we have experienced.  The support given by the State to Protestant schools is not elitism but an acceptance, even a tolerance, of religious diversity, not only in education but in our society as a whole.</P>
        <P>The Fianna F&aacute;il-Green Party Government took this action and therefore I must ask whether there has been an official change in policy within the Department of Education and Science such as we have not seen since the foundation of this State.  I would like the Minister of State to give a comprehensive answer to the question asked by Senator John Paul Phelan.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Kelleher</NameTxt>
	<P>I am taking this Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, who is unable to attend but sends his apologies.</P>
        <P>I am pleased to be given the opportunity to clarify for this House the position with regard to the withdrawal of certain grants from Protestant fee-paying schools.  The 2009 budget required difficult choices to be made across all areas of public expenditure.  Decisions were made in order to control expenditure and ensure sustainability in the long term.  In this respect, education, while protected to a much greater extent than most other areas of public expendi<Col N="327"/>ture, could not be entirely spared.  The Minister, Deputy O&rsquo;Keeffe, acknowledges the impact of funding restrictions in a number of areas, including at school level.  However, these are the inevitable results of the challenging international economic environment and the need to manage Exchequer resources.</P>
        <P>With regard to the removal of certain support services grants received by Protestant fee-charging schools, the Minister wishes to re-emphasise that the Protestant block grant remains in place.  Protestant fee-charging schools receive, and will continue to receive, this grant, which amounts to &euro;6.25 million in the current school year.  This payment covers capitation, tuition and boarding grants.  It is distributed among needier Protestant children by the Secondary Education Committee.  Applications are made by parents to the Central Protestant Churches Authority which, on the basis of a means test, distributes the funds to individual schools on the basis of pupil needs.</P>
        <P>The retention of this grant demonstrates the importance that the Minister, Deputy O&rsquo;Keeffe, and this Government, continue to attach to ensuring students of the Protestant faith can attend schools that reflect their denominational ethos.  In retaining this grant, the Government is being faithful to the separate arrangements agreed with the Protestant schools when the free scheme was introduced by the former Minister for Education, Donogh O&rsquo;Malley.  At the time, the payment of the block grant for Protestant fee-charging schools distinguished those schools from the Catholic schools that chose to continue to charge fees.</P>
        <P>It is estimated that savings of &euro;2.8 million will accrue to the Department as a result of the withdrawal of support services grants from Protestant fee-charging schools in 2009.  It is important to note that the purpose of these grants was not to offset fees for disadvantaged Protestant students but to cover a range of support services.</P>
        <P>The Minister has had to take decisions on a number of grants that have impacted on the funding of schools generally.  With the Protestant block grant remaining in place, the Minister can see no justification for treating the Protestant fee-charging schools in a special way, particularly given that Catholic fee-charging schools have not been in receipt of the grants in question.</P>
        <P>The Minister has met with representatives of both the Church of Ireland Board of Education and the Grand Orange Lodge of Ireland to discuss the funding position of Protestant fee-charging schools and the background to the decision to withdraw support services grants this year from Protestant fee-charging schools.  He has expressed his willingness to consider any proposals that might be made to the Department that would enable the available funding to be focused and adjusted to meet more effectively the twin objectives of access for individuals and the sustaining of the dispersed schools that they wish to attend.</P>
        <P>I thank the Senator for providing me with the opportunity to address the House on this matter and to outline the current position.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator John Paul Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I realise the Minister of State, Deputy Kelleher, does not deal specifically with this issue but was answering the question today.  I do not accept a word of what was said.  The reality is that the Protestant community is small and spread throughout the country.  The majority of communities in Ireland do not offer Protestant education.  I speak in particular about an area I know, Kilkenny.  Kilkenny College is the biggest Protestant boarding school in the country and students come from all over to attend it because both parents and students want an education in a Protestant ethos to which they are entitled.  I understand the retention of the Protestant block grant although I do not believe the Government should take credit for retaining it.</P>
<Col N="328"/>
        <P>The &euro;2.8 million quoted is a paltry amount.  To make such a saving at this juncture sends out an appalling signal to the minority community in this country.  I speak as a past pupil of the Augustinian Good Counsel College in New Ross.  Throughout the country there is a large variety of Catholic secondary schools and a diversity of other secondary schools, including community and VEC schools.  However, when it comes to seeking a second-level education with a Protestant ethos that diversity does not exist.  The removal of this grant, namely, these additional funds which covered a range of support services as the Minister of State noted, will lead to staff being laid off.  I know this will happen in Kilkenny College where it will lead also to increased class sizes and to a less diverse education for students.</P>
        <P>It is a direct attack on the Protestant community in this country and I regret the Government sought this target when it was looking for cutbacks in the budget.  I understand the financial situation the country is in but to single out a particular community for such a grievous assault was unnecessary, unwarranted and downright wrong.  In the further discussions he will have with the Church of Ireland Board of Education, I hope the Minister may be in a position to look at this.  The one positive note in the Minister of State&rsquo;s reply was that the Minister is open to suggestions.  Perhaps there will be some light at the end of the tunnel arising from those future negotiations.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Kelleher</NameTxt>
	<P>As Senator Phelan pointed out, the public purse is under pressure.  Savings had to be made across all sections of Exchequer spending and education was not spared although it was protected more than other areas.  The Minister has expressed his willingness to consider any proposals that might come to his Department concerning the targeting of resources made available via the block grant.  This might ensure that, despite the dispersed nature of education in Protestant schools, those concerned could come up with proposals which the Minister might consider.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>I know Senator John Paul Phelan will support me fully on this issue.  I want the Minister of State, Deputy Kelleher, in his reply on behalf of the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, to make clear there has been no attempt to downgrade the accident and emergency services at Wexford General Hospital.  Some concerns have been expressed recently that an attempt would be made to change the current 24-7 availability of accident and emergency services at that hospital.  This concern is genuine.  When I was Fine Gael spokesperson on health an attempt was made under the Hanly proposals to downgrade our accident and emergency department.  Subsequently, there were supposed to be plans to expand this department when we had put Hanly to one side but that has not happened.  There is concern at Wexford General Hospital, not only for the accident and emergency department but also because there have been bed closures there in recent weeks.  We fought for years to get an additional 21 beds at the hospital and now 25 beds have been closed, so we are again in a negative situation.</P>
        <P>There is concern that front-line services are taking a major hit, regardless of what the Government is saying at present.  There is extreme difficulty in getting home helps, as I know from being both a political representative and a doctor.  It is difficult to get additional home help hours for patients and hours for new patients at present.  This does not relate just to the elderly but is happening in the disability sector as well.  Respite beds are also restricted at a rate that has not been seen for many years.</P>
        <P>I would like the Minister of State to deal with these issues in his reply in terms of the effects these cuts are having, not just on primary care.  That includes services in the community pro<Col N="329"/>vided by home helps, public health nurses and occupational therapists.  I want him to confirm that the accident and emergency services at Wexford General Hospital will not be downgraded and that no attempts will be made to change this, either now or in the future.  I would like a comprehensive reply from the Minister of State in that regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Kelleher</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senator.  The Minister for Health and Children sends her apologies for not being able to attend the House to discuss the issues he has raised.</P>
        <P>Wexford General Hospital provides comprehensive acute services to the 130,000 people living in County Wexford and to the thousands of tourists who visit the area each year.  It benefits from a committed workforce who in 2009 will treat 15,400 patients, 6,500 day patients, 39,600 ED attendances and 2,400 mothers giving birth in the maternity unit.  In addition, the hospital deals with almost 56,730 outpatient attendances.</P>
        <P>The hospital has strong partnerships with colleagues working in primary, community and continuing care sectors and aims to provide patients with fully integrated services.  I am pleased to say that a capital allocation to progress the design of a new front entrance and accident and emergency extension in 2009 has recently been approved.  This amounts to some &euro;7.75 million, with &euro;400,000 to be expended in 2009.</P>
        <P>The HSE anticipates approval to proceed to the next stage in 2010.  In line with the national service plan 2009 and in accordance with the HSE&rsquo;s transformation programme, the executive will be reviewing the current configuration of acute hospital services in the south east.  A steering group has recently been put in place to this end and is tasked with developing a plan for hospital reconfiguration that will deliver optimal and cost effective services easily, of high quality and delivered through centres of excellence.  No decisions regarding the roles of services of any hospitals will be taken until this plan is completed through a process of broadly based consultation within the services.  It is likely to be the end of 2009 or early 2010 before this review is completed and a plan is put in place.  The Government is committed to ensuring the delivery of the best quality health services possible in an effective and efficient manner.  Ensuring patient safety is of paramount importance so that people can have confidence in the services and the best possible patient outcomes can be achieved.</P>
        <P>In summary, a review is being carried out and this will report towards the end of 2009 or early 2010.  It will be a broadly based consultation with all the stakeholders providing services in that area.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to clarify something the Minister of State said.  There are excellent staff at Wexford General Hospital and it is a centre of excellence.  I would ask the Government to stop using this term, &ldquo;centres of excellence&rdquo;, as if hospitals were not centres of excellence apart from those specified as such.  The services provided by Wexford General Hospital are of the highest standard.  We accept that some procedures such as breast cancer and some gastrointestinal surgery are carried out at Waterford General Hospital because that is for the safety and benefit of patients.  However, the services provided by Wexford General Hospital are excellent, as are the accident and emergency services.  They are an integral part of the health service in Wexford at present.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State is not talking about spending &euro;7.5 million but rather &euro;400,000 in 2009.  I do not know who sits on the acute hospital transformation programme but if it reflects what has happened in the north east or at Ennis and Nenagh hospitals, although I know these are not comparable to Wexford General Hospital or St. Luke&rsquo;s in the south east, I would worry because such initiatives always mean a reduction in services and not necessarily the efficient use of resources.  We can accept the transfer of certain services to a regional hospital, and I would prefer if the Government would use the term &ldquo;regional hospital&rdquo; rather than a centre <Col N="330"/>of excellence, but we cannot accept the reduction in front-line services that affects patients in Wexford.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Kelleher</NameTxt>
	<P>In the context of the capital allocation, funding for the accident and emergency entrance has been recently approved.  Some &euro;400,000 will be spent in 2009 and the rest of that budget will continue into the calendar year and the financial year of 2010.  The commitment is made in the context of the provision of the new front entrance. </P>
        <P>A steering group has been established and is assessing the provision of health services across a full range.  The Senator is right in saying that centres of excellence can exist in different faculties and for different treatments.  For example, there could be centres of excellence in the context of cardiology that may not be the same as those being provided in the treatment of cancer services.  We can agree that a centre of excellence does not necessarily cover all areas of medical procedure.  We will await the outcome of the steering group which will assess the best treatments for patients, indicating where services may best be used efficiently and wisely to ensure there is an integrated approach so that wherever services are located, patients can have confidence in them.</P>

REPS is a five-year programme where a farmer enters into a contract with the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food to farm in accordance with an agri-environmental plan drawn up by an approved agency or REPS planner.  The scheme is open to both part-time and full-time farmers who are farming at least three hectares of land.  This land can be either owned or leased for a period that encompasses the duration of the plan.  There are 11 measures in REPS which are directed towards controlling nitrogen and phosphate use, stocking rate and waste and effluent around the farmyard, and towards protecting water quality, hedges and features of archaeological or historical interest on the farm.</P>
        <P>REPS in Ireland has proven to be enormously beneficial to date.  At the close of the REPS 3 scheme, more than 53,000 farmers were in the programme.  That means approximately 50% of the agricultural land of Ireland was included under REPS and more than &euro;1.9 billion was paid to farmers at the end of 2006 according to the latest figures available.  There is 75% funding available from the European Union and 25% from the Exchequer.</P>
        <P>Following many contacts I have had with REPS planners and farmers, especially in County Donegal, I understand the closing date for the current REPS 4 scheme is 15 May 2009.  This is placing enormous difficulties on REPS planners and on farmers in turn to have their plans and application packs completed and submitted to the Department before the closing date.  I am seeking clarification from the Minister of State on the position regarding farmers who are in REPS 3 but whose REPS plans may expire from June to October and whether they will be allowed to re-enter REPS 4 at a later date, after 15 May, or if their applications must be lodged by that date.  I do not think it is possible for all the farmers whose REPS 3 are expiring to have new applications made in time, given the workload involved in making such an application.  For example, there is a 25 or 30 page application pack to be professionally prepared by a REPS planner, which must be submitted in conjunction with the application form from the Department.  In a worst case scenario, an extension may not be obtained from the EU for planners or farmers who are allowed to submit the application form up to 15 May.  However, <Col N="331"/>perhaps one or two months could be granted to submit the application pack by the end of June or mid-July.  Such a resolution may meet farmers&rsquo; needs and the workload of REPS planners also.</P>
        <P>This matter is a cause of concern to many farmers.  As we all know, farming activity across the country has been under significant pressure in recent years.  We saw that earlier this week with the issue of prices in some supermarkets.  Many farmers depend on the income available from REPS payments to sustain livelihoods in rural areas.  I hope therefore that we can have some resolution from the Department on this issue.</P>
        <P>I appreciate the excellent work done on the REPS programme, particularly by the former Minister and current T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Mary Coughlan, and the current Minister, Deputy Brendan Smith.  The Department allowed a vast number of applications under the programme.  However, I wish to see clarification so that farmers can rest easier.  They are very anxious at the moment given the closing date is looming &mdash; it is a week tomorrow.</P>

	<P>I thank Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill for raising this issue which is urgent in the context of the closing date.  REPS is regarded as one of the most successful farming schemes we have ever operated.  Since it was first introduced in 1994, it has delivered significant payments to farmers, but it is about much more than money.  It is a scheme that has brought many benefits to the environment and to society as a whole.  It enables farmers to remain viable while farming in ways that are compatible with protecting and improving the environment, safeguarding biodiversity and contributing to better water quality.</P>
        <P>With natural resources under ever increasing pressure, the scheme and in particular the introduction of REPS 4, is more pertinent than ever in meeting the new challenges we face.  I am glad so many farmers have seen fit to join the scheme.</P>
        <P>The arrangements for joining REPS 4 are derived from Commission regulations that reflect the Commission&rsquo;s objective of integrating and harmonising the operation of the various farm payment schemes, including the single payment scheme, REPS and the disadvantaged areas scheme.</P>
        <P>For REPS 4, this means that applications to join the scheme must be submitted by 15 May each year.  Any application to join REPS 4 submitted after May 15 cannot be considered for payment in the same calendar year and there is no possibility of providing an extension to this closing date.  We have already had indications from the Commission that any such extension would not be granted and that the closing date must be strictly observed.  It is important to re-emphasise that the Commission has stated there can be no extension in this context.  Therefore we are urging all those who are interested to have their applications in by the deadline.</P>
        <P>Given that REPS is an EU co-funded scheme, it is important that Ireland complies with all regulatory requirements, including closing dates, in order that funding is not compromised.</P>
        <P>It is open to all farmers to apply to join REPS 4.  Existing REPS 3 farmers can either see out their five-year contract and then move over to REPS 4 or, alternatively, they can transform from REPS 3 to REPS 4 at the anniversary date.  It is worth noting that Ireland secured a significant transitional arrangement for 2008 for REPS 3 farmers without which they would not have been able to join REPS 4 until 2009.</P>
        <P>The latest date for receipt of an application and accompanying REPS plan is Friday, 15 May, just one week away, to qualify for REPS 4 payment in the same calendar year.  The situation is very clear and, unfortunately, the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food has little leeway in this matter.</P>
        <P>The Government has provided &euro;330 million for REPS in the current year, despite the economic circumstances and the difficult position in the public finances.  There can be no question <Col N="332"/>therefore about the Minister&rsquo;s commitment to the scheme on an ongoing basis.  However, the situation remains that applications to join REPS 4 in the current year, whether a transforming REPS 3 farmer or otherwise, must be received by 15 May 2009.</P>
        <P>As I said earlier, the Commission has already emphasised there can be no leeway whatsoever in the context of the closing date.</P>
