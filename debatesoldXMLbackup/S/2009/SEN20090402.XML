	<P Just="Left">The fact that 700 people queued for food yesterday in Dublin is a terrible legacy for a Government that has been in power for more than 12 years.  The Leader should ask for the relevant Minister to be brought into this House immediately because 2009 is turning out to be an extremely black year for workers, with more than 1,000 people losing their jobs on every working day since the beginning of the year.  We are on course to see well in excess of 100,000 people losing their jobs by the end of the summer and this warrants urgent action on behalf of the Government.  The relevant Minister should be brought into this House immediately.  It is far too serious to be just point scoring on this, which is becoming an urgent <Col N="920"/>crisis for the people of Ireland.  I ask the Leader to have the relevant Minister address this House immediately.</P>
        <P>I also ask that the Minister for Health and Children be invited to address the Seanad because there are enormous delays as regards the same people who are losing their jobs being able to access medical cards and other services, both from the Department of Social and Family Affairs and the Department of Health and Children, simply because staff are overwhelmed by the number of applications they have to process.</P>
        <P>I would also like the Minister for Health and Children to address this House on urgent issues within the health service.  I treat patients who cannot sleep at night and who require up to nine courses of antibiotics a year because they suffer from severe tonsillitis and adenoids.  I cannot get those patients seen by an ear, nose and throat surgeon within two years and this problem has worsened over the last couple of months because of HSE cutbacks.  I ask the Minister for Health and Children to explain to this House whether we are going to let children down in such a bad manner over the next couple of years or if something is to be done about this.  I should also like her to discuss the issue as regards home help, because that is also becoming a crisis within our communities.</P>
        <P>Senator Jim Walsh has asked for this side of the House to discuss issues as regards fees for solicitors.  I have read the e-mail he sent to us and perhaps the Government parties would table a Private Members&rsquo; motion in this regard and we would be happy to discuss it.  There is some merit in having this discussed.</P>
        <P>Finally, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney, announced yesterday that she is setting up a new group to look at transferring care from hospitals into the community.  On this side of the House, we would be very willing to assist the Minister in any way she wants to make progress on this because it is very important for the future of the health care service.  In a spirit of co-operation with the Government, we would be delighted to help her with that endeavour.</P>

	<P>Will the Deputy Leader not agree that IBEC has today hit a new low with its proposal to attack social welfare, conveniently forgetting, as ever, that it was its members and main funders, the big banks, that led us into most of the trouble we face?  Having used every subterfuge, trick and manoeuvre to deprive workers of pay over the last number of months, wherever they could afford to do it, they are now going for the final trick of saying, in effect, we should hit social welfare.  Will the Deputy Leader tell the Government to make the rest of us share the pain, make the sacrifices and do whatever is required but leave social welfare alone?  The Government would get a resounding &ldquo;thank you&rdquo; and support from the electorate for taking that view.  It has been articulated by the Taoiseach on a number of occasions that it is not his intention to target social welfare.  While he rightly made the case that everybody must play their part, let those with most pay most.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>This morning the aid organisation, D&oacute;chas, will make a presentation to the Sub-committee on Overseas Development.  I expect one of the points it will make will be the impact further cuts will have on the world&rsquo;s poor.  Tonight approximately 1 billion people throughout the world will go to bed hungry.  Last week the OECD made the point that it is worried that any cuts to the aid budget will reduce the impact aid has had over recent years and will undo some of the good done in trying to achieve the millennium development goals.</P>
        <P>Today in the ExCel Centre in London&rsquo;s docklands, I hope to see the G20 governments restate the commitment that they will continue to give to the developing countries.  We can do the same in this country and I ask Senators on the Government side, in advance of next week&rsquo;s mini-budget, to make the case for the aid budget to be retained as it stands.  It suffered disproportionately in recent cuts and it needs to be left alone.</P><Col N="921"/>
        <?oasys _cl14- ?><P>Will the Deputy Leader arrange a debate on the effectiveness of Irish aid?  The Irish Aid programme has been very effective throughout the world in reducing poverty.  I would like a debate so that we can explore those benefits and help to convince people about the significant worth achieved by our aid programme.</P>
        <P>The Labour Party will make its submission to the mini-budget later today.  It will be based on the need to get Ireland back to work, protect jobs and ensure fairness.  Like Senator O&rsquo;Toole, I thought this morning&rsquo;s kite flying by IBEC was totally uncalled for.  If it wants to see the impact a reduction in social welfare rates will have all it has to do is pick up a copy of this morning&rsquo;s Irish <i>Daily Mail </i>which shows people queuing up for food.  Social welfare rates were low in the past.  During the Celtic tiger, many people were in poverty.  Any cuts to social welfare rates will put more children into poverty.  That point was made by the Society of St. Vincent de Paul which has seen a 30% increase in the number of calls.  Proposals, such as cutting social welfare rates, must be ruled out.</P>
        <P>We all recognise savings must be made but I suggest we start at the top.  We will look for an additional rate of tax at the top and to close off any tax loopholes.  We need to get rid of the ridiculous situation where disc jockeys being paid in excess of &euro;500,000 by the State can still claim tax free status on the sales of their book about life as a disc jockey.  The Minister for Finance needs to start there before he targets people on the breadline.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I will call first Senators who missed out yesterday.  I call Senator Ross.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>I endorse what was said by Senators Hannigan and O&rsquo;Toole.  What Senator O&rsquo;Toole said about IBEC is absolutely right.  It is quite extraordinary, disgusting and unnecessary to hear it call for cuts in social welfare.  It is worse than that because today on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo;, a director of IBEC appeared to promote this particular policy.  That director of IBEC, Mr. Danny McCoy, also happens to be a director of F&Aacute;S.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

	<P>He was very fast.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>No names, please.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Cathaoirleach would not want to blink.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>I apologise to the Cathaoirleach.  The extraordinary incongruity of a director of F&Aacute;S, the State agency, which is meant to promote the interests of the unemployed and those on social welfare, wearing his IBEC hat and suggesting on air that people on social welfare should have their payments cut is completely unacceptable.  Directors of F&Aacute;S get paid &euro;14,000 per year for a part-time job and for doing very little.  Their only achievement appears to be that they presided over a spendthrift waste of money over many years.  It is quite unacceptable that the directors of a State agency should demand that those who they are meant to look after take cuts in this budget.</P>
        <P>It would be appropriate if the Deputy Leader asked that this director of F&Aacute;S, who I will not name again, resigned as a director of F&Aacute;S and just wore his IBEC hat.  It is totally unacceptable behaviour.  I do not know from where the call for social welfare to be cut came.  All manner of other cuts have been suggested in this House which can be made.  These sort of antics where <Col N="922"/>people can wear a F&Aacute;S hat one day and an IBEC one another day is completely and utterly hypocritical.</P>
        <P>It is time Members of this House recognised that IBEC speaks for the big banks, as Senator O&rsquo;Toole said, which are giving it most of its funding.  These are not what they call &ldquo;representatives of enterprise&rdquo; but quite the opposite.  The big funders of IBEC are the banks, AIB and Bank of Ireland, and the semi-State monopolies.  It is time Members of this House recognised that and stopped paying tribute to at least one of the social partners.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I very much welcome the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s announcement last Tuesday evening of her intention to bring forward legislation to amend the Companies Acts to increase the powers and resources of the Office of the Director Corporate Enforcement, especially in regard to transparency, loans to directors and powers to enforce compliance.  Unfortunately, the legislation will not have the scope to deal with bodies other than limited companies, including building societies and other credit institutions such as credit unions and so on.  Apparently, she indicated through a spokesperson that she intends to close that loophole.</P>
        <P>In view of the appalling allegations involving Irish Life &amp; Permanent, Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide, which is not a company but a building society, we can afford no longer to leave such a large section of our financial sector free from investigation and cross checks.  As we know, many transactions between institutions took place which need to be investigated.  I ask that No. 13 on the Order Paper, the Credit Institutions (Financial Support)(Amendment) Bill 2009, which we put forward, be taken in Government time because the situation is quite urgent.</P>
        <P>The EU 8th Company Law Directive, which relates to the quality assurance of auditors dealing with public entities such as large public companies, was meant to be transposed into Irish law by mid-2008.  The recommendation is that it should be a matter for the supervisory authority, the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority in our case, and not the professional bodies of the auditors, some of whom are the subject matter of complaints which remain to be dealt with.  We are seriously out of line with EU and international best practice and it is a shame we have not dealt with that matter.  The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is clearly dragging its feet in the matter.</P>
        <P>I refer to the two main banks.  We have seen the part recapitalisation of one of the banks and the other is to follow.  The guarantee scheme was very necessary but we all know something more is needed.  There is much debate about a State assets management company to deal with the banks&rsquo; problem property loans.  We all would agree such an initiative is very necessary.  It is a variation of the so-called bad banks scheme.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator has made his point.  Time is moving on.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>It would need to be tailored to Irish needs.  We all agree it is vital for our future and time is of the essence.  Will the Deputy Leader indicate when that measure will come to the House because it is needed now?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Senator Ivor Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Deputy Leader seek clarification on yesterday&rsquo;s announcement by the Minister for Health and Children of the establishment of a new quango for health funding?  It is a source of concern and I would like to know the basis for the Minister proceeding with this proposal.  I am aware that a number of structures are in place.  When we set up the Health Service Executive I understood it would be the body for implementation and the Department and the Minister would look after policy.  Now after the Minister has been in office for so many years she needs another body to advise her on funding.  I am deeply concerned <Col N="923"/>and cannot fathom it.  Especially at a time of merging agencies rather than setting up new ones, this seems to go against the grain.</P>
        <P>Today is the United Nations World Autism Awareness Day.  Initiatives are taking place around the globe, which I very much welcome.  With the co-operation of this House there will be a release of balloons outside Leinster House as there will be outside the UN offices.  There will also be a briefing in the audiovisual room, which I understand has been organised on an all-party basis and in which I would encourage all Members to participate.  I congratulate the Irish Society for Autism on its endeavours in this regard.</P>
        <P>I have heard my colleagues mention issues relating to social welfare.  In some cases responsible people are denied a payment when other people are granted a payment.  This happens in two areas, one where a person gets a lump sum of money, is responsible with it and invests it wisely whereas somebody else might squander it.  The person who squanders it gets the payment but the person who invests the lump sum is denied the payment.  Equally a 19 or 20 year old who stays at home is denied a social welfare payment but if he or she moves into a flat or apartment he or she would be given a payment in addition to assistance for energy bills and rent, and many other supplements, which seems crazy.</P>
        <P>Will the Deputy Leader get some information on what I understand to be a new culture of carrying knife-like weapons.  Is there any particular element in society that is carrying these types of weapons?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Senators O&rsquo;Toole and Ross regarding the proposals from IBEC to cut social welfare payments.  While there is an element of deflation in the economy, its causes are very specific, mainly related to interest rate reductions and oil price decline.  This proposal is very divisive and quite nasty.  Many people are in a very difficult position in this economic crisis.  We are talking about the most vulnerable in society.  There has been talk about a change of leadership in the country and in the banks.  There is a question of leadership in IBEC.  The statement on cutting social welfare payments is as out of touch as the leadership of IBEC was in agreeing a national wage agreement last summer that was totally out of sync with the deteriorating economy.  There is an issue of leadership in IBEC.  At a time when we are trying to find solutions to the serious problems in the public finances and the economy, to introduce such divisive proposals is unfortunate.</P>
        <P>Unemployment has now reached 11%.  Yesterday Fine Gael introduced a comprehensive pre-budget perspective which proposes supporting jobs, sharing the burden and restoring confidence.  It is very specific in its suggestions.  It suggests an alternative way to manage the economy in the dire situation in which we find ourselves.  It has proposals on stimulating the economy and creating and retaining jobs.  In restoring the public finances two thirds is focused on expenditure and one third on tax cuts.  What we say is that no economy has ever taxed its way out of a recession.  The question is whether we are going to chase down the economy with more taxes.  Are we going to avoid the hard decisions on expenditure?  Will this budget focus on the soft option of increasing taxation?  The fundamental question for next week&rsquo;s budget is whether we will tax this economy into a depression.  Does the Deputy Leader agree with that approach?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I condemn the terrible murder of publican, Matt Farrell, who ran the Gaelic Bar in Daingean in County Offaly, by ruthless criminals who tied him up and robbed him.  It is an abhorrent crime against people who are living alone and vulnerable people who are active and strong but overcome by forces out to destroy society if they can.  I commend the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na which has 100 garda&iacute; working on the case.  The Garda Commissioner, Fachtna Murphy, met the Taoiseach in whose constituency this murder occurred.  It is also the constituency of the Cathaoirleach.  This murder has deprived a family of a father and grandfather.  He <Col N="924"/>was a fine upstanding man.  I am sure the Cathaoirleach knew him personally.  He was a former worker in Bord na M&oacute;na.</P>
        <P>Many similar crimes are occurring at the moment.  In Ballinlough, County Roscommon, a crime occurred in mid-March.  The Garda apprehended those criminals who had robbed approximately &euro;30,000 from the Ballinlough post office.  I know everyone will be working with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in Daingean and in surrounding areas.  We need more activity through the community alert scheme.  People need to be more conscious of surveillance being carried out on houses and pubs.  We all need to work to ensure these people are apprehended as quickly as possible.  It is causing great concern and anxiety among elderly people living alone in rural areas.  All we can do is extend our deepest sympathy to the Farrell family on their tragic loss.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Deputy Leader draw to the attention of the responsible Ministers some good news from Brussels yesterday.  With decisions needing to be made on the referendum later in the year, we should look for any good news.  The Commissioner for Competition has got agreement from MasterCard on interchange fees for debit and credit cards.  It will mean a dramatic reduction &mdash; not as much as some of us would have like to have seen &mdash; every time we use those cards.  It will mean a very large sum of money that will be of benefit to consumers in Europe.  It reduces the fee from 1.9% to 0.2% in the case of debit cards, which is quite dramatic.  It would not have happened unless Europe had grabbed hold of the issue.  It does not go quite as far as some of us would have liked to have seen it go.  It only applies to cross-border fees.  Now it is in the hands of each national government to introduce the same sort of legislation to ensure we all get the benefit rather than having to give the benefit to the banks.  It is one of the benefits of Europe.</P>
        <P>I also want to give an interesting challenge to Europe and to the Ministers responsible.  It relates to having a fixed date for Easter.  Senators may well ask what that has to do with Europe.  This year Easter will fall on the second Sunday of April.  We assume that this is all to do with the churches.  Some 40 years ago at the Second Vatican Council the Catholic church announced that it had no objection to having a fixed date for Easter.  Some 20 or 30 years ago the then Pope actually proposed the second Sunday in April as a fixed date.  Such a change would have many benefits.  The World Council of Churches has also supported the move.  Europe should grab a hold of this issue to knock together the heads of all those who discuss the matter.  The benefits would be substantial.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>Europe has managed to get us to change to summer time on the one date in March every year and to change back again in October.  It has got us to use the same prefix for telephone numbers &mdash; 00.  It has done a number of things that have been of considerable benefit.  It seems that if we were to ask the Commission to investigate the possibility of having a fixed date for Easter, the benefit to business, the community, education and tourism would be very substantial.  I ask the Deputy Leader to draw this to the attention of the Ministers responsible and to put it on the agenda so it can be regarded as of huge benefit to the community as a whole.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarkDaly"><NameTxt>Senator Mark Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Deputy Leader to raise the statement by the Israeli Foreign Minister that he sees no benefit in giving concessions.  The Israelis have not been known for giving concessions recently and their recent invasion of Gaza and its strangling of the Palestinian population by ensuring no food aid got into Gaza in the five months previous to the first rocket attack by Hamas in many months shows the Israelis are in no mindset for granting concessions.  I ask the Deputy Leader to talk to the Minister for Foreign Affairs about Ireland&rsquo;s position on invoking Article 2 of our preferential trade agreement with the Israelis and perhaps linking it to access to Gaza&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarkDaly"><NameTxt>Senator Mark Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;that there would be no access to European markets by the Israelis unless they give access to food for the Palestinians.</P>
        <P>I raise the matter of a very disturbing questionnaire sent by the F&Aacute;S branch of SIPTU to councillors throughout the country.  The objective of this questionnaire is clear when one reads the questions &mdash; for example, question No. 10 reads: &ldquo;Do you agree with workers on the minimum wage [being] brought into the tax base?&rdquo;, while question No. 12 reads: &ldquo;Do you agree that the lower paid and those on the minimum wage should be brought into the tax net?&rdquo;  Those questions are almost identical.  Another question asks: &ldquo;Do you agree ... the raising of taxes should affect mainly the wealthy and higher paid?&rdquo;  I believe that taxes should be fairly paid by all, not just by one group, whether it be the lower paid or the higher paid.  Then comes the crunch.  The questionnaire states: &ldquo;In the event of a non response received from particular councillors, we will record that [you] have responded negatively and advise our members accordingly.&rdquo;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is blackmail.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarkDaly"><NameTxt>Senator Mark Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>That is the point.  SIPTU will go around the country advising all its members that this questionnaire must be responded to.  To say the questions are unbalanced is putting it mildly.  It is not a questionnaire, it is a veiled threat.  I ask the Deputy Leader to take up this matter with the Minister of State, Deputy Billy Kelleher, with a view to questioning, through his good offices, SIPTU as to the purpose behind this sinister questionnaire.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>The formation of dole queues was something we were expecting and something the Government was doing its best to plan for.  The formation yesterday morning of food queues in our city, the length of those food queues and the despair of the people on them is another sign and a message to all of us that we must change the way we are doing business and respond to the extent of the crisis.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Many people in recent months have called for national government.  It is now increasingly clear that what we need is not national government but rational government, where the Government spells out what it will do to tackle the problem our country is facing.  In recent weeks, Fine Gael has made two very strong contributions to that debate.  Last night, we debated our proposals on job creation, one of the two crises facing our country, and we outlined yesterday our approach to dealing with the national finances.</P>
        <P>I concur with all my colleagues in stating that social welfare payments should not be touched for people who are going on to those payments for the first time.  However, we need to be clear that what we are saying is that &euro;3 to &euro;4 of every &euro;10 of Government expenditure will not be touched as a result of that decision.  That will mean that for the other &euro;6 to &euro;7 spent, we will need to make the tough decisions we have shied away from making in the past ten to 15 years.  My party yesterday spelled out what those decisions are, how much they will cost and what we would do.  I want the Deputy Leader to respond on that issue.</P>
        <P>On Sunday afternoon, a raid on the road next to mine by garda&iacute; and armed forces discovered material for pipe bombs.  Three arrests were made of people allegedly involved in subversive republican activity.  This brought home to me very clearly one simple fact.  We have taken our eye off the ball in terms of the threat that is posed to our national security.  In the two years I have been in this House, we have had only one debate on Northern Ireland, two at the most.  We need to bring this back to the top of our political agenda.  We have talked about the threats to our economic security but we need to now talk about the threats to our national security.  That needs be debated here more than it has been in the past.</P><Col N="926"/>
        <P>I will conclude with the fact that the national Carers Association is organising a demonstration outside Leinster House this morning.  I have been very careful in what I have said so far to acknowledge that very tough choices will have to be made in how we spend our money, but at the very least, let us publish a strategy to outline what we would do differently to help the people who need care most, even if we all know the money will not be there to do as much as we would all like to do.</P>

	<P>Last week, I visited Spain to attend the youth advisory forum at the Council of Europe directorate on youth and sport.  One of the key issues raised at the meeting concerned the mosquito device and I ask the Deputy Leader to ensure we have a debate regarding this device as soon as possible.  I know this caused great mirth the last time I raised the matter not only among Senators but also on RTE radio, which seemed to miss its significance.  It was the focal point of the youth forum last week at European level and has elicited much information from Irish youth since I raised it last.  Adults do not hear this sound, particularly those over 30 and a majority of those over 20, but it has been used by the military in some countries as a form of torture &mdash; I am not talking about the mosquito device but about the technology of high frequency acoustic devices.  I recognise that Senator Quinn said he did not need to resort to this type of activity when he was in business because he looked to classical music instead.</P>
        <P>The advice from one of the participants at the conference last week was that because people had refused to enter locations which used this device, they had reverted to classical music.  Other people have reverted to using pink lights which show up acne.  There are other devices, but my issue at present&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>I ask that we have a debate on this issue as soon as possible.  It is a human rights issue regarding our young people.  If we do not regulate or prohibit this device, it will potentially be used on other people.  When it affects people over 20, we will probably take it more seriously.</P>
        <P>On another issue, following my questioning yesterday of the fact that people who had been involved in significant tobacco smuggling received fines of only 13 cent, have we the right to ask in the House when sentencing across the board, be it for sex offending, rape, murder or tobacco issues, will be reviewed?  When will we deal with people who are re-offending and ensure that sentences for re-offenders reflect the fact that they have offended in the past?  I know there is a separation of powers but surely asking for these reviews&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <P>I add my voice to that of Senator Donohoe on Northern Ireland.  There was another shooting in Creggan last night.  I would call Creggan &ldquo;Derry&rdquo;, but the national ordnance survey map of 2008 calls it Londonderry or Doire.  I ask the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to consider this issue.  It is fine for us to acknowledge the different views on the town I love so well but there is the &ldquo;Derry air&rdquo; as well as the &ldquo;Londonderry air&rdquo;.</P>

What came to my mind on hearing this were the cuts called for last year by a certain senior banker, who subsequently resigned and fell from grace.  He called for the abolition of free medical cards for people aged over 70 years and we have seen his fall from grace as a result.  It is unjustified hubris for IBEC directors to make such calls.  Perhaps we should have a debate on calls for cutbacks by people such as IBEC directors and bankers in terms of how justified they are.  </P>
        <P>On a day when we see on the front page of <i>The Irish Examiner</i> appalling pictures of people in Dublin queueing for food, we should reflect on the fact that those calls were unwise.  I heard on radio on Sunday another IBEC director, not the one named by Senator Ross, whom I am happy to name&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>The crude intervention by IBEC on the social welfare issue is a recipe for social unrest.  It is not enough for us to condemn or be critical of this call, IBEC should move immediately on a damage limitation exercise.  If it does not do so, its comments in this case could have very serious consequences for the country.  One has to ask why the captains of industry are intervening in this manner.  Is it intended to shock or distract?  Whatever it is, it is not wise.  There must be someone in IBEC who could have called a halt to this intervention.  I say reluctantly that it is at a time like this one gets an insight into the mindset of the French Revolution.  It is absolutely vital that this House declares it is a matter for Government in the first instance to introduce the budget and subsequently for the Houses of the Oireachtas to debate it.<b></b> I am not suggesting that IBEC and its members are not entitled to put forward their case in a constructive and positive manner, but to humiliate and traumatise the people they have targeted is absolutely and utterly shameful.</P>

That should steel us into moving forward.  I ask that the Deputy Leader ensures that any attempt to rectify national finances next week is predicated on the principle of equality, fairness and targeting of those who are in a position to take the hit and, in fairness, those who created the problem in the first instance.  It might be prudent for the Government to bear in mind that when it took the advice of Mr. Seanie FitzPatrick on medical cards, it was an own goal.  It would be a similar own goal to accept the advice of IBEC on this matter.</P>

	<P>I exhort the Deputy Leader to make a statement and bring to the Minister&rsquo;s attention the question of carer&rsquo;s allowance and the preservation of income, rights and supports for carers.  The Minister has made a worthy attempt to limit the number of people going to hospital and to establish primary care, with the emphasis on community care, but we should not proceed with those policies, on which huge money has been spent, unless we support carers.  Carers are vital in supporting invalids who wish to remain in their own homes.  The provision of this service is cost-neutral.  Great savings are made in paying carers rather than paying for institutional care.  </P>

	<P>People want to remain in their homes, where they are happiest.  I ask the Deputy Leader to make a statement on this matter and to bring our views to the relevant Minister and the Government.  It is important we support our carers, in particular at a time of huge unemployment.  Where will these people go if they are not employed as carers?  Where <Col N="929"/>would unemployed people be better deployed than in the home as carers.  This is a no-brainer and it needs to be said over and over again.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Senator John Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>When a person speaks about sacrifice and that sacrifice relates to his or her own position or that of the pillar or group which he or she represents, that is laudable, but for IBEC, which is considered one of the wealthiest groups in the country, to call for sacrifices from the pillar that has the least is totally unacceptable.  In the current round of cuts and increases in taxation, the Cabinet has spent hours and days deliberating and painstakingly considering what needs to be done to ensure equity and fairness.  It is futile for any one pillar of society to point to another and suggest that it should bear the burden.  </P>
        <P>I support the calls made this morning for the commencement of discussions with the Northern Ireland and Scottish representatives in regard to areas of common interest such as minimum pricing orders, be it in respect of tobacco or alcohol, which would ensure we could raise taxation in an equitable manner and that gangsters could not profit from cross-Border trade illegal trafficking.  Perhaps the Deputy Leader will take up this matter and ask the Minister to ensure there is consultation with Northern Ireland and Scottish Ministers.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the changes to the Order of Business, niggardly though they be.  Five minutes is equal to &pound;19/11, which was used in days gone by during sales in the shops.  Why not go the whole hog and provide for an hour?  However, the idea is a good one.</P>
        <P>I wish to raise the case of Pamela Izevbekhai, which is a very important matter.  We are all concerned about the practice of female genital mutilation.  There appears to be some question about the falsity of the documents that were produced, the question of lying.  A question also arises about the role of the Nigerian ambassador, who stated that female genital mutilation is a non-existent problem, that it does not exist in that country and that Pamela Izevbekhai has damaged her country.  She said the Government was investigating the people who supplied the information on female genital mutilation, yet we have on record the Nigerian Government&rsquo;s submission to the United Nations from which it is clear the figures in this regard range from 2% to 65%.  That is not a non-existent problem.  The idea of investigating people who collect such statistics in an honest manner is chilling indeed.  One wonders what might happen to Pamela Izevbekhai if she goes back to a country whose ambassador so clearly lies in this country.  There are serious concerns about this matter.  I suggest we might look at it.</P>
        <P>With regard to the economy, I note that one of my colleagues has called for a metaphorical head.  A Senator on the Government side invoked the French Revolution when speaking about social unrest.  He seemed to look for a physical head in a basket, which is a little extreme.  We should be prepared to engage in robust debate about the economic realities in this country, which are stark indeed.  Senators have mentioned the chilling newspaper photographs of up to 1,000 people queueing for food parcels in Dublin.  To my mind, that is one of the classic indicators of a depression.  It is as sinister, at least, that a State organisation, Bord na M&oacute;na, has declared it may be unable to pay its pensions.  I do not think Bord na M&oacute;na has been privatised yet &mdash; if it has been, it has been a disaster.  I have highlighted two worrying indications that we may have reached a tipping point.  Rather than merely calling for people&rsquo;s heads, we need to look at the situation calmly and rationally and reach conclusions that will assist the recovery of our economy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EoghanHarris"><NameTxt>Senator Eoghan Harris</NameTxt>
	<P>One of the many valuable functions of the Seanad is to revisit questions that may have dropped off the screen.  In that context, I remind Senators that the Northern Ireland football team beat Slovenia last night.  It has barely registered on the radar of Irish newspapers, which gives the lie to the lip service that many people in the Republic of Ireland pay to the notions of republicanism and Irish unity.  Therefore, I commend Senators Donohoe <Col N="930"/>and Keaveney for returning Northern Ireland to the screen this morning.  I ask the Leader of the House to ask the Ministers for Foreign Affairs and Justice, Equality and Law Reform to come to the House to give Senators a progress report on Northern Ireland.  What I am seeing, slowly and surely, is the beginning of a rerun of the Provisional IRA campaign.  When a policeman and a couple of soldiers were shot and killed recently, it represented a tightening of the screw that is being turned.  The Real IRA and the Continuity IRA are starting to get more brazen, for example by functioning in public.  They are tied deeply, of course, into the Shell to Sea campaign in the South.  The predictions about unemployment that I made in this House before Christmas have proven to be correct.  Around the same time, I reminded Senators that this is one island and warned of the dangers of dumping the problems of Northern Ireland in Northern Ireland and hoping they remain there.</P>
        <P>If the group that is politically fronting for the Real IRA is active in the Republic of Ireland, it will become more active as the fragile social structure is leaned on by the economic crisis.  Accordingly, I strongly recommend to this House that the Seanad can do great work to keep Northern Ireland firmly on the screen.  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform needs to crack down on these groups in the South.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs should encourage the SDLP to stop pushing so hard on Sinn F&eacute;in on the green agenda.  If the SDLP is more green than Sinn F&eacute;in, that will not help Sinn F&eacute;in to be flexible.  Likewise, the Government should put pressure on the British Government to indicate to the UUP that it should take some of the pressure off the DUP.  If the DUP is forced to out-unionise the UUP and Sinn F&eacute;in is forced to out-green the SDLP, no progress can be made.  We need a devolution of policing.  If that is to happen, Sinn F&eacute;in and the DUP will have to co-operate.  The Republic of Ireland should use all its different arms to encourage the two parties to come to a quick and immediate solution on the devolution of policing, in order to put up bulwarks against the very sinister forces that are threatening both states on this island.</P>

	<P>Last evening, Senator Buttimer and I raised on the Adjournment an issue that has been highlighted by the Carers Association.  We called on the Minister for Health and Children to implement the association&rsquo;s cost-neutral proposals, but our argument was rejected out of hand.  As Senator Donohoe has said, representatives of the association will protest outside Leinster House later today because they are terrified.  It is outrageous that Mr. IBEC has the cheek to call for a 3% reduction in social welfare payments.  I applaud Senators on both sides of the House who have asked the man in question to withdraw his remarks.  I hope the Minister, Deputy Hanafin, will not take any of his suggestions on board.  A delegation from the Combat Poverty Agency attended yesterday&rsquo;s meeting of the Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs, of which I am a member.  We need to consider how we can help those who have recently been made unemployed.  As many such people have no resources for dealing with being unemployed, we should not cut their payments by 3%.  I ask the Deputy Leader to contact the man I have mentioned after the Order of Business to ask him to withdraw his outrageous remarks.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with what Senator Harris said.  I was invited to speak at the Belfast Film Festival last Saturday as part of a debate entitled &ldquo;Dealing with the Past: Conflict and Consensus&rdquo;.  I was not the only person present at the debate who detected the audience&rsquo;s extraordinary concern about the increase in support for dissident republican groups, particularly within certain areas of nationalism that have not enjoyed the benefits of the peace dividend.  It is something we need to discuss.  Senator Harris put his finger on it when he argued <Col N="932"/>that the competition between the two main parties on either side of the divide is retarding progress towards a more normalised society.  The interesting debate in Belfast certainly served as a warning sign.</P>
        <P>While it is right that we should challenge views with which we disagree, such as those expressed by the IBEC man today or the ICTU man yesterday, there is no need to introduce personal and vitriolic invective into the debate.</P>

        <P>My constituency colleague, Senator Twomey, commented on my motion, which relates to the extraordinary fees that are charged by barristers.  I was told recently that a senior counsel sent someone a bill of &euro;59,000 for reading a brief over a weekend, which is absolutely obscene.  Many Senators will be aware of the case in question.  I will not name the person involved.  We need to tackle privilege.  An article in one of yesterday&rsquo;s newspapers compared the remuneration of this country&rsquo;s university professors, lecturers and presidents with the remuneration of those in other countries.  In one instance, a person was found to be earning 80% more than his or her counterpart in Britain.  I remind the House that Ireland does not have a single university in the top 50 in the world.  I put it to Senator Twomey that the Government is about to increase consultants&rsquo; fees, thereby&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;bringing their salaries to over &euro;150,000 a year, or 50% more than their counterparts in Britain.  If we are talking about increasing taxes to buttress inflated incomes and waste across the public service, we are sowing the seeds of a revolution on the part of the productive side of our economy.  We should have a 10% reduction in salaries across the board in the public sector &mdash; I called previously for it.  I am now saying that those salaries in excess of &euro;100,000 should have a 20% reduction imposed on the excess of &euro;100,000.</P>

	<P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for his indulgence.  I want to make two brief points.  First, the ECB rate is expected to fall again this week.  In fact, it is expected to fall later this afternoon.  The rate is as close to zero as it ever has been.  Those on tracker mortgages will automatically be beneficiaries of that reduction, those of us who are on variable rates may, at the discretion of the banks, be beneficiaries but, unfortunately, those on fixed rate mortgages will not benefit.  I have raised the issue in this House previously.  The taxpayer has bailed out and recapitalised the banks.  A <i>quid pro quo</i> is required to ensure the banks look at giving those on mortgages fixed at a time when interest rates were going up some benefit of the reduction in the ECB rate.</P><Col N="933"/>
        <P>Second, it is preposterous that IBEC would continue this vendetta against those on social welfare and ask for reductions in social welfare payments.  Those who are on &euro;220 a week are finding it difficult enough to live on that rate.</P>

These people should not be allowed dictate our social welfare policy.  Let us not forget that those in the banks and all these people brought us to this level, and also that IBEC represents its interests, not the interests of the most vulnerable in society.</P>

	<P>To call for a reduction in social welfare at this time would be wrong, particularly when we see bread lines and the like.  It is stark in the extreme.  Happily, IBEC does not dictate social welfare policy for the Government.  I express the hope the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Hanafin, and her Cabinet colleagues will take the appropriate decisions next Tuesday in looking after the most vulnerable in our society, those less well off, those unemployed and those most needy, while at the same time ensuring that those of us who can, pay a little more.  I am certainly more than prepared to pay for that.</P>

	<P>In line with what my colleague, Senator Jim Walsh, stated, we need to look at public sector pay, particularly in the higher regions, whether it is reduced by 10%, 15% or 20%.  Otherwise, I fear we will be back in September to look at the books once more.</P>
        <P>As it is world autism day, the amount of supports for carers, who save the State some &euro;400,000 in terms of free medical care, must be maintained.  In line with the various supports in place, we must also ensure there is appropriate enforcement.  As Members will be well aware, there are serious abuses of the social welfare system and as resources are now more scarce, we must be smart about how we apply them.  With that in mind, I call for a debate on Science Foundation Ireland.  For &euro;180 million a year we get a tremendous return in the level of research and development, laying the foundations which will take this economy forward for many decades to come.  While I am aware resources are scarce, perhaps we could look at increasing investment in the schemes and awards made available by Science Foundation Ireland.</P>

	<P>Two potent images this week have struck us.  The first was yesterday&rsquo;s of the queues for food in Dublin.  ICTU man and IBEC man have done well while breakfast-roll man and woman, parents of that child with autism or parents trying to care for the elderly, have been victimised by the Government.  I challenge IBEC to live on the minimum wage for the week and let us see how we get on.  We must never forget the vulnerable and that is what IBEC has done this morning.</P><Col N="934"/>
        <P>I join with Senator Donohoe in asking for an urgent debate on national security, Northern Ireland and, especially, law and order.  I do so under two categories.  We have become complacent about the North.  We have seen a regeneration of activity by dissidents who do no service to all of us who are constitutional republicans and want to see peace and harmony in our country.  We are losing the mindset where we must reinforce and support the Garda.</P>
        <P>Second, we can never condone or allow people to have bomb-making facilities in any city or part of the country.  It is wrong and we must send these people a strong message that they are not welcome in this society and must be taken out of society and incarcerated because they are doing a disservice to all of us.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I ask the Acting Leader to bring in the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Dermot Ahern, and the Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs with responsibility for drugs, Deputy Curran, to have a debate because gangland war has gone on for too long.  We are painting a picture in the media, we are closing our eyes to it and we are not tackling it head on.  It is time we got serious.  It is time we took in hand the people who are doing this to society and our communities, from the small hamlets to the big cities.  We are sleepwalking into trouble and the Minister and the Minister of State must come into this House and say, give us the answers and let us go out and take it on.

	<P>At a time when there is much pressure on the public finances and on the finances of local authorities, in the latter regard it is true to say that there will be great pressure on the provision of social housing in view of the fact that many people will not be able to provide their own homes.  However, there is strong evidence, not merely currently but over a long period of years, to suggest there are people who have the benefit of first-class excellently-finished local authority houses who go on to wreck them.  In am aware of a case where an individual and his family got, not one house or two, but four different houses and proceeded to wreck each one of them.  I understand that in at least one local authority, on which a Member of this House served, there is a training programme to teach tenants of local authority houses how to manage the facility and to treat it with appropriate respect.  I ask that the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, come into this House for a debate on this matter.</P>
        <P>I strongly support the comments of all colleagues who spoke about the suggestion that social welfare should be reduced for those who must live on it as a necessity.  Social welfare was not invented merely for the fun of it.  It was brought in to give an income to people who otherwise do not have one.  There are many people benefiting from it who do not want to be on social welfare but, regrettably, there are also many abuses of social welfare.  The Minister, Deputy Hanafin, is focussed and fair.  If there is to be any focus on social welfare, it should be on eliminating social welfare abuse.</P>
        <P>In the past I raised in the House the question of illegal fishing &mdash; the destocking of our lakes, rivers and canals.  I regret to say, following a conversation with another colleague from the midlands, that this is still going on.  I do not apologise for saying &mdash; the truth is the truth &mdash; it is carried out in the main by people who have come to this country such as those on a work permit.  They are non-nationals.  It is the truth.  It may shame but it cannot be blamed.  I want <Col N="935"/>something done about it.  I want the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Ryan, to come to this House to debate this and outline his proposals on how this practice will be eliminated.  Counties Westmeath, Cavan and Longford depend heavily on tourism.  Even course fishing brings in many tourists.  This practice of illegal fishing must be stamped out once and for all.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Members for their contributions.  Senator Twomey listed a number of health related issues such as access to medical cards for people who are newly unemployed and the difficulties faced by eye, ear and throat patients and home helps.  I will inquire whether the Minister for Health and Children might be available for an omnibus debate or specific debates on these issues.  The House will have an opportunity to debate the issue of elder abuse next week.  That might be a good starting point to discuss the home helps issue if the Senator and others want to make use of that opportunity.  He also made helpful comments on issues such as controlling barristers&rsquo; fees and the transfer of long-term patients into community care.  The House should do as much as possible to progress these issues.</P>
        <P>Senator Twomey also raised the issue of job losses which became a theme for several Members.  Senator O&rsquo;Toole referred to the statement made by a director of IBEC on the issue of social welfare cuts.  The Government has no intention of changing the minimal income standards of those dependent on social welfare.</P>

	<P>Senator Ross was correct to point out the very rich irony of the making of such a call by someone who represents his organisation as a social partner and who receives a fee of &euro;14,000 for a part-time role on a State body, which is 50% more than the basic rate of social welfare.  We could have an opportunity in Private Members&rsquo; time next week to discuss public appointments and State bodies and develop these points.  This debate has been bedevilled by the use of terminology.  Those who claim to live in an enterprise culture always talk about subsidies and incentives when it comes to progressing their own agendas and issues that benefit them and those with whom they work but when it comes to social welfare and meeting the most basic of needs in our society, we refer to hand outs and imply people are scrounging on the system.  Until we strike the right balance, it will be difficult to make the hard decisions that must be made.</P>
        <P>The statement by the director of IBEC earlier was far from helpful.  I do not believe there is capacity to ask for his removal from that organisation because it is separate and independent but given that he earns a fee from a State agency which is many times the amount on which social welfare recipients live, he certainly needs to consider his position on that.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>The views of many Members concur with that.</P>
        <P>Senator Hannigan had to attend a committee meeting to raise the issue of overseas development aid.  That budget was cut by &euro;125 million but we are endeavouring to keep the percentage in line with our target for 2012.  It is difficult because hard decisions must be made but this is informing the Government&rsquo;s decisions.  Whatever the Minister for Finance does next Tuesday will be part of the process.</P>
        <P>The Senator also referred to the G20 meeting.  We all await what will happen and it is especially important that a consistent and coherent line emerges from that meeting for our future development.</P><Col N="936"/>
        <P>Senator Coghlan welcomed the proposed Bill on company law reform while referring to his own Private Members&rsquo; Bill on credit institutions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>It will close the loophole.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>There is great merit in the Bill.  The intention of the Government is to bring forward the more all-embracing legislation.  If the Senator&rsquo;s Bill remains on the Order  Paper until we debate the Government&rsquo;s wider Bill, we can see where we are with respect to the loophole concerning the ability of the Director of Corporate Enforcement to examine mutual societies.  The Senator&rsquo;s point regarding the European directive on the auditing of companies is valid.  It should have been transposed by the middle of last year.  This highlights the failure in regulation by not following through on this.  If we are to introduce a new culture in regulation and auditing, we must be much better at enforcing measures such as this.</P>
        <P>The policy regarding an asset management agency or a bad bank is subject to further discussion.  I am informed the Minister for Finance will use the opportunity next Tuesday not only to outline budgetary measures to deal with the public finances but also to give a roadmap on general economic issues, of which there is general expectation and in which all of us in the political process need to be involved.</P>
        <P>Senator Callely raised the establishment of an expert group on health sector funding.  There is reluctance to establish new groups in the public sector but the need for this group is important, given that while the Department of Social and Family Affairs is responsible for 40% of public expenditure, the Department of Health and Children expends a large wedge on top of that and we need to ensure we are making suitable efficiencies.  The group will be chaired by Professor Frances Ruane, director of the ESRI, which is a good appointment.  The group will do good work.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Regan raised the social welfare cuts and the issue of leadership.  I suspect one of the factors behind the statement made on radio earlier is the impending change in leadership in IBEC.  If that leads to this type of debate and thinking, it raises concerns about what will happen in the social partnership process, in particular, and it is good for the House to ensure its concerns are expressed and that this quality of debate and thinking cannot be considered in our future development.</P>
        <P>The Senator also discussed Fine Gael&rsquo;s economic proposals.  During Private Members&rsquo; business last night, we discussed an aspect of them.  He seemed to argue that we cannot and should not increase taxes.  I agree increasing taxes too much and too quickly would make it difficult for the economy to recover.  We apply the wrong taxes in this country and we tax unfairly and disproportionately.  People on higher incomes, in particular, do not pay enough.  However, we are still a low tax society and we must address that issue.  We cannot make the two pieces of not collecting enough and spending too much fit and to claim, as does the Fine Gael document, that we can bring about the economic progress we need by tax cuts is not particularly intellectually honest.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I was challenged by Senator Regan that we can tax ourselves out of existence in making an economic recovery but the opposite is also true.  The only way to achieve a programme of tax cuts is to introduce further and deeper public expenditure cuts.  If that is what Fine Gael is saying, it needs to be more honest and admit it.  We cannot have diverging approaches at this critical time in our economic history.</P>
        <P>Senator Leyden raised the re-emergence of rural crime, especially the savage murder in County Offaly, and the need to support initiatives such as the community alert scheme.  This <Col N="937"/>excellent initiative predates the neighbourhood watch scheme and is organised by Muintir na T&iacute;re.</P>
        <P>Senator Quinn referred to the EU agreement on credit card fees, which will be helpful, especially as the level of personal debt in Ireland is a major issue, which we are probably still avoiding.  It is many times the level of national debt and it also needs to be corrected if the economy is to work again.  He also raised the question of a fixed date for Easter.  I am not inclined in terms of the calendar or ecclesiastically to say whether I agree but I will pass on the question.</P>
        <P>Senator Daly highlighted the statement of the Israeli Foreign Minister that there is no need for concessions.  His view will be passed on to the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  The new Israeli Foreign Minister is the leader of a new party that is challenging the existing parties in the country.  The party had a successful election and it is very much to the right of existing parties, particularly Likud.  His position will determine the direction of foreign policy in that country in the future.</P>
        <P>Senator Donohoe and others referred to the question of national security and the finding of bomb-making facilities in his local area.  Senator Buttimer reinforced that point.  There can be no tolerance for these activities.  We should congratulate the Garda on their efforts in seeking them out.</P>
        <P>Senator Harris also said we must be vigilant and cannot be complacent about changes in security on the island, and Northern Ireland.  There are positive signs.  The British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly took place in Donegal at the start of this week with all parties, from all parts of the island, represented there.  They discussed these issues quite thoroughly.  I am somewhat optimistic that we can tackle the threats posed by this insignificantly small group of people by supporting the forces that uphold justice, and that we can advance matters politically, especially the devolution of policing.</P>
        <P>Senator Keaveney spoke about the use of the mosquito device and other devices that are harmful and abused in terms of young people.  I will pass those comments on to the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children with special responsibility for children and youth affairs.  She referred also to the situation in Northern Ireland and talked about the insignificance of fines for cigarette smuggling.  Many are concerned about this and it should be addressed in future legislation.</P>
        <P>Senators Bacik and Norris gave a half-hearted welcome to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges&rsquo; proposed changes in the Order of Business.  I am sure the House will welcome the motion when it is put a few minutes.</P>
        <P>Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; commented on the social welfare cuts and the role of people such as the director of IBEC.  Several Members spoke about the carer&rsquo;s allowance and strategy and the presence of representatives of the Carers Association outside the Houses today.  The publication of the carers&rsquo; strategy, even without its financial element, would be a welcome step.  It must be a better document, however, than the present one.  It must make clear promises about where the strategy is going.  We must be particularly aware that any talk of reducing payments to carers is a false economy.  If the State had the resources to provide that care fully it would cost billions of euro more than it does now.  I hope a carers&rsquo; strategy will see the light of day before the end of the year.</P>
        <P>There were many contributions and I apologise if there are Members to whom I have not referred and will seek to make information available to them by other means.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>If my amendments have been deemed out of order as involving a charge on the Revenue is it the intention to pay members of the authority?  The principle is a good one, that people who have been adopted should be represented on the board.  It is in line with our thinking about consumers, that the people most affected by a board or authority would have some representation.  I ask the Minister of State to take account of this.  Unless the idea that this involves a charge concerns expenses for board members I do not believe the amendments should have been ruled out of order and they could have been considered.</P>

	<P>I understand it is to do with expenses.</P>
        <P>I wish to raise another matter on this section.  I will be bringing forward an amendment to this section on Report Stage.  This arises because the register of medical practitioners referred to in section 98(3)(<i>d</i>) which was established under section 26 of the Medical Practitioners Act 1978, has been replaced by a new register established under section 43 of the Medical Prac<Col N="940"/>titioners Act 2007, as amended by the Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2007.  The relevant section was commenced on 16 March 2009.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no possibility for representation of a person who has been adopted in either a domestic or international adoption.  It would be a good and useful thing to bring the voice of the consumer, the experience of someone who has been adopted, to the board.  There are many agencies, organisations and networks in which people who have been adopted participate actively and they want their voices heard.  The Minister of State should consider this.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>That would be to assume the various other appointments, specifically, a social worker with experience in adoption practice, a social worker with research expertise in child welfare and protection, a barrister and solicitor with experience of practice in the law relating to families and children, a medical practitioner and a person trained in psychology, would not have sufficient experience to represent adopted persons and that there would be a gap in that experience needing to be filled by the appointment of a person who has himself or herself been adopted.  I hope those five persons, not to mention the chair, vice chair, chief executive and other staff, would be adequately able to represent the interests of adopted persons and ensure the adoption authority functions properly and carries out its functions as well as possible.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>The voice of the lay person, the one who has direct experience of the service, is a valuable asset.  This has been developing in the legal and medical areas for example, in the new medical practitioners Bill.  One cannot underestimate what the direct voice of experience would bring to a board or authority.  When the Government moves to establish bodies we should try to incorporate this as a general rule.  It would be very valuable to have the personal experience of adoption heard.  It has been ruled out of order because of the expenses, which are probably not very much, paid to board members.  The Minister of State might consider this in the future, as well as the provision of a mechanism to involve people who have been directly affected.  This is good practice.  Obviously, the social workers, barristers and psychologists will be expert in the area.  The direct voice of a person who has been through the experience would be a valuable one to have on the authority.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>The point was made to me that in some jurisdictions adoption orders are made by courts and because of the quasi-judicial functions of the board, expertise is obviously required at that level.

	<P>It would be wrong not to include an adoptive parent and many others who are affected by adoption.  However, the adoption authority is intended to be the body responsible for the making of adoption orders and the expertise required to carry out that quasi-judicial function would be of a high level.  The interests of adopted persons and of other categories of person I have described will be and have been represented adequately by the current board.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I shall not labour the point but I speak of a different quality of experience that is apart from the quasi-judicial nature of the board.  This is not an adequate <Col N="941"/>reason not to include the voice of the person who has been through the direct experience, which might be in turn a representative voice for the other groups the Minister of State mentioned.</P>
        <P>The amendment has been ruled out of order but I make the point that we must get away from the more hierarchical model of representation.  We ought to look at it from the ground up and with the voice of the consumer.  This is an appropriate place to have the voice of the consumer represented.  There has been a move in that direction when the Government appoints bodies and boards, namely, to have the voice of the person directly affected involved in the decision-making structures.  It is a good move, one we should try to develop more generally and which would be beneficial in this area.</P>

        <P FLI="0">There is some concern about this and it is a very delicate area.  I am interested to hear what the Minister of State will say about it.  Some of the international organisations felt that their fund-raising would be interfered with if this section contained the words: &ldquo;with the prior approval of the Authority&rdquo;.  It is a delicate issue because one does not want advertising put into the Bill that would suggest there is a market in respect of children or adoption.  The concern expressed by the organisations was that straightforward fund-raising might be interfered with by having this section included.  They made the point that if other voluntary organisations such as the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, the ISPCC or Barnardos were restricted in this way, they might not be able to get on with their work.  The amendment addresses the anxiety that the normal fund-raising a voluntary body might engage in would be interfered with unnecessarily.  Perhaps the Minister of State might say whether this is a genuine concern or he might tell us there is adequate opportunity within the Bill for bodies to engage in legitimate fund-raising.  The concern expressed was that this right might be taken away.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>Financial probity is one of the most important tenets in inter-country adoption.  The measure contained in the Bill is intended to ensure there can be no question of funds of any kind being made available to accredited bodies in a manner that might give rise to questions about the management and execution of responsibilities in respect of making arrangements for adoption.  This measure is protective of such accredited bodies.  It does not rule out such gifts but ensures any such gifts must by law be the subject of notification and approval of the adoption authority.  In this area, I am of the view that any measure that prevents improper financial gain at any stage of the process and that emphasises the importance of financial probity is essential to the process.</P>
        <P>This section reflects Article 8 of the Hague Convention and is one of the cornerstones of the development of inter-country adoption.  Achieving higher standards of financial probity is one of the challenges of inter-country adoption.  It does not interfere with fund-raising in any way but merely ensures there can be no question marks over conflicts of interest.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>Perhaps the Minister of State could offer some clarification.  I am in complete agreement with the Minister of State about the international obligations we would rightly have in this regard.  It would clearly be a safeguarding of children to have inappropriate financial donations forbidden by our legislation.  Is permission required for each and every donation or can they get on with legitimate fund-raising events which could be anything from selling tickets or holding sales of work?  Would prior approval be required or is this just to cover anonymous donations?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>Although it indicates prior approval of the receipt of the gift of money, there is no bar on fund-raising and therefore if a person bids for an item at a fund-raising auction, there is no requirement to seek the prior approval of the authority before <Col N="943"/>receiving the cheque.  It is simply that when one fund-raises, one must notify the authority of any overall receipt.  There is no bar on existing fund-raising.  Rather, the measure is to ensure there is an accountability for the source of funding so that this very sensitive and developing area is above reproach in terms of financial probity.</P>

        <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Title be the Title to the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>We have come to end of Committee Stage of the Bill.  The Minister of State has indicated that he will consider the suggestions and amendments for Report Stage.  The issues of the bilateral agreement, especially with Vietnam, and its current state and reassuring the many parents who were concerned about it, is critical.  From what the Minister of State has said, I know that he and his Department are working hard to ensure this agreement is signed as soon as possible.  I hope that before the Bill is completed in the House and when Report Stage is being dealt with that he will have good news on that.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Will the Minister of State consider also the points made in the House about tracing?  Some good comments were made yesterday on this matter, including the need for the tracing mechanisms to be put on a statutory footing.  Will he consider as well the development of post-adoption services?  Adoption does not end when the adoption order is made and a range of issues continue to arise.  There is a need for statutory provision for the development of post-adoption services.  The question of open adoption, which was discussed, and the changing face of adoption, both national and international, should be reflected to some degree in the legislation and some provision made to deal with the issues that arise.</P>
        <P>We have made many of these points on Second Stage and Committee Stage discussions.  I hope the Minister of State would be open to bringing back some amendments to the Bill at a later stage.  It is the mark of a mature Minister or Minister of State to be open to amendments arising from discussions.  We have seen increasingly that where amendments are worthwhile, they should be incorporated at a later point.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This legislation is very welcome because it brings Ireland into line with the Hague Convention.  It is very overdue.  Many people have been waiting for it for a long time because our adoption law has been outdated and has allowed confusion, insecurity and inconsistency to develop.  This is major legislation and I congratulate the Minister of State and his officials on the work that has gone into it.  I ask him to consider the discussions and amendments that were put forward, most of which have been withdrawn with the intention of resubmitting them on Report Stage and awaiting the outcome of the deliberations by the Minister of State and his Department on them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Senator Jim Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I have a request for the Minister of State on the same line of thought as Senator Fitzgerald.  I mentioned this to him privately but I got delayed at a parliamentary party meeting which disabled me from being here to put it forward.  I ask the Minister of State to <Col N="945"/>examine section 121 for Report Stage.  It raises a most serious issue.  It deals with an employee of the authority who is immediately seconded from employment where he will lose his salary and, if I am interpreting it correctly, his pension rights for the period if he is elected to the Oireachtas, the European Parliament or a local authority.  There may be a case regarding the Oireachtas and the European Parliament, which would be classified as full-time positions.  However, if we are saying a person elected to a local authority is automatically seconded and therefore displaced from his or her employment for the period of local authority membership, we are sending an alarming signal for democracy.  It says to all private sector employers that this should perhaps be a template for them and anybody elected to a local authority would not be able to hold down a full-time position.  That would be a serious retrograde step. We are saying to local government that only people who are retired, unemployed or self-employed can participate in that very important arm of democracy.</P>
        <P>If my interpretation is correct, I would express much opposition to that section and I ask the Minister to examine it closely.  There is an anomaly in it because it specifies an employee of a local authority at a level below chief executive officer.  If I am reading it correctly, that implies that a chief executive officer can run for the Seanad, the European Parliament, the D&aacute;il or a local authority and still hold down his or her job but people below that level cannot do so.  I do not see why that should be there, certainly regarding a member of a local authority.</P>
        <P>I thank the Leas-Chathaoirleach for indulging me to allow me to make the point, given that I missed the section when it was discussed here.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to comment on the Bill at the conclusion of Committee Stage and I look forward to making further contributions on Report Stage.  As I did before, I welcome this Bill, as did people on both sides of the House.  The debate on it has been extremely worthwhile and has, I hope, contributed to what will be an improvement of the Bill on Report Stage.  I would like to mention some points the Minister indicated he would examine and about which I hope we can continue the debate on Report Stage.</P>
        <P>There has been a great deal of discussion in the House on the bilateral agreements about the difficulties with Vietnam in particular and we will talk more on that on Report Stage.  My colleague, Senator Norris, and I proposed amendments on eligibility to adopt for same-sex couples.  During the course of the debate on that the Minister was open to the issue of same-sex couples and in particular to examining some way to accommodate those same-sex couples who already have children where adoption may not be the most appropriate procedure to give the child of that couple rights in respect of the non-birth parent.  I hope the Minister will explore some other way, perhaps not in this Bill, to ensure the rights of children of same-sex parents are protected and that the rights and responsibilities of the non-birth parent are recognised in law.  That is an important gap in our legislative system.</P>
        <P>Another amendment I hope to make on Report Stage, which I raised a number of times on Committee Stage, is on long-term foster carers and making provision for children who are in long-term foster arrangements to ensure they have some protection beyond the minimum protection in the foster relationship in law.  I am grateful to the Minister for expressing openness to examining the solution adopted in Britain in the 2002 Act, which was of special guardianship.  In this country the special guardianship mechanism, which has been recommended by expert groups over a number of years, would give a facility for a more secure legal status for a child in long-term foster care short of the absolute cut-off from the birth parents that an adoption order entails.  It is a different measure from adoption but it would allow a protected status for children in long-term foster care to have more security than they do now without cutting ties with their birth parents.  I ask the Minister to examine that for Report Stage.  There are some <Col N="946"/>provisions in the Bill concerning foster carers and it would be appropriate to introduce some special guardianship through this Bill.</P>
        <P>Many other issues were raised on Committee Stage and I will not rehash them all but I look forward to further debate on Report Stage.  I thank the Minister for his openness to accept points made and agree to review issues and come back to us on Report Stage.</P>

Committee Stage has been extremely valuable to me in developing a deeper understanding of the legislation, and I am honest enough to admit that.  We have considered and will consider all points and everything is being debated in the right way in the democratic process.  It underlines the value of having two Houses of the Oireachtas.  I am a fairly new Minister of State and when legislation is prepared there is no question that a genuine added value is provided by the analysis given by the Seanad with its unique voice and outlook in examining legislation &mdash; I am sure that is the case with all legislation.</P>
        <P>I thank Senator Fitzgerald for her forbearance on the very sensitive issues we are trying to tackle regarding the Vietnam bilateral agreement.

	<P>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an tAire St&aacute;it.  This matter relates to the proposed removal of a special class from St. Anne&rsquo;s primary school, Bailieborough, County Cavan.   Up to now, 14 children have attended two special classes for mild general learning disability.  These pupils would be hugely educationally, socially and emotionally disadvantaged if one of the classes was suppressed, as is proposed.  These two classes have been in existence since 1 July 1974 and have served the special needs pupils from the east Cavan area.  </P><Col N="947"/>
        <P>I know many of the past pupils of the school who benefited greatly as individuals from their education there.  There are excellent teachers in the school.  Ms Margaret Carolan, who has been a teacher there for a number of years, has developed a rapport with the parents of the children with particular needs and with the community.  She is well supported by the people who have joined the teaching team in the school, and the principal, Mr. Hanley, who has great interest in this area, has adopted a hands-on approach to running these special classes.</P>
        <P>If one of the classes is removed, the children concerned will experience a sense of failure.  A critical point worthy of examination by the Minister of State and his Department is that these children would have received the normal resource allocations in the schools they were attending.  They have come to this school from schools in east Cavan.  They received learning support, resource allocations and assistance in the schools they attended, but that was found to be inadequate.  Therefore, it would be a  misconception to say that these pupils could return to their schools and mainstream education and that they will be all right.  If they were all right in the first instance, with the generous allocations of learning support and resources, they would not be in this situation so it would be a misnomer to make that case.</P>
        <P>Another interesting aspect to this proposal has been revealed.  My colleague, Senator Fidelma Healy Eames, did a case study on a school in Galway, which found that if a special class is removed, as is proposed in this instance, the cost to the State in learning support in terms of SNAs and a range of needed supports for the children with particular needs in mainstream classes will exceed the cost of the provision of the special class.  The removal of the class is not sustainable on financial adjustment grounds, and God knows that would be a questionable area in which to seek to save money, nor is it sustainable on educational grounds.   I say that from my knowledge of the area as a public representative, of the teachers in the school and the pupils who have benefited from it and from my knowledge of having been a primary teacher and being acutely aware of the needs in this area.  I taught in a school in Cavan town that had two special classes at one stage.  The pupils in the special classes not only suffer from one difficulty but from a multiplicity of intellectual, physical, emotional and behavioural difficulties, which make their case particularly difficult.</P>
        <P>This proposal will not be successful as a cost-cutting exercise.  I can think of no other possible rationalisation for it.  If it were argued that the reason for the proposal is to mainstream all pupils and put them on a similar footing, that has already been tried with each of these pupils.  That is done where it is appropriate.  These pupils were only moved to these special classes when all the normal supports had failed.  It is not always supportive for a young student to be removed from or to be left in a high achieving mainstream class.  Such pupils can experience a sense of failure if they are left in a mainstream class even when they receive support in particular instances.  There is a certain dynamic in special classes.  People who have attended them have lived a very fulfilled existence in adult life.  I cannot see the merit of an argument to remove the class on either of those grounds.</P>
        <P>The children who attend these special classes have increased confidence.  They have a good foundation in academic and social education and the life skills aspect is important.  They are confident to participate in society.  The money in providing these special classes has been well spent.  It enhances pupils&rsquo; self-esteem, social development and all aspects of life.  From my observation and experience, I found that self-esteem is an important factor for such pupils and it can best be inculcated from a special class setting.  In special classes the class size is reduced, there is one to one teaching in a small group setting, differentiation between the pupils&rsquo; needs, speech and language support and liaison with personnel from other disciplines, such as occupational therapists, physiotherapists, social workers and psychologists.  Therefore, there is an integrated approach to teaching, which is necessary.</P><Col N="948"/>
        <P>In St. Anne&rsquo;s primary school there are two special classes, which have been in existence since 1974, and they have represented good value.  Many of the pupils who attended them have gone on to complete the leaving certificate etc.  The Minister of State has a commitment to such issues and I know he will give this matter serious consideration.  A serious point to note is that a pupil&rsquo;s enrolment in a special class occurs as result of a professional assessment carried out by a psychologist from the national education psychological service in whom the Department of Education and Science has invested responsibility.  Therefore, the recommendation is not lightly made &mdash; it is made only when the psychologist is satisfied that mainstream education is not an appropriate placement for the pupil concerned.  Therefore, the pupil needs such intervention.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I can make available to the Minister the analysis done by my colleague, Senator Healy Eames, based on Scoil Mhuire.  She is an educationalist, a primary teacher and she has lectured in a teacher training college. She costed such a proposal and she clearly delineated in that analysis the new costs that would be associated with what I believe would be an unsuccessful attempt to mainstream the pupils in question.  I would like the Minister to examine that analysis.</P>
        <P>We must be careful in this respect.  We all have a duty in a democracy and all of us in this Parliament have a duty to rectify the ills of the country by a method that is not at the expense of the weak and the vulnerable.  I can think of nobody more vulnerable than the children in these classes who have not succeeded in mainstream education with the provision of support and whom it is proposed will be taken out of one of these special classes.  It is not sustainable that that should happen.  Furthermore, it is not sustainable to have pupils ranging from seven years to 14 years in the same class.</P>
        <P>I appeal to the Minister to examine St. Anne&rsquo;s case and the maintenance of the two special classes.  If he does that, he will save money and will do the right thing by the people there.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I am taking this Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe.  I am pleased to have the opportunity, provided by Senator O&rsquo;Reilly, to deal with the matter.</P>
        <P>The Senator will be well aware that allocations to schools typically increase or decrease depending on pupil enrolment.  In the case of special classes for pupils with a mild general learning disability, the normal pupil-teacher ratio is 11:1.  The Department allows for a small reduction in this number and permits schools to retain a teaching post where it has a minimum of nine pupils in the class.  The school in question has two special classes and the enrolment totals 14.  The minimum enrolment required to retain the second class has therefore not been fulfilled and the school no longer qualifies to retain the second special class.</P>
        <P>In the case of 128 classes in 119 schools, the number of pupils dropped below this minimum.  These schools therefore are no longer entitled to retain the teaching posts in these classes.  All the 119 schools from which the teaching posts are being removed received allocations under the general allocation model of teaching support.  These schools therefore have been resourced for the categories of pupils in question.</P>
        <P>It is important to note that 3,000 schools that do not have special classes for pupils with mild general learning disability meet the needs of these children through mainstream classes and the use of their general allocation teaching resources.  Furthermore, some schools in recent years voluntarily disbanded their mild classes and mainstreamed the pupils, with the associated loss of the mild special class post.</P><Col N="949"/>
        <P>The pupils from the 128 classes will be placed in mainstream classes and will receive support from their class teacher.  All of them will benefit from the support available through the schools general allocation model.  As I said, the other primary schools in the country that do not have classes for children with mild general learning disability cater for these pupils from within the general allocation model.</P>
        <P>As the Minister stated, he is open to listening to proposals from schools in which they demonstrate that it is educationally more beneficial for the pupils involved to be in a special class of their own rather than to be integrated with their peers and supported by the mainstream classroom teacher and the learning resource teacher.  I understand that correspondence has been received in the Department from the school in relation to the mild class, and officials will be in direct contact with it shortly in this regard.</P>
        <P>There has been unprecedented investment in recent years in providing supports for children with special needs.  There are now about 19,000 adults in our schools working solely with children with special needs.  There are more than 8,000 resource and learning support teachers compared with 2,000 in 1998.  More than 1,000 other teachers support children in our special schools.  Some 76 classes for children with mild general learning disability are being retained where there are nine children or more in these classes</P>
        <P>I take this opportunity to emphasise that priority will continue to be given to provision for children with special educational needs.  As I stated, the establishment of these classes for mild general learning disability pre-date many of the developments in special education policy in recent years and we now have a system of providing schools with supports for children with high incidence special needs through the general allocation model.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his reply.  The one hopeful aspect is in the third paragraph, which states that the Department officials will look at the case in hand.  Children are coming in from a number of schools in the area.  They have been considered in the normal allocation and the difficulty is that it is not a runner to have children aged seven and 14 in the one class.  There is a very well developed special class in this school and it is the only such location in east Cavan.  I again appeal to the Minister to look specifically at this case and at individual pupils.  Those who have to go back to their own schools will not be able to manage in those environments.  For that reason I ask the Minister and his officials to look seriously at that.  I hope there is some ray of hope in that the Department officials will be in contact with the school. </P>

      <sTitle>Alcohol Abuse.</sTitle>
      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to address the need for the Minister for Health and Children to contact her counterparts in the North and the Scottish Parliament to exchange ideas on how to curb the abuse of alcohol with its associated health and economic costs.  I raise this specifically because the Scottish Parliament has highlighted the issue of alcohol abuse and misuse.  That Parliament in recent times prioritised this as one of its key issues.  It realised that Scottish alcohol consumption rates are very high as reflected in the significant economic costs from attendances at accident and emergency departments and in terms of the long-term illnesses associated with alcohol abuse.  It has decided that enough is enough and something has to be done about it.  I believe that Scotland is in eighth place in Europe in the alcohol consumption league.  The Scots are talking about introducing minimum pricing and many types of initiatives. </P>
        <P>I consume alcohol and I therefore declare an interest.  Perhaps I do not always fulfil the criteria attached to sensible drinking at times, but the problem is that Ireland is ranked first or second with Sweden in the one league we should not be proud of, namely, high consumption <Col N="950"/>of alcohol.  The debate about people going to the North to buy cheap alcohol is being monitored by the Minister for Finance.  A bottle of whiskey, for example, is said to be about &pound;14 cheaper in the North than it is here and that trend is having a downward spiral on our economy because people who go there to buy alcohol tend to purchase other commodities too, which they bring back.</P>
        <P>I am sure the vintners might argue that we should be reducing the price of alcohol to compete with the North.  I suggest something completely different, however.  I believe we should ask the North and Westminster, because it sets the VAT rates for the UK, to co-operate with Ireland in having the same VAT rate for alcohol &mdash; indeed, I would include cigarettes &mdash; if that is appropriate as both of those commodities price-driven in terms of where they are bought.</P>
        <P>I was on a national radio programme not long ago on which Mr. Jeffrey Donaldson, MLA, was invited to oppose me, but instead he started to agree with me because everybody knows that availability and accessibility are key driving forces in alcohol abuse.  Mr. Donaldson and all the other parliamentarians, whether they are based in Westminster, Cardiff, Edinburgh, Belfast or Dublin, realise that our consumption rates are nothing to be proud of.  On the economics of people buying alcohol in the North, they tend to purchase far more than they can consume because of the &ldquo;good deal&rdquo; factor.  However, the expiry dates on such products can be relatively short and therefore considerable amounts may be drunk if the alcohol is to be consumed within specified deadlines.</P>
        <P>I am not against alcohol, although I believe we have a major problem in our culture in that regard.  The league tables prove we are very successful in the wrong way, in terms of our consumption.  If Scotland, which is in eighth place in the league, is very worried about the health consequences for its citizens, social disorder and the cost of policing in this regard, given that Ireland is in second place, surely we should be talking to the Scots about the initiatives they intend to introduce.  We should talk to the North about the introduction of such initiatives on an all-island basis and we should consider the option of a single VAT rate for both Ireland and the UK to deal with a very significant health issue.</P>
        <P>Perhaps there will be an opportunity at North-South Ministerial Council level to look at mutual dealing in regard to what is a very significant and costly social and justice problem in this country.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryWallace"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Wallace</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank Senator Cecilia Keaveney for her great interest in this important issue.  She said that we have a problem with the culture and I will begin by discussing the damage caused by alcohol, which is visible throughout Ireland.  It is visible on the streets and in courts, hospitals, workplaces, schools and homes.  Despite the tendency to blame under-age drinkers, the majority of alcohol harm occurs among the adult population.  It manifests itself in street violence, accidents, hospital admissions, drunk driving, alcohol poisoning, suicides, alcohol dependency, cancers and cirrhosis.  Some of these problems, especially the acute problems, arise where the light or the moderate drinker drinks to excess on a single drinking occasion, while others result from regular heavy drinking over a long time.</P>
        <P>There is a considerable body of evidence which shows not only that policies and interventions targeted at vulnerable populations can prevent alcohol-related harm but that policies targeted at the population at large can have a protective effect.  This is the approach taken in the strategic task force on alcohol report of 2004 and it is consistent with the approach recommended by the World Health Organisation, WHO.</P>
        <P>Scientific knowledge is developing as regards the strategies that work to reduce alcohol-related harm.  The WHO has stated that a combination of strategies should be used to include <Col N="951"/>regulating and restricting the availability of alcohol, regulating the marketing of alcoholic beverages, enactment of appropriate drink-driving policies and implementing screening programmes and brief interventions against hazardous and harmful use of alcohol, for example, in primary care and accident and emergency departments.</P>
        <P>The introduction of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2008 which was conceived and passed within six months has demonstrated the Government&rsquo;s commitment to dealing with alcohol misuse, in particular from the public order perspective.  The Act contains provisions in regard to new hours for off-sales of alcohol, tougher public order provisions allowing the garda&iacute; to seize alcohol from minors, a court procedure to secure a new wine-only off-licence and new grounds for objection to the granting of an off-licence and new conditions attaching to the granting of a special exemption.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is also working on a new code of practice on the sale and display of alcohol with all the main supermarkets and convenience stores.  New strengthened codes on alcohol advertising and sponsorship have been in place since last July which control the placement and volume of advertising in all media.</P>
        <P>The Senator made an interesting suggestion in regard to common UK and Irish VAT and excise rates.  We should look at these issues.  North-South co-operation in the health sector has existed for many years and while collaboration between both jurisdictions has been ongoing, it has accelerated in recent years, in particular since the Good Friday Agreement.  That Agreement provided for the establishment of a North-South Ministerial Council to bring together those with executive responsibilities in Northern Ireland and in the Government.  Health Ministers formally engage on cross-Border issues under the auspices of the North-South Ministerial Council.  Its purpose is to develop consultation, co-operation and action within the island of Ireland, including implementation on a North-South and cross-Border basis, on matters of mutual interest and within the competence of each Administration.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Both health Ministers have agreed to undertake a comprehensive study to examine the potential for future co-operation between Northern Ireland and Ireland in the delivery and development of health and social care.  The study will provide a strategic framework for the development and implementation of future collaborative work in health and social care services.  The study recognises that both jurisdictions face problems associated with the misuse of alcohol and will include recommendations on future collaboration on substance abuse and alcohol related initiatives.</P>
        <P>As the Senator outlined, the Scottish Government is advancing proposals to tackle alcohol misuse in Scotland.  There has been contact at official level between the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Scottish officials in regard to the legislation and policy measures proposed.  Such contacts serve to inform and build up expertise which can be mutually beneficial.  As a result of the Senator raising the matter, I will make contact with my ministerial counterpart in the Scottish Government with a view to progressing this issue.</P>
        <P>The problems associated with alcohol misuse and proposals and initiatives to tackle such problems have been, and will continue to be, a basis for contact and co-operation at the highest levels between Ireland and our counterparts in Northern Ireland and Scotland.  I thank the Senator for her interest in this important issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I am delighted with the response and the fact that there will be more co-operation.  I forgot to commend all those involved in the decision to bring alcohol under the substance misuse strategy, which will replace the national drugs strategy.  It will play a part in dealing with the people and the families who suffer the consequences of alcohol abuse.  It will have major implications in our community.</P><Col N="952"/>
        <P>I would like more information on the labelling of alcohol products.  We were moving towards drink labelling in the same way as we have food labelling.  As someone who is permanently on a diet, I can choose to have a high calorie sandwich or meal because it is written on the product, but I cannot choose to have a high calorie or low calorie alcoholic drink.  I am aware of one brand, which I will not advertise, which calls itself &ldquo;Light&rdquo;.  It is not light in alcohol content but in calorie content.  How far advanced is the issue of alcohol labelling?  Will the Minister of State promote the concept of making people aware of healthier options, even when consuming alcohol?  If she does not have that information to hand, I will be happy to get it at a later date.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryWallace"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Wallace</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator raised that issue before and we fed it through the channels.  There are ongoing discussions in the EU on this important issue but I will raise it again.  As the Senator rightly pointed out, it impacts on the alcohol side of the health promotion unit as well as the obesity one.  A task force is to report at Easter and every element is being addressed.  We will look again at this to see what more can be done.</P>
