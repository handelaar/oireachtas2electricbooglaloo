	<P>I have received notice from Senator Keaveney that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism to outline the strategy proposed, if any, in conjunction with the Department of Education and Science, to deliver on the sub-committee report of the Arts Act that focused on music and education.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Doherty of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Health and Children to support the local youth project in Gweedore, County Donegal, and to provide funding to employ a youth worker in the area.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator McFadden of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources to reverse his decision to close commercial eel fishing in Ireland until 2012.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

	<P>The Order of Business is No. 1, motion regarding the appointment of the Ombudsman and No. 2, motion recommending Ms Emily O&rsquo;Reilly for appointment by the President to be the Information Commissioner, to be taken at the conclusion of the Order of Business and to conclude within 25 minutes, with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed three minutes and the Minister to be called three minutes before the end of the debate for concluding comments; and No. 3, statements on the National Asset Management Bureau, to adjourn not later than 7.30 p.m. if not previously concluded, with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 15 minutes and those of other Senators not to exceed ten minutes, and Senators may share time, and the Minister to be called ten minutes before the conclusion of the debate for concluding comments and to take questions from spokespersons or leaders.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Senator Frances Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Leader for arranging the debate tomorrow on the Ryan commission report.  It is appropriate that the House should debate the report, although obviously there is a great deal of reading in the five volumes.  This should be the first of a <Col N="654"/>number of debates on this document and it should be just the initial stage of a comprehensive response from the House to the content of the Ryan report.  It is an appalling litany of cruelty, violence and abuse of children in institutions where such behaviour was endemic.  This is not about party politics but about a comprehensive response to what is contained in the five volumes.</P>
        <P>The 18 congregations must respond in a moral and ethical way to their obligations.  They have so far failed to do that, as is clear from the interviews on the radio this morning and interviews earlier this week with other people.  This is not about legalities at this stage but about moving beyond what we have seen to date and ensuring there is a comprehensive response.  I do not doubt that we will begin to see the emergence of that comprehensive response from the contributions of Senators in the debate tomorrow.  That is what is necessary.</P>
        <P>We must discuss the recommendations of the report in detail and consider how we can move forward on them.  The State is still not listening to and is still failing children.  A number of weeks ago the Minister stated that there could be no independent inspection of homes where people with disabilities reside because the resources are not available to do it.  We must examine a range of issues relating to children on which we can move forward more comprehensively.  I hope we can do that.</P>
        <P>I wish to make two further points about the religious orders and the Department of Education and Science.  There was huge legal resistance to publication of this report.  Huge legal costs were incurred.  It is quite clear that the religious orders, at least, should pick up the bill for these legal expenses.  Second, this is a huge archive of incredible importance to this country.  I understand the commission gave a commitment to people that some of this material would be destroyed.  The Government should suggest to the commission that wherever possible the material and the details it contains should be preserved in the longer term.  None of us who watched &ldquo;Questions and Answers&rdquo; last night will forget the gentleman who spoke from the audience with such emotion about his experience.  It is the experience of these people as young children that we must remember and ensure it never happens again.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to take up the Senator&rsquo;s point.  We will have a good opportunity to discuss the Ryan report tomorrow and I look forward to doing so and putting on the record some things about which I was challenged last week.  In the meantime it is very important for us to articulate a clear view that in terms of responsibility, the congregations &mdash; the 18 orders &mdash; and the State should share the cost equally.  It should be a 50-50 response.  To those people who ask if we want to start selling the schools and hospitals, the answer is &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  However, I want the deeds of those schools and hospitals transferred to our ownership&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;until such time as we make up the amount that will be needed.  I know they are not marketable at the moment.  I do not want them sold, disposed of or liquidated, I want them transferred into our ownership to allow a 50-50 share of responsibility and cost all the way through.  No fair-minded person could object to that.</P>
        <P>I do not know how many people are aware that we have two ambassadors in the city of Rome, one for Italy and the other for the Vatican state.  I do not know what our trade with the Vatican state is, but I suspect it is considerably less than it is with other countries.  This week we decided to close down our consulate office in our nearest trading neighbour in Wales.  It would make far more sense to open an office in Wales and close the second unnecessary Rome embassy in the Vatican state.  I raise this matter assuredly and informatively because the Ryan report makes it clear that the Vatican was used as a place for orders to lodge files that <Col N="655"/>they do not want to make available to the Government.  It is a place in which elderly paedophiles and child abusers have been finding sanctuary away from this country.  Do we have an extradition treaty with the Vatican state?  Should we maintain an embassy in the Vatican state?  The Vatican state is fast becoming, as we see from our perspective, a flag of convenience for child abusers and paedophiles.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>We need to ask hard questions of the head of state in the Vatican, who is also the head of the Catholic church wearing a different hat.  There is a state within a state there and questions need to be put and answered.  I would like the Minister to come to the House and explain to us how we find ourselves in this position.  In the meantime I would prefer us to close down our embassy in the Vatican, which is completely unnecessary in this day and age.  We have millions of ambassadors going from the church to the Vatican all the time.  We also need to reconsider the decision to close the consular office in Wales. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Senator Brendan Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the points made by the previous speakers on the Ryan report.  My party and I are of the view that the religious institutions are not paying their fair share and, despite any legal reasons for not doing so, certainly morally they should pay their fair share.  I am conscious that we will have a debate in the House on the matter tomorrow so we will hold on that for the moment.</P>
        <P>I wish to share the contents of an e-mail I received from a constituent in recent days.  It will be self-evident where the e-mail leads.  It states:</P>
        <P LI="1">I would like to know if there&rsquo;s anything you can do for me.</P>
        <P LI="1">I have been recently let go out of my job,</P>
        <P LI="1">I have gone to social welfare to sign on for job seekers allowance,</P>
        <P LI="1">I have worked full time for the last 26 years and to my amazement I was told it could take up to 6 8 12 16 weeks for my claim to be assessed as there is a back log since January</P>
        <P LI="1">I am appalled that it could take so long I was told I could go to the community welfare office in swords and that they might be able to help me till my claim was processed</P>
        <P LI="1">I sat in the office for two hours waiting and when I went in I was told with amazement that I was entitled to absolutely nothing because my husband is in full time employment</P>
        <P LI="1">I am so annoyed.  My husband wages is a very low income and it just barely covers our mortgage and bills,</P>
        <P LI="1">I am so annoyed when I think of all the years that I worked full time and paid tax and prsi,</P>
        <P LI="1">I have recently became a mam for the first time and I don&rsquo;t know where my next packet of nappies and baby food is going to come from and that is no joke, but the lady in welfare office didn&rsquo;t seem to care.  I was embarrassed that I went down and I was so upset when I came home.  I am very annoyed with the whole system.</P>
        <P LI="1">I have the flu and a chest infection at the moment and I don&rsquo;t have the money to go to the doctor and I was told I won&rsquo;t qualify for a medical card because of my husband working.  If my baby got sick tomorrow what am I supposed to do?  I don&rsquo;t have the money to bring him.</P><Col N="656"/>
        <P LI="1">I need help. I don&rsquo;t know what to do. I can&rsquo;t sleep worrying. I hope you can do something for me because I don&rsquo;t know what to and I really don&rsquo;t.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This is the reality for people who are losing their jobs and it is nothing short of scandalous.  The lady in question is entitled to her benefit and cannot afford to wait.  We were told last year that the Minister for Social and Family Affairs was dealing with the problem of delays.  To date, however, no evidence has emerged to indicate she has done so, certainly not in north County Dublin where the problem, if anything, is worsening.  The delays in processing social welfare applications are unacceptable.</P>
        <P>Will the Leader ask the Minister to come before the House to advise on what she is doing to address the problem, the reason it has not been resolved and what the lady in question is supposed to do?  She is not asking for a hand-out but seeking her entitlements based on the contributions she has made.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GeraldineFeeney"><NameTxt>Senator Geraldine Feeney</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Fitzgerald&rsquo;s request that the debate on the Ryan commission report into child abuse be held in sessions.  Given that the report is published in five volumes, it will be difficult to cover everything in a single session.  We owe it to the victims to take our time and not rush the issue.  The agenda of the House is not such that we would be unable to have five debates on the report.</P>
        <P>On my way to the House this afternoon, I was listening to the &ldquo;Liveline&rdquo; show with Joe Duffy which featured a woman who entered Goldenbridge industrial school at the age of 13 years.  The lady in question was not sent to school and did not receive an education.  At the end of the conversation, Mr. Duffy asked her whether she had read the Ryan commission report, to which she replied that she could not do so because she could not read or write.  Did the commission take into consideration that many of the victims of abuse cannot read or write?  Is it possible to release the contents of the report in audio form, thus giving those who cannot read or write an opportunity to listen to a spoken version?</P>
        <P>I was shocked to hear Sister Marianne O&rsquo;Connor, who I understand is a Sligo woman, speaking on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; today.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GeraldineFeeney"><NameTxt>Senator Geraldine Feeney</NameTxt>
	<P>While I have the height of respect for Sister O&rsquo;Connor, who is a very good woman, I am sure she was sent out to do a job.  My experience of CORI in my work as a politician is that it acts as a defender of the weakest in society.  I ask its members to defend the weakest in society in this case and to avoid having an appropriate response dragged out of them.</P>
        <P>I concur with Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s comments on the Vatican, the wealthiest institution on earth.  Most of the victims of abuse have stated that the issue was never about money but about securing an apology.  Let us listen to them and, if necessary, we should over-compensate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I strongly agree with previous speakers, particularly Senator Fitzgerald&rsquo;s call to have the debate on the Ryan report truncated, so to speak, to deal with the five volumes of what is a substantial document.  I strongly support the calls made by Cardinal Brady and his bishops, which the orders appear to be resisting.</P>
        <P>I hope the House will address this issue in a balanced manner through the debate to be held tomorrow.  I have no doubt Senators will take a balanced position because, while appalling things happened, particularly in the industrial school divisions of the religious orders, we need <Col N="657"/>to reflect on the fact that many of us received a good education from some of the religious orders, for which we are grateful.  While there were undoubtedly rotten apples in the barrel here and there, there were a great many good people and, sadly, the good that any of them did will be interred with their bones, so to speak.  No doubt Senators will be balanced.  I, too, am grateful to the Leader that he is allowing this debate and, perhaps, further ones.</P>
        <P>On the debate the Leader announced for this evening, I note on the Order Paper it is referred to as the National Asset Management Agency, which we have known as NAMA, but he distinctly mentioned the word &ldquo;bureau&rdquo;.  Perhaps he would clarify that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Senator John Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>Like all the other speakers, I welcome the debate tomorrow on the Ryan report.  I am conscious that it will give an opportunity to condemn the wrongdoing of some in the church.  Notwithstanding that, I note that there could be a corruption of anger.  On that corruption of anger, it is important to look at whether those who did wrong were doing so by instruction from the top, as happens, say, when people overreact and use the words &ldquo;concentration camp&rdquo;.  In a concentration camp, the instruction from the authorities is to treat people in a certain manner.  The children were not treated according to the diktat, rules, regulations and statements of the church and those who did those things were further away from the church than the poor innocent victims.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not agree with the previous speaker.  I would say that we must do something practical.  I propose an amendment to the Order of Business, that we take today No. 34, motion 8, in my name and some of my Independent colleagues, on the exemption of the churches from the operations of the equality legislation.  It is astonishing that the very agency that presided over the rape of children, forcing children to lick excrement off shoes and all the other matters, the full list of which I will not go into, has been placed above the law so that it can do further damage, and it is doing so as we speak.</P>
        <P>At the weekend I attended a launch in Dublin, which was also attended by the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children with responsibility for children and youth affairs, Deputy Barry Andrews, who is a very decent man, at which a youth aged 16 told how he was not allowed by the Christian Brothers to put up anti-homophobic bullying posters in the school in which he was a student.  Nothing can be done about that because in the face of this cataclysm, we are still allowing the churches exemption from the equality legislation.  We are still placing them above the law and if we do nothing about that, everything else we do is utter hypocrisy.</P>
        <P>I listened to Sr. Marianne from some order.  Even the names of the orders are astonishing &mdash; the Sisters of Mercy.  How much mercy was there?  The names intended to show power and to confuse the ordinary people.  I do not know what Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate means but I know it is supposed to mean they are terribly important etc.</P>
        <P>I listened in horror to the oleaginous Deputy Woods excusing the disgraceful agreement that was made and stating the taxpayers will be glad to pay.  They will not.  Why should they?  It should be 50:50 as anything else is appalling.  For him then to state it was the British who urged this regime of cruelty, I do not believe there is room in this Oireachtas for a person like that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator should conclude.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>The deaf, the handicapped, the most vulnerable were especially targeted.  I say to that nun who stated that the deal is closed, &ldquo;No it ain&rsquo;t, Sister.&rdquo;  I can tell the House this.  On any deal where they state they will deal with the victims, have they not learned anything?  Do they not listen?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="658"/>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator&rsquo;s time is up.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>The very thing that terrifies, as Mr. Michael O&rsquo;Brien stated on television last night, is to be put in the same room as the agencies that abused them.  Do not shame us.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarkDaly"><NameTxt>Senator Mark Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>I remember a comment made to me two years ago by a priest when there was an emergency meeting of his order about a child abuse case that had come to light.  He was relaying a comment made by another priest of the order to the effect the order would be all right; not that it would look after the children or ensure they would get help, but that the institution and the religious order would be all right and would get through it.</P>
        <P>While Senators have stated it was not an order from the top or the Vatican and that bishops did not say children should be treated in that way, the crime is appalling and the cover-up, while not as bad, is equally appalling.  Those who did it were protected by those who knew.  This went on and on.  People turned blind eye after blind eye.  The Vatican has played a role in hiding the files and resisting the truth coming out in every way possible.</P>
        <P>CORI has no moral authority left now that it has stated it will not renegotiate the deal.  We must remember the &euro;1 billion the taxpayer must pay is being diverted from essential funds&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Exactly.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarkDaly"><NameTxt>Senator Mark Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;that could help vulnerable children.  We cannot provide those services because we must pay for past abuses.  CORI and the religious orders continue to perpetuate the abuse of children because we cannot afford to help the vulnerable.</P>
        <P>I look forward to tomorrow&rsquo;s debate, of which there should be at least five such debates.  CORI is so out of touch with the people that it does not realise it will need to turn around and, as Senator O&rsquo;Toole stated, pay half of the cost.  The State is culpable for 50% and the religious orders should come to their senses and realise they must pay 50% before we lose faith in them and they lose all moral authority.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>I second Senator Norris&rsquo;s amendment to the effect that the debate, which is important, should be held today.</P>
        <P>Will the Leader arrange for the Minister for Education and Science to answer a few questions on these institutions at the start of tomorrow&rsquo;s debate?  Is it the case they do not have enough funding to give to the State?  Are they concerned the services provided by them will be curtailed or suspended if they must pay an additional amount?  Are they simply sticking to an agreement made with the State so they can keep their millions of euro for themselves?  These questions should be answered by the Minister at the outset tomorrow so we can know the ground rules.</P>
        <P>The Minister must discuss the 1999 agreement.  Through the report, it has come to light that information available to the institutions was not provided to the then Minister.  Failure to disclose all information or the deliberate hiding of information breaks the terms of any contract.  The current Minister claims he cannot renegotiate it, but he can do so by proving the contract was invalid from day one because information was not disclosed.  If he has written any other type of contract with the institutions, he is a greater eejit than anyone could possibly have believed.</P>
        <P>The State can issue threats to institutions that refuse to co-operate.  Removing their charitable status would be easy.  They would need to pay corporate and other taxes like everyone else.  In this way, the State could get the money quickly.  Other avenues are open to the Minister besides holding his head and claiming he can do nothing about it.  He can do a lot.  Before he does so, <Col N="659"/>perhaps the institutions should be given a chance to explain why they believe they cannot or should not pay the additional amount.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvorCallely"><NameTxt>Senator Ivor Callely</NameTxt>
	<P>I look forward to tomorrow&rsquo;s debate, in which I hope everyone will have an opportunity to participate.</P>
     
        <P>Regarding a lack of transport developments, we often allow ourselves to be knocked about, but we should acknowledge that a section of the M8 was opened yesterday ahead of schedule and below budget.  There are many other good developments in the area of transport which have been carried out, such as the Mitchelstown M8 section, barrier-free tolling, the development of the Luas, the rail network, the interconnector and many other good projects.</P>
        <P>It is important to acknowledge all those who have been involved at the political, local authority and contractual level, and when we put our minds to it, we can bring these projects in ahead of schedule and below budget.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>Shame on us if we put the goods of the church ahead of the good of victims.  The religious orders have a moral duty to look at what has happened under their care, at the resources they have now and what it is in their power to do to help heal the hurt &mdash; I stress &ldquo;help&rdquo; &mdash; including the application of such resources as they have at their disposal.</P>
        <P>It will be a complicated matter.  Some religious orders, no doubt, will be better equipped than others, but I hope they will be generous in looking at the issue again.  I heard politicians say with great outrage in recent days, and I understand the wave of anger and outrage, that religious orders have a moral duty to contribute more.  They certainly have a moral duty to ask themselves whether they have contributed enough.</P>
        <P>It will be difficult to assess, if we are honest about the work being done, the disparity of resources between the State and the orders and the disparity of resources between the orders themselves.  It is not something that can be assessed quickly, but generosity is what is required and a gesture of generosity badly needs to be heard from that quarter.</P>
        <P>It is incumbent upon us as Senators and Members of Parliament to be true to the facts and give leadership at this time, because of the waves of anger washing over the country about all this, and it is anger we feel ourselves as citizens and people with humanitarian intent.  People have been talking at this time about closing down embassies or mixing Rome with the Vatican.  Many of these organisations have headquarters in Rome and may well have people or documents there.  It does not mean such documents are under the control of the Vatican or anything like it.</P>
        <P>We had a history of anti-Catholic bigotry in this country in the North and it should not return under any guise or any provoking circumstances such as those we are all enduring.  I say that as somebody who feels sick to the stomach.  I hate reading this report, but I forced myself to do so.  Every citizen should.  It is not a matter of whether they are a Catholic but of trying to ensure justice is done.  Let us not descend into further injustice.</P>
        <P>I had a meeting just now with a member of the Good Shepherd order, one of the 18 orders, in the ordinary&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;course of business, which was organised some time ago to discuss the work that needs to be done to assist victims of human trafficking.  The person concerned is giving of their own resources to help people because of the flimsy contribution they are getting from the State.  Let us keep our sanity in all of this, even while we ask the hard questions of the religious orders and others.</P>

	<P>I welcome the fact we will have a detailed report on the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse and, as suggested by Senator Feeney, that we have it on a rolling basis to go through all the reports.</P>
        <P>I regret very much that I disobeyed the Chair last Thursday evening.  I apologise to the Cathaoirleach.  It was not intentional.  It was a very emotional debate.  I sought an extension of time, which was not granted.</P>

        <P>Regarding the point made on our embassy in the Holy See, I know the ambassador, Mr. Noel Fahey.  He is a school friend of mine from the CBS in Roscommon.  It would be a retrograde step to close an embassy which is of great historical importance to the country and was vital in gaining our recognition throughout the world.  It is a very small embassy in Rome, assigned to the Holy See, and we have the Papal Nuncio in Dublin, who is head of the diplomatic corps.  It is a bit over the top to ask for a closure at this time when we want to be in a position to talk to the Vatican, through our embassy, which is the appropriate way to do it.</P>
         <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>We will go to the polls on 5 June and many of us are not happy with the compilation of the register of electors.  I am aware of a couple who were on the register for 45 years but they have been taken off it.  One could say they should have checked it.  However, there should be a late appeals system.  I urge the Leader to speak to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government about this issue.  Surely it is a deprivation of their democratic right for a couple who have been on the register for upwards of 40 years to be unable to vote on 5 June?  With all the arrangements we have in place there should be some late appeals system where errors have occurred.</P>

	<P>The abuse we read about in recent days has horrified us.  Those of us who knew something about it and had covered some of it earlier had no idea of the extent of it.  It is interesting to be reminded that Archbishop Diarmuid Martin had warned us of how serious this report would be.  We welcome the opportunity to debate it tomorrow.  The onus is on us to do that.</P>
        <P>I was impressed by what Senator Mullen said.  There is also a balance to be achieved.  Many generations have received an education from a very large number of perfectly judged nuns, priests and members of religious orders.  We must not disturb the balance by forgetting that they gave us our education.  The religious orders were responsible for a high proportion of our education.  I accept we have been let down by some of them but let us get the balance in proportion and not make the mistake of suggesting that everybody was at fault.</P>
        <P>I read an interesting letter in <i>The Irish Times</i> yesterday, which was only one such letter among approximately ten.  It was from a man who wrote about the wonderful education he had received and how much he and his large family had achieved.  He finished by asking that we should please not tar all these fine men with the same brush.  That is the balance that I would like to ensure we achieve and I hope we achieve it tomorrow.  It is important we debate the report tomorrow and that we do not hide it, but let us get the balance right also.</P>
        <P>Reference was made to a publication last month that showed that e.coli levels in Irish water was 30 times the UK level.  That is very serious because the figures that were given indicated that approximately 5% of samples taken from public water supplies were contaminated with <Col N="661"/>e.coli and approximately 90% of the population gets its water from public supplies.  It is important that we find time to debate the issue.  We have had problems in the past in various parts of the country, particularly Galway.</P>

	<P>I join in the call by Senator Fitzgerald for an all-party debate.  We should highlight the need for collective responsibility of the Judiciary, medical professionals and families who turned a blind eye to what was going on.  I agree with other speakers that there were some very good people in religious orders.  I got a very good education from the Mercy order.  While canvassing in recent days I heard stories to the effect that a &ldquo;cruelty man&rdquo; came around and took children away from their homes.  I was told that the payment for a child was &pound;9.  That money went to fund the institutions, but most of the children in those institutions did not get an education.  It is a terrible indictment of all of us that that went on.</P>

	<P>It is.  We stood idly by and we let it happen.  We knew about Letterfrack, Daingean and these other places.  Even I heard the threat as a child that I would be sent to the reformatory if I did not behave myself.  The idea that this has all come out now is shameful.</P>
        <P>This is still going on.  We are still turning a blind eye on children being abused.  Only in the last few months, we have heard about that dreadful situation in Roscommon.  We have no social workers at weekends.  We have closed two wards in the children&rsquo;s hospital in Crumlin.  We need to focus on collective responsibility in tomorrow&rsquo;s debate.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>It is important we have a debate on the Ryan report at an early stage.  Members in the Seanad, just like those in the D&aacute;il and indeed all public representatives, have an opportunity to show leadership in this area.  I have been very impressed by the balance shown by some of the spokespersons for the victims&rsquo; groups in their response.  If we had found ourselves in the same position, would we have been as balanced?  They are almost charitable in the manner in which they present their case.  They possibly expect exactly the same reaction from us.  The person who spoke last night on &ldquo;Questions and Answers&rdquo; asked that this would not be made a political issue.  Senator Frances Fitzgerald has made the same point.  The danger was that this could have happened as we are so close to an election.  I am glad it has not happened.</P>
        <P>We need to be genuine in helping the victims and the children of victims.  We also need to ensure that what happened could never happen again.  The only way we can do that is to get down to real practical steps when the emotion has died down.  At the end of the day, when the emotion has gone, there is a danger this story could disappear to the back pages.  That would be wrong as well.</P>
        <P>The best leadership we can provide is to show balance.  I can think back to my own education.  I said on the last morning here that I never witnessed anything inappropriate.  I saw nothing but appreciation for the Christian Brothers and the great work they had done.  I was travelling on the train later that day and a young man was sitting opposite me.  He said he had been in Cashel, my home town, for a reunion of the Croke Cup team and that 20 of them had turned up.  They got around to discussing this dreadful report and he told me that each and every one of the 20 people in Cashel that night said they never experienced anything but the best education from the Christian Brothers.  I can say the same for the nuns and many others.</P>
        <P>If we give real leadership by creating balance and thinking of everyone&rsquo;s concerns in this, we will best serve the needs not just of the victims and the children of this nation, but the whole of society.</P>

	<P>I want to raise two issues that are loosely connected to sport in a negative sense.  Can we have a debate on the return of sectarianism in the North that led to the death of a person recently in Coleraine?  It is important we highlight our disdain and distaste for these people who are opposed to the spirit of what 99.9% of the people in the whole of Ulster and the whole of the island of Ireland feel at this stage.  To have it loosely associated with the results of a particular soccer championship brings sport into disrepute as well.  The whole thing is appalling, and it is about time we raised our voices in the Upper House on this matter.  We should show our solidarity with the rest of our colleagues and friends right across the island and say we do not stand up for this and we do not support it.</P>
        <P>I seek a debate on the Irish language and Irish culture which come within the remit of the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v.  At a meeting of the Council of Europe in Paris last week I was informed that owing to the successful measures taken by the Irish Government in the form of the Legal Practitioners (Irish Language) Act 2008, An Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga and other initiatives, Irish has moved from being an endangered language to a vulnerable language, which is a progressive step.  It is important we debate this issue given the stated policy of the main Opposition party to abolish this ministry should it be returned to Government.  I hope that in its endeavour not to support the Irish language, the main Opposition party does not, given Irish is loosely associated with sport, also encourage disrespect or disassociation with the GAA or culture in general.  A debate on this issue would be timely given the forthcoming elections and ensuing decisions in regard to policies and so on.</P>

	<P>I do not support my colleagues who called for balance in the context of the Ryan report.  This is not the time for talking about balance but for talking about the Catholic church, an organisation that has totally and utterly failed its citizens.  How dare anybody talk about balance.  Anyone who reads the five volumes of the report will be traumatised.  I do not believe anybody should speak of balance until they have done so.  There are 3,600 pages in the document, which everybody should read.  What our fellow citizens and members of the Catholic church did to innocent little children is unbelievable.  As I said last week, these were poor children, the poorest in our society.</P>
        <P>Attention must be drawn to the fact that people who are sexually abused in institutions suffer consequences for the rest of their lives, including post traumatic distress, suicide and alcohol and drug abuse.  Also, there is evidence to prove that the children of adults who were abused in institutions equally, when they become adults, suffer from suicidal behaviour, alcohol and drug abuse and post traumatic distress.  The Catholic church at this time is a failed organisation.  This issue is not about Christianity and Christ but about the organisation and institute of the Catholic Church.  Archbishop Martin and Cardinal Brady are doing their best to save the day.  We must, for the rest of our lives, be vigilant to ensure this does not happen again.</P>
        <P>Chapter 13 of the report states that right up through the 1980s children in St. Joseph&rsquo;s school for the deaf in Cabra, which was not an industrial school, were being sexually abused and that in the 1990s deaf children were being physically abused.  This was happening in the 1990s.  I can assure members that if they read this document before making their contribution tomorrow they will forget about talking about balance.  That is for another day.</P>

	<P>Senators Fitzgerald, O&rsquo;Toole, Ryan, Feeney, Coghlan, Hanafin, Norris, Daly, Twomey, Callely, Mullen, Quinn, &Oacute; Murch&uacute; and Mary White expressed their strong views, shock and horror, at the report which has focused the attention of everyone in the country on events we wish had never happened.  Violence and crimes were perpetrated against children.  Senators will have an opportunity tomorrow to express their opinions and make suggestions to the Minister for Education and Science.  The report comprises 3,600 pages and Members will require a considerable amount of time to read it.  As Senator O&rsquo;Donovan noted last week, there is an urgent need for a referendum on children.</P>
        <P>For generations, priests and nuns have made their mark throughout the world.  They have given their lives to assisting the education of poor people and bringing the faith all over the world.  This report has highlighted the complete negation of the men and women who gave up their lives to bring religion to the people of the world and to help all of us from day to day.  This is not the future of the religious and, now it is out in the open, let us hope we can learn from the experience and introduce whatever legislation and other measures are necessary.</P>
        <P>The Government of the day had to give serious consideration to the advice of its Attorney General but this Government commissioned this report and the Taoiseach apologised to the people of Ireland and all those who suffered.  As Members of the Oireachtas, we do not condone what happened in any shape or form.  I look forward to allocating further time for dealing with these issues as a matter of urgency.</P>
        <P>Senator Ryan made a passionate plea to the House on behalf of a constituent.  If he provides me with a copy of his correspondence after the Order of Business, I will use my office to assist the person.</P>
        <P>Senator Callely called for a debate on transport and welcomed the investment in the N8, which is ahead of time and below budget.  The late great S&eacute;amus Brennan made this possible when, as Minister for Transport, he introduced corrective measures for achieving value for money and completing contracts on time based, of course, on hard experience.</P>
        <P>Senator Leyden expressed his disappointment that some people have been left off the electoral register even though they had been on it for the preceding 40 years.  It should be possible to replace names on the register, particularly if they have been on it for lengthy periods.  Often, the last two names on a page are inadvertently left out due to typing errors or unknown reasons with the result that people cannot vote.  The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government should on a pilot basis consult with postmen and postwomen, who are the first to know when constituents move into an area.  What is to stop us from trying this out for one election?  The Minister will be pleasantly surprised, even 14 days before an election, because post office staff are intimately aware of everything that happens in an area.</P>
        <P>Senator Quinn pointed out that the incidence of e.coli in Irish water is 30 times higher than in the UK.  This is an alarming statistic and I will pass his views on to the Minister for a response.</P>
        <P>Senator Keaveney expressed her horror about the unfortunate tragedy in Northern Ireland over the weekend.  If this is sectarianism, we will do what we can do to highlight that to every<Col N="664"/>one concerned and the great working relationship we have with our colleagues in Stormont and London.  We thought sectarianism was all over and done with it and this incident was a major shock to everyone on the island and those who respect life.  We thought we would only see 40 people punishing a person to death in old films going back many years.  I send my condolences to the wife and family of the poor man who lost his life because of this over the weekend.</P>
        <P>We have a debate on the Irish language in the House every year and Senator Keaveney is correct to call for that.  This will happen.</P>

        <P LI="1" Just="Left">That Seanad &Eacute;ireann recommends Ms Emily O&rsquo;Reilly for appointment by the President to be the Ombudsman.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>Emily O&rsquo;Reilly was appointed to the offices of the Ombudsman and Information Commissioner in June 2003 for a term of six years.  She is eligible for reappointment for a further six years, and the Government has decided to nominate her again for both positions.  I am delighted that she is willing to serve a second term and to lead her office, where she enjoys public respect and confidence, in the challenges that lie ahead.  I have a high personal regard for her and for her work.</P>
        <P>The process of appointment to both positions is similar.  Each appointment is made by the President on the recommendation of both Houses, hence the resolutions before the House.</P>
        <P>I will put the proposed appointments in context.  The first Ombudsman was Mr. Michael Mills, former political editor of <i>The Irish Press</i>, who served from January 1984 to October 1994.  He established and developed the Ombudsman&rsquo;s central role of examining individual complaints against public bodies.  During his term, and thanks largely to his efforts, the office achieved widespread respect and acceptance within the public administration.  There were some political tensions and challenges, centred on the resourcing of the office, but they were successfully overcome and resolved.</P>
        <P>The second Ombudsman, Mr. Kevin Murphy, former Secretary General for public service management and development in the Department of Finance, who served from November 1994 to May 2003, was also the first Information Commissioner under the Freedom of Information Act 1997.  In the latter role, he contributed to a fundamental movement towards openness and transparency in administration while continuing to develop the services of the Ombudsman.  As a Senator and member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service, I paid tribute to him at his last appearance before that committee.</P>
        <P>The current Ombudsman has also seen her role enlarged.  Since 2007, she holds the Office of Commissioner for Environmental Information, providing an independent appeals system to cater for applicants whose requests for environmental information have not been dealt with to their satisfaction.  Furthermore, in her second term of office she will be required to oversee a substantial extension of her remit.</P>
        <P>The Ombudsman (Amendment) Bill 2008 provides for the extension of the Ombudsman&rsquo;s jurisdiction to the administrative actions of vocational education committees, higher education institutions, and a range of other bodies whose administrative actions have not previously been subject to investigation.  The Bill also provides the Ombudsman with additional powers and updates various provisions in the Ombudsman Act 1980 in light of the passage of time.</P>
        <P>The Bill represents the most significant extension of the Ombudsman&rsquo;s remit in almost 25 years.  At present, the Ombudsman is empowered to investigate complaints about the administrative actions of Departments and Government offices, the Health Service Executive, including the public voluntary hospitals, local authorities and An Post.  The Ombudsman also has certain functions under the Disability Act 2005.</P>
        <P>Since the Freedom of Information Act 1997 came into force, the Ombudsman has also held the office of Information Commissioner.  As Information Commissioner, Ms O&rsquo;Reilly and her distinguished predecessor have played a central role in establishing the freedom of information regime in Ireland.  In this role, they have been a very important, independent force in helping to bring about a fundamental change in the relationship between the administration and the citizen, whereby most of the business of Departments is open to scrutiny under the Act, and <Col N="666"/>rightly so.  Her office has won the respect of citizens and of public servants alike, and she has been a strong and relentless advocate in articulating the importance of openness and transparency in Government.</P>
        <P>The Ombudsman and her office have produced a series of guidelines for the public service, which serve as templates to improve the quality of specific aspects of customer service.  These include The Ombudsman&rsquo;s Principles of Good Administration; The Ombudsman&rsquo;s Standards of Best Practice for Public Servants; The Ombudsman&rsquo;s Guide to Internal Complaints Systems; and Redress &mdash; Getting it Wrong and Putting it Right.  These are based on lessons learned from individual complaints over the years and represent what the Ombudsman often refers to as the added value that her office brings to bear arising from that process.</P>
        <P>It would be disingenuous of me were I not to acknowledge that the amendment of the freedom of information legislation in 2003 continues to cause some disagreement and controversy.  I am glad to say that the ten year limitation on the release of Government memoranda and associated documents was not further extended when my party returned to office for a third time.  Information requests can be time-consuming to process and some charge can be appropriate.  The Ombudsman and Information Commissioner operates under legislation passed by the Oireachtas and there may be legitimate differences of opinion, based on different responsibilities and perspectives, with regard to how the best balance is to be struck.</P>
        <P>As someone who was keen on such legislation being introduced and who once worked as an adviser for former the Taoiseach, Albert Reynolds, one of whose mottos was &ldquo;Letting in the light&rdquo;, something which is also being done in recent days in a tragic and appalling context, I would stress that the important point is that the current situation is a large advance on where we were and provides a progressive and relatively liberal framework.  The secretive, more authoritarian culture of the past often served us very badly and, thankfully, today we have a far more open society.  I would be concerned, however, at the diminished willingness of many public officials to commit to paper as fully, frankly and comprehensively as they might have done in the past, and at the dangers that this too may create.</P>
        <P>Prior to her appointment as Ombudsman, Emily O&rsquo;Reilly was well known to us all as one of the most able and incisive journalists of her generation, and I remember a number of encounters with her in that capacity, both in a Northern Ireland and European context.  Her work was widely read, highly respected, and heeded.  The same can be said for her decisions in the past six years as Ombudsman and Information Commissioner.  I am delighted to recommend her reappointment to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>I would also like to be associated with the reappointment of Emily O&rsquo;Reilly to the role of Ombudsman.  She has done an excellent job in the past six years, and I wish her another six years of equally being a good servant of the State, but I ask the Minister of State to ensure that there is adequate funding for her new role in the future.  She will take on a much greater burden in the next six years covering all the institutions about which the Minister of State spoke.  As someone who has used the Office of the Ombudsman to get some satisfaction for my constituents in the past, I understand there are certain limitations to her role because of the legislation under which she must operate.  The changes made in 2003 to the Freedom of Information Act strike the balance the Minister of State spoke about between accountability and transparency in Government &mdash; what the Government does not want the people to know and what the people believe they should know.  There will always be an argument about that because we would always prefer, certainly those of us in Opposition, to have as much openness, accountability and transparency as possible but there is a role for Government to try to limit that amount of information, especially controversial information.</P><Col N="667"/>
        <P>The role of the Ombudsman is a positive one which solves genuine problems people experience in their dealings with State organisations and we should do everything we can to bolster that role.  I have never seen any political involvement on the part of the Ombudsman.  It has always been a balanced and open office to deal with, and long may that continue.</P>

	<P>I would like also to be associated with the good wishes expressed.  I am pleased that Emily O&rsquo;Reilly has been proposed for reappointment as Ombudsman.  I am conscious that the original institution as ombudsman was set up in Sweden 200 years ago this year but we need the institution now more than ever.  It is an institution that protects the most exposed and unprotected in the community.  The sad events of recent days and the publication of the Ryan report show how important it is to be vigilant and to ensure proper practices and standards are maintained at all times.  An independent Ombudsman assists in that.</P>
        <P>The Office of the Ombudsman has existed in this country since 1984.  Tens of thousands of people have been helped by the dedicated staff of the office, who are committed to raising standards of service for customers of Government Departments, the health service, local authorities and other public bodies.  We owe Ms Emily O&rsquo;Reilly and her predecessors a vote of thanks for their work in this area.  We wish her every success in her appointment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the appointment of Ms O&rsquo;Reilly as Ombudsman.  I thank the Minister for widening the remit of the office and the scope of her duties, of which I had not been aware.  I knew Ms Emily O&rsquo;Reilly before her appointment as Ombudsman, and I knew the two previous holders of the office.  There is little doubt that the Office of the Ombudsman has been helped by the people appointed to that position since 1984.</P>
        <P>There are several examples of important reports and recommendations by Ms O&rsquo;Reilly to improve the transparency and fairness of our society.  She has taken on board everything we have allocated to her office, including the Disability Act 2005.  There has been much soul searching about the abuses perpetrated on victims in State institutions.  Ms O&rsquo;Reilly&rsquo;s work as Ombudsman has also highlighted abuses that continue to occur.  In a report last December, which I only saw a few days ago, the Ombudsman found that an 88 year old woman received care that fell far below what could reasonably have been expected in a nursing home in Mullingar, County Westmeath.  She said the investigation by her office showed the nursing home failed to ensure the patient&rsquo;s most basic needs were catered for, including being adequately fed and hydrated.</P>
        <P>She also highlighted the revelations about F&Aacute;S, which were taken up by our colleague, Senator Shane Ross, in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> , were due in part to the Freedom of Information Act, for which she has responsibility.  However, we still appear to be lagging behind in several areas with regard to freedom of information.  Recently, Ms O&rsquo;Reilly rightly expressed anger at the failure of the Government to subject the Financial Regulator, the Central Bank, the National Treasury Management Agency and the National Pensions Reserve Fund Commission to the Freedom of Information Act.  At a meeting of an Oireachtas joint committee this morning I suggested to the Minister that the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, should also be included under that Act.  I support the Ombudsman&rsquo;s aim to bring these bodies under the remit of the Act.</P>
        <P>The re-appointment of Ms O&rsquo;Reilly will allow her to continue her good work to achieve the goals she has set and for which she has established such a reputation.</P>

The publication of the <Col N="668"/>Ryan report has made clear the need for a flow of information, transparency and openness.  She has done an exceptional job, not only in working with current legislation but also in recommending improvements that might be made.  I hope we will actively pursue those in the coming years to improve the current good system under the Freedom of Information Act.  As Senator Quinn said, some flaws remain.  There is no better person than Ms Emily O&rsquo;Reilly to continue the good work she has started in that regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senators for their support for this motion.  Indeed, there is unanimity on the excellent work that has been done by Ms Emily O&rsquo;Reilly.</P>
        <P>Senator Twomey raised the relevant issue of resources.  On completion of the First Schedule of the Ombudsman (Amendment) Bill, that is, the list of bodies that will be subject to investigation by the Ombudsman, the Ombudsman&rsquo;s office identified a need for 13 additional staff to be recruited on a phased basis as the workload of the office increased following enactment of the Bill.  However, mindful of the current Exchequer situation, the Ombudsman has since indicated a willingness to explore additional options to maintain a satisfactory service level to the office&rsquo;s clients within the current constraints, while attempting to service satisfactorily the additional workload arising from the Bill.  This involves both a comprehensive review of work practices and structures to optimise internal resource allocation and a detailed analysis of the options available for increasing the staffing complement within the current funding constraints regarding salary commitments.  Another option to address this is the redeployment of surplus staff from elsewhere in the Civil Service.  These options are being explored.</P>
        <P>I thank Senator Twomey for his honest acknowledgement that there will always be a certain tension between the Executive and the concept of freedom of information.  That will be the case under any Government.  It is not just a case, as the Senator was perhaps implying, of suppressing information that might in some sense be embarrassing.  There can be perfectly good, objective, bona fide reasons that it is not in the public interest to put certain information in the public domain at a particular point in time.</P>
        <P>Senator Hanafin excited my historical imagination by mentioning the founding of the office in Sweden in 1809.  If I remember correctly that is when the last of the Vasa dynasty died and Bernadotte, the Napoleonic marshal, took over.  His dynasty still reigns today.  I wonder if the Ombudsman was introduced as part of that transition or whether there was an element of Napoleonic reform in it.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>The Minister need not fear transparency or openness.  He could be there for 200 years.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>Whatever the circumstances, and I intend to look into the matter a little further, it is certainly an institution that has stood the test of time in Sweden and has spread across much of the developed world.</P>
        <P>Senator Quinn referred to the several valuable reports produced by the Ombudsman.  Undoubtedly, her office constitutes an important safeguard.  It is not the only constitutional or other safeguard we have &mdash; this House is another safeguard &mdash; but it is an important safeguard, particularly where people&rsquo;s rights are concerned.  The Senator gave a very good example with the case of the 88 year old woman in a nursing home.  With regard to making the Financial Regulator and other State financial institutions subject to the Freedom of Information Act, the Act contains protections for commercially sensitive information.  That would apply to nearly all the transactions of those bodies.  It appears a great deal more thought will have to go into how and if one can apply freedom of information to those bodies.</P><Col N="669"/>
        <P>Finally, as Senator MacSharry pointed out, the Ombudsman has recommended improvements, many of which have been adopted.  These will always be given careful consideration.</P>

    <Title>National Asset Management Agency: Statements. </Title>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>Senators will be very familiar with the context and background to today&rsquo;s debate.  An unparalleled period of instability and loss of confidence in financial markets has been the driver of a broader global economic slowdown.  Few countries have felt the impact of this downturn harder than our own.  We have one of the most open economies in the world, largely dependent on international finance and unfortunately this international crisis has coincided with the bursting of a domestic property bubble.</P>
        <P>It is important to set out, up front, the reason for the Government&rsquo;s interventions to date to stabilise the banking sector, including the establishment of the National Asset Management Agency.  The banking system is unique.  Its proper functioning is absolutely critical to the smooth running of the economy and therefore must be protected by Government.  Our overriding objective is clear &mdash; to maintain a functioning banking system that will ensure a flow of credit to the real economy.  To realise this objective, the banks must have strong balance sheets and solid capital buffers.  NAMA is designed to do just that and I will explore the operation and impact of NAMA in more detail later.</P>
        <P>Before getting into the details of the operation and establishment of NAMA, I would like to address what many commentators seem to be suggesting is an alternative to an asset management agency approach, that is the wholesale nationalisation of the State-guaranteed banks.  The Government does not accept that nationalisation of the entire Irish banking system would be the short-term panacea that many envisage.  The Government believes it is important, where at all possible, that the banking sector has a market presence and that it operates within market disciplines and constraints.  The Government&rsquo;s objective is to ensure the lending needs of the real economy are met.  A commercially focused banking system, which includes banks having a market presence, operating within market disciplines and constraints, is best equipped to achieve this aim.</P>
        <P>No country is currently adopting a policy of wholesale bank nationalisation and there is no immediate reason for Ireland to adopt such a policy.  If Ireland was uniquely to proceed down that route, it could, from an international point of view, be very damaging to Ireland&rsquo;s reputation and attractiveness to international investors, not only from the perspective of the provision of funding to the banking sector, but from the perspective of international investment more generally.  Nationalisation will not in itself make the problems faced by the banks go away.  Many of the difficulties relating to managing impaired loans, cleansing the balance sheets of the banks and dealing with legal challenges will also arise in the context of a nationalised banking system and perhaps even to a greater extent.  Nationalisation is something we should avoid, if at all possible.  This is not a position held no matter what the cost, but is rather a balanced approach to the existing situation.  The Minister for Finance has also made it clear that if any further capital injections are required from the State for either of the two main <Col N="670"/>banks, these will be in the form of equity capital, which would have the effect of increasing State ownership of these two banks.</P>
        <P>The financial crisis has precipitated Government interventions across the developed world.  Governments have provided guarantees to banks, injected capital into them and established short-term liquidity supports.  Central banks have also intervened to support banks and banking systems.  Initial government interventions focused on the liability side to ensure banks could access funds as necessary and the Irish guarantee scheme is a case in point.  This allowed Irish banks to access funds from international markets during an unprecedented period of credit tightening.</P>
        <P>The focus of Government interventions has recently shifted to the asset side of the banks&rsquo; balance sheet.  Markets are concerned that likely future losses will erode the capital of banks, undermining confidence in banks and banking systems.  The matter has been discussed in detail at EU level and guidance has been issued by the Commission and the ECB.  Guidance at EU level provides for flexibility in dealing with impaired assets.  For example, in many countries banks hold structured financial products based on US sub-prime mortgages.  The appropriate State intervention to deal with these types of assets may be quite different from that required to deal with property-based loans.</P>
        <P>Concerns over asset quality in Irish banks relate to risky property-based exposures &mdash; mainly land and development loans.  The economic downturn and sharp decrease in property prices has led to increasing impairment charges on these types of loans.</P>
        <P>Following the advice of the Central Bank, the Financial Regulator and the NTMA, and from legal and financial advisors, the Government concluded that the establishment of an asset management agency was the most effective way to bring stability to the Irish banking system.  The asset management model has been supported and recommended by banking experts across the globe and used successfully in many countries in the past, as part of the work-out process of problem loans.  Done properly, investments in the banking system using this approach have eventually been recovered in full.</P>
        <P>The objective of NAMA is to strengthen the banks&rsquo; balance sheets which will considerably reduce uncertainty over bad debts and as a consequence ensure the flow of credit on a commercial basis to the real economy, to protect and increase employment, while also protecting the interest of taxpayers.  The evidence from other countries shows that the longer bankers and developers are allowed to deny the reality of the losses they face, the greater the ultimate cost to the taxpayer and the economy more generally.</P>
        <P>Transferring development loans to a State-owned asset management company protects taxpayers. Decisions about which development projects are viable and which are not should be made in the taxpayers&rsquo; interest, not in the interests of developers and bankers.  Managing distressed assets also requires expertise that rarely exists inside banks, but can be brought into a single asset management company with benefits of scale.</P>
        <P>The potential book value of loans that will be transferred to NAMA is in the region of &euro;80 billion to &euro;90 billion, but the amount paid by the agency will be considerably less than this.  It is important to emphasise that the State will not take all of the risk in the acquisition of such assets.  The price of the assets will have regard to current and expected market value of the relevant assets and what is sustainable for the taxpayer.  In the longer term, if the agency were to fall short of recouping all of the costs, the Government intends that a levy should be applied to recoup any shortfall incurred.</P>
        <P>Significant further detailed work and extensive due diligence on the loans books will be needed to ensure the appropriate categories or portfolios of loans are transferred and that the <Col N="671"/>banks are cleared of the identified riskiest loan portfolios.  The riskiest loan category for banks in Ireland is &ldquo;land and development&rdquo; and the largest related aggregate exposures across the institutions.  Entire portfolios of loans will be transferred to the agency.</P>
        <P>It must be stressed, in this context, that developers will continue to be required to repay their loans in full.  Where borrowers have made losses, they will need to recognise and take such losses and it will certainly not be the function of NAMA to &ldquo;go easy&rdquo; on them.  NAMA will operate on a full commercial basis and will be determined to recover monies owed to it to the fullest extent possible.  The stream of income from the assets and the proceeds from the eventual sale of the underlying asset or the repayment of the loan will accrue to NAMA.  This will be used to pay interest on the bonds issued to pay for the assets and eventually to repay these bonds.</P>
        <P>NAMA will be developed and implemented within the common EU framework detailed in the European Commission guidance on the treatment of impaired assets, working closely with the European Commission to obtain prior state aid approval.  By drawing on the best advice and experience available internationally, the Government is committed to ensuring that this very significant measure will be an example of best practice which meets all of the objectives the Government has set for it.</P>
        <P>I would like to update Senators on recent developments with regard to NAMA.  The initial preparations for NAMA are being managed by a steering group made up of representatives of the Department of Finance, the Office of the Attorney General and the NTMA.  The steering group is overseeing the preparation of the legislation in parallel with the practical preparations for the establishment of NAMA.</P>
        <P>An interim managing director has been appointed to drive the implementation process forward.  Mr. Brendan McDonagh, a director with the NTMA, has been appointed to this position and will be assisted by an advisory committee, to be appointed shortly, which will provide him with a range of expert advice.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Finance has also directed the National Treasury Management Agency to provide the necessary staffing and other facilities through its existing resourcing arrangements to support the interim operation of the National Asset Management Agency pending its establishment on a statutory basis.  The NTMA is engaging experts to assist the interim managing director and, on their appointment, substantive work will commence on analysis of eligible assets, valuation methodology and management of engagements with the financial institutions.</P>
        <P>Senators may have noted from media coverage that the National Treasury Management Agency issued a questionnaire to the banks last week seeking details of their loan books as a basis for the National Asset Management Agency&rsquo;s work in determining details of the assets.  Yesterday was the deadline for the banks to provide a breakdown of their property loan portfolios to the NTMA.  These details will inform the development of the NAMA business model and its staffing requirements.</P>
        <P>The Department has also opened communications with the European Commission with a view to ensuring the establishment of the National Asset Management Agency on a statutory basis is consistent with European Union guidelines on the treatment of impaired assets and complies with state aid rules.</P>
        <P>While substantial progress has been made since the Government&rsquo;s announcement in April to establish the National Asset Management Agency, clearly much more needs to be done.  We cannot allow ourselves to rush the process as the impediments to be overcome are both complex and challenging.  Nevertheless, practical arrangements for the operation of NAMA are progressing apace.  The Minister for Finance will publish legislation in July which should allow sufficient time to get things right.  I confirm that the Oireachtas will be given adequate time to <Col N="672"/>debate the important issues in the legislation.  I understand the intention is that the legislation will be debated in the House in September.</P>
        <P>I alluded to the fact that there has been much discussion in recent times about the difficulties the National Asset Management Agency is likely to face in its operation.  There is no doubt the establishment and ongoing operation of NAMA will entail logistical, legal and technical challenges.  Previous examples internationally highlight the importance of a speedy and comprehensive approach to cleaning up the balance sheets of distressed banks.  The Japanese banking crisis is an example of where Government procrastination and inability to take decisive action prolonged a banking crisis, hampering economic growth.</P>
        <P>While the establishment of the National Asset Management Agency is an enormous task, it is necessary and appropriate to strengthen our banks and kick-start lending to the real economy.  The Government, the Department of Finance and the National Treasury Management Agency have sought and taken the best advice available in their responses to the evolving financial crisis and will continue to do so in finalising the design of NAMA.  The Government will draw on the advice of the Office of the Attorney General and commercial legal advisers, where appropriate, to ensure the legislative and operational model of NAMA is robust and can withstand all legal and constitutional scrutiny.  It will also have regard to European Union state aid guidelines, particularly with regard to the valuation of impaired assets.</P>
        <P>I reiterate that the rationale for the establishment of the National Asset Management Agency is to free the banks from their risky property assets so that they can lend again to the real economy, creating jobs, generating tax revenue and improving standards of living.  Credit is the lifeblood of the economy and its flow is a prerequisite for economic recovery.</P>
        <P>The establishment of NAMA is a decisive and comprehensive solution to deal with concern over asset quality in Irish banks.  Getting the agency up and running effectively will be a major task which we must get right.  While we recognise that there are practical difficulties to contend with, the Government is confident these will be overcome.  This is the reason it is taking its time in doing the preparatory work with the banks and preparing legislation.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s approach to the National Asset Management Agency builds upon all its previous actions in response to the financial crisis.  At all stages, whether it was the initial announcement of the guarantee, the nationalisation of Anglo Irish Bank, the recapitalisation of the two main banks or the establishment of the National Asset Management Agency, the response has been structured and considered.  The Government has consistently demonstrated its commitment to prevent the failure of any systemically important financial institution, at the same time having regard for the overarching principle of protecting the interests of the taxpayer.</P>
        <P>I assure Senators that this same fundamental principle of protecting taxpayers&rsquo; interests will also apply in the roll-out of the National Asset Management Agency.  The Government is absolutely determined to meet the challenges that lie ahead and provide the necessary stability that will allow the banks to support the recovery of our economy, a recovery in which the Government is determined to play its part to the maximum and to the benefit of all Irish people.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his contribution.  While I was unable to attend today&rsquo;s meeting of the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service, I understand the joint committee had a long debate on the National Asset Management Agency and that many issues of concern were discussed.  Given the complexity of this issue, further questions will need to be asked in the months and years ahead. </P><Col N="673"/>
        <P>The Minister of State described the Government&rsquo;s response to the financial crisis as &ldquo;structured and considered&rdquo;.  It has also been incredibly expensive.  The combined personal debt held by every man, woman and child in the State amounts to more than &euro;100 billion, while Government debt is set to increase to more than &euro;70 billion by the end of the year.  In addition, Government bonds will be issued to pay the costs incurred by the National Asset Management Agency, which the Minister acknowledges could reach &euro;90 billion.  The State is already bailing out banks and the final cost of this measure could reach &euro;20 billion.  Essentially, therefore, the State has acquired new debt of more than &euro;100 billion since the previous general election and no end to the problem is in sight.  Many people find this difficult to comprehend.</P>
        <P>I sometimes believe that officials in the Department of Finance must feel as the crews of U-boats under attack must have felt during the Second World War.  As they descended deeper and deeper in their efforts to avoid depth charges, the sailors had to listen to the hull of their vessels creaking and cracking and must have wondered whether they would manage to escape.  Similarly, given the scale of our debts, departmental officials must wonder whether the whole edifice will collapse upon itself.  We have not returned to the 1980s but we have entered a new era.  We have not, since the foundation of the State, had similar levels of personal and Government debt.  This issue must be discussed on an ongoing basis because we cannot assume things will happen.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State indicated that developers will be held liable for their debts and will have to pay back their borrowings in full.  He is engaging in a form of grand-standing because it is clear NAMA will not have a hope in hell of seeing much of the money.  For example, if the value of a developer&rsquo;s assets and borrowings is &euro;350 million and &euro;1 billion, respectively, the difference will have vanished into thin air because land prices, especially prices for development land, house prices and the value of bank shares and stocks have gone through the floor.  It is pointless, therefore, to argue that the Government will get back the money borrowed by developers because few developers will be in a position to pay it back.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State referred to the imposition of a levy on the banks.  How much will the banks pay under the new levy?  Most of those with whom I spoke who have a better understanding of finance than I do have told me such a levy would not be workable.  They argue it would be preferable to leave bad debts with the banks if the alternative is for the National Asset Management Agency to impose a levy in five or ten years&rsquo; time because it has been unable to realise the value of the assets.  Such a levy would hinder the operations of the banks for years.</P>
        <P>In recent years, the banks have rolled over interest on many development loans and many developers have not paid interest on their loans.  In some cases, they have not even made repayments on the capital they have loaned, yet the banks have not taken action.  One does not read many reports about banks taking developers and builders to the courts.  The banks appear to be happy to free-wheel along, building up debts and problems.  The people who will pay for the problem in the long term are those who do business with the banks.  This will be achieved through increased bank charges, fees and costs, including the cost of borrowing money.</P>
        <P>Comments were made about fixed-term mortgages.  If the Minister is serious, he must put the boot into the banks to ensure they run their businesses properly.  Otherwise there is the perception of the three groups &mdash; the holy trinity &mdash; which are involved in this problem, the Government, the banks and developers.  If the Government is as incompetent as the other two, I see nothing improving in the next couple of years.  That is important when one considers the vast sums of money involved.  NAMA will generate &euro;90 billion of debt for the Irish people over night and one really needs a sense that the Government knows what it is doing here and that it is rapidly trying to transform this.</P><Col N="674"/>
        <P>The economic situation is completely different from that from which this model came, that is, Sweden in the 1990s.  When Sweden nationalised its banks and bought up all its toxic assets, it was still dealing with a growing global economy.  We are dealing with a contracting global economy and there is no guarantee that these assets will have any greater value in two or three years&rsquo; time.  No matter what might happen in the overall economy, many of these assets will remain depressed.  As nobody believes that his or her house will be worth next year, the year after or even in 2012 what it was worth in 2006, why should we believe that development land or commercial properties which the Government is taking into NAMA will have that value?  It is the stuff of daydreams.  The reality is that these are depressed assets.  They are toxic assets and they will remain so for quite some time.  The Government should speak of how it will make NAMA work in that way.</P>
        <P>There are no experts in this.  It would be great if it transpires that we are wrong and these assets become substantially valuable in a short time.  That would mean we as a nation can do something about the approximate &euro;300 billion national debt.  However, it is far more likely that will not happen and we need to be realistic about how we plan our future finances on that basis &mdash; I get the impression the Government is not looking at it from that point of view.</P>
        <P>I would like to know more about how NAMA will work.  If we can see that the developers cannot pay for it and that the banks are not really in a position to deal with it, we need to know what is the superstructure and who are the persons involved.  I pointed out previously that a big developer will have legal experts, property experts and financial experts managing his or her property portfolios and projects and that the banks will also have specialists working with these developers.  When these projects move to NAMA there is a sense that some of that responsibility might go with it and I do not see the Government planning on taking on 600 to 700 persons to make NAMA function.  There are only approximately 40 or 50 persons who are responsible for most of the mess we are in and if each of them employs between 30 and 40 people, there will be between 1,500 and 2,000 presently employed in trying to deal with this mess.  Having a half dozen persons in the National Treasury Management Agency giving assistance to a new organisation called NAMA does not inspire the confidence needed if these are the figures being employed at present.  We need to know whether this is merely an oversight role or will a large number of people be taken on by NAMA to manage this fund in the future?  Those are the sorts of core questions the Government needs to answer to instill confidence that NAMA will work.</P>
        <P>My fear always is that somehow it will be the poor taxpayer who will get lumbered with this, that the &euro;90 billion will be written up as Government debt, given as bonds to the banks, eventually there will be a fire sale of these toxic assets and in a couple of years&rsquo; time the ordinary citizens of the State will suddenly realise that the national debt has ballooned under the present Government and they are being more or less left with it.  There is a serious risk of something like that happening no matter what the Minister of State tells us.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister of State to outline in his response whether the Government has looked at alternatives.  I refer not to alternatives as big as NAMA but to alternatives that might not cost as much.  For example, has the Government looked at directly forming property funds or property trusts?  Has it looked at one of the solutions I put to it, namely, taking over Haven, which is an SPV of the EBS, and using that to rush money into the economy?  Apparently, that has been dismissed by the Minister.  How much research did the Government conduct on other solutions that were presented to it?  These solutions would not have dealt with this crisis in the same way but they might have helped give those green shoots of the economy, about which everybody keeps speaking.  I suppose the biggest fear is that when we come to the end of all this in two or three years&rsquo; time we will have achieved nothing.</P><Col N="675"/>
        <P>The Minister of State gave explanations about what happened to Japanese banking.  What happened was a complete paralysis of both the banking sector and the political establishment in the way they dealt with this issue.  Funnily enough, exports seemed to recover quite quickly in Japan, but banking and finance was totally paralysed.  The circumstances there were different from those in which we find ourselves.  This is new and the Government should not rigidly apply what worked in other countries in the expectation that it will work here because there is no guarantee of that.</P>
        <P>When people read what the Minister of State said today they will be flabbergasted.  The sums we will commit to sort out the banking crisis would pay for the educational sector for the next decade.  It is a massive amount of money.  Even the interest built up on that every two years would probably pay for one year&rsquo;s education in this country.  We know the return we can get from a well resourced educational service, yet we are not really getting the clear answers from the Minister of State on what may happen with NAMA.</P>
        <P>Another aspect the Minister of State did not point out are the substantial legal issues cropping up to do with NAMA.  It is not merely that there are good developers who do not want to see their properties and portfolios taken over by NAMA.  Many of the developers would have protected themselves when they were taking out these massive loans.  Most of the developers when developing big sites would have treated each site as a new limited company where their exposure would be limited enough.  It was surprising to find big developers with personal guarantees on some of these massive developments.  I would say that a significant number of these developers did not make personal guarantees and may even have protected their good quality assets from some of these developments.  If they have set up such limited companies on some of these big sites which have clearly become toxic, the Government is not in a position legally to go after those developers&rsquo; other resources or funding.  Legally, one cannot go after persons who may be involved in another capacity, for example, where a person might have a 10% or 15% share of a big development.  The main shareholder may well need to go into NAMA, but these smaller individuals may feel that that is not necessary and that the Government is damaging the value of their property assets by pulling them into NAMA and letting them sit there for a number of years.  These are the nitty-gritty matters about which we do not hear much from the Minister.</P>
        <P>We all now understand the big picture as to the nature of NAMA but, as a former Taoiseach stated, it is the small details that trip one up.</P>

It will be in the small matters, when we are trying to get through the nitty-gritty of NAMA, that we will see the problems arise and I ask the Minister of State to discuss those as much as possible so that we can get a good sense of what is happening.</P>
        <P>When the Minister speaks about this over the coming months one of the first points to clarify is the amount of property which is completely toxic.  In other words, let us look at some of the half built housing estates and industrial estates on the edge of provincial towns that are closed up where the sites have been sealed off.  In reality, one cannot see those houses being sold for a decade.  This can be kept in an historical context.  Senators from certain parts of the country know of half-derelict building sites and housing estates that were started during previous booms because people expected businesses to enter the areas or the towns had businesses.  Some expected that areas were going to become the new Costa del Sol, so new chalets were built.  The country used to be littered with such sites, but nothing on the current scale.  Many half-<Col N="676"/>built estates are of little or no value to anyone.  What percentage of NAMA&rsquo;s assets will comprise such sites?  Will the Minister of State address my concerns in his response?</P>

      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Senator Marc MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>I join others in welcoming the Minister of State.  I am glad to have an opportunity to make a few points on the National Asset Management Agency.  In recent weeks, many calls have been made for a debate on the issue and we are all happy with this opportunity to make a number of interim points.  As I cautioned in response to a number of contributions on the Order of Business, NAMA is a work in progress and we will need further debates as more of the details become clear.</P>
        <P>Due to other commitments, Senator Twomey was not in a position to attend this morning&rsquo;s meeting with NAMA&rsquo;s interim director, Mr. Brendan McDonagh, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, and Dr. Bacon.  It was extremely informative, lasted for four hours and, lest I was in any doubt, left me confident we are moving in the right direction, that we have engaged the correct personnel and that our approach is correct, notwithstanding that the international community has already adjudicated that we are moving in the right direction in terms of our policies, including not least this one, but also last week&rsquo;s issue of oversubscription of bonds, the NTMA issue and so on.  Internationally, our approach so far has received a resounding thumbs up.</P>
        <P>The purpose of NAMA&rsquo;s establishment, a major initiative, is to transfer key exposures from the financial institutions to NAMA to clean up banks&rsquo; balance sheets and provide them with Government bonds, thus enabling the resumption of the flow of credit to the real economy.  Key exposures identified by the market and the credit rating agencies include all the land and development loans of the eligible institutions, amounting to some &euro;60 billion, and the commercial loans linked to land and development loans, estimated to be worth &euro;20 billion or &euro;40 billion.  Therefore, NAMA will acquire performing and non-performing loans.  In return, the institutions will receive Government bonds issued by the NTMA.  These may be used as collateral to avail of European Central Bank, ECB, funding.  It is envisaged that the interest payable on the bonds will be offset by interest flows from performing loans acquired by NAMA.</P>
        <P Just="Left">While NAMA will initially deal with the management of transferred loans, there is little doubt that a large part of its work may become the management of a portfolio of underlying property assets.  In managing these loans and assets, NAMA will have a commercial mandate, the aim of which will be to ensure over its projected lifespan of ten to 15 years the optimal outcome of the realised value of the assets transferred to it.  The Government and the Minister of State have stated that NAMA will have a categoric and clear mandate to ensure taxpayers do not pay for the over-exuberant lending practices of the past decade.  In the event of there being a shortfall, the Government has signalled the money will be recouped from the financial institutions via levies, which were mentioned in the last budget.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Twomey suggested we buy up loans and assets, give Government bonds and have a fire sale of the assets.  I am sure the Senator saw last weekend&rsquo;s coverage of the situation in the United States of America in the 1980s, namely, the savings and loans debacle.  As Senator Quinn said, the Resolution Trust Corporation was established with some 8,000 or 9,000 employees, took in assets valued at approximately $450 billion and closed after six years with a loss of approximately $90 billion.  This morning, the Minister for Finance alluded to a part of the reason for this, namely, that there was a fire sale.  However, a fire sale is not the intention behind NAMA.  Rather, its purpose is to take on board and manage the assets and to pursue workouts to the fullest extent possible and to the taxpayers&rsquo; benefit.  There will be no fire sale.</P><Col N="677"/>
        <P>As will inevitably be the case when a number of developers default on their obligations, assets must be secured.  However, NAMA has no automatic intention to dispose of those assets at the earliest possible convenience.  It has an obligation to ensure it gets the maximum return, but this does not mean it must have a fire sale or auction the following week of whatever landbank or property may be at stake.  As was confirmed to us this morning, it will have the ability to bank land to be brought to market at the optimum time.  This is to be welcomed.</P>
        <P>Those developers who find themselves marginally outside in terms of their ability to react to the changing times in which we find ourselves will be happy to hear that every loan will be treated individually after the valuation methodology has been worked out, an ongoing process.  No blanket approach will be taken whereby all development loans will be cut by X percentage.  This is also to be welcomed because situations can differ greatly.  While Dr. Bacon mentioned a broad blanket approach in his initial recommendations, it considered six types of asset.  The methodology will be even more detailed and will examine each loan to assess its value.  Any objective observer could be pleased about this.</P>
        <P>Senator Twomey asked whether NAMA will take on many employees and what the consequential cost implications would be.  The Resolution Trust Corporation in the US had many employees, but it is envisaged NAMA will have few, perhaps 30 or 40.  Over the coming months, some experts might be contracted in on a short-term basis to ensure NAMA has the optimum and correct form of legislation before being tabled before the Houses.  We will be prepared to sit in July or whenever.  The Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, and Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, have stated the Houses will be recalled if necessary.  We could use the existing banks to administer the loan books on their behalf and under strict criteria.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This morning, I raised my preference for an Indonesian approach.  When Indonesia faced a similar situation, its banks were incentivised to get the maximum possible return for the assets.  Our banks will not just focus on the lower valuation paid by NAMA.  Instead, they will be incentivised to recover the maximum amount and may receive a return for doing so.  Since examining the Indonesian example would be of benefit, I am glad to report that NAMA&rsquo;s interim director, Mr. McDonagh, stated it is being considered as an option.  There would be nothing worse than using personnel within the banking system to administer the recovery of debts, only to have the banks collect &euro;85 million out of every &euro;100 million paid by NAMA before moving on to more profitable business.  As that would be regrettable, we must consider some level of incentivisation.</P>
        <P>The heads of a Bill are being worked on.  As it is appropriate that we get this right, I am pleased that some time is being taken.  I have often heard it said on many sides of the House that rushed legislation normally tends to be bad legislation.  I am pleased that the appropriate time is being taken and that the appropriate expertise is being brought into play.  I hope towards the end of July, we can see the heads of a Bill and, if necessary, throughout August or September we will be brought back here to pass it through the Houses.</P>
        <P>I am informed that following the enactment of the Bill, NAMA could be up and running, in terms of taking loans under its control, within eight weeks, and I welcome that.  I asked a question at a committee this morning and it is a shame more members of the Seanad could not make it to the debate, because I am sure some very important questions could have been put to the witnesses attending and Dr. Bacon.</P>
        <P>I am pleased we are moving in the right direction.  As the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, mentioned, the questionnaire to be returned by all the financial institutions to the interim director last evening indicated some 1,200 borrowers have borrowings in excess of &euro;10 million and quite a few have borrowings in excess of &euro;500 million.  Taking into account all six <Col N="678"/>institutions, some have borrowed in excess of &euro;1 billion.  As we look to the future, notwithstanding the challenges we currently face, there are lessons we can learn.</P>
        <P>As the Minister of State mentioned, the project is being managed by the steering group, made up of senior officials from the Department of Finance, the Attorney General and the NTMA.  One point Senator Twomey mentioned, which was a major issue from the Fine Gael perspective, was how one can charge a levy at a late date on the basis that I bought X from someone today at &euro;100, have only been paid &euro;80, am down &euro;20, and, therefore, another person must now pay me &euro;20.  It was a valid point, but by using the Finance Act as a vehicle, the Government can levy the banks for, effectively, whatever it wants.</P>
        <P>The point was made by myself and others this morning that the legislation introduced to set up NAMA would signal the agreement of the financial institutions covered by it that that would be the case and would happen so we could avoid potential legal challenges when the time would come.  It is well down the road, so one is in a position to say what would be recovered for what assets, if appropriately managed over the eight or ten-year period.</P>
        <P>The witnesses before the committee this morning also informed us lands were bought at speculative rates, on the assumption they might be rezoned or valuable from a development point of view at some stage in the future.  Such lands are worth no more than agricultural values today.  It is envisaged by those involved in NAMA that no more than agricultural prices should be paid for such land to date.  There will be losses.  There are other lands which they feel, if appropriately managed, can produce a reasonable dividend over five to 15 years.  That is positive and it is not all bad news.</P>
        <P>The comments of Dr. Somers, which left us all a little confused last week, identified many of the practical difficulties associated with a project as large as NAMA.  All of us agree with that.  The Government and its advisors, including the NTMA, are aware of these difficulties.  Those who were at the committee this morning heard some of those issues being teased out.  They had an indication aspects of it cannot be discussed at this stage, because it is still very much a work in progress, and as soon as they can be, they will be.  Senator Quinn, who was at the committee for four hours, along with myself, agree we were given a clear indication and some confidence that these issues are in hand.  Mr. Brendan McDonagh, in particular, was impressive.</P>
        <P>Establishing NAMA and drafting the legislative framework within which it will operate is very complex.  There are, as Dr. Somers pointed out, considerable potential legal and practical difficulties.  The Minister of State met Dr. Somers and he has confirmed to him he is supportive of the NAMA proposal and sees no other solution to the issues that arise in the banking system.</P>
        <P>The NTMA has, at all stages of the development of the NAMA proposal, been a key policy advisor to the Minister and Government on the banking crisis.  We have seen some coverage over the last number of weeks, as Senator Quinn will bear out, that what the Government was pursuing was not remotely in line with what was proposed by Dr. Bacon and others.  At today&rsquo;s meeting, one was left in no doubt that Dr. Bacon felt everybody was in agreement that what he had suggested was completely at one with what the Government was pursuing.</P>
        <P>There are difficulties and major complexities to be teased out.  I am much more confident today than I was last week, having heard the contribution of Dr. Somers.  For those who could not attend the meeting, perhaps they could check the records of it.  It was very positive indeed.  This is the first of a number of debates on NAMA and I look forward to participating in future ones.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh.  It is very tough to stand up and speak after Senator MacSharry, who spent four hours with me at the committee meeting today, because he has given a full report of it.  I am delighted I attended the meeting.</P>
        <P>I went to it feeling doubtful, questioning and unsure whether this was the right thing to do.  I was influenced by the amount of media reports and the number of academics who said this was the wrong thing to do.  I was very impressed with Dr. Bacon and the words he used.  I was also impressed with Mr. Brendan McDonagh and the Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, who, we were told, had to leave at 1 o&rsquo;clock and was still there when I left at 3.45 p.m.</P>
        <P>The one thing I learned from the meeting was there is no silver bullet or easy answer to this problem.  I understand why there is questioning from both sides.  Whatever solution we come up with will have its supporters, detractors and critics.  The impaired loans are clogging up the banking system and the onus is on the State to facilitate a solution.  If the banking system is to begin to work again, we must overcome that problem.</P>
        <P>The objective must be to establish a banking system that will ensure a flow of credit to the economy to enable trade and industry to go about their business.  I am not just talking about SMEs, but about industry, trade and large businesses.  The decision to establish NAMA is aimed at that particular objective, that is, to buy property and development loans from the banks at, I understand, a large discount, through the issue of Government loans to the banks.</P>
        <P>There are a number of benefits to establishing NAMA.  The first is transferring development loans to a State-owned asset management company.  It protects the taxpayer, which is a major query people had.  It seemed those who objected to the project asked why it was being done to help the banks.  However, that is not the objective.  The objective is to ensure we get the banking system working again.  Transferring development loans to a State-owned asset management company protects taxpayers.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Dr. Alan Ahearne said the evidence from property bursts in other countries showed the longer bankers and developers are allowed to deny the reality of the losses they face, the greater the ultimate cost to the taxpayer and economy in general.  He also said troubled developers should not be allowed to use taxpayers&rsquo; funds to gamble on resurrection.  He has a great way with words and I agree with him entirely.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>Managing distressed assets needs expertise and the belief is the NTMA can source this expertise, even if it does not have it already.  At the meeting today, which Senator MacSharry touched on already, I asked about the timeframe.  I understood the Resolution Trust Corporation, created in the United States in 1989, lasted until 1995, which was a short period.  Mr. McDonagh, the chief executive of NAMA, referred to the fact he expected NAMA would be in place for ten to 15 years.  Given that we have a tradition in this country of not being able to stick to our budgets, timeframes and schedules I wonder whether we are wise to set out a ten to 15 year timeframe for the agency.  It looks as though NAMA will be in place forever.  The timespan for the Resolution Trust Corporation, RTC, in the United States turned out to be only five and a half years.  The Minister gave me a competent answer to the effect the rush to get things done within five and a half years was the reason for the $90 billion loss that the RTC made.  I hope nothing like that will happen with NAMA.</P>
        <P>Another query I had was about where we would find people with the expertise to work with NAMA.  The chief executive of NAMA gave an efficient reply to the effect the agency sees itself using the support of the banks and that it will employ only approximately 30 to 40 people. <Col N="680"/> That gives me some confidence we will not end up employing a corresponding figure to the 9,000 that were employed in RTC in the United States.</P>
        <P>On the other hand, given the restriction we have placed on the amount bankers can earn, I am concerned about the ability to employ suitable people.  The restriction is understandable but my query is whether we are likely to get the required expertise.  I am not sure we will be capable of doing so.  Sometimes one has to pay to get the right help.  We should be careful not to place restrictions on those who will work in NAMA if we want to achieve the right results.</P>
        <P>Clearing the bank balance sheets will allow bank management to concentrate on its core business, namely, lending to small and medium-sized businesses, as well as to large businesses.  We must consider what has been done in other countries.  A different problem is evident in Germany where a bad bank was created.  Property was not the problem there, it was financial tools.  Germany may well be able to solve that with a bad bank as opposed to what we are doing.</P>
        <P>Senator MacSharry referred to the example of Indonesia.  The International Monetary Fund, IMF, pointed out that it approves of the way we are going about things and setting up NAMA.  It said that is the sort of action that was taken in Indonesia, which had a much bigger problem, but it solved it on the same basis as we are doing with NAMA.  Mr. Seelig of the IMF approves of NAMA.  He compared it with what was achieved in Indonesia in 1997.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The German approach of setting up a bad bank would not suit this country, as the German problem is different to ours.  It is due to toxic financial products, not property loans.  The other banking crisis was in Japan in the early 1990s and the government there did not do anything at first.  The crisis did not get resolved and the country went from having a healthy economy to ten years or more of stagnation before it introduced a NAMA-type organisation.  However, it was too late in the day to achieve its aims.</P>
        <P>We discussed the Ombudsman and freedom of information in the previous debate.  I mentioned to the Minister of State that there was a great air of transparency about what was done in Finland and Sweden.  We do not seem to have that here because the freedom of information legislation does not apply to this issue.  The Minister of State said he would give it serious consideration.  We will see whether there is a benefit to be had from that and whether he will do it.</P>
        <P>Earlier today I was still doubtful about whether setting up NAMA was the right way to go.  I am now of the opinion that the Government is going in the correct direction.  It is following the clear, concise and articulate explanation of Dr. Peter Bacon&rsquo;s suggestion on the setting up of NAMA.  He was supported in that by Professor Alan Ahearne.  Those two men, along with their team, were able to combat the long list of academics who had written to the newspapers to say it was the wrong way to go.</P>
        <P>I wish to inform Senator Coghlan of the Fine Gael Party that I was also impressed by Deputy Bruton who attended the committee meeting this morning.  He said he wanted to query the setting up of NAMA but he did so in a positive manner.  He outlined the alternatives.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>He is always constructive.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>He is.  He was very positive.  He talked about the alternatives but he seemed to support the Government&rsquo;s approach.  He did not necessarily say he supported it, but he said he understood what the Minister was doing and asked about it in a logical way.</P>
        <P>There is a widespread view that NAMA will estimate the long-term value of the banks at &euro;90 billion worth of development loans and that it will value them at somewhere between &euro;60 billion to &euro;70 billion.  Under this scheme NAMA would pay &euro;63 billion for the loans with the <Col N="681"/>banks able to get back the &euro;7 billion difference if it turns out that the loans have value.  Much thought has gone into NAMA and many questions have been asked about it.  I am not sure why it is taking so long to set it up.  Dr. Michael Somers had queries last week that must have sent shivers up those who listened to him.  I am now supportive of NAMA.  The Minister seemed to have an open mind today about taking suggestions into account to ensure it is even better controlled than it might otherwise have been.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, despite the fact it is perfectly clear the action is elsewhere.  The fact has already been referred to that there was an important committee meeting earlier today.  Although I completely accept that the Minister of State is a highly intelligent and gifted contributor, both as a Senator and as a Minister of State, even though he is almost as irritating as I am&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>That would not be possible.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;the real action and decision making will be done by the Minister and advisers such as Dr. Peter Bacon.  I was unable to attend this morning&rsquo;s meeting but I corresponded a little with Dr. Bacon.  I asked him when the idea of setting up NAMA first arose.  He said the report was submitted to the Minister on 20 March 2009.  I mooted the idea of a somewhat similar agency, the national property management agency, on 10 February 2009.  One can note the etymological closeness of the two agencies.  I returned to the idea on 5 March and 9 April without attracting any great interest.  My proposal was considerably more radical than what is currently being set up.  I suggested we need to be much more radical.  We need to be less obsessed with the market.  The Minister of State referred to market forces, as did Professor Ahearne.  I will return to that matter.</P>
        <P>I am not an economist.  Perhaps my ideas are all over the place &mdash; I do not know &mdash; but in broad outline they might attract some interest and could be considered.  My expertise was analysing language.  In an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> on 25 April Professor Ahearne referred to the dangers of nationalising banks.  A cluster of language occurs in the centre of his article around the word &ldquo;market&rdquo;.  That word appears six times in two short paragraphs.  The Minister has a similar swarm but it is not quite as intense.  This obsession with the markets is incorrect, in particular because the Government is never prepared to let the market operate anyway.  The Government protects the banks against the operation of the markets.  The banks are out of the marketplace as they have made a comprehensive balls of it.  They invested in the Irish National Insurance Company.  There was the Rusnak affair.  The banks overcharged clients and defrauded them.  They advised clients to take immoral decisions involving tax evasion.  The minute the market clamps down, the banks may clamp down on private householders but as sure as blazes they will not be allowed to clamp down on the market because the minute market forces operate, banks are not allowed go to the wall.  The biggest mistake the Yanks made was not to let Lehman Brothers go down.  We would not have suffered everything we have suffered if they had let it go, yet they paid for it.</P>
        <P>I am interested that there is not a single figure from beginning to end in what the Minister of State said.  We simply do not know what we are going to pay.  In a previous debate I referred to this as flubber, namely, that volatile, uncontrollable green stuff from a film of the same name.  The banks seem to be full of it.  I was suggesting that the banks be nationalised.  The whole lot of them should be nationalised and put into one bank called &ldquo;The Bank of Ireland&rdquo;.  That would solve a certain number of problems.  We should not worry about the international market response, because it could not possibly be worse.  Our banks are valued at virtually nothing.  They have had a huge collapse in their value.  What are we rescuing?  We own most <Col N="682"/>of them anyway.  We should collapse them altogether.  We can drain out the toxic assets and put them into a bad bank if we want a second bank.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State spoke about an asset management agency approach.  We should sequester the tangible assets, by which I mean the land, and manage them in the interests of the people of Ireland.  People have recently been stating that property speculators will gang up together and take legal advice, but I say &ldquo;to hell with them&rdquo;.  I do not believe they stand a chance in the courts, although they might waste money.  It is always possible to do that.  The Constitution may vindicate the rights of private property and we have heard that again with regard to religious orders.  Nobody seems to have taken on either of these corrupt institutions, despite the fact that the governing clause deals with the public interest.</P>
        <P>Let us send the National Asset Management Agency Bill to the President.  We only need two thirds of the Seanad to do so and we can then get it proofed against any challenge by having her refer it to the constitutional court.  That will save a lot of money on lawyers&rsquo; fees.  I do not accept that is a difficulty.  The Minister of State talks about an asset management agency, but a toxic debt is not an asset.</P>

	<P>We are not protecting the taxpayer.  The Minister of State has given us no indication on the situation regarding the money.  There has been a great number of tragedies and repossessions.  The chief executive officer of Aer Arann, P&aacute;draig &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh, was on my radio programme on Newstalk at the weekend.  He has a turnover of &euro;100 million, and after all the money that has already been pumped into the banks to prop them up, he told me he cannot get &euro;100 from them.</P>
        <P>I spoke about physical assets such as property and land banks.  We should complete the half finished buildings, get the workforce back out there to work on them in a spirit of co-operation and provide homes for people who need them.  We should also provide allotments for people who are out of work to grow vegetables and do something positive and constructive with their lives.  That is my radical suggestion.  We should nationalise the banks, create one bank with a decent reputation and have a national property management agency to manage land banks rather than toxic assets.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Senator John Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the proposal on the National Asset Management Agency.  I am conscious of the fact that the media will allow a view  to be represented that the Government is going to bail out the banks, and will mention five or seven different areas where money is vitally needed.  Do they really think that the Government, with so many political minds, has had collective amnesia?  I admire some people for their political nous and their instinct to see around corners.  Do we really think that if it was not absolutely necessary to ensure the survival of our banking system, the Government would have taken the course of action that it did?  The &euro;7 billion was necessary and it meant that other necessary projects had to be forgone.  Those projects forgone included positive developments in the constituencies of the representatives involved.</P>
        <P Just="Left">No matter what Government was in power, there was no doubt but that money had to be put into the banking sector.  The banking sector is similar to the human body.  It needs a blood supply and that is credit.  That was completely drying up because confidence was gone and <Col N="683"/>there were non-performing assets, and the world situation made it more difficult to borrow.  The Government has ensured, through the National Asset Management Agency, an orderly development of Ireland&rsquo;s current situation.  It has ensured that the banks will have liquidity.  There have been and still are difficulties with that liquidity, but, notwithstanding that, without the absolutely necessary course that the Government took, our banks would be in a very difficult situation at the moment.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Further analysis shows that there is a probability that this asset agency can take the long view, something which the banks cannot do.  It can watch for developments that can take place within the property sector over the next ten or 15 years.  The Government is not without resources.  Once we have taken control of the assets, would it not be prudent for the Government, as a major holder of property in the State, to reduce the tax on the purchase of property?  If it is reduced to 2%, it could stimulate that sector.  The Government will also have the ability, when the world economy picks up, to increase mortgage interest relief, possibly even doubling it at top marginal rates.  As we have become a major holder of property, we now have a vested interest in ensuring that the orderly disposal of that property is aided by what the Government is in a position to do at any particular time.</P>
        <P>The Indonesian model has been mentioned as an ideal model for the Irish situation.  That may well be the case, but I would also refer to the Swedish model.  The director general of the Confederation of Swedish Enterprise, who was previously Secretary of State at the Swedish Ministry for Finance, has given us some indicators of what we should do.  He is in favour of the National Asset Management Agency.  He stated that if an economy is hit by a financial crisis, the most important step is to maintain liquidity in the banking system and to prevent the system from collapsing.</P>
        <P>The prompt and transparent handling of the banking sector problem is also important.  Terms for recapitalisation should be such as to avoid moral hazard problems.  Such problems have been avoided because, despite what the Opposition has stated and despite the undermining of the Government&rsquo;s work, the National Asset Management Agency was not put in place to bail out friends of Fianna F&aacute;il or anybody in that category.  However, those statements did us harm internationally.  The reality is that it was an absolutely necessary step at that time and it remains necessary.</P>
        <P>The director general of the Confederation of Swedish Enterprise also mentioned that a government&rsquo;s budget and monetary conditions can help to mitigate the economy&rsquo;s tendencies.  In other words, we must make sure that we do not go into a deeper recession.  I suggest that it is now down to looking at how the National Asset Management Agency will operate.  It appears that the banks will use Government bonds issued by the NTMA as collateral for the purchase of the assets, some of which are toxic.  The important point is that not all assets purchased will be toxic.</P>
        <P>It appears that management of the loans, which is an important portfolio, will be undertaken by the banks.  This is prudent because the loans were originally undertaken by the banks.  As well as this, staff at the banks will be rotated to ensure people who issued the loans will not deal with management of the securitised assets.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A total of &euro;90 billion before writedown is expected.  It is important to point out that there is to be an extensive writedown to real value.  The point has been made that this is likely to result in a further draw from the banks, but that makes prudent sense.  Were we to find in ten years&rsquo; time that the banks had substantially regained their strength and were profitable but the Government in the form of the National Asset Management Agency found itself short, it would be correct for the legislation to allow us to revisit the banks to ensure we obtained recompense for any balance outstanding.  We are assured at every stage of a strong possibility of getting a <Col N="684"/>return.  In light of the experience of the Swedish model, it is distinctly possible, with world trends, that a profit will be made.  I look forward to the day that happens.  It appears that the loan books of the banks are such that many of the loans are of the bespoke variety.  Each of these loans will have to be examined to ensure fair value is achieved.  There may be a substantial readjustment of the underlying agreement in the asset value.  This will take time.</P>
        <P>The National Asset Management Agency has requested assistance and advice on how to proceed.  I believe it has received 600 applications of financial advice, including from the international sector, which is welcome.  The agency will have a workforce of between 30 and 40 people, including senior managers, asset managers, corporate finance and legal staff and a supervisory panel.  It will be run tightly and cost-effectively.</P>
        <P>The National Asset Management Agency will be a good and properly constructed subsidiary of the successful National Treasury Management Agency, ensuring it operates within strict guidelines, to the highest standard and is provided by a minimum number of people.  This agency will not become a major industry, rather it will be maintained as a cottage industry with the majority of gains accruing to the State.  Based on the Indonesian and Swedish models it is reasonable to assume we will see a profit from this venture at some stage.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Calleary, to the House and wish him well in his Ministry. I welcome the opportunity to discuss the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, and to hear the progress the Government has made on it.  I did not hear the contribution of the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, but, like Senator MacSharry, I attended part of the informative meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service today.  I regret I could not attend the full meeting.</P>
        <P>We are greatly concerned that our banking system is not functioning properly because it is clogged with impaired property loans.  Until this is resolved, we will not have a functioning banking system to ensure a proper flow of credit to the economy, the lack of which is impeding our recovery.  The banks urgently need a clean bill of health.  Their balance sheets must be strengthened and uncertainty about bad debts must be removed.  While Fine Gael&rsquo;s approach differs from that of Government, we are equally concerned that whatever model is provided for in legislation succeeds in the national interest.  It is intended that the NAMA model will allow the agency to buy from the banks at a significant discount through the issue of Government bonds.  Our primary concern is that the transfer of these development related loans to NAMA will protect taxpayers&rsquo; interests.  All decisions on development projects and lands for which these loans were made available must be made not in the interests of developers or bankers but in the best interests of taxpayers.</P>
        <P>It was good to hear at the committee meeting that the National Treasury Management Agency has moved to acquire professional advice in all the fields in which it will be required.  It is hoped once bank balance sheets have been cleaned, banks will be able to refocus their efforts and operations on lending to small and medium sized businesses and home owners.</P>
        <P>Many commentators are fond of attaching the word &ldquo;toxic&rdquo; to bank debt.  Our problem relates to impaired property loans, not sub-prime financial products and other mortgage-like securities and so on.  It is hoped the NAMA legislation will be ready quickly to provide for a speedy restoration of normal banking activity.  I understand the guaranteed banks will be asked to establish subsidiary companies to administer the transfer of their property loans to NAMA and that NAMA will have a staff of between 20 and 40 people.</P>
        <P>It was disturbing that Dr. Michael Somers, when he was before the Committee of Public Accounts last week, had occasion to express negative sentiments about NAMA, which comments were discussed previously in the House.  Presumably, these difficulties have been or are <Col N="685"/>being worked through.  The National Treasury Management Agency will house the National Asset Management Agency.  It is important these two agencies speak with one voice.</P>
        <P>I am informed that approximately 5,000 bank staff across the various institutions are dealing with the management of these loans.  It is hoped they will continue to be available to engage in this work, perhaps on rotation, subject to direction by NAMA.  As mentioned by another speaker, rotation of staff will be important given the intimate knowledge of some officials of the individuals to whom the loans were given.  It is understood the Bank of Ireland has assigned staff to a separate company to manage its development loan book and associated borrowings in readiness for transfer to NAMA, which will deal first with Allied Irish Banks followed by Bank of Ireland and the Educational Building Society.</P>
        <P>A major issue is the charge banks will be able to levy on NAMA by way of administration fee for the daily management of these loans.  We need to hear more of the range of discounts provided for in the European Commission guidelines on impaired assets.  The land and development loans of the guaranteed institutions is estimated to be of the order of &euro;60 billion with inter-linked land and development loans estimated to be an estimated additional &euro;20 billion to &euro;30 billion.  We are told these include performing and non-performing loans.  Government bonds will be issued for these which the banks may use as collateral to avail of European Central Bank funding.</P>
        <P>NAMA, rather than a bank, will be a company managing property assets for best return to the taxpayer and Exchequer.  NAMA&rsquo;s advantage in managing this asset portfolio will be that it can take a ten to 15-year view to ensure optimal return in terms of realised value of the assets.  Many questions arise in this regard, one of which is, if NAMA is to rely on existing bank staff, which makes sense, is it necessary to transfer such a sizeable loan book when NAMA will have the safety net of being able to recoup by way of levy on the financial institutions?</P>
        <P>We are led to believe the development of NAMA is proceeding well in parallel with the preparation of the necessary legislation and that the covered institutions are co-operating fully.  The steering group is meeting on a regular basis to address the various legislative issues and we learned this morning the draft heads of a Bill will be ready in two to three weeks, with publication planned for July.  We welcome the Government&rsquo;s decision to recall the Houses to deal with the legislation expeditiously.</P>
        <P>One of the difficulties with the borrowers whose loans are to be transferred is that many are involved with several institutions, some of which are outside the scope of NAMA.  Again, however, we are assured everything will be done on a properly commercial basis to protect the interest of taxpayers.  NAMA will liaise with the uncovered financial institutions in regard to these borrowers.</P>
        <P>The valuation method and discounts applied to the loans will be difficult to calculate.  The level of discount to be applied is not known at present.  The European Commission requires that each loan is assessed and valued individually.  Our property market has undergone a substantial readjustment and may yet fall further.  The Commission requires that valuations are conducted on the basis of current market value where possible but in our present circumstances it is not possible to arrive at a meaningful market value.  The Commission has indicated it is prepared to accept a transfer value which reflects the longer term economic value of assets as an acceptable benchmark.  This is one of the most basic issues to be decided by the steering group and I understood it is in discussions with the Commission on this and other important matters.  We are told the steering group must ensure its proposals are totally consistent with EU rules on state aid and the treatment of impaired assets.</P><Col N="686"/>
        <P>Regardless of our differences over methods and models, I welcome that NAMA will be able to choose among the options of proceeding by early disposal, holding for market improvements or developing projects to enhance returns.  If necessary, it will be able to enter into joint ventures, partnerships and special purpose vehicles.  This flexibility will be important to achieving the objectives of optimising returns to taxpayers and securing the interests of the Exchequer.  While banks will administer the loans, all key decisions will be made centrally by NAMA.  It is vitally important it maintains control at all times because we can no longer afford &mdash; I hesitate to use the word &mdash; cronyism.  I wish the new body well if it is the way to proceed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LarryButler"><NameTxt>Senator Larry Butler</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State.  It is important we introduce legislation at the earliest opportunity to get NAMA up and running.  We all agree our banks are not functioning properly.  Complaints are made by every sector of business about the unavailability of credit and we cannot sustain further delay in this regard.  I am glad the Seanad will return over the summer to deal with this legislation.</P>
        <P>However, we must also be prudent in ensuring we are careful in preparing the complex legislation required for NAMA.  The Labour Party and other commentators have proposed nationalising the banks, thereby putting taxpayers at greater risk.  I do not understand where they are coming from because nationalising banks will require taxpayers to assume all the risks.  What about the people who invested in banks to fund their pensions?  The Government also has a responsibility to these people.  It is important, therefore, that we do not nationalise the banks.  It is fair to say that nationalised banks do not work well.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s investments in the banks have recouped &euro;1 billion in profits in the past week alone.  I do not think anybody has picked that up.  It will recoup a further &euro;500 million from the bank guarantee scheme.  The Government has made wise investments in this regard.</P>
        <P>In ensuring NAMA works for the benefit of the country, we must ensure it does not put people out of business.  Its function is to take non-performing loans from the banks to allow them to do what they do best.  Once it is established, it will have to ensure these non-performing debts are made to work.  One of the better ways of doing this is by working with those who have invested in the properties concerned.  It is a given that some developers will be unable to remain in business but if we want development in this country to continue, we will have to work closely with them.  It is not the function of NAMA or the Government to put people out of business.  On the contrary, it is vital we keep them in operation.</P>
        <P>Previous speakers have referred to land values.  Land will always remain a valuable commodity.  It is a particularly scarce resource in urban areas.  It is important to bear in mind that 30% of the land in question is located overseas.  I recently spoke with a UK based businessman who is familiar with property matters.  He is of the opinion the property business has started to move significantly.  That is an encouraging sign in terms of NAMA&rsquo;s potential for making profits.  Even though land may be cheaper, the cost to build per square foot is not much lower.  A company might build a 2,000 sq. ft. house a little cheaper but the cost of materials has not reduced substantially, which is an important issue.</P>
        <P>As we become land holders, Senator Hanafin is correct that we must examine the stamp duty implications.  It is important to do so to encourage investment and demand.  Many people are staying out of the property market and not even changing houses, as they normally would for many reasons such as increase in the size of the family or the house becoming too big for them, leading them to trade down.  However, 2% of something is worth more than 100% of nothing.  The market is not performing and it must be encouraged to grow again.</P><Col N="687"/>
        <?oasys _cl13.5- ?><P Just="Left">The agency must be careful when writing down the toxic and bad loans.  If they are evaluated carefully, it will go a long way to ensure NAMA&rsquo;s success in the future.  Before the agency is set up, will the Minister ensure monthly reports are issued by the Government-nominated directors on the boards of banks regarding lending to small and medium-sized businesses?  They are being squeezed and while taking two or three months to enact the relevant legislation may not seem long to us, it will probably be the difference between a company staying in business and going out of business.  If that is not taken into consideration, many more people will be on the dole, which is not the Government&rsquo;s function.  Our function is to create jobs and NAMA represents an opportunity to ensure our land bank works for us for the future.</P>
        <P>I commend the Minister&rsquo;s proposal.  Senator MacSharry provided an extremely good outline of where we are going with NAMA.  I did not have an opportunity to attend the meeting of the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service earlier but he is convinced it is the way forward.  Senator Quinn, who is a respected businessman with a great deal of experience, is also convinced this is the correct way to go.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Senator Joe O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I pushed hard for the debate because at the time I thought there was a need for discussion of the different views put forward, particularly by Fine Gael, the Labour Party and consultants outside the House.  I listened with some fascination to the entire proceedings of the joint committee and the debate was exactly what should have taken place a month ago.  It was a superb meeting.  It was a classic example of how joint committees should work and how they can give added value to politics.  The meeting highlighted the confidence and knowledge base on which the proposal is built and people with worries should have gained a great deal of reassurance.</P>
        <P>However, the Government seems to shoot itself in the foot every time it turns around.   A list of frequently asked questions relating to NAMA should be put together and made available on the Department of Finance&rsquo;s website to deal with much of the nonsense uttered recently about the proposal.  I welcomed the idea of us owning the land at the beginning because, like Senator Butler, I would like to feel at the end of the day that we owned it, but I pointed out there were issues I did not understand.  I could not understand them because they were not explained.</P>
        <P>Many important issues were clarified this morning.  A steering group was set up and Dr. Bacon stated on a number of occasions that on a daily basis he is in contact formally and informally with the NTMA, NAMA and the Central Bank regarding the financial side.  That is important in light of the way many Members responded to the comments of Dr. Michael J. Somers at a recent meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts.  Issues still need to be clarified but there seems to be a lack of communication between the bodies concerned.  I pay tribute to the solid performance of the Fine Gael team at the meeting.  They put questions, dealt with issues and engaged with the witnesses.  Deputy Richard Bruton was very impressive.</P>
        <P>It is crucial that we examine what kind of banks we want in the future.  I acknowledge that is difficult to do now as we try to sort out the current structure but a number of fail-safe measures should be built into the system.  Banks should not be allowed to become so large that they can hold the country to ransom or stifle the country&rsquo;s development by not allowing cash to flow or whatever.  It must be ensured they operate as banks.  Even if they take on insurance arms and so on, they should be regulated as banks.</P>
        <P>We have had long discussions in this House.  It is easy to look down on the regulators and comment on how bad they were etc.  They were as good as we allowed or wanted them to be because the minute they got in the way of people doing their business or created more paperwork, there was huge opposition to them.  When the Central Bank increased the tier 1 capital requirement of financial institutions in January 2008, the banks, in particular, Anglo Irish Bank, kicked up about it, stating that it would create difficulties.</P><Col N="688"/>
        <P>The Minister must examine new ways to capitalise banks.  Instead of setting a figure for the capital a bank must have as an asset base to cover its loans, it must be recognised the figure can fluctuate.  It can go down in good times and up in bad times.  How can good and bad times be measured?  The level of risk attaching to loans can be measured in a simple way.  If one runs a business, builds up debt and does not repay it on time, one can sell it to a debt collector or through various different financial instruments.  The market measurement of one&rsquo;s risk is what one pays for it.  The same mechanism applied to the Government&rsquo;s sale of bonds last week.  The State has to pay a higher price than Germany for borrrowings, which is a measure of the risk of the country.  The banks can do the same.  On that basis, the regulator should be in a position to demand additional capital.  If the bank does not provide it, the regulator should have the opportunity to take over the bank, which would happen at an earlier stage.  That is what we have to look at in future.</P>
        <P>How will valuation work?  I do not know but I heard additional information to the effect that it will be measured on the basis of current value and predicted value.  I know this is the length of a piece of string but that is not the point.  This is thinking in the right direction to the effect that if results do not meet the predictions, a clawback from the banks will be sought.</P>
        <P>Senator Butler commented on building costs, which are a crucial part of valuation.  If an auctioneer 30 years ago wanted to value a bungalow a mile outside a town or work out how much it would cost to build one, he or she knew pretty well the cost of a half-acre site and would go within 15% either way of that.  He or she knew the cost of the building materials, the point made by Senator Butler, and the cost of building, which is the cost to pay people to turn the materials into a house and the profits on top of that.  In those simple days of old it was one third, one third and one third.  If one multiplied the price of a site by three, that was more or less the cost of a house in those days.</P>
        <P>This has changed but one factor that is still quite solid is the cost of the materials.  We can consider various aspects of a building in Ballsbridge but we could work out a two-thirds valuation of it because we know how much it would cost to build it and we know the cost of materials used to build it.  It is interesting that a figure is beginning to emerge without anybody saying it for the cost of the &euro;80 billion, &euro;85 billion or &euro;90 billion of between one half and two-thirds.  It may not come to that but it is not a bad starting point and is sensible.  This is what emerged from what was said by the Minister, Mr. McDonagh and Mr. Bacon at the meeting of the joint committee today, from what the Minister said on &ldquo;The Week In Politics&rdquo; over the weekend and from what the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, said in this debate.</P>
        <P>Will constitutional issues arise from building in a clawback?  I do not see it as long as it is included as a condition now.  Let us remember the discussion we had earlier on the deal with the congregations in 2002 and allow flexibility to deal with what the Americans would call a &ldquo;known unknown&rdquo;.  We would sign off in the knowledge that were an unknown value not to reach a certain level, a clawback would come into play.  There is no constitutional problem if we enter into it on that basis.</P>
        <P>Whereas NAMA will not be in the business of liquidating the assets and selling them off in car boot sales or fire sales, it will none the less take control of them and the collateral assets that have been put in place.  This is a relief.  Ordinary people do not realise what is going on and this is why the Government has a job to do.  It needs to explain to people that this is not handing money to the banks but about taking control of the debts and managing them properly and sensibly that will not cost too much or more than is necessary and will allow us to claw back so we do not lose anything.</P>
        <P>Through all the various criticisms that have been made of the Government I have said consistently that I am watching closely and do not think the Government has made more mistakes than any other Government and, in fact, has spent and risked less.  The US Govern<Col N="689"/>ment has put $1 trillion into its banking system and has made no progress.  Our plans are in a more solid position than the US economy.  I would be more confident, secure and comfortable with what we propose to do than what has been done in the United States so far.</P>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;because for the past few months he has been unaware we were to take over the good loans the banks had as well as the bad loans.

      <Speaker pid="MarkDaly"><NameTxt>Senator Mark Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>He did not know that and he has been giving out about NAMA and the Government&rsquo;s policy over recent months since we introduced the concept.  When one discusses the Labour Party as the alternative government along with Fine Gael, it is well to be aware that not only are its members not reading the fine print, they are not reading the big print either.</P>
        <P>NAMA has come about because of the situation with the banks and we have to be aware that originally the Labour Party, which is led by Deputy Gilmore, did not want us to guarantee the money of deposit holders.  It did not want us to introduce the legislation and voted against it.  Fine Gael&rsquo;s policy is diametrically opposed to that of the Labour Party, which many authorities, financial observers, economists and the European Union stated would have led to us paying quite enormous sums because of our borrowing requirements from the EU and bond holders.</P>
        <P>When we are considering leadership, Senator O&rsquo;Toole has been gracious enough to acknowledge that the Government has taken enormous risks on whether we would guarantee the deposit holders.  Initially it was up to &euro;100,000 and then it was all deposits.  That was a bold step criticised by many and was eventually followed by the Germans.  Even though Chancellor Angela Merkel criticised us on the Tuesday she was doing it herself within a wet week.</P>

If it is seen that we are giving too much, the cry will go out from the media that we are trying to give money to the developers when we should be giving them less.  There are a number of valuation methods on which I am sure Senator Coghlan could educate the House far more than I.  The comparison method is no longer viable because land is not selling.  Retail property sales do not count.  We do not have any comparison valuations to go on because the last real sales were a number of years ago.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MarkDaly"><NameTxt>Senator Mark Daly</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">There are guidelines but do we employ an army of valuers to go around the country trying to value these properties?  We cannot give a &ldquo;one size fits all&rdquo; valuation because the valuation for undeveloped development land will not be the same as for commercial property on Grafton Street but we must come up with some method because we cannot afford to spend millions of euro on valuers&rsquo; fees and go property by property, house by house, land parcel by land parcel, and development land by development land until we have all these reports.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As Senators Coghlan and MacSharry are aware, auctioneering and valuations is an art form as opposed to a science and if the method is not entirely transparent accusations will be made that we are trying to bail out developers.  Labour has said we are bailing out the developers, but we are not bailing out anybody.  As Senator O&rsquo;Toole pointed out, we are taking over the assets.  We will give money in exchange for that but when we realise the value of those assets and we subsequently get money for those, if there is a difference between what we have given the developer or the bank in the first instance and what we have realised, we will claw back the difference from the bank.</P>
        <P>The objective is to get NAMA to work properly by giving correct and accurate valuations because we can then get the banks to work properly.  In the event that there is a shortfall to <Col N="691"/>the taxpayer in terms of what we initially give the banks, we will make up for that shortfall by going back to the banks and either getting shares, as the Minister pointed out, or realising it in cash.</P>
        <P>In a real sense NAMA is a consequence of what happened to the banks, but Labour was against guaranteeing the loans.  Labour is against the formation of NAMA.  Labour is against everything.  It does not appear to be for anything.  It is never positive.  It talks about job losses but it does not have any plan.  All its Members are probably out canvassing because their voting record is fairly poor too, as Senator Coghlan is well aware.</P>
        <P>Our main issue is getting the banks to work.  They are not working and NAMA is a huge step in the right direction.  It is a risk, as Senator O&rsquo;Toole pointed out.  Other countries have taken the risks and have profited, but it takes years.  We will not see profit from many of the assets we will acquire in the next 12 months, 24 months or even five years.  It might take ten years or more but in that time our banks will be back working and as a result our economy will be back working and we will get our people back to work.</P>

	<P>I thank Senators for their contributions on this most important policy initiative for the banking sector.  I welcome the fact that Senators have generally been very positive in their comments, with many benefiting from discussions this morning in the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service, with the interim managing director, Brendan McDonagh, Dr. Peter Bacon and the Minister for Finance.</P>
        <P>I assure Senators that the extensive preparatory work required, both legislative and practical, is progressing well and will be completed before NAMA is formally established on a statutory basis.</P>
        <P>I would like to address a number of the points made by Senators throughout the course of the debate.  First I reiterate in the strongest possible terms that the Government has at all stages in the process based its decisions on advice from the Central Bank, the Financial Regulator and the National Treasury Management Agency.  The Government has also received technical, legal and financial advice as required.</P>
        <P>The core concern has been the destabilising effect of risky assets on the balance sheets of Irish banks.  The Government commissioned Dr. Peter Bacon to examine the potential approaches available to it in dealing with those risky assets.  Following receipt of Dr. Bacon&rsquo;s report, the consensus among all stakeholders and advisers was that the establishment of an asset management agency was the most effective method of dealing with risky assets and ensuring the flow of credit to the real economy.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The State&rsquo;s primary interest is not to meet the needs of distressed developers or bankers but to ensure that householders can access credit for home loans and consumer credit, that small and medium sized businesses can fund their enterprises, that deposit holders have confidence that their money is secure and protected and that international investors are satisfied about the stability of our banking system.  That objective is best served by dealing quickly and comprehensively with the risky assets that are weighing down the balance sheets of our banks.</P>
        <P>Senators queried the progress being made on the legislation necessary to establish NAMA and govern its operation.  I noted in my opening contribution that a steering group had been established comprising the NTMA, the Department of Finance and the Attorney General&rsquo;s office.  The group meets up to twice weekly to consider a range of issues that will need to be addressed as part of the draft National Asset Management Agency Bill.  It is expected the draft <Col N="692"/>heads of the Bill will be ready in the coming weeks and that the Bill, subject to Government approval, will be published in July.</P>
        <P>The Bill will necessarily be complex, not least because of the potential difficulties that will need to be addressed from operational, legal and constitutional perspectives, but as has been emphasised by the Minister for Finance on a number of occasions, we will take the necessary time in our preparation stage to get it right.</P>
        <P>Senator Twomey mentioned the number of staff that might be required by NAMA.  This matter was dealt with by some of the other speakers but it is an important issue.  Mr. McDonagh, the interim managing director of NAMA, is giving initial consideration to the proposal that NAMA should be a division within the NTMA of about 30 to 40 staff, possibly based around a core of senior managers supervising panels of external service providers.  The core staff would include property asset managers whose job it would be to make recommendations as to disposal or development of any properties that NAMA ends up with.  Their advice on how to achieve the optimal return on NAMA loan and property assets would be based on well informed knowledge of the markets.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The question of the valuation of transferred assets has also been discussed and there was much discussion on the discount, or haircut, to be applied to the book value of such loans when they are transferred to NAMA.  Senators should note that it is not possible at this stage to determine what that discount will be as it is dependent on such a wide range of factors and the fact that each loan will have to be assessed and valued individually.  It is also expected that many of the loans will be distinctive, with differing legal documentation.  Furthermore, European Commission requirements will have to be met.</P>
        <P>An immediate priority for the steering group is to ensure that its proposals in regard to not only valuation methodology but also eligibility criteria for institutions and asset classes are consistent with EU rules.  The Department of Finance continues to maintain a close dialogue with the European Commission.</P>
        <P>Recruiting the necessary expertise for the NAMA project represents an important challenge to the steering group and the NAMA interim management.  Senators may be aware that the NTMA recently tendered for banking and advisory services during the preparatory phase pending the establishment of NAMA on a statutory basis.  There was a huge level of interest in this tender with over 600 expressions of interest.  The NTMA will now assess the applicants and will have expert support in place in early June.  Having the necessary expertise is a critical success factor for NAMA, ensuring that it meets its goal of ensuring a maximum return for the taxpayer.</P>
        <P>Some speakers also referred to developers and borrowers and their likely treatment by NAMA.  The Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach made clear on a number of occasions that borrowers will have to continue to meet their obligations as normal.  Borrowers will owe NAMA the full amount they originally borrowed from the banks and there is no question of a bailout for any borrower.  NAMA will work constructively and professionally with all parties and stakeholders to achieve its objective of ensuring the optimal return for the Exchequer.  However, those unwilling to co-operate for whatever reason will face the full legal consequences available to NAMA to protect its interests.</P>
        <P>None of us would wish to be in the unprecedented situation in which we now find ourselves.  Failure to recognise and deal with the problems in our banking system is too costly to contemplate for this and future generations.  The Government&rsquo;s response to the banking crisis has been structured and decisive.  It is committed to taking whatever further steps are required to sustain the banking system and support economic recovery.  The task is challenging but with borrowers, lenders, the Government and NAMA working in a spirit of co-operation and in a <Col N="693"/>committed, commercial and professional manner, it is a task in which we are confident we can succeed.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>The last time I raised this issue was in December 2007.  The issue is the sub-committee on education and the arts under the Arts Act 2003.  I was Chairman of the Committee on Arts, Sport, Tourism, Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs when it dealt with the Arts Bill.  As a result of the Arts Act coming into force, the then Minister, Deputy John O&rsquo;Donoghue, agreed to establish sub-committees to examine special areas of interest.</P>
        <P>The first sub-committee formed examined the traditional arts.  I was pleased, as was Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute;, with the results of that sub-committee because it established not only the priority that should be given to the traditional arts but also a funding mechanism of &euro;3 million in that year.</P>
        <P>The second sub-committee, on arts and education, was established in 2004.  Its report was to have been finalised in May 2007.  I and many others involved in the arts consider the link between arts and education very important, especially now as we battle the economic recession and recognise the need for creative and entrepreneurial citizens who can add to the variety of employers and employees in our communities.  Last week at a Council of Europe meeting in Paris the OECD referred to the challenges in producing these entrepreneurs to assist us in emerging from the recession.  My point then and now was and is that the education system must be reformed internationally to encourage and support creative thought from the youngest ages instead of imparting facts and effectively smothering such free thinking and exploration that is found through engagement with the arts.  This is virtually ignored at a statutory level.</P>
        <P>However, I would say that, given my background as a musician.  I have researched the issue of how young people&rsquo;s involvement in music changes the shape of their brains and their ability to cope with life, education, co-ordination and many other core features of reality.  In later years, exposure to music gives them a better ability to cope with diseases and syndromes that might affect them as they grow older.  One cannot overstate the role of music in personal development.</P>
        <P>What has emerged from the sub-committee on arts and education?  What effort has been made to deliver a joint approach from the Arts Council, the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism, the Department of Education and Science and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment?  Until this sub-committee was formed, if one asked a question of the Minister for Education and Science about the arts, he or she would reply that it was a matter for the Arts Council and if one asked the same question of the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, he or she would reply that it was an education matter.  It went from Billy to Jack.  What I sought was a report that had the imprimatur and acceptance of both Departments.  What has been received to date, half way through 2009, as a result of the Arts Act of 2003?</P>
        <P>The Arts Council cannot impose its will on the education system.  At the same time, the education system, having produced various reports on the arts, cannot provide all the expertise needed for music education.  Music is supposed to be part of the curriculum in primary school and it is a subject in the leaving certificate examinations.  It provides an important opportunity for personal development for people like me.</P><Col N="694"/>
        <P>I declare again my interest in that I have a BMus, MPhil, PGCE, LTCL and as many letters as one probably would want.  Music provided me with a career opportunity and although it may not do so for everyone, it gives everyone the opportunity to improve their quality of life, now and in the future.</P>
        <P>It is vital not only for the arts but for forthcoming generations and their ability to live their lives in an imaginative and new manner that the results arrived at by the sub-committee, which was set up following a brave battle, are disclosed, published and pursued.  The Arts Council presented the former Minister and Deputy, the late S&eacute;amus Brennan, with the sub-committee report in 2007.  As the report had not yet been published it was deemed inappropriate to comment on its recommendations in December 2007 when I last raised this issue.  The special committee&rsquo;s remit was to make specific recommendations for implementation over three to five years.  Time is passing.</P>
        <P>I am aware that I will again hear great endorsements by the Departments of the key role of the arts in education, but surely it is time to engage seriously in delivering now, in association with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Forf&aacute;s and all the State agencies involved in job creation and the targeting of resources.  Is it not time to prioritise our primary and pre-primary children so their innovation will deliver change and not more of the same in years to come?</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister was considering the report in late 2007.  He intended to discuss it with his colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, and with the Arts Council.  The personnel involved have changed in that time.  The Minister&rsquo;s officials had bilateral discussions with the Department of Education and Science and the Arts Council.  All three parties were due to meet in early 2008 to discuss its recommendations in further detail.  Are those discussions ongoing?  Is it still premature for the Minister to comment further?  I believe it is time for action.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>I am replying on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, Deputy Martin Cullen.  I am pleased to have the opportunity provided by Senator Keaveney to deal with the matter.  I acknowledge her experience and expertise in the subject and that of the Acting Chairman, Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute;.</P>
        <P>This report, Points of Alignment, produced by the special committee on arts and education, under the auspices of the Arts Council, brought forward a number of comprehensive and thought-provoking recommendations.  The members of the special committee are to be congratulated on their considerable work in producing this document.  The report recommended, <i>inter alia</i>, the establishment of a national unit for education and the arts.  This was to be managed on an inter-agency basis to implement policy objectives and provide a range of services.  It was to support local networking, and monitor, research and inform best practice and policy-making.  The unit would also provide a website and promote virtual learning.  It would have a role in co-ordinating, promoting and funding the work of proposed new local arts area partnerships.</P>
        <P>The report envisaged the funding of these local partnerships to promote synergy between local authorities, vocational education committees, teachers, education centres, schools and third level colleges.  The vision set out in the report saw the introduction of an &ldquo;arts in education practice&rdquo; model.  This would involve skilled professionals working with schools, both within and outside of school.  Its aim would be to enrich the curriculum, by promoting best practice and quality in arts education in schools and by widening school-community links.  In addition, to complement and support these actions, the report recommended substantial increases in Arts Council funding and resources to support artists and arts organisations working in arts in education.</P><Col N="695"/>
        <P>When the arts and education committee was established, its terms of reference specifically required it to take account of the fact &ldquo;that the budgetary resources likely to be available over the next four years to the Minister for Education and Science for development of services in the education sector must be allocated to fund existing policy commitments&rdquo;.  Although the committee was established in 2006, the terms of reference were framed to take account of the competing needs for future investment in education.  These included the significant increases in enrolment due to demographic change, provision of new schools in developing areas, as well as integration and language supports for newcomer children.  The areas of combating educational disadvantage, investment in curriculum reform, professional development of teachers, investment in strategic research and innovation in higher education were also issues to be addressed.</P>
        <P>When the Points of Alignment report was finalised, the Department held a number of meetings with the Arts Council and the Department of Education and Science to examine how best the recommendations in the report could be progressed, taking account of the public expenditure constraints at that time.  While a range of proposals was considered for the embryonic establishment of an arts in education unit with modest staffing, it was not possible to reach agreement on the scale of the vision enshrined in the report.  Since then the budgetary difficulties have become acute and it is evident that new cost-increasing measures must be deferred for the foreseeable future.</P>
        <P>I am aware from our colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, that the State invests significantly in arts education at present.  Arts education &mdash; visual arts, music and drama &mdash; forms a significant part of the primary curriculum which has been rolled out in the period from 1999 to 2007.  The implementation of the arts curriculum was supported by comprehensive investment in professional development for teachers.</P>
        <P>Courses for craft and design and in music and art are integrated variously into the junior, leaving and leaving applied certificate cycles at post-primary level.  Transition year programmes also offer a variety of modules which stimulate pupils&rsquo; interest in the arts in general and which, in many cases, give them the opportunity, in their own classrooms and in other contexts, to interact with practising artists.</P>
        <P>In addition to supporting music in the curriculum a substantial additional allocation of teaching posts has been given to a range of vocational education committees to support music education.  This takes the form of individual tuition in instrumental and vocal music education and supports for choirs, orchestras and ensembles.  Through this, 68,000 hours of music tuition are provided annually.  This investment is supplemented through a series of summer programmes in the arts in disadvantaged schools, a music initiative under which schools in disadvantaged areas are given once-off funds to purchase or replace musical instruments, and two music network projects.</P>
        <P>It should be noted that within the constraints of the existing system, the education and arts sectors co-operate fully to ensure the optimal delivery of services.  The artists in schools guidelines issued to schools, which were developed by the Department of Education and Science and the Arts Council working in partnership, are an important resource in informing schools of how best to plan, implement and evaluate partnerships with local artists and organisations which will provide stimulating and interesting learning experiences for children.  They encapsulate the vision of arts in education practice which is set out in the points of alignment report.  The music network projects are also important examples of collaboration between VECs, schools, artists, local authorities and county and city development boards to add scale and synergy to provide increased access to arts education on a strategic area basis.</P>
        <P>We agree that giving the arts a higher and more consistent profile at primary and post-primary level can benefit the students concerned significantly and, ultimately, society.  It is important to stress that this applies to all students and not just those recognised as being gifted <Col N="696"/>artistically.  Given that, as is the case in sport, the future of the arts resides with our children, it is vital the arts are embedded at all levels in our education system.</P>
        <P>This debate is taking place owing to the significant investment made in recent years by the Government to the capital and everyday costs of the broad range of arts entities.  The Department has allocated &euro;90 million in the past five years towards the cost of providing vital arts and cultural infrastructure and venues for communities to present the arts in all their forms.  Complementary to this activity, the Arts Council&rsquo;s resources have increased exponentially from &euro;47.67 million in 2002 to more than &euro;73.35 million in 2009, which is approximately &euro;8 million less than last year.  The Arts Council has at pursued all times a policy of engaging with young people, whether through its specific programmes or by its support of organisations specialising in arts in education interventions, such as The Ark and Team in Dublin, and of theatrical groups.  These are signs of maturity in our arts role and the integration of the arts into every aspect of our society.  We intend, when resources permit, to revisit the proposed actions in this report.</P>
        <P>I am glad to have had the opportunity to give the Senator some detail on the state of play so that she knows how and where to proceed next in pursuing what are worthwhile recommendations.  I understand she will find the present state of play somewhat disappointing.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CeciliaKeaveney"><NameTxt>Senator Cecilia Keaveney</NameTxt>
	<P>I know I have a friend in the Minister of State.  He mentioned primary and post-primary education.  There is the new initiative of a free preschool year of early childhood care and education.  Our focus must be on the arts in pre-primary school and not just in primary and post-primary education.  I fully agree with arts for all; it is exactly my point.  However, how are we to get people to think about the arts for employment and not just the arts for arts&rsquo; sake?</P>
        <P>I could argue the issue of money all day.  If people were involved and gainfully employed in the arts or even with music therapy, we might not have to spend &euro;15 billion on health or more than &euro;20 million on social welfare.  We are talking about millions.  I know the Minister of State is on my side in this matter.  It is a question of how we can convince the establishment that the arts are central to life, life learning and development.  There are probably not enough hours left in the night to get an answer on it.  We need to keep plugging the battle against the norms.  I do not want the normal education.  I want a completely different education, but how do we start that?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>I make the point in almost every arts related speech I make that I am very conscious that an estimated 50,000 people are involved or employed in different arts organisations.  There is not a community in the country I have encountered in any town of any size that does not have many different arts activities.  More than half our tourism industry is what one might call culturally related, including heritage.  There are countries in Europe that may understand better than we do the economic importance of the arts from an employment and tourism industry point of view.  It also has an effect on people&rsquo;s morale and sense of identity, which is very important.  There is a better understanding of that than was the case 20 or 30 years ago, but considerable further progress remains to be made.  One still hears voices, political and otherwise, talking about the arts as if they were an optional extra.  They are very much not an optional extra.  They are needed as an integral part of national life.</P>
