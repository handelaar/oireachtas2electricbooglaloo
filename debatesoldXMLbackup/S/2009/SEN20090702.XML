	<P>I have received notice from Senator Kieran Phelan that on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to establish a task force in south Laois and to increase the support measures in light of the devastating job losses in Meadow Meats and Arcon mines.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen on the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, in light of the publication of the Ryan report, to explain the reason a family has not yet received justice and compensation further to the meeting of 30 June 2008 between the DUP, UUP and Sinn F&eacute;in politicians, the family and the Secretary General of his Department.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Eugene Regan on the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to ensure the application of section 258 of the Children Act 2001 in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na vetting procedures, by amending the Garda vetting application form to reflect the provisions of section 258 of that Act.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Paul Bradford on the following matter:</P>

        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Cecilia Keaveney on the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to comment on the importance, in his view, of media studies programmes ensuring that students today exposed to &ldquo;historical&rdquo; events spun by media channels with their own agendas, on a 24-hour basis, are helped evaluate what they hear in a critical manner.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Fidelma Healy Eames on the following matter:</P><Col N="610"/>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to advise whether the major capital programme or the devolved scheme is the preferred option for the delivery of the accommodation needs of a school in County Galway.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and have selected the matters raised by Senators Phelan, Mullen and Regan to be taken at the conclusion of business.

	<P>I seek an urgent debate in the House on the issue of social welfare fraud and the manner in which this issue is being raised in the media.  It is being reported that non-nationals are flying in here to collect social welfare benefits, but social welfare fraud is a wider problem.  There has been cross-Border social welfare fraud for years.  Irish people have been travelling to the United Kingdom to collect benefits there as well as collecting Irish benefits.  Considering the number of non-national people living here we must be careful that there is not a witch hunt of non-nationals because of our failure to police social welfare benefits.  Social welfare fraud has always been a serious matter and we need to be careful about how we report it so as not to engender a racist attitude towards non-nationals, of whom a large number live here.  I ask that we have an urgent debate on the issue of social welfare fraud and how it is reported.  </P>
        <P>Many comments have been made from the Government side of the House about how incompatible Fine Gael and Labour policies may be, but it was strange to hear a Minister this morning urging her coalition partners to support her policies.  Maybe the Minister should tell us whether there is dissent within the Cabinet about her policies.  The Leader might raise that issue for us.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>It is true, we will never know.  Why will the Order of Business start at 10 o&rsquo;clock tomorrow morning and will the time for it be shortened?  If we are asked to sit <Col N="611"/>an extra day we should make it a full day&rsquo;s work and make it look like a full day&rsquo;s work, with a full Order of Business.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I was very glad to hear on the radio this morning the voices of some of my Seanad colleagues, Senators Doherty and Cannon, whose concerns about the Local Government (Charges) Bill were very well aired, particularly on whether people living in granny flats or self-contained units would have to pay the &euro;200 tax.  It was a relevant question on the legislation and we await the Minister&rsquo;s response, but the point is made very effectively that in the Seanad we have a forum for the scrutiny of legislation.  At a time when the Seanad is coming under criticism what happened here yesterday evening shows exactly why we need a bicameral system for the proper scrutiny of legislation.  </P>

      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I encourage the Government to listen very carefully to the concerns raised by Opposition and Independent Seanad&oacute;ir&iacute; about legislation.  Senator Norris and I had some success last week in the discussion on the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Bill, although we would have liked more substantial success.  The Government will encourage people to understand the virtue of our bicameral system if it is open to a proper, open-minded consideration of amendments proposed in this House. </P>
        <P>As we are all aware, the German federal constitutional court recently gave a conditional green light to Germany&rsquo;s ratification of the Lisbon treaty subject, however, to the bringing forward of legislation that would strengthen the power of the German Parliament over the application of European legislation in Germany.  The German constitutional court insisted that it has the power to refute the validity of European law in Germany if necessary.  That is relevant to us as we face a referendum on the Lisbon treaty.  Will the proposed constitutional change allow a similar right of way, as it were, to the Constitution and to those who interpret it when it comes to taking a serious dispassionate look at how European legislation might apply in this jurisdiction?  I fear that our courts have not been sufficiently strong in vindicating the dignity and the role of the Constitution in this respect.  I hope that we will follow the German model, regardless of the outcome of the referendum on the Lisbon treaty.</P>
        <P>Listening to the director of the Central Mental Hospital this morning, I did not get the impression that there was any enthusiasm for its move from Dundrum, but perhaps I misunderstood him.  While it is good that the hospital will not be located at Thornton Hall, I am not convinced that this is not a U-turn.  There was obviously a plan to locate the Central Mental Hospital at Thornton Hall and now we hear that the site would not be large enough to accommodate other required forensic mental health units.  I do not suppose there is a chance that the Government will recoup the high cost of buying that site from the vendor.</P>
        <P>On a very serious note, I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on the need to include end-of-life care in the corporate service plan of the Health Service Executive, HSE.  Professor Roger Ulrich of Texas A&amp;M University and the Center for Health System and Design said that Ireland has some of the poorest health infrastructure in the developed world.  We badly need <Col N="612"/>to put end-of-life care at the front and centre of our HSE corporate service plan to support the good work of the Irish Hospice Foundation and particularly its hospice friendly hospitals initiative and the design and dignity initiative in preparing standards and conducting audits with hospitals.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Senator Mullen that yesterday&rsquo;s debate was an excellent example of how the Seanad can add value but we all recognise that it was the exception rather than the rule.  It was a clear example of legislation brought before the House that had not been fully thought out.  We are glad to see the reversal of the imposition of a charge on mobile homes, but anybody who was in the House could see that the Minister was making it up as he went along.  He could not and did not give a clear answer on granny flats.  When he was asked whether barges would be subject to a tax, he made up his response.  While we need legislation, rushed legislation is no good to anybody because we will have to revise it later.  The Seanad did a great job yesterday but the legislation that came before the House was not ready for the House. </P>
        <P>This morning&rsquo;s report by the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, shows that over half of the sewage treatment plants in the country do not meet EU standards.  Only one county, Longford, meets those standards.  This is a case of chronic underinvestment.  The plant in Ringsend in Dublin serves twice the capacity it was intended to serve.  There is also a problem about the maintenance of these plants.  The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, said that we need more training and upskilling of workers at these plants but he has the law on his side.  He can fine plants up to &euro;500,000.  There are health issues at stake.  We need to ensure that these plants are maintained and operated at the highest standard possible, and their current state is not acceptable.</P>
        <P>I wish finally to make a comparison between two foreign Ministers.  Yesterday, Deputy Ring, to whom I am grateful, managed to obtain the information that our Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Martin, took a flight from Belfast to Dublin, despite the presence of the M1 motorway which is very good value for money.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DominicHannigan"><NameTxt>Senator Dominic Hannigan</NameTxt>
	<P>The UK Foreign Secretary arrived here yesterday on a scheduled BMI flight.  The lesson I learnt from that visit is that one of the most important politicians in the United Kingdom will take a scheduled flight.  Unfortunately, the lesson our Ministers will learn from that is that if one takes a scheduled flight one might lose one&rsquo;s jacket so one is better off using a Government jet. </P>

      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>Can the Order of Business be amended so that No. 25 on the Order Paper will be taken before No. 1?  On the importance and value of this House, I mentioned the Broadcasting Bill on yesterday&rsquo;s Order of Business.  This House does itself a disservice when Members say that any attempt to amend legislation is seen as a climb down or U-turn.  The point of our being in this Chamber is to amend legislation.  The Bills brought forward by the Ministers for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and the Environment, Heritage and Local Government show how this House works and we should be looking forward to many other such examples.</P>
        <P>We need a debate on sewerage services.  The EPA report is of great concern and even though additional resources in an era when less resources are being made available elsewhere are being made available for water services.  Obviously it is not enough and more needs to be done.  This House has a role to play in such a debate and I encourage the House to hold this debate.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="613"/>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the call for a debate on the EPA report.  It is with regret I note that two years after the Green Party entered Government it appears that the state of the environment has reversed rather than advanced.  I see Senator Boyle shaking his head but the facts speak for themselves and the statistics are there.  We debated this matter during the past four or five years and now we have a report that shows clearly that in our rural towns and villages our sewerage schemes at best are not working and at worst are dangerous for human health.  Significant investment and political leadership are required and it is important that a debate on this matter of serious public health concern takes place in the House as soon as possible.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Senator Terry Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I know the schedule is very busy but it is important we have a debate prior to the summer recess on the present state of the economy and to consider the past manifestos of the parties from the previous general election.  The Fine Gael manifesto for the 2007 election stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">Our manifesto commitments are fully costed and affordable in the context of the prudent budgetary assumptions drawn from the most authoritative economic sources.  The Economic and Budgetary Framework agreed with Labour provides for continued government surpluses, and a reduction in net debt to below 7% of GDP by 2012.</P>

	<P>I wish to address a serious issue.  Will the Leader ask the Minister for Health and Children to come to the House to address the issue of the pharmacists?  This is causing a deafening silence from the Government benches, I suppose because of the situation that will confront us in the coming weeks.  Everyone in the House knows that the pharmacists are sending back their contracts and perhaps 50% have already done so.  There is a real danger that a nasty confrontation will take place at the beginning of August.  It is now and not the beginning of August that we should be addressing this problem.  When the Leader agrees to ask the Minister to come to the House to debate this we should ask her at the very least to engage in dialogue with the pharmacists.</P>
      </Speaker>

      </Speaker><Col N="615"/>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Senator Shane Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>This is not just an issue of people making a lot of money being able to afford to take some of it back, which is how it is portrayed by some of the Government spinners.  There are two very important elements involved.  One is the issue of small businesses, some of which are in serious difficulties as a result of the cuts made.  They borrowed a lot of money on the basis of the fact that they would go ahead on the margins given to them by the Department of Health and Children for the medicines.  The other is a serious health issue.  I do not want to be absent from here with the House in recess when old people are not able to get their medicines because they do not have access to their chemists or this scheme.</P>
        <P>Now is the time we should address this.  There is no point in the Minister or the Government taking macho attitudes heading into the summer and going on holidays when there will be a mini-disaster facing them by August.  Will the Minister come to the House?  This is not a taboo subject as has been demanded by Fianna F&aacute;il.  It is a subject to be aired on both sides of the House so we can nip it in the bud prior to it becoming a national problem, which it will, and a serious difficulty for old people and small businesses.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan"><NameTxt>Senator Denis O&rsquo;Donovan</NameTxt>
	<P>When will it be possible to have a debate on the fishing industry?  If it is not possible in this term, perhaps it will get priority when we resume in September.  I welcome the opening this week in Garinish in the Beara Peninsula by the Minister of State, Deputy Killeen, of the largest farm in Europe of abalone, referred to by some as the sea slug aphrodisiac.  It represents the possibilities fish farming has for the creation of jobs.  I believe it is the largest farm in the northern hemisphere and there is a high added value market for abalones in places such as Japan, China and India as well as in Europe.</P>
        <P>I also call for a debate on rural Ireland and the potential of rural tourism.  I am enticed to do so by my home parish of Muintir Bhaire winning a European destination of excellence award for the Sheep&rsquo;s Head Way walk.  It is a wonderful walk covering more than 100 km in west Cork.  I was proud of it winning this prestigious award which was presented in Bantry last Monday by the Minister of State, Deputy Martin Mansergh.</P>
        <P>We should have a debate on the potential of rural Ireland.  Walking is the most popular sport in Ireland and for every person who plays golf &mdash; I do not, unfortunately, as I am too awkward for it &mdash; there are three people who walk.  It is an inexpensive sport but it brings many people to places such as Donegal, Mayo, west Cork and Kerry.  It is a wonderful activity we should promote and highlight more and we should debate the value of tourism generally to rural Ireland.</P>

	<P>Last night, the Local Government (Charges) Bill passed Committee Stage and will be concluded today.  It is important legislation to provide for a property tax on second residences and includes in section 1 the Joe Duffy amendment that secured an exemption for mobile homes.  There will be many Joe Duffy amendments to another measure which the Government seems intent on introducing, namely, property tax on primary residences.  We have been there before and the experience was not pleasant.  The residential property tax did not succeed.  It conflicted with every basic principle of good taxation in that it was neither equitable nor successful and was difficult to administer.  The Government parties should consider, notwithstanding that the Minister for Finance intimated in the supplementary budget that a property tax was being considered, whether they really want to go down this road.  It will distract from what is really needed in the economic policies of this Government, that is, a focus on the expenditure and waste in public finances.

      <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Senator Ann Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Mullen.  He made a point about the importance of the role of the Seanad.  Once again, the importance of it became clear yesterday afternoon <Col N="616"/>when we had a very fine discussion on Committee Stage on the Local Government (Charges) Bill.  Many fine suggestions were made and it demonstrated to me once again the importance of the Seanad and how important it is that we try to ensure we have ongoing debate on the reform of the Seanad.  While we may have put the issue to bed and said there will be reform, we owe it to ourselves to have an ongoing discussion on how best we can change what is already in place in light of the results of the local elections.</P>
        <P>We also had a debate yesterday during Private Members&rsquo; time on how we would reverse the rate of unemployment.  The debate focused on what F&Aacute;S can do and the co-ordination of the three Departments.  I would like to keep that issue on the agenda because many people still do not know about the courses available at post-leaving certificate level and back to education programmes.  For us to debate that regularly would help to keep it in the minds of people that there are opportunities coming on stream, and we need to ensure that gets into the public arena.</P>
        <P>I know the Leader has a heavy agenda, but perhaps when we come back early in September he will put the matter on the agenda again so we can have an ongoing debate on how best we can improve the situation of the unemployed and provide opportunities for those who are out of work.</P>

	<P>The report of the Environmental Protection Agency issued this morning on drinking water should concern everybody.  The survey it conducted showed 51% of drinking water is contaminated or below standard.  It is mainly due, as far as I understand, to treatment plants and soilage entering river water.  If the Seanad is to earn the respect of the nation, this is the very sort of thing we should be bringing to peoples&rsquo; attention.  There is a possibility that we have introduced too many laws over the years, not just in Ireland but in Europe as well.</P>
        <P>The good news is that one thing we can now sell and buy as of yesterday are misshapen vegetables.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>That is excellent.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>It was a law passed somewhere along the line in recent years.  Europe passed it and we did the same.  It meant those of us who are not worried about the shape of vegetables, especially those of us who are watching prices, could not sell vegetables unless they were of exactly the right shape.  We had to throw away vegetables and not avail of their benefits.  I mention this because we pass too many laws that are not of value to the nation.</P>
        <P>Other legislation introduced in Europe yesterday that is of benefit concerns roaming charges on mobile phones, which have been reduced dramatically because the European Parliament and Commission were able to say it was no longer acceptable to have such high charges.  There are benefits in Europe.  If we are to recognise Europe and the benefits we get from it, particularly with a referendum coming up, we should draw attention to the benefits we receive and work hard to ensure we do not pass silly laws as we have done in the past.</P>

	<P>Will the Leader invite the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney, to the House to have an urgent debate on the cuts in pharmacists&rsquo; margins.  I <?oasys _dc18- ?>note <i>The Irish Times</i> today had a report that the Minister has written to Fianna F&aacute;il backbenchers.<?oasys _dc0- ?>  Could the Deputy Leader tell the House whether the Green Party has been ignored because it has become irrelevant or has locked into the issue completely?</P>

      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>Can the Leader invite the Minister to the House?  It is important we have a debate and that the Minister outline to the House the contingency plans if 700 pharmacists opt out of dispensing medicines to medical card holders.  These are old and young vulnerable people who are on treatment and need medicine the most.  Senator Ross is correct.  What is the plan?  We do not want people to be deprived of medicines, taken to hospital and possibly dying.</P>
        <P>I also ask the Leader that during such a debate we would discuss small pharmacists, such as Mary Shinnick who runs the North Gate Pharmacy in Cork city, and not big conglomerates.  We should be a voice for the small people who are struggling and are doing their very best to survive in a very competitive market against chains of pharmacies.  It is important to have such a debate.  Does the Minister have a contingency plan?  It is fine to talk like Rambo, but if she acts like Bambi the people will suffer.  We need to have a contingency plan if the 700 pharmacists opt out.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Senator Mary M. White</NameTxt>
	<P>I am delighted with the news that the Central Mental Hospital in Dundrum will not be built adjacent to the prison in Thornton Hall.  The mental health commission, the Irish mental health coalition and many members of the Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children, including myself, were totally opposed to the building of the hospital beside a prison.  One is in prison because of a custodial sentence.  Being in the Central Mental Hospital is, it is to be hoped, a path to recovery and being brought back into society again.  People there receive therapy and counselling and are mentally ill.</P>
        <P>I am proud today on behalf of Professor Kennedy to whom I spoke this morning and who thanked me personally for my valiant efforts.  I spoke on every occasion against the plan to move the hospital.  It was the wrong decision in the first place.  It was done for financial reasons.  Apparently, the plan has now changed for financial reasons.  I do not mind once the savage treatment of people with mental illness who were to be put adjacent to a prison is halted.  I am delighted.</P>

        <P>I would like to protest at the unprofessional ordering of business in this House.  Once again we are meeting at a random time &mdash; 10 o&rsquo;clock.  We never know where we are going to go.  I am not saying Seanad &Eacute;ireann is a silk purse, but the Leader has displayed a remarkable talent of making a pig&rsquo;s ear out of it.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to raise the matter of pharmacies, which other colleagues have raised.  It is very worrying.  Once again we are in a mess.  There are questions of employment, delivery of services to the public and a loss of jobs.  We have all been involved in this over the years.  It is ridiculous.</P>
        <P>With regard to last night, it was a very good debate.  We should welcome the fact that the Minister took on board the amendments, which many of us urged.  It is a question of definition, however, and there were a series of very loose definitions.</P><Col N="618"/>
        <P>I am astonished by the behaviour of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Dermot Ahern, in the other House.  He has agreed to cut the fines for the blasphemy sections of the law from &euro;100,000 to &euro;25,000, and said yesterday in the D&aacute;il that the draft of the legislation on blasphemy has been deliberately drawn up to make it virtually impossible to get a successful prosecution out of it.  That is a very peculiar way to be drafting law.  We are drafting law so that nobody can be properly prosecuted.  It is a complete farce, a nonsense and an insult to the intelligence of the people.  The whole question of blasphemy ought to be blown out of it.</P>
        <P>I mentioned definitions.  I cannot give the House a definition of blasphemy, but I can give a description of it.  It is one we all heard and was printed in <i>The Irish Times</i>, that respectable newspaper, when that remarkable man, Mr. O&rsquo;Brien, a former Fianna F&aacute;il mayor of Clonmel, said: &ldquo;They raped me, they buggered me, they beat the shite out of me and the next day put the Host in my mouth.&rdquo;  That showed the most extraordinary disregard for God and man.  That is blasphemy.  The laws were in place at the time but they did not nothing to save that unfortunate child.  Let us not have a pretence or a farce.  Let us have real and properly drafted legislation and forget all this nonsense about blasphemy.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaschalDonohoe"><NameTxt>Senator Paschal Donohoe</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the calls from my colleague for another debate on unemployment.  We had a debate on the issue yesterday but the new figures from the Central Statistics Office have been published and show the trend continuing, with unemployment rising at a time when our national income is falling.</P>
        <P>I find myself in some agreement with Senator Leyden.  We should have a debate on the different documents and plans published by the political parties.  When we do this, we should consider the document the Government published in November, the plan for a smart economy, which was meant to turn around our economy and get it back on the path to growth.  What has happened since that plan was published?  Another 100,000 people are unemployed and this week, six months after its publication, the Government announces a task force for the implementation of that document, not an update on how the plan is being implemented or on the results of failures it has had.  Let us have a debate.  I have no doubt the quality and vision of our plans will not be found wanting but I know we cannot say the same about the Government plans.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I echo the words of other Senators in calling again for a debate on prison policy.  In light of the announcements that have been made about the Central Mental Hospital and Thornton Hall, it is timely that we would debate this.  Like others, I heard Professor Harry Kennedy on the radio this morning.  He is doing an excellent job in the Central Mental Hospital despite difficulties with facilities there, just as Governor John Lonergan is doing a great job despite appalling physical conditions in Mountjoy.</P>
        <P>The answer to the difficulties with physical conditions in both institutions is not to build a super-prison at Thornton Hall.  I am glad the announcement has been made that the Central Mental Hospital will not be moving to Thornton Hall.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>It was never appropriate to criminalise mental illness by placing psychiatric patients in an institution on a campus that was really a prison campus which included the enormous prison which was proposed for Thornton Hall.</P>
        <P>I am glad it has been announced that Thornton Hall will at least be delayed.  There is a strong argument to review in much greater depth the need for building more prison places as <Col N="619"/>we have never seen an evidence-based rationale for building them.  We know there are large numbers of people in prison who should not be there, including large numbers who are mentally ill and who should be receiving treatment.  We know conditions within our prisons are appalling with very few rehabilitation prospects.  We need a debate on prison policy in light of these announcements.</P>
        <P>The Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill is before the House today, one of the many pieces of legislation coming to the House in this race to finish in July.  There must be a better way of ordering legislation.  Among these Bills, Part 6 of the Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill will reconstitute the Crisis Pregnancy Agency.  I want to record my appreciation and that of many people, especially women in crisis pregnancy, for the great work the agency has done since its inception in 2001.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>This is an evidence-based rationale.  The numbers of women travelling for abortion has dropped and women in crisis pregnancy have been much better cared for since the inception of the Crisis Pregnancy Agency.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Exactly.  Well said.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>We should all appreciate the work of the agency.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NickyMcFadden"><NameTxt>Senator Nicky McFadden</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I would also like to raise the issue of people flying into this country to claim dole and the suggestion that each of these people defrauding our country has cost the State &euro;10,000.  This is extraordinary when so many of our people need the dole and we do not have enough to pay them at this stage.  Why is there not joined-up thinking between the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Department of Social and Family Affairs so that PPS numbers are used to register these people?  I call for a debate on this matter.  The officials of the Department of Social and Family Affairs came to the Oireachtas committee to discuss all of these issues but I cannot understand how it has taken so long for people to need to be identified by their photograph, for example.  This involves not just foreign nationals but also includes Irish people claiming dole while working or pretending to be sick.  There is a serious need for a debate in the House on fraud.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF"><NameTxt>Senator Donie Cassidy</NameTxt>
	<P>Senators Twomey, Mullen, Hannigan, Ormonde, Norris and McFadden called for an urgent debate on matters pertaining to social welfare fraud and all other kinds of fraud.  I have no difficulty in having the Minister for Social and Family Affairs come to the House to assist in this matter.  As Senator McFadden said, &euro;10,000 is a lot of money and if thousands are doing this, it represents a considerable sum.  We want to do everything we can to support the Minister in the challenge that faces the Department in this area.</P>
        <P>With regard to the debate yesterday on local government and the importance of the Seanad, as I said on &ldquo;The Late, Late Show&rdquo;, the Seanad discusses every Bill section by section and line by line.  The more Bills that are initiated in the Seanad, the better the legislation will be in both Houses.  I compliment all the work the D&aacute;il is doing and has done through the years.  However, the Seanad has the capacity and the ability, and no guillotine whatsoever is involved.  The taxpayers of Ireland trust us under the Constitution and Seanad &Eacute;ireann is the upholder of both the Constitution and the taxpayers.</P>

	<P>I congratulate Senator Mullen on being appointed acting leader of the Independent group this morning.  It is good to see him in that position.  The Senator raised the issue of the Lisbon treaty.  I assure him that the Constitution takes precedence over any EU regulation so the people can feel very safe and sure in that thought.  We have always been protected by our great Constitution of 1937.</P>
        <P>Senator Mullen also called for a debate on the need to include end-of-life care, which is very worthwhile.  I compliment the hospice organisation, the voluntary organisations and everyone associated with those who are terminally ill on all they have done.  We should all be doing more.  I have no difficulty allocating time for a debate to find how we can enhance and progress any future good ideas in this area following the recess.</P>
        <P>Senators Hannigan, Boyle, Bradford and Quinn referred to the EPA report.  I am pleased that one of the counties in my constituency, Longford, is the top county.  I congratulate Longford County Council, the county manager and everyone associated with the great work that is taking place.  Coming from the lake county of Westmeath, I know it is a serious challenge given all the heavy rain from the hills being washed into the rivers and lakes.  A huge amount of money is being invested by the Department at present and more is needed.  I will certainly pass on the views of Senators and I have no difficulty having a debate in the House following the recess.</P>
        <P>Senator Leyden referred to the various manifestos and pointed to the Fine Gael document suggesting 7% growth and no stamp duty for houses costing &euro;450,000.  How the world economy has changed.</P>

	<P>Senators Ross, Buttimer and Norris called for the Minister for Health and Children to come to the House to discuss the pharmacy situation.  Despite all the legislation we have to debate and discuss before recess, this is an urgent matter.  The situation facing the pharmacy sector and the Department of Health and Children is challenging.  I will endeavour to have the Minister before the House in the next few days to update it on the serious situation regarding the withdrawal of contracts by pharmacists.</P>
        <P>We all know the small family pharmacy is the backbone of our communities, parishes and everyone in our area.  I do not want to see anything interfere with the services to which we have become accustomed and from which we have been getting a very good service.  I have no difficulty holding an urgent debate in the House.  As Senator Twomey and other colleagues remarked, this is an urgent matter and it is our duty to ensure we are updated on the situation with the Minister present.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Donovan called for a debate on the fishing industry and fish farming, to which I have already made a commitment.  Fish farming is a source of great potential for the country and any such debate should include rural development, everything to do with promoting tourism, particularly in rural areas, walking and all such activities, which are a great attraction and which is possible in our beautiful, scenic country.  I endeavour to have this take place and I have already agreed to do so.</P>
        <P>Senator Regan referred to the Local Government Bill and the value of Seanad &Eacute;ireann, a topic I have already covered.  Further taxes were implemented in the budget and we all await with bated breath 2 December next to see the difficult budget facing the country.  I am not privy to what will be in that any more than the good Senator.  However, the property tax was one of the reasons his party lost power in 1987 and I am sure we will all remember that in making up our minds about the budget.</P>

    <Title>Health Insurance (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2008: Second Stage. </Title>
        <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="JohnMoloney"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Moloney</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to address the House on Second Stage of the Health Insurance (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2008.  The Bill contains a number of important measures to support the operation of community rated health insurance which is widely supported by all parties in the House since the market was opened to competition.  In 1993 in its first report, the seventh joint committee on commercial State bodies, which included four Members of this House, highlighted the threat to community rating that competition could bring while recognising that community rating could be preserved through the use of a mechanism which would channel compensation to insurers covering older subscribers from insurers covering younger subscribers.  At the centre of community rated health insurance is inter-generational solidarity between all insured persons through the application of community rating to all insured persons irrespective of their age or health status.  It is a policy which successive Governments over many decades have been committed to maintaining.</P>
        <P>Approximately 51% of the Irish population holds private health insurance.  This figure has typically reflected the numbers of people in employment and there has been a small decline in the numbers insured over the past six months.  Given the manner in which inter-generational support operates it is essential the regulatory framework, especially at a time when overall membership is subject to the broader economic environment, effectively supports inter-generational solidarity.  Recent data indicate the market share of VHI has fallen to about 66%, while the share of Quinn Healthcare has increased to 22% with Hibernian Aviva, which took over Vivas in 2008, close to 10%.  Most relevant to any assessment of the market, VHI continues to have by a considerable margin the highest number and proportion of members over 50 years of age.  While Quinn Healthcare&rsquo;s customer profile is maturing, along with Hibernian Aviva it enjoys a significantly younger age profile than the overall market.  A community rated market with such a profile requires a mechanism that redistributes the higher health care costs of supporting the elderly.</P>
        <P>While all political parties and most academics and professional bodies, including the Society of Actuaries in Ireland, supported the risk equalisation scheme, commercial interests opposed it from the outset and sought to overturn the entire regulatory framework through legal challenges.  The challenges ultimately succeeded when, in July 2008, the Supreme Court found the risk equalisation scheme to be <i>ultra vires</i> on a point of statutory interpretation.<b>  </b>While the Supreme Court decision did not strike down the principles of community rating, open enrolment, lifetime cover or risk equalisation, it found the scheme to be <i>ultra vires</i> because the legislation did not provide an explicit link between community rating as defined in the Health Insurance Acts and the section of the Acts providing for risk equalisation.  The Chief Justice <Col N="624"/>subsequently commented that the decision was not an obstacle to the Government bringing forward a new scheme.</P>
        <P>Currently, a system of single community rating applies whereby all individuals with a specific insurer pay a single rate for the same cover, irrespective of age, when entering the market.  The Minister will be bringing forward regulations in the early autumn, as provided for under section 7A of the principal Act, with the intention of commencing lifetime community rating by the end of this year.  The introduction of these regulations will encourage younger people to continue to take out health insurance as those who delay taking out cover until older will be liable for a late entry loading reflecting the fact that they did not contribute positively to the overall risk pool and intergenerational solidarity when in a position to do so.</P>
        <P>Following the Supreme Court decision in July 2008 the Government came to the conclusion that there was an immediate need for an interim scheme to prevent a risk rated market developing in a manner that would make it impossible to revert to an effective community rated market.</P>
        <P>There was also a need to ensure the protection of older people, many of whom had been paying private health insurance since their youth and who were now at the point where they needed such insurance most, facing the prospect of no longer being able to afford appropriate cover.</P>
        <P>It is also true that the principle of community rating protects all persons suffering ill health, irrespective of age.  This is because, under a community rated system, prices for products are the same to all persons, irrespective of age and health status.  However, without risk equalisation or related measures insurers are incentivised to focus solely on attracting only younger lives.</P>
        <P>The reality is that in the absence of an immediate mechanism to support intergenerational solidarity there are incentives for insurers to design products that are attractive only to healthier lives undermining intergenerational solidarity and the common good protections.  The market is then open to fragmentation and intergenerational solidarity is at risk of being weakened or eliminated.</P>
        <P>Given this, the Government determined that officials from the Department, with the Health Insurance Authority and legal and actuarial experts, would work to develop an interim scheme which could be put in place promptly to stabilise the market, while a longer term solution was developed.  Consideration was also given to submissions received from and representations made by market stakeholders.  It is this interim scheme that is provided for in the Health Insurance (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2008.</P>
        <P>On the interim scheme, the measures provided for in the Bill were notified to the Commission, DG Competition, on 19 November in the same manner as the 2003 scheme had been notified.  That scheme was approved by the Commission and the Commission&rsquo;s decision was subsequently upheld by the Court of First Instance as the previous scheme was recognised as a justifiable measure given the obligation imposed in the common good on health insurance providers.  Similarly, the Commission has recently determined that the interim scheme is also an appropriate measure given the nature of our market.</P>
        <P>The Bill has been amended since publication to reflect the detail of the Commission&rsquo;s decision, particularly as regards the inclusion of a framework to satisfy the Altmark criteria applied by the Commission and to allow an assessment of whether any overcompensation occurs.  I take the opportunity to clarify that the Commission&rsquo;s decision, primarily reflecting the examination of DG Competition, specifically recognised that any action the Commission would take on VHI&rsquo;s historical derogation from having to be authorised would be a separate matter, primarily for DG Internal Market and Services.</P><Col N="625"/>
        <P>The interim scheme consists of two elements: age related tax reliefs granted to individuals who hold private health insurance and a levy, that is a stamp duty, charged on private health insurance companies to be used to finance the age-related tax reliefs.</P>
        <P>The details of the relief are as follows.  People aged 50 to 59 &mdash; &euro;200, aged 60 to 69 &mdash; &euro;500, 70 to 79 &mdash; &euro;950, and over 80 &mdash; &euro;1,175.  The existing tax relief at source of 20%, which will continue to apply, will relate to the gross premium paid net of the new credit being introduced.</P>
        <P>On the levy, each private health insurance company will be required to pay an annual levy to the Revenue Commissioners.  The levy will be remitted to the Exchequer where it will form part of the overall Exchequer funding.  The levy will be charged on all adult insured lives at a level of &euro;160.  Apart from a reduction to one third of this amount, &euro;53, for insured lives under age 18, to reflect the fact that insurance premiums for under 18s are on average of the order of one third of the adult premium, there will be no differentiation on the basis of age.</P>
        <P>Both the age-related private health insurance relief<b> </b>and the<b> </b>levy<b> </b>will be subject to annual<b> </b>review<b> </b>to take account of medical inflation and the impact of an ageing population.</P>
        <P>The stamp duty is being placed on the health insurance companies for each insured life, and not<i> </i>on the individual subscribers.  It is a matter for the companies whether to pass this duty on to their customers.</P>
        <P>The additional tax relief under the scheme is being granted at source to the insurer as tax relief at source, TRS.  It is granted on the basis that the insurer must charge the same net premium to all persons covered by a plan.  The operation of the medical insurance relief at source means the relief is available to all persons, including those whose taxable income would be insufficient to avail of the tax relief.  This will be reflected in the fact that each person will only pay the same net premium.</P>
        <P>The tax relief being made available under this interim scheme is a fixed sum tax relief.  The amount of relief given is fixed, irrespective of the plan held by the insured person and, accordingly, higher amounts of relief will not be available for more expensive plans.</P>
        <P>The age related tax relief and the levy will only apply to the commercial insurers operating in the market.  They will not apply to the restricted membership undertakings, RMUs, for the ESB, garda&iacute; and prison officers.  The option given to the RMUs to choose to be included in the original risk equalisation scheme has been identified as a legal weakness in the regulatory framework.</P>
        <P>The main objects of the Bill are to affirm that the purposes of the Health Insurance Acts include, inter alia, ensuring that access to health insurance cover is available to all consumers without differentiation made in respect of age and health status, and providing for the implementation of related measures to achieve these objects.</P>
        <P>Section 3 provides that the principal objective of the Minister and the Health Insurance Authority in performing their duties under the Act is to ensure, in the interests of the common good, that access to health insurance cover is available to all consumers with no differentiation made, in particular as regards the costs of health services, based on age and health status.</P>
        <P>Section 4<i> </i>includes revised definitions, reflecting the Supreme Court judgment, of terms such as &ldquo;community rated health insurance contract&rdquo; and &ldquo;community rating&rdquo;, which now encompasses measures that support the achievement of the principal objective.</P>
        <P>Section 6 includes a basis for determining reasonable profit.  Determination of &ldquo;reasonable profit&rdquo; will be assessed in accordance with the Community Framework for State Aid in the Form of Public Service Compensation, which has been inserted to the Bill as Schedule 2.  It also substitutes a new section for section 7 of the Act with changes aimed at ensuring community rated health insurance contracts are made available without differentiation, irrespective <Col N="626"/>of age or health status.  Insurers are required to offer any particular contract for a period of not less than 31 days and insurers are to charge all persons the same net premium.</P>
        <P>Section 7<i> </i>amends section 7A of the principal Act and provides for a reduction of the age at which the late entry loadings can be applied from 35 to 30.</P>
        <P>Section 8<i> </i>provides that private health insurers are to submit samples of all contracts to the Health Insurance Authority ten working days in advance of offering them for sale to potential customers.  This section also provides for the authority to establish a register of health insurance contracts.</P>
        <P>Section 9<i> </i>inserts a new section into the principal Act to provide for the necessary data returns to be made to the Health Insurance Authority to allow monitoring of this scheme.  The section provides for an evaluation and analysis of the data returned by the authority and for it to make a determination on the appropriate level of credits and duty for the following year and to advise the Minister accordingly.  It also sets out a process for determining net beneficiaries of the scheme and a test for possible over compensation, and for net financial impact being evaluated on a cumulative basis over the duration of the scheme.  The section also provides for the insured person being informed of the gross and net premium.</P>
        <P>Section 10<i> </i>amends section 12A of the principal Act.  This amendment<i> </i>provides for the use of any data returns made in the calculation of the age-related tax credit and the amount of the levy payable.</P>
        <P>Section 11 replaces section 13 of the principal Act which contained limited provisions relating to advertising and promotion of health insurance business.  This new section includes much stronger provisions with an emphasis on enhancing the position of the consumer in relation to the provision of information by insurers and regulating the content of advertisements.</P>
        <P>Section 12 amends section 14 of the principal Act.  This amendment prevents the establishment of new restricted membership undertakings offering health insurance.</P>
        <P>Section 13 inserts a new part into the principal Act that enables the Health Insurance Authority to pursue enforcement of provisions where it is of the opinion that an insurer is contravening a provision or is likely to do so again.  The section sets out a specific process whereby the authority may take a number of steps to have any contravention remedied, including making an application to the High Court to seek compliance.</P>
        <P>Section 14 provides for the amendment and substitution of section 21(1) of the principal Act, which deals with the functions of the authority.  It enhances the functions and powers of the authority in line with the provisions of the Bill.</P>
        <P>Sections 15 to 21 amend the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 to provide for a new age-related tax credit in respect of payment of private health insurance premiums during the course of this scheme in respect of persons aged 50 years and over.  These sections relate directly to the tax relief elements of the interim scheme which I described.</P>
        <P>Section 22 inserts a new section 125A into the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act 1999 to provide for the collection of the annual stamp duty on health insurance companies based on the number of lives covered.  The section now provides for four return periods recognising that premium payments made monthly will flow into 2012.  The section also provides for benefit in kind assessment on a basis that will not result in an employer who pays insurance on behalf of staff facing higher costs.</P>
        <P>Section 26 provides for the application of the levy on the health insurance companies.  It has been amended since publication to address issues raised by the industry.  In particular, the levy now applies only to contracts renewed or entered into in 2009 and onwards.</P><Col N="627"/>
        <P>Section 27 provides for the amendment of the Insurance Act 1936 with the definition of premium contained therein amended for the purpose of solvency calculation and corporation tax assessment on foot of industry representation.</P>
        <P>The combination of measures in the Bill is designed to protect the common good features of the market, in particular community rating and effective open enrolment.  These measures need to be put in place while a more permanent replacement for the 2003 risk equalisation scheme is designed.  While that work intensified over the next two years the Government must ensure that the regulatory framework does not support product segmentation and the development of niche products directed at attractive segments of the population, undermining community rated health insurance.</P>
        <P>The Bill also contains a significant number of new measures, including the establishment of a register of contracts, information provision by insurer, control of advertising, compliance with the principal objective and related enforcement powers for the Health Insurance Authority.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>The risk equalisation issue goes back to 2003.  I find it surprising that this legislation is necessary in 2009.  I was a Member of the D&aacute;il when many of the issues related to risk equalisation cropped up and they were debated at length.  The level of corporate knowledge of this issue in the Departments of Health and Children and Finance must be substantial.  I do not understand the need for this legislation.  The Government should have dealt with the core issue, which is the role of risk equalisation in a community rated private health insurance market.  The Bill imposes a levy on private health insurance, which is an easy way out of a difficulty.</P>
        <P>This levy will penalise the young families who are hit hardest by the present economic downturn and will further drive people out of the private health insurance market.  This will lead to knock-on problems.  Of the 2 million people who have private health insurance, approximately 500,000 are over the age of 50.  If people under 50 are driven away from private health insurance, what will be done next?  The Government will be forced to increase the proposed levy further in years to come.  I am not sure the Government is approaching this issue in the right way.</P>
        <P>When I was a Member of the Lower House, I debated with the Minister for Health and Children the issue of the 40% reserve which must be kept by private health insurance companies.  Four years ago, the Minister, Deputy Harney, and I discussed the fact that 40% seemed an incredibly high reserve for private health insurance.  Health insurance is not like insurance against accidents or storm damage.  Companies can predict, more or less, what will happen year on year.  I do not understand the need for a 40% reserve.  A reserve of 25% would seem to be sufficient.  Why is this figure not questioned?  Is there some reason the figure cannot be lowered to, say, 25%?  The VHI reserve has dropped from 35% to 27%.  If the Government lowered the required reserve figure there would be no need for such a high levy.  I accept the need for a levy if the Government chooses to maintain risk equalisation within the market but I do not accept it should be so high.  A household consisting of two parents and three children will be liable for a levy of &euro;500 per year.  This is another tax on families.</P>
        <P>Consider the example of a person who pays the VHI premium for an elderly parent who is an old age pensioner.  Will the full premium now have to be paid in such cases?  Such an elderly person will not have tax credits.  Will his or her premium be increased by &euro;1,000?  Many elderly people, often holding medical cards, have their premiums paid by their families.  The Bill will oblige children who pay premiums for elderly parents to pay an additional &euro;1,000 per year, on average, because the elderly person will not benefit from tax credits.  I ask the Minister of State to answer that question.</P><Col N="628"/>
        <P>The Minister of State does not appear to know how many children have private health insurance.  Does the Department work on the basis of a rough estimate or is the exact figure known?  I have heard it said that the Minister of State does not know the exact figure.</P>
        <P>We appear to operate on the basis that private health insurance companies are perfect.  Let us suppose I have an accident and am taken, unconscious, to hospital, where blood tests, X-rays and so on are taken.  If, when I become conscious, I tell the hospital I have private health insurance, the procedures, which have been performed at the taxpayers&rsquo; expense, will be paid for again by my private health insurer.  That anomaly in our public health care system has never been tackled.  The Minister for Health and Children appears to have been lulled into a false sense of security regarding the private health market and is convinced it is the only way forward.  The way the private element works in public hospitals is wrong.  Everyone who stops at a patient&rsquo;s bed and shakes his hand can submit a claim to a private health insurer.  There is no control of costs.  Sometimes the VHI asks patients to inform the organisation if they see anything wrong with their bills.  However, the detail in the VHI bills can be very poor, and I am surprised the VHI puts up with that.  None of the private insurance companies on the Continent would put up with the poorly itemised bills that are issued by hospitals to the VHI.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>The Minister should pay far greater attention to the costs incurred by the VHI.  There are plenty of Members who run businesses and they know that if one is sloppy about one&rsquo;s costs and the cost of one&rsquo;s service, all one can do is front-load those costs onto the customer who is buying the services.  One will not get away with that in a normal business environment because a competitor will control their costs better and, therefore, keep the cost of their service down.  However, that is not the situation for the VHI.  The Government, which is the ultimate beneficiary of the VHI, does not pay much attention to this either.  There is scope to deal with this, considering the average cost paid by the VHI for hospital procedures is approximately &euro;900.  If it was possible to cut 10% to 15% of that cost, it would have a significant impact on the levy the Government is now charging people under the age of 50, children and young adults, to pay for getting the risk equalisation argument wrong.  The Minister must tell us why the Government is failing to deal with this issue.</P>
        <P>The cost of the levy should be tiered.  Plan D or plan E costs about twice as much as the basic plan B.  People who join the VHI at a lower plan level and can only afford plan A or plan B will pay the same Government levy as somebody who has plan D or plan E.  That is inequitable.  If somebody wishes for and can afford the higher plans, they should also pay a higher levy if the Government genuinely believes that those who earn more should pay more.  It should not hit poorer families with the same high levy as better off people.  There is a huge difference between the cost of plan D or plan E and the cost of plan A or plan B.</P>
        <P>With regard to the derogation the VHI gets from the Government because it does not have sufficient reserves, how long will that last?  I understand it will only last until the end of September, although it has been extended a couple of times over the last 15 months.  Does the Government have another plan for VHI?  If the VHI is short of &euro;100 million to bring its reserves to the level required by current regulation of this market, there is not a hope in hell of it coming up with that amount before the end of September.  Will the Government drop the percentage from 40% to 20% or 25% or is it planning to sell the VHI?</P>
        <P>When she commented on this recently the Minister, Deputy Mary Harney, seemed to indicate that there are plans to privatise the VHI.  Some people would support that while others would not.  However, we must be told if that is what the Government plans for the VHI.  There is a belief that the Government is fattening up the VHI for sale, and that this is the purpose of the levy.  The levy is a high amount.  Some people might not think so but it is high.  The <Col N="629"/>Minister must be honest and state the Government&rsquo;s future plans for the VHI.  If it intends to sell the VHI, I do not believe hard-pressed young families should have to pay this levy under the guise of it being an interim solution for risk equalisation.  I do not believe it is an effective interim solution for risk equalisation but I will await the Minister&rsquo;s response to the debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GeraldineFeeney"><NameTxt>Senator Geraldine Feeney</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy John Moloney, and thank him for his presentation.  While Senator Liam Twomey was speaking I recalled the time we spent on the health committee four years ago.  The Senator was then a Member of the Lower House.  We debated this issue <i>ad nauseam</i>.  There were brilliant debates involving Mr. Vincent Sheridan, the chief executive officer of the VHI, and Mr. Martin O&rsquo;Rourke, managing director of BUPA Ireland, the health insurer that would be most affected by the levy required at the time for risk equalisation and community rating.</P>
        <P>Until four years ago I did not know what risk equalisation or community rating were.  I knew what the VHI was; we were roughly about the same age.  I grew up with the VHI.  It was founded in the same year I was born, 1957.  It was a household name and everybody had ownership of it, whether that was through affection or hearing one&rsquo;s parents say: &ldquo;God, this is an awful bill we have to pay&rdquo;.  There were hard times when I was a child but one&rsquo;s parents still had to pay their subscription.  There was a huge amount of loyalty to the VHI.</P>
        <P>I recall listening with interest at the committee.  I felt almost like a lawyer because when I heard one side of the argument from the VHI, I was very much on its side and thought risk equalisation and community rating were necessary.  I recall Mr. Sheridan saying one day that it was not fair because the VHI had all the old nuns and old priests and it could not afford to maintain its level of support for them.  My attitude would have been, too bad &mdash; the VHI got them when they were young priests, brothers and nuns and they paid their premium like everybody else.  Then I heard the other side of the argument from Mr. O&rsquo;Rourke from BUPA.  Was it fair to penalise BUPA to the tune of millions of euro just because it was a newcomer to the market?  Naturally, as a newcomer, it was attracting people who were coming into the market for the first time.  The people who were more settled and who had grown up with the VHI, like me, were afraid of change and did not wish to change their insurer for fear anything would go wrong.</P>
        <P>I have come full circle on this issue.  I am delighted that the Minister of State has risen to higher ranks but four years ago he was the chairman of the health committee so he knows a good deal about this matter.  In the early days I would not have been on VHI&rsquo;s side but now I am.  I have firmly come round to the view that risk equalisation and community rating are what we need to go forward and to encourage competition in this market.  Before BUPA entered the market there was no competition.  It was a little like the Aer Lingus and Ryanair situation.  Now the market has opened up and more procedures, ranging from laser treatment to maternity services, are covered by private health insurance.</P>
        <P>Unlike Senator Liam Twomey, I believe this legislation is necessary.  I do not claim everything in the legislation is perfect but it is necessary.  We could not leave the situation as it was, after the Supreme Court had found against BUPA, without enacting legislation.  I appreciate the Minister outlining the different provisions in the Bill but I have some concerns about the levy.  It seems severe that every insured adult must pay that levy of &euro;160.  We all come at this from our own point of view, judging how it will affect our pocket.  I have five persons on my VHI policy, myself and my four children.  Unfortunately, while they are all adults, they do not earn adequate funds to pay for their own schemes and, for peace of mind, it is easier for me to keep them on my policy.  I certainly notice increases when they occur but I go without other items to keep private health insurance.</P><Col N="630"/>
        <P>Senator Twomey will leave the Chamber today asking what Senator Feeney had for her breakfast because, while normally we never agree on anything, today I agree wholeheartedly with what he said.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>It would frighten me if the Senator agreed with me twice in the one day.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GeraldineFeeney"><NameTxt>Senator Geraldine Feeney</NameTxt>
	<P>That might happen later.  I agree particularly with what the Senator said about VHI coverage and what it pays for. It seems that anybody who asks persons in a nursing home or a private or public hospital if they are all right can put in a bill and get a few bob.  Like the Senator, I have raised this issue on other occasions in the Chamber.  </P>
        <P>I would like to see a situation whereby a person going for a procedure, for example, a woman having a D and C, need not go in the night before because there is no need for an overnight stay.  One can go in at 7 a.m. and be discharged later that evening.  If one is having minor day surgery one should not be brought in the evening before because that is where the charges occur.  I do not know if the fault lies with the insurer or the hospital.</P>
        <P>I tabled a matter on the Adjournment some weeks ago regarding maternity services.  A pregnant woman might wish to go into hospital to have her baby delivered by a midwife under the public health system and she might like a private room.  However, she is denied this facility because private rooms are at the request of the consultant who will tell the woman she can only have a private room if she consults privately, using her private health insurance.  There is something wrong with such a system and it should be looked at and tightened up.  Perhaps if that were to happen, much of the money that has been spent, unnecessarily, in my opinion, might be offset against the high premiums people must pay.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Bill and look forward to debating it on Committee Stage with its accompanying amendments.  I believe the Opposition is being reasonable.  Perhaps there are areas in the Bill where there might be some tweaking.  I hope that when we go deeper into it next week we might widen it out somewhat.  The legislation was necessary and will firm up in people&rsquo;s minds that these provisions are signed, sealed and delivered.  It gives some comfort, particularly for the older and sicker section of our population.</P>
        <P>With any luck, at this stage in their lives the persons in this Chamber will not have had great value for all the money they have paid into the VHI.  That is a nice thing to say rather than a bad thing.  My parents are now deceased but in their day they would certainly have felt they were paying out a great deal of money and getting very little for it, perhaps the odd appendicitis operation, tonsillectomy or treatment for a childhood accident such as the person falling from a window who needed to go to the hospital.  However, in the final stages of their lives, both my parents received from the VHI ten times what they paid into it, particularly my father, who suffered with respiratory failure in the latter part of his life.  I say that as a source of comfort.  The care will be there for us and what we pay in today, we will reap in the long run.</P>
        <P>I heard what Senator Twomey said and I sympathise and hold similar views.  It is difficult, especially at a time when we are going through an economic downturn and other levies are imposed upon us.  There is none of us who does not look at the bottom line of our salary cheques every month and think that we are much less well-off than we were six months ago.</P>
        <P>I welcome the legislation, which is necessary, and I look forward to debating it as it goes through the Chamber.</P>

	<P>That is agreed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Senator Feargal Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>Perhaps the Leas-Chathaoirleach will remind me if I exceed six minutes.  The Minister of State is very welcome and I am glad to see him in the House.  I support the aim of the Bill, namely, to ensure that older people and those with illnesses are not forced to pay higher insurance premiums, as they would be if the market were left unregulated.  I hope the scheme will counter the motivation among insurers to focus on younger age groups and that insured persons will be less likely to face higher increases or product segmentation related to their age.</P>
        <P>Given that last year the VHI made profits of &euro;112 million and that most of the levy to be collected is to be used as a form of subsidy to the VHI, I am sceptical as to whether this is merely a distortion of the market.  I foresee more hardship for the more than 2 million people in this country who have health insurance.  Senator Twomey asked whether the Government will go ahead with its plan to sell off the VHI in some years&rsquo; time.  I would like to know that too.  If that is the case, it seems clear that the motive behind this move is to divert much of the levy to the VHI.  I wonder why we are not introducing a long-term risk equalisation scheme at this point.  This is an interim measure for only three years, supposedly to stabilise the market.  I can only presume that part of the reason for this move is the ongoing legal challenges, such as that from Hibernian Aviva which plans to take a legal challenge to the decision of the European Commission to endorse the Government&rsquo;s health insurance levy.</P>
        <P>What plans are in motion for the Government to establish a long-term risk equalisation scheme?  Although the aim of the Bill is to prevent premiums for the over-50s rising to unaffordable levels, it is questionable whether this will be the case.  Higher premiums seem inevitable for those under 50.  At what point does health insurance become unaffordable for this group?</P>
        <P>The Minister of State mentioned that both the age-related private health insurance relief and the levy will be subject to annual review to take into account medical inflation and the impact of an ageing population.  I do not believe there will be medical inflation.  Instead, I predict medical deflation.  At least I hope that will be the case because if one compares medical costs elsewhere, what we pay doctors south of the Border is greatly in excess of what is paid north of the Border.  There will be changes and I hope it will be on that basis.</P>
        <P>I draw the Minister of State&rsquo;s attention to a situation that attracted me greatly in the United States.  The US has a different insurance system, but I do not propose we should adopt it.  Safeway, an American supermarket company, has instituted a policy for its 200,000 employees that is well worth examining and very interesting to observe.  Some 47 million Americans have no medical insurance, while tens of millions of others are underinsured and probably cannot afford to go to the doctor.  Those with jobs are in a much better situation.  I do not propose we copy the American method, but Safeway has introduced a scheme that rewards good behaviour among its 200,000 employees.  It is preventative rather than curative.  Safeway states that if its employees behave in a certain manner their medical premiums will be reduced.  The scheme has been so successful that the company has formed a consortium with 60 other companies to attempt to introduce it into the American system.  They reward those who do not smoke, who take regular exercise and who watch their weight.  This behaviour has enabled them to reduce their costs.  In terms of the cost of health insurance, behaving well and acting to prevent diseases that they might otherwise have had have been of benefit.</P>
        <P>Safeway makes the case that four chronic conditions account for 74% of all health costs, namely, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, arthritis and respiratory diseases like emphysema.  It believes that changes in one&rsquo;s behaviour can alleviate most of these conditions.  The <Col N="632"/>results have been startling.  Steve Burd, Safeway&rsquo;s chief executive to whom I spoke last week, has almost become a missionary, making the case for prevention rather than cure.</P>
        <P>Introducing something similar into our insurance system must be possible.  I am not sure how it would be done, but examining the case of Safeway and the other 60 countries that joined it in the United States of America would be worthwhile.  The scheme&rsquo;s ability to reduce costs is significant.  Senator Feeney&rsquo;s comments on the years of high costs and inputs were interesting because I have had the same experience, in that we do not aim to reduce costs to the extent that we should do.  This should form part of the target.  If we can achieve it by rewarding good behaviour &mdash; taking exercise, not smoking and watching weight &mdash; we will be able to reduce the costs of health insurance and prolong people&rsquo;s lives.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PhilPrendergast"><NameTxt>Senator Phil Prendergast</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State.  I also welcome the opportunity to discuss the Bill.  I concur with Senator Feeney in respect of maternity patients.  For many years, it was a matter of considerable frustration for women who were VHI clients and wanted to avail of private rooms that they could not do so due to hospital policy, not necessarily because of the consultants.  It is ridiculous that so many people who want private rooms would instead be put into public beds because of hospital policy.  It also wastes hospitals&rsquo; money.  I wish to expand the discussion on this matter.</P>
        <P>The reward system for people in the US who have private health insurance has been proven to work well.  I read about the Safeway case, including on the Internet.  A system wherein people would be rewarded for looking after their health would always be good.</P>
        <P>The VHI&rsquo;s market share has decreased to an estimated 66%, but its profits remain substantial, so I am not too concerned.  The risk equalisation issue must be examined.  I like the interim scheme, as it will provide an opportunity for a proper evaluation and review of any insurance system put in place.  Many people are VHI clients because they are members of a work scheme and their contributions are deducted from salary at base or so on.  As with Senator Feeney&rsquo;s case, I noticed quite a jump when my youngest son recently became 18 years of age and was put on the higher rate.  It should be the case that people who are still in school should not be put on a higher rate, given the dramatic jump.  Those who are less well off would feel it significantly.</P>
        <P>Every other point has been discussed by previous speakers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MariaCorrigan"><NameTxt>Senator Maria Corrigan</NameTxt>
	<P>I join colleagues in welcoming the Minister of State.  I welcome the clarity he has provided in his contribution by outlining the Bill&rsquo;s necessity, which is to provide for an interim scheme that can be put in place to ensure continuation of the system of single community rating and risk equalisation while a longer term solution is being developed.  The Minister of State clearly outlined that a failure to pass legislation on an interim scheme could result in a risk-related market developing in a manner that would make it impossible to revert to an effective community-rated market at a later stage.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Minister of State&rsquo;s announcement that regulations will be introduced in early autumn with the intention of commencing lifetime rating by the end of the year.  It is particularly important, as it will encourage younger people to continue to take out health insurance.  Those who delay until they are older will be liable for late entry loading, reflecting the fact that they did not contribute positively to the overall risk pool.  This is the importance of community rating and risk equalisation within the health insurance market.  That there is no differentiation in terms of age or health status has been an important market component.</P>
        <P>Colleagues have referred to parents, relatives or people they know who have paid for private health insurance for all of their lives.  Were we not to have a community rating scheme and <Col N="633"/>risk equalisation, it would be paradoxical that those who contributed positively to the collective pool of insurance for all of their lives yet may not have utilised it would be penalised by higher insurance costs as they became older.  The introduction of community lifetime rating to encourage younger people to take out insurance is essential if our principles of community rating and risk equalisation are to be effective.  Otherwise, there would be no incentive and those people could go for ten or 20 years without contributing, yet still be able to access insurance at the same rate as everyone else.</P>
        <P>I wish to ask the Minister of State about one of the measures in the legislation, namely, tax credits that will become increasingly available according to age.  As I listened to him, I remembered a constituent who raised the matter with me some years ago.  An older person, he was on a pension.  When he required a consultant&rsquo;s services, he opted to attend a private consultant instead of going on the public waiting list.  He paid full private consultancy fees.  Since he was on a pension, he was not paying any tax, so a tax relief or tax credit was of no benefit.  He made the point to me that, by opting to attend a private consultant, he had taken pressure off the public service by not adding to public waiting lists.  While everyone else was able to avail of a tax relief, he could not.  Will the Minister of State clarify how tax credits will work in respect of older people who do not pay tax?  I am struck by the point that this man asked at the time whether some measure, in the form of a supplement or subsidy, was available.  He was continuing to contribute at an older age.</P>
        <P>I welcome section 8, which will require all insurance companies to submit samples of all new contracts to the Health Insurance Authority ten days prior to the sale of any new contract.</P>
        <P>I was very struck by the comments of Senator Quinn on the importance of rewarding behaviour that is conducive to good health.  There is merit in considering his point that it may eventually be possible to develop a scheme that would achieve this.  It is in everybody&rsquo;s interest and insurance companies should consider actively how they can provide incentives for those who engage in behaviour that is conducive to positive health.  Ultimately, in addition to a benefit accruing to the State on foot of there being no increased pressure on the health service as a result of ill health, a benefit would accrue to the insurance companies in that there would not be as many claims as a result of ill health.</P>
        <P>I look forward to Committee and Remaining Stages and compliment the Minister of State on the legislation.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Paddy Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to say a few words on this legislation.  I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Moloney, and wish him well with the Bill.  However, it will be very hard to vote in favour of it.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State&rsquo;s speech was very complicated and the average person on the street could not comprehend from it what is to occur in regard to health insurance.  Senator Twomey referred to some very important questions and figures associated with the Bill&rsquo;s implications for those who must pay for health insurance.  At the very core of community rating is the concept that the introduction of the guidelines will encourage young people to continue to take out health insurance and that those who delay taking out cover until an older age will be liable for late entry loading, reflecting the fact that they did not contribute positively to the overall risk pool and intergenerational solidarity when in a position to do so.  This was referred to by the Minister of State and Senator Corrigan.  At what age will people be liable for late entry loading?  At what age will one be relieved of the obligation of paying the penalty?  Will there be a sliding scale such that one who avails of health insurance at 20 will not have to pay a penalty, one who avails of it at 30 for the first time will have to pay a small penalty, and one who avails of it at 50 for the first time will have to pay the full whack?  It is very important to <Col N="634"/>know this.  It is necessary that everyone pay for health insurance because the more who pay, the lower the cost for everyone.</P>
        <P>Senator Twomey implied the Minister of State is taking &euro;150 million from people under 50.  This is quite a considerable sum for young people who are at their wits&rsquo; end trying to put bread on the table and pay for their mortgages, cars and kids at college.  An adult is to be levied at &euro;163 per year and each child at &euro;53.  The levies being imposed are driving up the cost of health insurance.  It will be very difficult for the Opposition to vote in favour of a measure extracting &euro;150 million from the pockets of those under 50.  The Minister of State should explain whether the levy will be imposed on a graduated scale depending on one&rsquo;s age.  Those with mortgages, car loans and kids at college will be hit hardest and will find payment very difficult.  As Senator Twomey stated, they will be driven out of the market whereas we need to drive them into the market on the basis that costs will be lower for everybody if more pay for health insurance.  Eventually the levy will drive competitors out of the market because they will not be able to afford to remain in it.  One or two providers will be left in the market and they will be able to charge whatever price they want.  The Minister of State needs to answer some of the questions raised by Senator Twomey.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DeirdredeBurca"><NameTxt>Senator D&eacute;irdre de B&uacute;rca</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State.  I am thankful for the opportunity to engage in this debate on the Bill.  We are all aware that public access to health services is becoming increasingly important.  Some Senators referred to circumstances in the United States where 47 million people find themselves without health insurance.  Health services and access thereto are becoming increasingly expensive.  Ireland is also struggling in this area.  We are challenged to produce a response that will ensure all citizens have access to timely and affordable health care.</P>
        <P>Ireland has focused considerably on the issue of waiting lists and timely access to health services.  Increasingly, however, because of the ruling of the Supreme Court in July 2008 that the risk equalisation scheme was <i>ultra vires</i>, we must really consider the regulation of the health insurance market so health products and services will not become increasingly inaccessible to ordinary members of the public due to their cost.  I refer in particular to vulnerable sectors of the population, such as the elderly, who have more health care needs than others.  The cost of meeting these needs is likely to grow significantly and, therefore, we must protect the vulnerable and examine ways of incentivising younger people to enter the market.  We must ensure the principle of intergenerational solidarity, which has informed the market to date, is upheld, protected and enshrined in the health insurance legislation.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State has made it clear this Bill is interim legislation and it is really responding to the Supreme Court judgment.  I welcome many aspects of it and its objectives are set out very clearly.  The main objective is to ensure access to health insurance cover will be available to all consumers without differentiation on the basis of age and health status.  The purpose of the regulations set out in the legislation is to ensure health service providers do not operate within the legislation in contravention of its main objective.</P>
        <P>Section 3 sets out that the principal objective of the Minister and the Health Insurance Authority in performing their functions under the Act is to ensure that, in the interest of the common good, access to health insurance cover will be available to all, with no differentiation made on the basis of age or health status.  The section also provides that the insurer shall not engage in a practice or agreement against the principal objective.  This is very important.  Clear definitions of complex terms are also provided, such as &ldquo;community rated health insurance contract&rdquo;, &ldquo;community rating&rdquo; and &ldquo;net premium&rdquo;.</P><Col N="635"/>
        <P>Section 6 is aimed at ensuring community rated health insurance contracts are made available to all persons without differentiation based on age or health status.  Insurers are required to offer any particular contract for a period of not less than 31 days and are to charge all persons the same net premium.  The issue of entry loadings is dealt with also.  Based on the way the new system of regulations is designed, it is obviously in the interest of citizens to take out health insurance as early as possible so they can contribute over time to the risk pool and the principle of intergenerational solidarity through their insurance contributions so that when they are likely to make greater demands on the health services at a later stage, they will have made early contributions.  The late entry loadings are for people who enter late into the market and who do not take out health insurance cover until later in life when their claim costs would be at a higher level.  Obviously, they would not have made any contribution to intergenerational solidarity.  The main change in this area of the legislation is to ensure that the age at which late entry loadings can be applied will change from 35 to 30.  The legislation also clarifies that these loadings can apply on renewal of a contract to which the loading would previously have applied.</P>
        <P>The Health Insurance Authority is given a central role in the legislation.  Under section 8, insurers are now required to submit new contracts to the Health Insurance Authority 20 working days in advance of offering them to potential customers.  Therefore, the authority has a role in screening and supervising the kinds of contracts being offered to potential consumers.  The authority is also required to establish a register of health insurance contracts and this register must be available for inspection by the public free of charge at the office of the authority.  There will, therefore, be much greater transparency and oversight in the system.</P>
        <P>Section 9 obliges insurers to make information returns to the authority, which is a welcome development.  The legislation prescribes that these would be six-monthly returns so that the authority, and in due course the Minister, will be enabled to perform functions under the Act.  This is an improvement because previously, insurers were obliged to make data returns under the risk equalisation scheme.  This provision ensures that more detailed and regular information is required of the insurance providers.  The authority must also submit a report to the Minister at the end of every year.  This will empower and assist the Minister because it will provide advice on matters that should be brought to the attention of the Minister as a result of evaluation and analysis undertaken.  As mentioned already, this is an interim scheme that is being put in place and there will, obviously, be room for improvement.  The role of the authority will be to advise the Minister in that regard.  This section also provides the Minister with the power to make recommendations to the Minister for Finance on any of the reports submitted.</P>
        <P>Section 11 deals with the issue of information and advertising as it relates to consumers.  It enhances the position of the consumer with regard to information and advertisements where this is considered to be in the consumer&rsquo;s interest.  Section 12 deals with the registration of insurers and section 13 deals with the enforcement of provisions contained in the Act.</P>
        <P>The Minister has indicated this is considered an interim scheme to stabilise the market in light of the ruling of the Supreme Court.  Therefore, we need to look at the issue of a longer term scheme.  The Minister of State, Deputy Moloney, mentioned that until recently some 51% of the public had private health insurance, but that percentage may have decreased slightly.  We need to consider the shape the longer term health insurance scheme should take.  The Green Party would hope we would consider a universal health insurance scheme.</P>
        <P>We can learn from the experiences of other countries, for example Canada, where there is one major health insurer that deals with all the various private health providers.  This might be a good model for Ireland to follow.  Whatever choice we make, we must ensure we have a proper longer term scheme.  Currently our health insurance market is a bit of a hybrid.  We have a strong public health system, but we also have increasing pressure as a result of compe<Col N="636"/>tition law to allow for private providers to enter the market.  We need to ensure that whatever health insurance we put in place, we hold true to the object of intergenerational solidarity set out in the Bill and ensure that no member of the public is discriminated against in terms of access to health services or the provision of health insurance on either the basis of age or health status.  I welcome the legislation to the House and the Green Party is happy to support it.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator de B&uacute;rca&rsquo;s contribution has been one of the best I have heard.  It was delivered at rapid fire speed and was most enlightening.  I felt privileged to listen to it.  I do not have the same command of the detail as she clearly has.  I was very impressed by her contribution.</P>
        <P>I could be wrong, but I imagine the chief instigator of the Bill was not the Minister of State.  The Bill has the hallmark of campaigns waged for a long time by the Minister, Deputy Harney.  I do not always agree with the Minister and would have liked to take a bit of a smack at her on the last &ldquo;Questions and Answers&rdquo; programme, but felt that would have been wrong because of it being the occasion of John Bowman&rsquo;s last show.  It would have been rather puppish for me to take a swipe at Deputy Harney on it.  She was making extraordinary claims such as that thanks to the Progressive Democrats and its policies, people could now walk in off the street and get a phone.  Of course one can, but they are mobile phones.  That overlooks the fact that Eircom is a complete and absolute shambles.  Thank God we can get mobile phones and are not dependent on Eircom any more.  The same is true with regard to Progressive Democrat policies on air transport.  They made ducks and drakes out of Aer Lingus, but thank God it has survived.  They rubbished Team Aer Lingus and many of its jobs have now moved to Zurich.</P>
        <P>I am glad, because I like and respect the Minister, that I now have something on which I can agree with her in principle.  I am interested in the philosophical context of the Bill because I do not believe in a two-tier system, but in access.  There should be a more radical approach to health.  We should have universal health care that is paid for by those who can afford it and that is subsidised by the State.  I have no objection to paying the highest rate, which I do, and do not mind my contributions, even if they are increased, going into a nationalised health service and helping to bring in some other citizens.  That is real solidarity.</P>
        <P>Senator de B&uacute;rca referred to the Canadian system.  I suggest we should also look at the Australian system, which was explained in general outline to me in the past few days.  Under that system, everyone has access to health care, but the people with extra money can buy the frills.  Everybody has universal access to beds, treatment and care etc.  That is the way to do it.  If we want to have a private area, it should be for the frills.  I am already on plan E, but if there was a plan F, I would be on it.  People in my situation need not be a burden and to be able to afford to look after themselves.  Therefore, health insurance for me is a prudent investment.</P>
        <P>I well recall how the private capitalist investors in people&rsquo;s illness challenged the risk equalisation scheme, which I supported, in court where it took a bit of a toss.  The principle, however, survives and I am glad that the Minister of State referred to this.  At the end of his speech he unobtrusively used the key phrase, &ldquo;the common good&rdquo;, to which I would like all Departments to pay attention.  My view, and that of many who are more expert in law, is that the common or public good takes precedence over personal or commercial financial gain.  This is a social and community issue.  It is obvious that there should be a responsible rather than a profit-orientated attitude to health care.</P>
        <P>At the beginning of his speech the Minister of State said that 51% of Irish people have private insurance.  That is significant.  It tells us that 51% of Irish people do not regard the public health service as satisfactory.  That should be noted and addressed.  They have every entitlement to that view.  The sad fact, of which the Minister of State is aware, is that this stark <Col N="637"/>figure may well fall because people will not be able to afford private insurance.  The Minister of State points out that the VHI market share has fallen to 66%, but that is still a massive share.</P>
        <P>Quinn Healthcare and others have moved up the scale.  The English crowd, BUPA and others, tried to stick their noses in the trough.  There is no doubt that the Quinn group is a very skilful and clever organisation dedicated to the generation of money for itself and its investors.  It has a talent for cherrypicking, which is precisely what this Bill is intended to address.  It cherrypicks in all its insurance activities.  I have heard numerous stories on the radio, and read them in the newspaper, of people who applied to Quinn Direct and Quinn this, that and the other but happened to live in the wrong area of Dublin, as I do.  Twice I wrote to Quinn Direct seeking a quote for my house but received no answer.  I live in Dublin 1, near &ldquo;handbag corner&rdquo; so it would not give me a quote.  It did not even reply.  The same applies for certain occupations.  That is cherrypicking.  That seems to be prevalent in the insurance industry but it is certainly not appropriate when we are dealing with health.  Quinn comes to this trailing a reputation for cherrypicking.  I am not saying it is doing anything illegal but that is its business practice and it is not appropriate when providing people with health insurance.</P>
        <P>One of the interesting aspects of the Supreme Court judgment is that the Chief Justice immediately drew the Government&rsquo;s attention to the fact that it was not ruling out the principle of looking after the most vulnerable people through risk equalisation and more or less urged the Government to bring forward a new scheme.  There are many occasions when the Judiciary reproves the Oireachtas for allowing lacunae to exist in the law.  It also has ideas on its side of the fence on how we as legislators should address the law.  I have suggested here a couple of times that there should be some channel of communication between the Judiciary and the Oireachtas.  I know there is separation of powers but that does not mean there cannot be communication.  There should be some institutionalised system whereby if the Judiciary sees a gap in the law that damages the interest of citizens, it can send a message asking us to look into it.  That could perhaps operate in two ways.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I notice that the Commission has approved this and so on.  In general I welcome this Bill because it is in the interests of all of us.  We are a community, not just a collection of financial units, and anything other than this would lead to a rather nasty fragmentation of society and compartmentalisation on an age basis.  I suppose I would feel that as I sail into my late 60s.  It is good that we do not stand idly and that we attempt to amend what could have been a fracturing of our sense of community.</P>

	<P>I would welcome one.  When the Minister of State was Chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children we dealt often with the health insurance market, which is fascinating.  I took a strong interest in this area as we watched the evolution of competition in the sector.  We heard that the VHI would decide how many days a patient would stay in hospital and the terms of that stay.  It did not matter if the patient came out after three days or did not need to stay in for three days.  That is a total abuse of power.  That is why I welcome the arrival of companies based in other countries. </P>
        <P>Our system is good in so far as we have a high rate of people on private health insurance, although that is declining in the present economic situation.  One hears that the first thing people cancel when they can no longer afford it is health insurance, but intergenerational solidarity and risk equalisation is a good principle.  That is why the insurance Bill and changes in the insurance market are necessary.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>There is, however, a contradiction in this Bill because the Minister of State uses the term intergenerational solidarity and states that nobody should pay any more, but he proposes a levy which eliminates the notion that everybody pays the same.  I am not a fan, if that is the correct word, of health insurance.  I do not really believe in it.  I believe the public system should be good enough for us to have faith in it.  I do not have health insurance.  If one decides to take out health insurance later in life one will pay a penalty for doing so.  That may well be because one will not have cost the health insurance company any money at that stage and therefore it is entitled to get more money out of one.  That flies in the face of the notion of true risk equalisation and fairness.  I see this as an interim measure to deal with the legislation as it is.  It is an area that needs a great deal of change where litigation has been pending for many years and, as we all know, BUPA took the State to court.  It is not over and it is not a level playing field.</P>
      
        <P>The Minister of State will know from his time as Chairman of the Joint Committee on Health and Children when we dealt with this matter that it is a very uneven playing field.  The committee tried to make the playing field more level but we were somewhat restricted from doing so, largely because of the dominance of the VHI and its construction in terms of its financial obligations.  I wish we were introducing legislation to deal with that because it is far more important.  We need regulation in this area, but we need light-touch regulation.  We need to be able to encourage many more insurers into the market.</P>
        <P>I note this interim measure is to deal with the specific issue of the judgment and to provide a degree of certainty to older people in particular because they are at risk of facing higher premiums.  We need a once and for all health insurance Bill to deal with the dominance of the VHI and I would welcome it into the Oireachtas.  I understand what this Bill is trying to do but there is this inherent contradiction and I am interested to hear the response of the Minister of State on this.</P>
        <P>We need to encourage more participants and health insurance providers into the market.  That is the best way of ensuring competition and getting greater efficiencies and better value for money for the patient and the State in terms of what it pays for health insurance, which is after all what we want.  The monopoly has interfered with or damaged much practice and bad practices were allowed to develop.  As I mentioned before, competition now exists in the <Col N="639"/>aviation sector and is much to the benefit of the consumer.  This could be replicated in the health insurance area.  I seek changes in the ongoing regulation of the health insurance market because we need to keep competition alive in it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <?oasys _cl13.5- ?><Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I listened with interest to the contributions of the two previous speakers and I share some of the sentiments expressed by both of them.  However, I very much disagree with the comments of Senator Norris on the BUPA health insurance group.  To paraphrase what he stated, he claimed that BUPA arrived into the Irish health insurance market to feed at the trough.  I wish to point out to Senator Norris and those who hold such a view that BUPA is a mutual society.  It is not a profit-making agency and invests its surplus in health care projects across the globe.  It does not have shareholders who benefit from the profits of the industry and I am glad that BUPA arrived in Fermoy.  It opened up the Irish health insurance market.  Without BUPA we would not have had the Quinn Group, without whose entrance we would not have VIVAS.  Without those companies we would not have competition and the VHI would have continued to enjoy total dominance.  My only disappointment about BUPA is that the mishandling of the risk equalisation policy resulted in BUPA leaving the Irish market which was a grave disappointment.  It was bad news for the Irish health care industry and I wish it had been handled differently.</P>
        <P>I agree with Senator O&rsquo;Malley&rsquo;s comments on the need to foster and encourage further health insurance competition in the Irish market.  By international standards, notwithstanding Ireland being a small country, it is quite extraordinary that one company still has almost 70% of the business.  In every walk of Irish life we have seen that where there is such dominance by one company it is bad for the consumer and I hope that further competition will enter the Irish market.</P>
        <P>The Bill we are debating today is a continuation of the ongoing debate on risk equalisation that we have been having for the past decade.  I contributed to the debate in both Houses because I felt from day one that the way risk equalisation was being introduced was unhelpful to competition and needed review and change.  It is a pity it took so long and ended up in the Supreme Court.  I support the concept of community rating, as I am sure do all my colleagues, but the heavy-handed approach we apply to risk equalisation has resulted in the mess we are in now.</P>
        <P>There is one aspect of the Irish health care industry on which we need to concentrate and that is the cost of health care.  It is great to have private health insurance companies footing the bill, and the more companies, the better.  However, we must ask why the cost is so high.  Why is health care in Ireland so expensive in comparison with most other countries, not only in the European Union but worldwide?  Last year, I was in Italy for a social occasion and I had to attend a doctor to obtain a prescription for antibiotics.  I was in a small village and I was pleasantly surprised to find a doctor readily available in a local health clinic.  To the best of my knowledge, the bill for the consultation for his writing of the prescription was &euro;20 and the prescription in the local chemist cost me &euro;4.50.  If it was here, the bill would have been &euro;70 or &euro;80, I would have been made feel under a compliment to walk in and meet a doctor so easily and the prescription in the chemist shop certainly would have cost &euro;20.</P>
        <P>While we are debating health insurance it is important, necessary and fundamental to consider the other side of the equation, which is how much we spend on health services and what type of value for money we get.  We have to ask ourselves why Irish health care is the most expensive in the world.  Why does it cost &euro;60 or &euro;70 to visit a doctor?  Why does a prescription cost so much more than in any other country?</P>
        <P>A debate will take place today in the other House on the difficulty that the Minister is having with the pharmacists.  I am very sympathetic towards the Minister&rsquo;s proposals in this regard because the taxpayer and consumer in this country have been ripped off as far as health care <Col N="640"/>is concerned.  While I welcome insurance policies in one sense, in another they are almost covering up the core problem, which is the cost of health care, and we need a very fundamental debate on this.</P>
        <P>We all acknowledge we need more hospital beds, step-down facilities and community care facilities.  However, we may also have to examine the training of general practitioners and the number of GPs we have.  Why is it such a closed group?  Measures have been taken by the Minister for Health and Children to increase slightly the number of persons training for a degree in medicine and the college entrance procedure has been changed.  It is hoped this will result in additional GPs coming on stream.  Until such time as we change the supply and demand equation, health care providers will remain in a position to charge exorbitant fees.  That is a very fundamental part of the debate, not only on health insurance but on the provision of health care.  It needs very thorough examination and, more importantly, it needs action by the Minister and his Government colleagues.</P>
        <P>I appreciate the legislation is interim and I suppose it is an emergency measure.  I was surprised that so many people expressed surprise at the Supreme Court decision on risk equalisation.  The risk equalisation policy, as it existed previously, looked to me at though it could have been written by the VHI itself.  It appeared to be a policy that was absolutely detrimental to the little bit of competition that had arrived into the Irish market and would ensure that no further competition would enter the market.  We now have to go back to the drawing board.  Yet, what we are doing here by way of levies, taxes and charges is not dealing with the fundamental problem of the cost of health care provision.</P>
        <P>I was interested in what Senator O&rsquo;Malley said, namely, that there should be universal health care and that the public system should be so sufficient, efficient and effective that it should be the answer to everybody&rsquo;s problems.  In an ideal, utopian world that would be the case, but it is not the case in this or any other country.  There will always be a degree of necessity for private health insurance and health care, and it should be possible that it sits complementary to the public system.  The Minister of State is aware of the Fine Gael policy announced relatively recently on universal health care, which is the result of a process of long debate within the party.  It is worthy of serious consideration.</P>
        <P>I heard Senator Norris refer to the Canadian model of health policy.  Somebody else mentioned Australia.  We have toured the world over the past ten years and heard about marvellous systems in country A, B or C, but when one investigates them they are never as marvellous as it would appear and there are always problems.  The core of the problems which need to be tackled are the fact that a GP visit costs &euro;60 or &euro;70 and medicine prices are so high.  Senator Norris mentioned that health care is not a privilege and he is correct.  It should not be a privilege but should be enjoyed freely and easily by every citizen of the State, who should have ease of access to it, but sadly that is not the case today.</P>
        <P>With regard to the legislation before us, I appreciate why the Government had to respond in some form to the court decision.  However, since 1998 or 1999, when the first piece of political thinking on risk equalisation was debated in the other House, we have not got it right.  We have been stumbling from one solution to another and this is a case of a Band-Aid being applied to a much bigger problem.  The passing of this Bill does not deal with the fundamental cost issues at the core of the crisis in Ireland.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnMoloney"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Moloney</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank everybody for the debate and will try to respond to as many of the issues as I can.  I thank the officials, Mr. Barrett and Mr. Smyth, for their support and advice throughout the passage of this Bill.</P><Col N="641"/>
        <P>It should be remembered that many issues mentioned here were dealt with and flagged in the health committee some years ago, when we had presentations from VHI and BUPA.  Many of the concerns raised by members of the committee are now being addressed or at least referred to.</P>
        <P>I thank Senator Twomey for his contribution.  He referred to the effects of the levy on younger people.  The reality is that the increase in younger peoples&rsquo; premiums because of the levy reflects the fact that younger members of these insurers had not been supporting intergenerational solidarity.</P>
        <P>Whilst the solvency requirement is high, its level is a matter for the Financial Regulator.  It has already been made aware of these changes.  As the credit is granted at source all persons will benefit, in the same way as they benefit from the standard relief currently granted.  There is no change in that particular apparatus.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>If I pay for somebody else, can I claim the credit?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnMoloney"><NameTxt>Deputy John Moloney</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, there is no change.  The level of the credit and the levy was calculated based on current market data and was not agreed by the Department taking a notional figure.</P>
        <P>It would not be possible to impose a higher levy on specific plans.  In granting a standard level of credits an equitable approach has been taken.  The Government will shortly be considering the best approach regarding VHI&rsquo;s authorisation.  This scheme is separate to that question and will not fully compensate VHI for its adverse risk profile.  That was pointed out often during the deliberations of the health committee some time ago when those points were made on a regular basis.</P>
        <P>Senator Feeney offered her support to the Bill.  It is welcome and I welcome the fact that she and Senator Twomey agree on so much.  That has been noted.  I see peace breaking out in every area.</P>
        <P>The scheme does not penalise companies.  It is a necessary measure in the community rated market.  I also wish to emphasise that the levy is not being imposed on any person, rather it is on the insurer.  The VHI has given considerable attention to reducing costs and most of its <?oasys _dc18- ?>coverage now concerns day care, which were the points raised by Senators Feeney and Twomey.<?oasys _dc0- ?></P>
        <P>The high costs of VHI were referred to in this House and the Lower House.  VHI does not control its costs in an effective way &mdash; this point has been made.  However, all insurance companies in the health area, here and abroad, face significant costs in meeting the claims of their members.  VHI is no different from any other insurer as it, like Government-funded services, sees new technology constantly emerging, whether in drugs or new imaging equipment.  It is also seeing an increase in activity in acute hospitals, particularly in day work.  I understand VHI does take steps to control costs, such as through robust negotiations with private hospitals on their budgets and with medical consultants.  Senator Quinn referred to VHI&rsquo;s profitability and status.  The provisions in this Bill only partly compensate VHI for its age profile.  Should it emerge that medical inflation falls, it will be part of the Health Insurance Authority&rsquo;s assessment in considering the level of credits.</P>
        <P>The overall impact of the measures in the market is neutral.  As the amount collected in levies is paid it is not possible to implement a new risk equalisation scheme in the time available.  That is why the interim measure is being introduced.  I take the point made by Senator Twomey, who asked why, in all the years we have spoken about the issue, it is happening now.  It is an interim measure until the complete legislation proposed is passed.  We will take the issues and proposals made here into account in the interim measures before the new scheme is developed.</P>
        <P>Senator Prendergast raised similar points.  VHI&rsquo;s financial position is not as positive as she indicated.  For example, it has recorded significant losses for 2008.  With regard to the avail<Col N="642"/>ability of higher tax credits, the position is that by granting the credit at source, even those who do not have a tax liability will benefit.</P>
        <P>I will deal with the points raised by Senator de B&uacute;rca.  With regard to lifetime community rating, the regulations will specify a maximum percentage that can be applied to the standard premium in respect of each year beyond 30 that the person concerned does not hold cover.  They will not apply to persons who have cover before the regulations are made.  Issues raised by Senator de B&uacute;rca on protecting the elderly, given the cost that inevitably arises from the care of older people, is at the centre of the Bill.  Furthermore, the Bill also contains a number of measures aimed at enhancing the position of the insured.</P>
        <P>A number of points were raised by Senator Norris.  With regard to the common good aspect of the framework, the Government is obviously committed to protecting the common good and ensuring the conditions are met.  Consequently, the Bill includes a number of measures beyond the interim scheme which the Government aims to achieve.</P>
        <P>Questions have been raised about the long-term future of the VHI and, specifically, whether it will be sold.  The Minister, Deputy Harney, referred to this issue on a number of occasions.  She is considering the issue of authorisation of VHI as an insurer at present and the Government will deal with the authorisation as soon as possible.  The issue is raising the capital to allow for authorisation and there are obviously options in this regard.  All these will be considered by the Minister in framing the final document.</P>
        <P>I will take into account the issues raised by the Senators and will respond more directly on the next Stage of the Bill.</P>

    <Title>Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2009: Second Stage. </Title>
        <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="AineBrady"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy &Aacute;ine Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>I will begin by briefly outlining the six distinct purposes of the Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2009 in the order in which the relevant provisions appear in the Bill.  I will then speak in more detail about the policy objectives underpinning the Bill.</P>
        <P>The Bill advances Government policy on health service agency integration as put forward in the health service reform programme and more recently in regard to the rationalisation of State agencies generally, by providing for the integration of the National Council on Ageing and Older People and the Women&rsquo;s Health Council within the Department of Health and Children and the integration of the National Cancer Screening Service Board, the Drug Treatment Centre and the Crisis Pregnancy Agency within the Health Service Executive.  As part of this overall process, the Bill progresses Government policy on the establishment of the office with responsibility for older people within the Department of Health and Children.</P>
        <P>Second, the Bill provides for the transfer of ministerial responsibility for the local government superannuation scheme, health sector, from the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to the Minister for Health and Children.  The Bill also gives legal effect to amendments made to this scheme by the Minister.</P>
        <P>The third purpose of the Bill is the amendment of the Hepatitis C Compensation Tribunal Act 1997, as amended, to remove age limits for travel insurance benefit provided in accordance with that Act.  The Bill also provides for an amendment to the Mental Health Act 2001 to address difficulties in the operation of the Act which have arisen following a recent High Court judgment.  In addition, the Bill makes technical amendments to the Health Act 2007.  The Bill amends the National Cancer Registry Board (Establishment) Order 1991 in regard to the composition of the board.  This amendment to the establishment order is intended to facilitate the integration of the registry within the Health Service Executive in due course.</P>
        <P>Turning to the policy objectives of the Bill, I referred to the health service reform programme and, in this context, Senators will know that the rationalisation of health services agencies was one of the recommendations of the Prospectus report on the audit of structure and functions in the health system.  A number of such agencies had been established over several decades by successive Governments.  Each one of these played its part in the development of our health services.  However, by 2003, with over 55 different agencies, it was acknowledged that we were working with a system that was, in overall terms, unnecessarily complicated and fragmented.  A core principle underpinning this policy of streamlining was the achievement of better co-ordination and reduction in duplication and overlap of functions between agencies, through the amalgamation of bodies carrying out similar functions and operational work.  In the case of advisory bodies, the thinking underpinning the health reform programme was that the role of assisting a Minister in policy development should not, where possible, be devolved to outside agencies.</P>
        <P>As part of this planned rationalisation programme, several agencies were integrated within the Health Service Executive under the Health Act 2004 while provision was made in other legislation for the integration of a number of agencies within other bodies.</P><Col N="644"/>
        <P>Since that time, following on from the efficiency review announced in 2007 and the publication of the OECD Review of the Irish Public Service, the Government agreed a process of rationalisation of State agencies.  In the case of the health sector, the number of agencies is being reduced from 34 to 18.</P>
        <P>In this Bill, the programme of rationalisation is moved forward through the integration of the National Council on Ageing and Older People and the Women&rsquo;s Health Council within the Department of Health and Children and the integration of the National Cancer Screening Service Board, the Drug Treatment Centre Board and the Crisis Pregnancy Agency within the Health Service Executive.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The principle of integration in regard to these agencies had the general support of the D&aacute;il.  We must now build on what has been accomplished in the past by these agencies and work towards achieving all the advantages to be gained from co-ordination and integration.  During the debate on the Bill in the D&aacute;il, my colleagues made the point that efficiencies must be gained from the rationalisation process but that the primary aim of agency integration under the Bill is to streamline service delivery and policy making.  Efficiencies will be achieved over time from economies of scale and the elimination of duplication in areas such as recruitment, procurement, payroll and ICT systems.</P>
        <P>I stress that it was also made clear that the integration of the staff and work of these agencies will be carefully managed to ensure a seamless continuation of important services they provide.  Staff transferred under the Bill will bring their expertise and experience to the Department and the Health Service Executive.</P>
        <P>Before moving on to the other aspects of the Bill, I would like to pay tribute to the boards of these agencies and their employees for the work they have carried out over the years.  The National Council on Ageing and Older People has made a key contribution to policy development in respect of services for older people.  The Women&rsquo;s Health Council has had a significant part to play in facilitating policy formulation on women&rsquo;s health.  The work of the National Cancer Screening Service Board in early detection of cancer is well known and valued.  The Drug Treatment Centre Board has made an important contribution to the delivery of services for drug misusers.  The Crisis Pregnancy Agency has played a critical part in the delivery of strategies to reduce the number of crisis pregnancies.  I have no doubt that Senators share my views in this matter.</P>
        <P>I will deal with the transfer of ministerial responsibility for the local government superannuation scheme (health sector) from the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to the Minister for Health and Children.  Part 7 of the Bill confers the same powers on the Minister for Health and Children as were conferred on the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government under sections 2 and 4 of the Local Government (Superannuation) Act 1980 in respect of a range of health sector organisations.  All powers exercised by the Minister for Health and Children under sections 2 and 4 of the Local Government (Superannuation) Act 1980 since 1 February 2001 are confirmed and apply to all of the organisations mentioned in section 60.</P>
        <P>On the amendment of the hepatitis C legislation dealt with in the Bill, the position is that the Hepatitis C Compensation Tribunal (Amendment) Act 2006 provides for the setting up of an insurance scheme for persons infected with hepatitis C and HIV through the administration within the State of infected blood or blood products.  This provision is intended to assist persons with hepatitis C or HIV to obtain insurance where they would otherwise have difficulty in doing so on the open market.</P><Col N="645"/>
        <P>This amendment will provide for the removal of the 65 year age limit when applying for travel insurance under the scheme.  The scheme encompasses mortgage and life assurance and travel insurance.  The current legislation limits entry age to the scheme to 65 years.  The Minister has agreed that the age limit for travel insurance only should be removed, as this age restriction under the Act may make the availability of travel insurance cover to the relevant claimants under the scheme more limited than for persons who are not infected.</P>
        <P>The Minister is satisfied that any additional cost, which would be spread over many years, will be modest and can be met from within the costs originally provided for the scheme.</P>
        <P>On the amendment to the Mental Health Act 2001, the 2001 Act provides for the involuntary admission to approved centres of persons suffering from mental disorders.  The legislation also provides that where a person is acutely mentally ill and requires admission to hospital but is unwilling to travel to hospital voluntarily, the person may be brought to the hospital.  Section 13(2) of the 2001 Act places a statutory obligation on the clinical director of an approved centre to provide such assisted admissions where necessary, using &ldquo;staff of the approved centre&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>In recent High Court proceedings, a patient sought and was granted a declaration that her removal to a psychiatric hospital in April 2007 was not in accordance with section 13(2) of the Mental Health Act 2001.  The patient had been removed to the psychiatric hospital by an external agency contracted by the HSE to provide assisted admissions, where these could not be provided by the local service.  In his ruling the judge found that the meaning of the term &ldquo;member of staff&rdquo; is confined to an individual, and a corporate entity such as the external agency could not be a member of staff.</P>
        <P>This narrow interpretation of the term &ldquo;staff of the approved centre&rdquo; presents<i> </i>difficulties in the ongoing provision of an assisted admissions service.  In 2008 there were 2,004 involuntary admissions of which 604 were assisted; 42% or 250 of those assisted admissions were provided by the external agency and it is worth noting that all the assisted admissions in the Dublin-mid-Leinster region were provided by the external agency.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that the external agency has provided a very professional, high quality and safe assisted admission service for both the HSE and two private psychiatric hospitals since 2006.  To date, over 600 people have been safely brought to hospital by this agency and no complaints have been made about the service during that period, which is noteworthy when one considers the sensitive and potentially difficult nature of the service.</P>
        <P>The provision of the assisted admissions by a central agency enables the development of specialised expertise in the de-escalation of difficult situations, which is of immense value and ultimately makes the situation easier for the patient and the patient&rsquo;s family.  The company employs only fully qualified psychiatric nurses, all of whom have received intensive, specialised training, including appropriate interaction with service users and training on de-escalation and &ldquo;talk-down&rdquo; techniques.  The company complies with all Mental Health Commission guidelines and standards in its work.  It provides special transport with trained drivers and co-operates effectively with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na when its assistance is required.</P>
        <P>The amendment proposed is necessary to ensure that acutely mentally ill persons who require hospitalisation and who refuse to come to hospital voluntarily can be brought to the hospital by specially authorised persons, where the local service is not in a position to provide the necessary assisted admission.  It is proposed to amend sections 13 and 27 of the 2001 Act to provide that a clinical director can arrange for a person to be removed or returned to the approved centre by members of staff of the approved centre or by authorised persons.  The amendment provides that the registered proprietor of an approved centre may enter into a contract for the purposes of arranging externally assisted admissions; persons who are employed by the external agency will then be authorised in writing by the clinical director to <Col N="646"/>provide assisted admissions to his or her particular approved centre for a period not exceeding 12 months.</P>
        <P>It is also proposed to amend section 9(2) of the Mental Health Act 2001 to disqualify authorised persons from making an application to detain a person under the Act and thus ensure that no conflict of interest can arise.</P>
        <P>A question has arisen as to whether assisted admissions by the external agency to date are valid.  Counsel has advised that the Legislature has the power to ratify previous breaches of sections 13 and 27 and in these circumstances, and for the avoidance of doubt, a validation provision is included in the amendment to confirm all external agency assisted admissions to date.</P>
        <P>It is without question that we need an assisted admission service so that vulnerable people in need of care and treatment are not left in the community when they should be admitted to hospital.  It is also fundamentally important that such a service is available uniformly throughout the country.  However, to ensure the continuation of externally provided assisted admissions in circumstances where the local service is not in a position to provide the necessary assisted admission, we must amend our current legislation on the lines proposed.</P>
        <P>I have mentioned that the Bill makes technical amendments to the Health Act 2007.  That Act provided for the establishment of the Health Information and Quality Authority, the Office of the Chief Inspector of Social Services and a new inspection and registration system for residential centres for older people, children and people with disabilities.  Amendments to the Act in the Bill are technical drafting amendments.</P>
        <P>I also indicated that the Government&rsquo;s rationalisation programme for agencies included the integration of the national cancer registry within the Health Service Executive.  To prepare for this, the establishment order for the National Cancer Registry Board is being amended to change its provisions relating to board composition which currently provide for the Minister to appoint a board of up to ten persons nominated by various bodies.  The smooth integration of the registry with the Health Service Executive in due course will be facilitated through the forging of closer links at this point between the registry and the Health Service Executive&rsquo;s national cancer control programme.  The Bill, therefore, amends the provisions of the establishment order for the registry to allow the appointment of a seven person board with knowledge or experience of the functions of the board, including those related to Government policy on cancer control.</P>
        <P>Turning to the details of the Bill, Part 1, sections 1 to 3, contains standard provisions dealing with the Short Title, commencement date, definitions and expenses.</P>
        <P>Part 2 consists of sections 4 to 14.  Section 4 provides for the dissolution of the National Council on Ageing and Older People.  Section 5 dissolves the council.  Section 6 transfers rights and liabilities of the council to the Minister for Health and Children.  Section 7 transfers land, other property and any moneys, stocks and shares and securities of the council to the Minister.  Section 8 requires the Minister to cause final accounts of the council to be prepared and submit them to the Comptroller and Auditor General for audit.  Copies of the audited accounts and the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report on the accounts must be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.  Section 9 requires the Minister to cause a final report on the council&rsquo;s activities to be prepared and lay copies of the report before each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
        <P>Section 10 substitutes the name of the Minister for Health and Children for the name of the council in any pending legal proceedings to which the council is a party immediately before the commencement of Part 2.  The proceedings shall not abate by reason of such substitution.  Section 11 provides that every contract or agreement made between the council or any trustee <Col N="647"/>or agent thereof acting on its behalf, and any other person, which is in force immediately before the commencement of Part 2 shall continue in force and shall be construed and have effect as if the Minister were substituted therein for the council and shall be enforceable against the Minister.</P>
        <P>Section 12 provides that every person who, immediately before the commencement of Part 2, is an employee of the council shall, on the commencement of Part 2, hold an unestablished position in the Civil Service.  Save in accordance with a collective agreement negotiated with a recognised trade union or staff association concerned, a person transferred shall not, on the commencement of Part 2, be brought to less beneficial conditions of remuneration than the conditions of remuneration to which he or she was subject immediately before the commencement of Part 2.  The previous service of a person transferred shall be reckonable for the purposes of the employment legislation set out in section 12(3), subject to any exceptions or exclusions in that legislation.  Any superannuation benefits awarded to or in respect of a person transferred and the terms relating to these benefits shall be no less favourable than those applicable to or in respect of that person immediately before the commencement of Part 2.  The pension payments and other superannuation liabilities of the council in respect of its former employees become, on the commencement of Part 2, the liabilities of the Minister for Finance.  A person transferred under section 12 shall undertake such duties as the Minister may from time to time direct and shall be subject to and employed in accordance with the Civil Service Regulation Acts 1956 to 2005.</P>
        <P>Section 13 transfers each record held by the council immediately before the commencement of Part 2 to the Minister.  Section 14 revokes the establishment order for the National Council on Ageing and Older People.</P>
        <P>Part 3, sections 15 to 25, provides for the dissolution of the Women&rsquo;s Health Council.  The provisions of Part 3 are similar to those in Part 2 in regard to the National Council on Ageing and Older People.</P>
        <P>Part 4 consists of sections 26 to 36 and provides for the dissolution of the National Cancer Screening Service Board.  Section 28 transfers rights and liabilities of the board to the Health Service Executive.  Section 29 transfers land, other property and any moneys, stocks and shares and securities of the board to the Health Service Executive.  Section 30 requires the Health Service Executive to cause final accounts of the board to be prepared and submit them to the Comptroller and Auditor General for audit.  A copy of the audited accounts and the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report on the accounts shall be submitted to the Minister who shall lay copies of the audited accounts and the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report on the accounts before each House of the Oireachtas.  Section 31 requires the Health Service Executive to cause a final report to the Minister on the board&rsquo;s activities to be prepared.  The Minister shall lay copies of the final report before each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
        <P>Section 32 substitutes the name of the Health Service Executive for the name of the board in any pending legal proceedings to which the board is a party immediately before the commencement of Part 4.  The proceedings shall not abate by reason of such substitution.  Section 33 provides that every contract or agreement made between the board or any trustee or agent thereof acting on its behalf, and any other person, which is in force immediately before the commencement of Part 4 shall continue in force and shall be construed and have effect as if the Health Service Executive were substituted therein for the board and shall be enforceable against the Minister.</P>
        <P>Section 34 provides that every person who, immediately before the commencement of Part 4, is an employee of the board shall, on the commencement of Part 4, be transferred to and become an employee of the Health Service Executive.  Save in accordance with a collective <Col N="648"/>agreement negotiated with a recognised trade union or staff association concerned, a person transferred shall not, on the commencement of Part 4, be brought to less beneficial conditions of service, including conditions in relation to tenure, or remuneration to which he or she was subject immediately before the commencement of Part 4.  The previous service of a person transferred shall be reckonable for the purposes of the employment legislation set out in section 34(3), subject to any exceptions or exclusions in that legislation.  Any superannuation benefits awarded to or in respect of a person transferred and the terms relating to these benefits shall be no less favourable than those applicable to or in respect of that person immediately before the commencement of Part 4. The pension payments and other superannuation liabilities of the board in respect of its former employees become, on the commencement of Part 4, the liabilities of the Health Service Executive.  A person transferred under section 34 shall be subject to and employed in accordance with the Health Acts 1947 to 2008.</P>
        <P>Section 35 transfers each record held by the board immediately before the commencement of Part 4 to the Health Service Executive.  Section 36 revokes the National Cancer Screening Service Board (Establishment) Order 2006.</P>
        <P>Part 5, sections 37 to 47, provides for the dissolution of the Drug Treatment Centre Board and the provisions are similar to those in Part 4 for the dissolution of the Cancer Screening Service Board.</P>
        <P>Part 6, sections 48 to 59, provides for the dissolution of the Crisis Pregnancy Agency.  Again, the provisions are similar to those in Parts 4 and 5.  In addition, however, there is provision under section 50 for the transfer of functions from the Crisis Pregnancy Agency to the HSE in view of legal advice that the HSE may not currently have the statutory authority to carry out these functions.  Functions transferred under the Bill are: the preparation of a strategy to address the issue of crisis pregnancy in consultation with Departments of State and other appropriate persons; to work with appropriate agencies to promote and co-ordinate the attainment of the objectives contained in the strategy; to produce periodic reports on progress and to propose remedial action where required; to further the attainment of the objectives of the strategy by promoting public awareness, developing, promoting and disseminating information and information material and by fostering the provision of education and training; to draw up codes of best practice for consideration by agencies and individuals involved in providing services to women with crisis pregnancies; to promote and commission research into aspects of crisis pregnancy, as considered necessary; to furnish advice to the Minister and other Ministers on issues relating to crisis pregnancy; and to perform any other function in relation to crisis pregnancy that the Minister may assign.</P>
        <P>Part 7, section 60, confers the same powers on the Minister for Health and Children, from 1 February 2001, as were conferred on the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government under sections 2 and 4 of the Local Government (Superannuation) Act 1980 in respect of the organisations set out in that section.  Part 8, sections 61 to 64, provides for miscellaneous amendments to other legislation.  Section 61 provides for the amendment of the Hepatitis C Compensation Tribunal Act 1997 to remove the age limits in respect of the travel element of the insurance scheme established for persons infected with hepatitis C or HIV through the administration within the State of infected blood or blood products.  Section 62 amends the Mental Health Act 2001.  Section 63 makes technical drafting amendments to the Health Act 2007.  Section 64 amends article 5 of the National Cancer Registry Board (Establishment) Order 1991 to provide for the appointment by the Minister of a seven person board with knowledge or experience or relating to particular functions and other relevant competencies to assist the board in the performance of its functions.</P><Col N="649"/>
        <P>I conclude by again acknowledging, on behalf of the Minister and myself, the work of the agencies to be dissolved under this Bill and the commitment of their boards, past and present.  I commend the Bill to the house.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>This legislation is quite straightforward.  The only surprising thing about it is that it took so long for this work to start.  The Prospectus report which was published in 2001 or 2002 discussed rationalising services and agencies in all areas of Government.  Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, the then Minister, has the distinction of managing to set up the largest number of agencies while he was Minister.  We are now dismantling many of them.  The International Monetary Fund, IMF, has said it had little confidence in the Government in this country between 2002 and 2007 and alluded to the setting up of agencies to deal with everything and anything.</P>
        <P>Many of the agencies we are discussing today are incredibly good, and it is important the corporate memory of each is not lost when they are subsumed into the HSE.  The Government needs to move a little quicker to deal with the many other agencies, bodies and groups it established over the last decade which appear to serve little function when compared with the agencies being discussed in this legislation.  Perhaps the Minister in her reply will discuss the corporate memory of these agencies.  Once the agencies are subsumed into the HSE their employees will become like any other employee of the HSE and might find themselves transferred or moved around.  There is also the issue of the ethos of a good organisation.  The national cancer registry has a great ethos, is very well run and delivers great results.  One can rely on the registry; it is impartial and its results are accurate and can be quoted in comfort.  The crisis pregnancy agency has not shrunk from its responsibilities and often receives negative media coverage from certain vested interests that do not agree with what it is doing.</P>
        <P>On the other hand, there has been a litany of corporate disasters in the HSE.  It responds to criticism by either trying to bury or cover up the problem or by misleading the public on what has gone wrong.  I am concerned that the negative corporate memory that has developed in the HSE would seep into some of these agencies and that the information they produce would be tampered with, altered or changed to present the Government of the day in a more favourable light or that they will shrink from making difficult decisions or implementing difficult policies simply because they might be told to do so, not necessarily by a politician or Minister but by senior managers within the larger organisation.</P>
        <P>There is a problem with the senior management of the HSE.  Many people do not quite know what we mean but there is a serious problem with how senior management makes decisions, implements those decisions and shrinks from taking responsibility for crises in the organisation.  I have mentioned the Leas Cross report previously and I thank the Minister of State for providing me with a reply when I commented on that report.  When the Leas Cross report was published its release was delayed for months because every individual mentioned in it was given the right to reply.  The replies from some of the senior members of the HSE were an exercise in self defence and passing the buck.  They never accepted the responsibility that they might have had a part to play in what happened in Leas Cross.  Although I fully support rationalising and getting rid of some of these quangos, my greatest fear is that the agencies that were doing a good job will become like the HSE when they get sucked into that organisation.  If that happens, they might as well have been abolished.  They will become another group of employees pushing paper and getting shot down by senior management whenever they come up with a good idea that is considered controversial or difficult.  I hope that does not happen.</P>
        <P>Every agency of the State, including the Cabinet, should put the quote from the Ombudsman, Ms Emily O&rsquo;Reilly, over the door of its organisation.  She said: &ldquo;Public bodies and agencies begin to go bad when they begin to lose sight of why they are there in the first place.&rdquo;  It is an <Col N="650"/>excellent quote.  Agencies and organisations are established with the best intentions but as soon as they allow internal or external politics or the criticisms of vested interests to intrude, they cease to function in the way that was expected when they were established.  We see this all too often.  The problem has become worse in the last number of years and especially since the Freedom of Information Act was dismantled to some degree by the Government.</P>
        <P>There is always an element of secrecy within an organisation, whether it is a small private sector business, a big organisation such as the HSE or even politicians.  However, it has become all-pervasive in the sense that we try to bury every piece of information.  We have killed transparency and accountability to an extent because we are not prepared to accept any form of criticism or accountability when something happens.  It has worsened over the last decade.  The IMF spoke about the problems with Ireland&rsquo;s economy and poor Government policy making.  The Governments led by Deputy Bertie Ahern contributed hugely to that secrecy, which has been very bad for the public sector and the Civil Service.  Many of the people who work in organisations in the public sector and in the Civil Service should fight back to secure their autonomy.</P>
        <P>I said previously on the Order of Business that what the Governor of the Central Bank did on the day of the local and European elections was nothing short of a disgrace.  He started to talk about the green shoots in the economy although he clearly knew everything we now know about the regression of our economy, rising unemployment and the mess of our public finances.  He knew all these factors and was clearly trying to manipulate a result.  Even if he denies that charge he should have had enough cop-on not to have issued statements of that kind on the day of an election.  Even if he was completely innocent he should not have said such things because I and others like me will see his speech for what it was, as being far too political for somebody of his stature and with his role in Irish society.  This attitude appears to have percolated through the civil and public service in such a way that people are no longer prepared merely to say things in the way they are supposed to, making themselves less political.  This issue will become very important.  The HSE has become too political and because these kinds of organisations are being subsumed into it there is a genuine fear they may lose their independence and the good corporate structure they have had for so long. When the Minister of State is discussing such matters in the Department perhaps she should be a little bolder and decide not to subsume the people and the organisations.</P>
        <P>Perhaps it is time to look at the role of the National Treatment Purchase Fund.  The NTPF has been great for the approximately 50,000 people who received procedures under it but it has added very little to the overall health care of this country.  It is a private organisation set up by the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, to try to show the private sector as something special.  What should have taken place during the lifetime of the NTPF was significant and serious reform of the public health services to make them more efficient and work better.  The funding for the NTPF should have been used in that way.  During the NTPF&rsquo;s lifetime, the health services in Northern Ireland experienced much the same problems as those in the Republic.  Theirs were not as bad because more resources have been put into the national health service for a longer period but they were similar.  When the services in the North set out to deal with those problems they did not seek the solution of diverting money towards the private sector but set up small groups under clear ministerial direction.  These were not quangos but were very much the responsibility of the respective Ministers. They dealt with many of their problems in a very effective way, using public resources and delivering for the public.</P>
        <P>In recent years when money was sloshing around under this Government &mdash; a false economy as we know now &mdash; we did not tackle the very serious problems in the delivery of health care.  It is amazing that only one third of our people are entitled to free primary health care services, <Col N="651"/>namely, free access to a general practitioner, and they must pay &euro;100 per day for hospital services.  It costs every taxpayer approximately &euro;3,000 to deliver that service, but north of the Border people have free GP and primary care, free hospital care, delivered and achieved.  This is not an ideological point but is about getting the best value for money and being able to deliver for the people whom one is supposed to serve.  Perhaps the Minister of State should begin considering whether the days of the NTPF are over and whether we should focus on delivering and working and making the public health service work for the country.  When the Minister of State replies perhaps she will give an indication of how much she expects to save when this legislation is passed and the changes are applied.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GeraldineFeeney"><NameTxt>Senator Geraldine Feeney</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy &Aacute;ine Brady, to the House and thank her for her very comprehensive presentation.  She outlined the Bill line for line in a very clear and coherent manner.</P>
        <P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on the Bill, which is very technical and much needed.  There is not a man, woman or child in Ireland who did not want a reduction in the number of State agencies.  We spoke earlier on another Bill with the Minister of State&rsquo;s colleague, Deputy John Moloney, the Minister of State with responsibility for mental health, during which time I agreed with many points made by my colleague on the opposite side, my good friend, Senator Twomey.  We laughed because I agreed with so much of what he said, but I do not agree with what he said on this Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>They got to Senator Feeney over lunch.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GeraldineFeeney"><NameTxt>Senator Geraldine Feeney</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Twomey must not have had a good lunch because he really had a go at the HSE.  I smile because the Senator welcomed the Bill and acknowledged that rationalisation is needed, for all the right reasons.  However, having said that, he had a right old barney at the HSE to which I will respond later.</P>
        <P>Like Senator Twomey, I believe the Bill is very good and much needed.  It may have been long awaited but I am glad it is here.  It will certainly bring more clarification to what is going on and will bring together the people who served on councils such as the National Council on Ageing and Older People, the Women&rsquo;s Health Council, the National Cancer Screening Service, the Drug Treatment Centre and the Crisis Pregnancy Agency.  This is in addition to dealing with superannuation, for example, which the Minister of State rightly said should be taken from the remit of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and placed under the auspices of the Department of Health and Children.  There are also the many changes to the Mental Health Act, which arose from that court case last summer.</P>
        <P>One of the important points, especially in the bad economic downturn we are experiencing, is value for money and the efficiencies that can be achieved.  There is no doubt the Bill&rsquo;s measures will bring these about, resulting in value for money and money being better spent.</P>
        <P>Senator Twomey has a fear the agencies now going into the HSE may be contaminated by it.  I do not agree they bring bad press on themselves.  Paper will not refuse ink.  The majority of those who work in the HSE are very hard-working public servants who do not deserve the bad press they get from irresponsible reporters.  I say to Senator Twomey that the councils and boards to be incorporated into the HSE will bring their expertise to that body and it will also be beneficial for them because they will be at the coalface, a very important strategic move for them.</P>
        <P>I am glad to see there will be a reduction in the number of agencies in the health service, from 34 to 18.  As the Minister of State presented her speech, it struck me that everything has been done in  a very methodical and well thought out way.  She discussed the transfer of lands, <Col N="652"/>other properties, moneys, stocks, shares and securities of the board to the HSE and it sounded almost like a will.  I was beginning to wish I was a member of the HSE, getting some of these goodies that are coming.  The final accounts will be prepared and submitted to the Comptroller and Auditor General for audit and ultimately the audited accounts and the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General  will be presented to the Minister and then to both Houses of the Oireachtas.  It appears to be, and I am sure it will turn out to be so, a well thought out process and will go through in a coherent and simple way.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Senator Twomey agreed with the IMF&rsquo;s advice on a reduction in the number of agencies.  Everybody does, and we have no problem with that, but I disagree with his statement that from 2002 to 2007 agencies mushroomed and were set up in considerable numbers.  A great deal of work was done.  Senator Twomey was in the Lower House then but we both sat on the Joint Committee on Health and Children and had many meetings regarding this matter.  He will remember that much good work was done within the Department by the Ministers, Deputies Martin and Harney.</P>
      
        <P>As the Minister of State made her presentation, my attention was drawn to the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005 which regulated a group of ten or 12 professions, including dieticians, physiotherapists and chiropodists, for the first time.  This was done with patient safety and care in mind.  Ground-breaking provisions were introduced in terms of health.  Between 2002 and 2007, the Department of Health and Children was doing many good things in which Senator Twomey and I played a role.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State has rightly pointed out the wonderful successes that are BreastCheck, the Drug Treatment Centre Board and the Crisis Pregnancy Agency.  From a woman&rsquo;s point of view, I must take my hat off to the breast screening facility and BreastCheck.  The latter has been rolled out in my area.  Only one other area remains to be covered, namely, Donegal.  That roll-out is either in progress or is imminent.  In County Sligo where I live, women are availing of BreastCheck and are glad to have it.  It is a great service and I would love to see the screening of other cancers about which we have spoken in the House, but that matter is for another day.</P>
        <P>The Bill is important, but the case of a young mother involuntarily detained in a mental hospital, which was highlighted in the courts last summer, was scary to say the least.  From reading newspapers, we all know what occurred.  She was out walking when she was taken to a mental institution.  I could never understand what constituted &ldquo;staff of the approved centre&rdquo; until I read the Bill and realised that the reference was probably to agency staff.  As we know, nursing involves a lot of agency staff.  Many private and public hospitals and nursing homes use a considerable number of agency staff personnel.  As the Minister of State pointed out, there is a greater usage of agency nurses in the mid-Leinster and Dublin regions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamTwomeyIND"><NameTxt>Senator Liam Twomey</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not mean to correct Senator Feeney, but the staff are not agency staff as she and I may know them.  There is an agency, but its staff are permanent.  It is a trained team that collects the patients in question.</P>

      </Speaker>

	<P>It is a specially trained agency.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GeraldineFeeney"><NameTxt>Senator Geraldine Feeney</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senator for pointing that out, as I did not realise.  As the Leader would say, one is learning something all of the time.  I am glad to hear Senator Twomey&rsquo;s point.  At the time, I read that the woman needed to be taken in that manner to <Col N="653"/>ensure the safety of the patient and the wider public.  The situation is always improving, in that mental health carers, be they nurses or doctors, are highly trained and no one else could do that type of work.  I welcome the amending legislation is this regard, given the issues of patient and public safety.</P>
        <P>There is no doubt we are gone from the days of long ago when people who acted in a way that was other than the norm as it was then known were put in mental institutions because there was nowhere else to put them.  Who decided the norm?  In some cases, they were incarcerated.  I have finished reading a good book, <i>The Secret Scripture</i>.  Given that other people are smiling, other Members have read it as well.  It tells the story of a woman who, as with those to whom I have just referred, grew up normally, got married and had stuff go wrong.  It is a true story and I recommend it to everyone.  It is a great read, but frightening.  When I finished it, I said, &ldquo;Thank God&rdquo;, because I knew what occurred to her could never occur in the Ireland of today.</P>
        <P>I thank the Minister of State for outlining every section and provision of the Bill in a clear and coherent way.  I look forward to the Bill&rsquo;s remaining Stages in the House next week.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State.  This is one of a flurry of Bills arriving in the House.  In this area, we sometimes get miscellaneous provisions Bills, such as the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill.  There is an outbreak of miscellaneous provisions Bills.  It is rather a pity that there is such a rag-bag approach because the Bill before us contains important elements, some of which I welcome and others I will probe further.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State used the word &ldquo;rationalisation&rdquo; repeatedly.  I hope it will be rationalisation in the full sense as opposed to just a mathematical division.  I note her comment that, following the efficiency review of various agencies, &ldquo;the Government agreed a process of rationalisation of State agencies&rdquo; and that, in the health sector, &ldquo;the number of agencies is being reduced from 34 to 18&rdquo;.  That cut of 50% will be admirable if it is accompanied by real rationalisation, namely, retaining appropriate staff, preventing damage to the professional relationships within the area and, most crucially, maintaining delivery of service to the public.  I would like to believe this will be the case.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State referred to the integration of the National Council on Ageing and Older People and the Women&rsquo;s Health Council within the Department.  I take it that they will be individually integrated as opposed to being merged, which would not be rational.  Speaking as a 65 year old pseudo-male, there are also elderly male persons.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not claiming total macho credits.  As a matter of principle, the rationalisation should be rational and should have full intellectual justification unlike the Government&rsquo;s decentralisation programme, which is really a disintegration programme, in that people were moved inappropriately and some valuable skills were lost.  It is important we retain the most significant skills.</P>
        <P>I am concerned about some aspects of the Bill.  For example, the Drug Treatment Centre Board was mentioned.  We all know that cities such as Dublin are on the brink of another heroin epidemic, yet there does not even seem to be enough money to cope with the current situation.  The street prices of heroin and other opiates are decreasing.  We are in a serious economic crisis and it is inappropriate for people such as me to keep telling the Government that it must spend more money here and cut money somewhere else, but mere economising would worry me.</P>
        <P>My colleague, Senator Feeney, referred to the question of people who are mentally ill.  She referred to Sebastian Barry&rsquo;s remarkable novel.  He started his writing career while he was a <Col N="654"/>tenant in my basement in North Great George&rsquo;s Street.  Simultaneously, Anne Enright was a tenant.  I believe they both won the Booker Prize.  Both the attic and the basement won the Booker Prize and I was the boring bit in the middle.</P>
        <P>There is another book that has not been mentioned but which is at least as striking, namely, <i>Bird&rsquo;s Nest Soup</i>, the autobiography of a woman from County Westmeath called Hanna<?oasys _jy ?>Greally.  She was incarcerated because she was perceived as a little bit socially awkward by her family.  She was kept in an institution for about 40 years but her human personality remained unfractured.  A remarkable young doctor discovered the woman was totally sane and had just been institutionalised for social reasons.  That is why I listened with some interest to the coy euphemisms employed by the Minister of State in her speech.  She referred to persons who are acutely mentally ill and require admission to hospital but who are &ldquo;unwilling to travel to hospital voluntarily&rdquo;.  That is a very nice euphemistic phrase.  The people are probably admitted kicking and screaming, with their foot up against the ambulance door in some cases.  We therefore need to be absolutely realistic.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State referred to &ldquo;assisted admissions&rdquo;.  I can imagine what the assistance consists of.  She referred also to the use, where necessary, of &ldquo;staff of the approved centre&rdquo;.  She mentioned well-known recent proceedings in the High Court pertaining to the case of someone who did not like being &ldquo;assisted voluntarily&rdquo; in being admitted.  The lady took a case and part of her case, focusing on the legal inadequacy of the admission process, concerned the fact that she was admitted with the assistance of some external agencies, in other words, hired help.  I am not impugning these agencies as I am sure they may be very well qualified but the intriguing point was that the judge found in his ruling that the meaning of the term &ldquo;member of staff&rdquo; is confined to an individual and that a corporate entity such as an external agency could not be a member of staff.  The Minister of State commented that this is a &ldquo;narrow interpretation&rdquo; of the term &ldquo;staff of the approved centre&rdquo;.  Narrow my fanny: it is perfectly obvious that the interpretation is correct.  Anybody reading that would know perfectly well one cannot just define a franchise as a member of staff.  It is not a member of staff and the judge was making a perfectly straightforward and obvious comment.  It may be the case that there is room for external agencies but I caution against going too far, for financial reasons, in the direction of franchising and privatisation.  The Americans have gone down that road in every area, from medical services to prison administration, with consequences that are not always humane.</P>
        <P>It was very interesting that there were 2004 involuntary admissions in 2008, of which 604 were assisted.  In other words, 604 of those admitted were resisting so vigorously that they had to be pushed in.  We should obtain as much information as possible on this.  It is very interesting that a cross-party group has been established on mental health.  It met some days ago in the audiovisual room.  We should investigate the matter because we do not want to repeat the mistakes of the past.</P>
        <P>Let me say a few words about the Crisis Pregnancy Agency, which emerged in troubled times after the decision on the X case.  It is a very important institution.  I said in a previous session of Parliament that I was a tutor in Trinity College for ten years.  The university authorities were a bit anxious about me and concerned for the moral welfare of the students, with the result that I never had anything in trousers in my chamber of students.  I got a collection of skirts &mdash; I got 80 female students, with not one man among them.  They obviously believed I was such soiled goods that I would be non-judgmental.  Once a year a young woman would come to me with a crisis pregnancy and I was able to tell her of the existence of non-directive counselling agencies.  Of probably ten such women, one had an abortion.  I am convinced this is because I was able to give the girls information dispassionately and access to a place where the hysteria would be removed, where the appropriate questions would be put to them and where arrange<Col N="655"/>ments would be made if they decided to have the child, although there would possibly be emotional consequences.  It is essential that there is some advice available before and afterwards.  This is really important, regardless of what people believe about abortion, which is always sad.  Sometimes it may be the better of two options.  It is terribly important that women have treatment, therapy or advice after termination.</P>
        <P>I welcome the fact that the Crisis Pregnancy Agency has a non-directive approach.  It cannot and does not recommend abortion to clients but can give information.  The Minister of State should, for God&rsquo;s sake, maintain this position because it is the best way to reduce the number of abortions.  There are puritan ideologues outside and within the Houses who are so extreme in their views on this subject that they would say one should not give out information on abortion.  This is foolish and counterproductive because the best way to reduce the number of abortions is to allow people the dignity of having as much information as possible.  The Crisis Pregnancy Agency has been able to produce figures showing this is the case.</P>
        <P>The agency is mandated to reduce the number of crisis pregnancies and reduce the number of women choosing abortion as an outcome of pregnancy.  Nothing is said about condemning abortion.  The agency is also mandated to safeguard women&rsquo;s physical and mental health following termination of pregnancy.  What progress has been achieved in this regard?  There has been a decrease of 30%.  This is not just vague waffle from a retired tutor from Trinity College because I refer to a fact, an actual percentage.  The reduction is the result of giving information and of being adult and mature.  There has been a 20% decrease in the number and rate of births to teenagers and a 43% decrease in the number of teenagers travelling from Ireland to the United Kingdom for an abortion.  It is worthwhile pausing to thank the agency.  It has done a remarkable service, not just to the women of Ireland but to the population as a whole.  I hope the Government will continue to support the agency in every way.</P>
        <P>The Crisis Pregnancy Agency has, in these very difficult times, managed to increase its contact hours and services to women, which I very much welcome.  The Minister of State, I am sure, is familiar with the kind of brief I have received on the agency.  The agency has a number of issues and targets.  The targets include achieving better access to information on contraception and contraceptive services for those identified to be at special risk of crisis pregnancy and improving the standards and quality of contraceptive services.  It is not just enough for one to have actual contraceptives as one needs to be given information on how precisely to use them.  Not providing this information is the reason for the failure of some of them.  Proper information, guidance and policies on human sexuality and relationships are required in schools.  We have not progressed nearly far enough in this regard.</P>
        <P>My briefing note states that the chairperson of the Crisis Pregnancy Agency is Katherine Bulbulia, who was a distinguished Member of this House but who is now no longer directly involved in party politics.  It is very heartening to see that somebody of her calibre is chairperson.  She was an excellent advocate for women&rsquo;s health in this House, as was my former colleague, Dr. Mary Henry.  Ms Bulbulia is continuing her valuable work through this excellent agency.  I urge the Minister to ensure the Government continues its support for this work.</P>

	<P>I join my colleagues in welcoming the Minister of State.  I also welcome the reduction in the number of agencies from 34 to 18.  In the times we are in, this is a welcome rationalisation provided the services continue to be delivered but more efficiently.  It is an opportunity to streamline and focus on these issues in an effective way.  I especially welcome the Minister of State&rsquo;s reassurance that the skills and expertise of the staff attached to these agencies will not be lost because the staff will join the Department of Health and Children.</P><Col N="656"/>
        <P>In respect of the amendment to the Mental Health Act 2001, the Minister of State highlighted the specialisation required to ensure patient safety in dealing with involuntary admissions.  The amendment provides for expert and skilled assistance.  The Minister of State&rsquo;s speech gave us pause to reflect that on occasion involuntary admissions are resisted.  The changes in recent years have made us much more cognisant of the circumstances that make such admissions permissible which has been in the best interest of the patients and in accordance with best practice.  It is useful to remind ourselves that involuntary admissions can take place only under the clear criterion that the person represents either a danger to him or herself or to others.  While the criterion is more clearly defined we have not had much opportunity to consider the admission process.  This can be a highly distressing and traumatic event for someone who is quite ill and it is useful for us to consider that the patient should come into contact only with skilled people.  The Minister of State&rsquo;s focus on the need for these people to be skilled and trained in this area is welcome.  That helps to minimise the trauma and distress and the risk of injury to the person, to the staff or to others.  I welcome that focus.</P>
        <P>I also welcome the removal of age limits for travel insurance for people who are infected with hepatitis C.  This will have a practical and positive impact on people&rsquo;s quality of life.  The legislation makes technical amendments to the Health Act 2007 which provided for the establishment of the Health Information and Quality Authority, the office of the chief inspector of social services and a new inspection and registration system for residential centres for older people, children and people with disabilities.  While I accept a great deal of work is involved in implementing this important Act, it has a real impact on the protection of these groups of people.  I welcome the continued commitment to the implementation of that Act.</P>
        <P>The Bill provides for the transfer of several functions of the Crisis Pregnancy Agency to the Department, including the preparation of a strategy to address the problem of crisis pregnancy in consultation with Departments and other appropriate persons.  In all the debates on this sensitive and upsetting topic there has tended to be a focus on abortion whereas the real problem has been crisis pregnancy.  It is of much greater benefit to keep a focus on how to address that issue.  The Crisis Pregnancy Agency sent us some briefing notes on the Bill.  It states that one purpose of the agency has been to ensure women faced with a crisis pregnancy would be offered &ldquo;real and positive alternatives to abortion&rdquo;.  It is important we keep that focus.  One service that provides a very real alternative is Cura.  Last year there were concerns about its funding.  It is very important that such an agency receives funding.  What is the impact of the dissolution of the Crisis Pregnancy Agency on service providers such as Cura?  I welcome the Bill and wish the Minister of State well.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Senator Brendan Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Labour Party has no major difficulty with the substance of this legislation but we are concerned about its results and the work carried out by the various agencies to be subsumed into the Department of Health and Children and the HSE.  We must preserve the functions carried out by the agencies and ensure such functions continue while not being in any way reduced.  As the Women&rsquo;s Health Council says, we must safeguard the knowledge or institutional memory built up by these organisations.  A significant number of people work in the Department of Health and Children and that number decreased only a small amount when the HSE was set up.  We strongly endorse proposals for the rationalisation of the HSE, especially in the middle and other management grades.</P>
        <P>The Crisis Pregnancy Agency was established in 2001 following the fifth report of the Oireachtas all-party committee with a remit to offer real and positive alternatives to abortion.  Contraceptive services were and still are poorly developed in this country.  According to the Crisis Pregnancy Agency, crisis pregnancy is not tracked or measured internationally.  Irish <Col N="657"/>research indicates that 28% of women and 23% of men are affected by a crisis pregnancy in their lifetime.  It is not something that just affects teenagers.  Less than 1% of pregnancies end in adoption; 15% end in abortion while the remainder end in parenting the child.</P>
        <P>Progress has been measured and is detailed as a decrease of 30% in the number of women travelling to the UK from Ireland for abortions; a 20% decrease in the rate of births to teenagers and a 43% decrease in the number of teenagers travelling from Ireland to the UK for abortions, a decrease from 6% to 3.8%.</P>
        <P>The Crisis Pregnancy Agency has succeeded in bringing to the table services with opposing ideological viewpoints, keeping them there and encouraging them to work in collaboration on developing standards, resources and advertising.  In this context, the Labour Party is concerned that the work of the agency should continue.  The agency had an extremely precise brief; it promoted public awareness and brought together those with opposing points of view in its efforts to reduce the number of abortions carried out on Irish women.</P>
        <P>The decline in front-line services is evident throughout the entire spectrum of services provided by the State.  Mental health services are affected; I refer to the addiction and counselling services being cut in certain areas by as much as 50%.  The HSE must honour its promises on mental health and fill all vacant nursing posts.  I am aware of the very great need to save money in all sections but cutting services to children with special needs, particularly those on the autistic spectrum, is seriously flawed.  It will create a considerably heavier burden in the future with a far greater cost and will do a huge disservice to these children.</P>
        <P>I see great merit in eliminating the duplication of services throughout all Departments if the savings can be invested in vital front-line services.  On this point, will there be a monitoring system to ensure the work of these agencies will continue and that top-class services will be provided?  What tools will be used to measure effectiveness?  Will the Bill save money?</P>
        <P>I continue to be concerned that funding which is supposedly red circled for specific health programmes such as palliative care, physical and intellectual disability and Traveller health has been diverted to other areas of health.  It is a matter of continuing regret that the &euro;10 million announced last year for a cervical screening programme was pulled.  We will continue to insist that preventive life-saving vaccines should be a priority and we feel very strongly that this screening programme should go ahead.</P>
        <P>The National Council on Ageing and Older People is a very necessary group and I and other Members of my party have met many of its members.  Its voice should continue to be heard in the Department.  Better health outcomes were a positive benefit of medical cards for the over 70s as they allowed people to avail of checkups, which in turn prevented a deterioration in health.  Carers have many well-founded concerns, with many people now contacting my office with concerns about a reduction in home help hours.  I am informed that respite is increasingly more difficult to access and this is a retrograde step because we know how necessary it is for those who take care of people with challenging conditions.</P>
        <P>The cancer strategy for the country has given cause for concern as a line from Galway to Dublin sees a lack of centres of excellence above it.  Has any audit been done on the National Treatment Purchase Fund?  What has been its effect?  Since 2002, the Labour Party has been proposing a universal health insurance scheme.  It is a fair system and should be re-examined.  We should examine models that work in other countries and implement policies which put patients first.</P>

	<P>I have been pursuing the case of an 89 year old Balbriggan woman who is ready for release from Beaumont Hospital.  Her family has identified an available public bed in Gormanstown, a couple of miles away.  She cannot be released because no funding is available from the HSE.  Unfortunately, she is not alone as 130 older people are in a similar situation in Beaumont Hospital holding up beds in the system.  I understand no one in similar circumstances has been released from Beaumont Hospital since 15 January and this is July.  This is a disgrace and something must be done about it.  It is a false economy and cannot be allowed to continue.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DeirdredeBurca"><NameTxt>Senator D&eacute;irdre de B&uacute;rca</NameTxt>
	<P>The Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill is the first of a number of legislative measures that will come before us in an attempt to rationalise and introduce greater efficiencies in the agencies and statutory bodies we have established over the years.  It is interesting to hear the squeals of outrage already coming from the other side of the House from parties which state that if they were in Government they would implement greater efficiencies and on the need to ensure that the public service delivers more effectively.  We are all aware that there are less resources available to us and that we will have to rationalise and implement efficiencies.  The aim of the Bill is to do so in a way that will not see their functions significantly diminished in any way but that will recognise the need to be more efficient and achieve cost savings in the way the services are run.</P>
        <P>From the discussions we have had about our health services, we are all aware that over the years perhaps there has been an over-concentration on administrative infrastructure and much less on front-line services.  Whatever efficiencies we implement now we must ensure the front-line services of our health system in particular are protected and supported.  We must ensure this legislation works in a way that will not negatively impact on front-line health services.  When we consider how the health boards were dissolved to establish the Health Service Executive, which was supposed to be about rationalisation and making more efficient the administration of the health services, particularly at local level, I do not believe those efficiencies were achieved and part of the reason was that the emphasis was more on preserving administrative structures than on the more important issue of front-line services.  Let us learn from this experience and ensure that the way in which the necessary rationalisation that will occur over the coming years happens in a way that prioritise front-line services.</P>
        <P>The Long Title of the Bill describes it as &ldquo;an Act to provide for the dissolution of the National Council on Ageing and Older People, the Women&rsquo;s Health Council, the National Cancer Screening Service Board, the Drug Treatment Centre Board and the Crisis Pregnancy Agency&rdquo;.  Effectively, we are discussing merging these bodies with the Health Service Executive and in two cases, those of the Women&rsquo;s Health Council and the National Council on Ageing and Older People, redeploying the staff into the broader Civil Service.  It would be a mistake to assume that because these bodies are being restructured that any lesser priority will be given to these policy areas.</P>
        <P>I am a little concerned that two of the bodies are concerned with women&rsquo;s health.  I hope the Minister of State will reassure me that their functions will be just as effectively delivered in the new form in which they will exist, particularly those of the Crisis Pregnancy Agency.  Other speakers have discussed the importance of the role and function of the Crisis Pregnancy Agency and just because it is being absorbed into the HSE does not mean it has to perform or deliver its services in any less effective way.  The dissolution of these bodies will mean the transfer of their functions, assets, liabilities, officers and staff members.  The legislation has attempted to look after all of the issues that might arise in this transfer.</P>
        <P>I wish to focus on the Crisis Pregnancy Agency because it has performed a very useful function since it was established in 2000.  In this country, the strong right to life protections for <Col N="659"/>the unborn, the right to life provision that exists in our Constitution and the very difficult and prolonged debates we have had on the subject of abortion mean we are obliged to back up our rhetoric on such constitutional protections with resources and services.  In terms of the establishment of the Crisis Pregnancy Agency, that was done.  Its establishment was recommended in 2000 and it was specifically charged with reducing the number of crisis pregnancies and ensuring women who faced  a crisis pregnancy were offered real and positive alternatives to abortion.  It was established in 2001 and at that time there was clearly a deficit of services, resources and public health campaigns aimed at empowering men and women with the skills and knowledge to prevent unwanted conception.</P>
        <P>We know from the research that has been carried out that crisis pregnancy affects 28% of women and 23% of men.  The research also suggests women may be experiencing crisis pregnancy at a younger age than before.  The average age for women tends to be approximately 23 years of age and 24 years of age for men.  Approximately 15% of women experiencing a crisis pregnancy will have an abortion.  Those are the figures we need to keep them in mind when we are examining the continuance of the services provided by the Crisis Pregnancy Agency.</P>
        <P>The agency was mandated with reducing the number of crisis pregnancies, reducing the number of women choosing abortion as an outcome of crisis pregnancies and safeguarding women&rsquo;s physical and mental health following the termination of pregnancy.  Its progress and achievements have been considerable to date.  It reported a decrease of 30% in the number of women travelling from Ireland to the UK for abortion, a 20% decrease in the number and rate of births to teenagers and a 43% decrease in the number of teenagers travelling from Ireland to the UK for an abortion.  In 2001 the figure was 932, which dropped to 530 teenagers in 2007, a considerable drop.</P>
        <P>Other improvements brought about by the agency include more than a doubling in the number of crisis pregnancy counselling services nationwide, free services being provided in 50 locations nationwide, and providing for a range of choices for potential clients in terms of the range of services offered on a geographic basis.  There has been an increase in crisis pregnancy counselling hours of 35% and an increased provision and uptake in post abortion medical services of 37%.</P>
        <P>Other contributions for which the agency has been responsible include delivering and evaluating the first strategic plan on crisis pregnancy.  It is midway through the implementation of its second strategy.  It developed a standardised framework and associated NUI-accredited training programme to improve counselling provision.  It published 25 research reports related to crisis pregnancy prevention and support and built research capacity in the field of sexual research.  It also worked with the Department of Education and Science to increase the implementation of relationships and sexuality education in post-primary schools.</P>
        <P>The Bill concerns dissolving the agency and merging it with the Health Service Executive.  The onus on the Government now is to ensure the proud track record of the agency since 2001 is continued in the new form in which it finds itself within the structures of the HSE.  Some recommendations made by the agency on sustaining and progressing the advances it has made to date include the need for better access to and information on contraception and contraceptive services, especially for identified groups at risk of crisis pregnancy, and the need for measurable improvements in knowledge about relationships and sexuality amongst adolescents, a lot of which depends on the programmes we are implementing in our schools.  Other recommendations include the need for improved access to and delivery of crisis pregnancy counselling services and post-abortion medical and counselling services throughout the country, the need to introduce recognised standards and regulation for crisis pregnancy services, and the need to improve the range of supports to make the continuation of pregnancy more attractive.  A range <Col N="660"/>of areas need to be progressed further and require considerable work to be done to ensure the track record of the agency to date as a stand-alone agency is continued and its very important work and achievements are continued into the future.</P>
        <P>I am happy to support this Bill, subject to the points I made on the continued delivery of the excellent service to date under the new structures proposed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State and his officials to the House to debate this very important Bill.  I want to focus on specific aspects of the Bill, those being the dissolution of the Women&rsquo;s Health Council and the National Cancer Screening Services board and the transfer of all their rights and liabilities to the board of the HSE.</P>
        <P>We are all aware of the national cancer strategy and a lot of faith has been placed in it by the Government under the stewardship of the HSE and Professor Tom Keane.  I want to focus on the south east and on Waterford Regional Hospital which has been identified as a regional centre of excellence.  Recent studies have noted that the word &ldquo;excellence&rdquo; needs to be re-examined owing to the many shortcomings identified in the delivery of cancer care in the region, due mainly to a lack of resources, staffing and other issues.  Questions still need to be answered on the appropriate and proper delivery of cancer care in the region.</P>
        <P>All the cancer care disciplines are delivered in Waterford Regional Hospital, bar one very important treatment, namely, radiotherapy.  It is currently delivered through a private contract with the HSE and the Whitfield Clinic in Waterford.  It has been reported in local media that there are contractual problems between the HSE and Whitfield Clinic with regard to the clear understanding of the radiotherapy services that are available and are being delivered in the region.  It is something the Minister and the HSE need to focus on to iron out any difficulties or problems.</P>
        <P>There have been many public rallies in Waterford calling on the Government to provide public radiotherapy facilities at Waterford Regional Hospital.  That is the position of many people in the region and remains so.  They will not be happy until there are full public radiotherapy treatment facilities available at the centre of excellence, as the HSE likes to call it, in Waterford Regional Hospital.</P>
        <P>With regard to women&rsquo;s health and cancer care, I have raised the issue of BreastCheck on a number of occasions in the House, as have some of my colleagues in the D&aacute;il.  My understanding is that BreastCheck is not fully rolled out in Waterford.  It is in Dungarvan, a larger county town, but not in Waterford city and many of the county areas.</P>
        <P>There is no better way to display how a service is delivered than to see the evidence locally.  I was contacted by a lady in her late 50s who has a long history of cysts on her breasts and, unfortunately for her and her family, there is a history of the same cancer in the family.  She is considered a very high risk patient.  Since the discovery of the cysts on her breasts, she has had a mammogram every 12 months in Waterford Regional Hospital until two years ago.  When the consultant, Mr. Gordon Watson, retired &mdash; he had delivered great service to Waterford &mdash; a replacement was appointed. BreastCheck was then supposedly implemented and brought into the Waterford area.  The lady was told by the HSE in Waterford Regional Hospital that she had been transferred onto the BreastCheck list for her annual check-ups.  When she enquired with BreastCheck as to when she would be examined, she was told examinations were held occasionally in Dungarvan and not in Waterford city, and no date was given to her.  She has now been waiting almost three years for a mammogram, which is totally unacceptable for a women in her position.</P><Col N="661"/>
        <P>We are discussing women&rsquo;s health.  She is a women who has a history and has already had cancer identified in her and her family.  She cannot present for an annual mammogram in Waterford Regional Hospital unless she already has a lump.  If we are discussing early detection of cancer, it is a disgrace for a person who is already high risk and has been identified as such not to be allowed to have a mammogram in the public service.  When she went where she had been referred to, she again could not get a date from BreastCheck.  It is not acceptable that this situation is pertinent.  This is the state of play of our cancer care and is how we are looking after our women in the present climate.  I appeal to the Minister of State and his officials to bring this to the attention of the Department and the HSE to find out whether this issue can be resolved once and for all.  BreastCheck must be fully rolled out for those women who present with real concerns and who are not sleeping at night due to the worry of their cancer history.  This issue should be prioritised by the HSE and the Department so that when women present for BreastCheck, they will be seen and their minds put at rest.  Early detection will save the State money, save lives and improve health.  If it is implemented properly, it will do justice to the health needs of all in this country.</P>
        <P>Waterford city has the largest population base in the south-east region but it still does not have BreastCheck.  The cancer care services, while they have developed to some degree in the region, are not the centre of excellence the HSE would like us to believe they are.  We should strive for that excellence.  This side of the House will co-operate when we see the results delivered.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State and his officials.  I remind Senator de B&uacute;rca that the Fine Gael Party is in favour of greater efficiencies and creating better value for money, be that in health or any other sphere of the public service.  However, we will oppose and resist the issues causing legitimate concern to many organisations and people with regard to the quality of service for patients.  People matter.  It is extraordinary, given Senator de B&uacute;rca&rsquo;s contribution, that the Green Party has now become so embroiled in Government and so subsumed into Fianna F&aacute;il that we might see them as one entity before the end of this D&aacute;il term.</P>
        <P>To deal with the Bill, it is important that we preserve the function of the agencies.  They cannot be allowed to disappear within the HSE or the Department of Health and Children, or simply evaporate.  I note the lexicon of the HSE now includes &ldquo;reconfiguration&rdquo; and &ldquo;rationalisation&rdquo;.  In plain language, this means the elimination and reduction of services.  I am fearful we will have a loss of autonomy and a loss of policy-driven focus in these agencies so it is important we safeguard their functions and roles.  What review mechanism will be in place to ensure the policies and functions of these agencies are implemented?  The Minister of State might respond to this question.</P>
        <P>I have grave reservations about the subsuming of these five critical agencies.  Although it looks good on paper and reads well, if one goes through the functions of all the five agencies, there is a genuine fear they will get lost within the HSE or the Department of Health and Children.  One of the issues I have with the HSE is that it has become a superstructure, which none of us envisaged when it was created.  There is very little accountability and a democratic deficit.  If one puts down an Adjournment matter, it is often deemed not to be the responsibility of the Department, but one cannot question the HSE on the issue.</P>
        <P>Mental health is rightly becoming a central part of the health services.  An all-party committee was set up yesterday, on which I commend Senator Fitzgerald and the Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews.  I have a concern with regard to the Mental Health Act and I am not reassured by the Minister of State&rsquo;s contribution.  The agency that carries out involuntary admissions for the HSE has worked well up to this point &mdash; there is no argument about that &mdash; but there are no ministerial regulations or protocols governing how it carries out its duties.  The section <Col N="662"/>would be more appropriate in a mental health Bill because it would benefit from an expanded explanation in a separate Bill.  I look forward to the Minster of State&rsquo;s reply in this regard.  I emphasise that there should have been a separate Bill purely to discuss mental health and mental health services.</P>
        <P>In the context of women&rsquo;s health and the national cancer strategy, like Senator Coffey, I want to raise a core matter with which I have a fundamental issue.  It concerns the insistence on the policy of the Government and the HSE with regard to the transfer of breast cancer services from South Infirmary-Victoria University Hospital to Cork University Hospital.  This is a fundamentally flawed policy.  Nothing that has been said in Adjournment debates or parliamentary questions, or by the HSE, has changed my mind or the minds of expert specialist clinicians, the women of Cork and the staff who work in the South Infirmary-Victoria University Hospital.</P>
        <P Just="Left">If we are genuinely serious about women&rsquo;s health, the reduction of cancer and early detection, this would be a flawed move.  The South Infirmary-Victoria University Hospital is by far the best, the largest and the most specialised unit in the south, with a proven track record that is second to none.  Its statistics in diagnosis and the way it treats people have been well documented.  If we are talking about creating better efficiencies and value for money, I cannot understand why we invested millions of euro and then suddenly decided to move from campus A to campus B in Cork University Hospital.  It does not make sense.  It is a waste of money, is a vote of no confidence in the staff of South Infirmary-Victoria University Hospital and does not instil confidence in the women of Cork.  I have reams of e-mails and copious volumes of notes from public meetings where woman after woman has raised these issues.</P>
        <P>If the Government wants greater networking and two hospital campuses, that is fine, but let us keep services at the existing campus where BreastCheck was invested in by the Government.  Why move to the already packed and straining campus of Cork University Hospital?  It does not make sense.  If we are talking about the whole issue of HSE accountability, Professor Drumm and his merry men and women are saying one thing but, on the ground, the staff working in the HSE, of all grades, are diametrically opposed to their view and have no confidence whatsoever in the operation of the HSE.  I challenge any staff member of the Department of Health and Children or the HSE, or the Minister of State, Deputy Moloney, and the Minister, Deputy Harney, to tour the front-line services of hospitals throughout the country.  Morale is low and confidence is critically low.  Yet, we are today subsuming five agencies into the HSE and the Department.  While I accept we must create efficiencies and achieve value for money, at what cost and risk?</P>
        <P>Senator de B&uacute;rca gave an eloquent speech about the Crisis Pregnancy Agency and I would like to be associated with Senator Corrigan&rsquo;s remarks concerning Cura.  I hope Cura will continue to be funded because the reduction or elimination of abortion should be on all of our political agendas.  While I do not have access to figures on the issues raised by Senator de B&uacute;rca, I suggest we need to visit the schools and give detailed consideration to how best we educate young people.  I would go a step further and move beyond the schools to the youth cafes and youth clubs.  We have an obligation to educate our young people, irrespective of their sexuality, as Senator Norris said, with a view to eliminating abortion and looking after our young people.</P>
        <P>I thank the Minister of State and his officials for attending and for their patience.  I appeal to the Minister of State at this eleventh hour to go back to the Minister, Deputy Harney, and the HSE with regard to the national cancer strategy and the proposed transfer of services at South Infirmary-Victoria University Hospital to Cork University Hospital.</P></Speaker><Col N="663"/>
      
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I am grateful for the time and I wish to say some brief words about the Bill which amalgamates several different areas within it.  As I stated previously, I am always somewhat wary when a Bill is introduced to the House with the words &ldquo;miscellaneous provisions&rdquo; in the title because usually it indicates that many rather significant changes are proposed.  It is unfortunate that it has been introduced this late during the two or three week period in July in which we have before us a great volume of legislation.  It does not allow the level of reflective or considered debate that would be preferable.  Rushed drafting was evident in the Local Government (Charges) Bill debated yesterday, which will return to the House this evening.  Changes were made by the Government to that Bill last night and I hope further changes will be made to address people&rsquo;s concerns about that Bill and to address such matters as the unintended inclusion of entities such as mobiles homes in its scope.</P>
        <P>Turning to the Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, there is a range of areas, including a rather last minute amendment to the Mental Health Act, which other Members have addressed.  I refer especially to Part 6 of the Bill and the dissolution of the Crisis Pregnancy Agency.  As I stated on the Order of Business, it is worth placing on the record our appreciation of the work of the Crisis Pregnancy Agency, including Katherine Bulbulia and her staff, since its inception in 2001.  I express the hope in the strongest terms that the functions the agency has been discharging during the past eight years will continue to be discharged, albeit under the auspices of the Department of Health and Children, to which I understand the functions will be transferred.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Questions must be asked about the dissolution of the agency and the transfer of its functions into the Department.  What happened to the functions of health education when they became part of the Department of Health and Children?  Will the Minister of State to address this point?  As a mother of very young children and as someone who is very conscious of the need to take folic acid during pregnancy, I have a particular interest in this area.  There has been a real concern that since the functions of health education were transferred to the Department of Health and Children we have seen very little in terms of public information campaigns on such matters as taking folic acid during pregnancy.  I simply use the folic acid campaign as an example because I understand the importance of informing the public of the need to take folic acid during pregnancy to prevent spina bifida in young babies.  The campaign has been handed over to the voluntary spina bifida organisation and it must now carry out a public information campaign but without adequate resourcing to do so.  Will the Minister of State confirm if this is the case?  If it is true I wish to hear it confirmed.  It is an example of the difficulties which can arise when the functions of an agency specifically set up and with a particular health related agenda are transferred to the Department of Health and Children.  Such functions may become lost in the bigger Department or they may be transferred inappropriately to bodies which do not have adequate resources to carry out the work.  There is a strong argument to ensure the particular functions of the Crisis Pregnancy Agency remain fulfilled, albeit under the auspices of the Department of Health and Children.  On the spina bifida issue, will the Minister of State provide the dates of the last public information campaign?  This is of great concern to women looking to conceive or who are pregnant, many of whom are unaware of the evidence about the importance of taking folic acid during pregnancy.</P>
        <P>I refer to the functions and work of the Crisis Pregnancy Agency.  I am grateful to the agency for providing a briefing document, to which other colleagues referred during the debate.  The document sets out in clear terms the important role of the Crisis Pregnancy Agency since its establishment.  Without going into the detail of the origins of the agency and the position before its establishment, there was a clear need for some centralised regulatory mechanism to deal with the provision of information to women in crisis pregnancy.  I know such a need existed because for a time in the late 1980s I provided such information as an officer of the Trinity <Col N="664"/>College Students Union.  I was taken to court and threatened with prison in 1989 simply for providing information to women in crisis pregnancy.  I will never forget the experience as a 20 year old student of being placed in the position of being one of the only people openly giving information to women in crisis pregnancy.  We had the very difficult and often traumatic experience of dealing with women, some younger and some older women, in crisis who rang and called in to us in great distress seeking information on the options available.  In particular they sought information on where they could access termination of pregnancy or abortion abroad.  This followed the Hamilton judgment in the Open Door Counselling case and there was a constitutional difficulty with the provision of such information and a suggestion that by providing it in breach of a court injunction we could have been regarded as being in breach of criminal law.  There was also a threat of jail hanging over us for breach of an order, carrying with it a penal sanction.</P>
        <P>I have a particular personal interest in noting appreciation for the work of the Crisis Pregnancy Agency and ensuring information is available openly, publicly and in a professional manner to women facing crisis pregnancy.  We should never again have to face a situation in which student union officers are the only people openly offering such information to women.  Clearly there is a need for the provision of such information.  All the figures provided by the Crisis Pregnancy Agency support this claim.  Some 136,000 women among the present population have experienced crisis pregnancy.  We know it affects women of all age groups and all social classes.  That is my direct experience, having provided such information in the past.</P>
        <P>Since its inception the Crisis Pregnancy Agency has been able to offer information in a more open, accessible and transparent manner and to ensure other agencies do so.  The agency itself does not offer the information but it provides information on the agencies through which crisis pregnancy information may be made available.  It has achieved remarkable results, which are testament to its work.  It has achieved a decrease of 30% in the number of women travelling from Ireland to the United Kingdom for abortion.  There has been a continuous seven year drop in the abortion rate, a very welcome outcome for all of us who have a concern about women&rsquo;s reproductive health.  I speak as someone who has been on the board of the Irish Family Planning Association in the past.  The IFPA has been a pioneer in its work, supporting women in crisis pregnancy throughout the years.  Since the inception of the CPA there has been a 20% decrease in the number and rate of births to teenagers and a 43% decrease in the number of teenagers travelling from Ireland to the UK for abortion.  These figures show the importance of having an agency in place or an entity which provides information for women in crisis pregnancy and to ensure such information is provided to such women in a professional, open, transparent and accessible manner.</P>
        <P>For many years those on the right in the country, including the conservative side, and especially the Catholic Church, sought to create a framework where such information was not available to women.  As a result when sex education and information on abortion and pregnancy options were not available, the abortion rate was higher and the rate of crisis pregnancy was higher.  We all wish to see these rates decreased and it is very important we ensure there is a transparent and professional counselling agency that can provide such information.  There is a good deal more I could say on the matter but I urge the Minister of State to ensure the functions so ably carried out by the agency do not simply disappear once it is dissolved through the Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Senator Paddy Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to offer some brief words on the legislation.  I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy John Moloney, to the House and I compliment him on his knowledge of various aspects of Bills he has brought through the House.</P><Col N="665"/>
        <P>I refer to the national cancer strategy, Mayo General Hospital and the transfer of services from Castlebar to Galway.  We should receive a report at this stage to outline how the strategy is performing.  Is it all it is cracked up to be?  Has it progressed as the Minister for Health and Children intended when she first outlined it in the House 12 or more months ago?  How is the national cancer strategy working throughout the country?  I am led to believe there are still complications and issues of funding and people travelling long distances to and from the various designated centres.  I refer also to the ongoing problem with Sligo where people want to hold onto the cancer services being provided there and where the hospital is achieving good results.  There should be an open debate on this issue.</P>
        <P>The Bill provides for the amalgamation of six bodies in to the HSE and the Department of Health and Children.  The National Council on Ageing and Older People, the Women&rsquo;s Health Council and the Crisis Pregnancy Agency will go to the Department of Health and Children.  The National Cancer Screening Service Board and the Drug Treatment Centre Board will go to the HSE.  I compliment all those who have worked in these areas over the past ten years as they have done tremendous work.  They have gathered valuable information for the HSE, for the Department of Health and Children and for the people.</P>
        <P>I agree with Senator Bacik that there is a role for specific agencies and I hope that when these bodies are amalgamated into the HSE and the Department of Health and Children that they would still have an identity.  Each body has specific expertise which has been gathered over many years and the systems are in place.  It would be wrong to amalgamate them for the sake of amalgamation alone and to cut down on the number of agencies.  They should retain their own identities within the system.  I ask the Minister of State to say the number of staff who will go to the Department, the number who will go to the HSE and the annual saving.</P>
        <P>I refer to the 2008 annual report of the HSE which does not make reference to amalgamation of those agencies.  The HSE has its own remuneration committee.  Will the staff of these bodies be on different levels of pay to HSE staff?  There could be a situation where staff transferred from an agency would be on different levels of pay and this should be examined.  They are all classified as civil servants, by and large, but there could be different levels of pay.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State stated in his contribution that the rationalisation programme was set up under the Health Service Executive Act 2004 and provision was made in other legislation for the integration of a number of agencies within other bodies.  There has been an explosion in employment in the HSE.  I hope that under this amalgamation process there will not be a further explosion of numbers of staff.  Are there any planned redundancies as a result of the rationalisation programme which reduces the number of agencies from 34 to 18?</P>
        <P>I wish the Minister of State well with this Bill.  I suggest we should be given a report on the performance of the national cancer strategy at national level and at regional level.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnMoloney"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Moloney</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senators for their contributions.  I take Senator Bacik&rsquo;s point that miscellaneous provisions in themselves can cater for so many different issues.  I will try to deal with as many as possible.  I am particularly interested in the mental health provisions of the Bill.</P>
        <P>I am aware that Members of this and the other House have expressed concerns about the possibility of rushed legislation.  The reason for the rush is the High Court judgment delivered on 21 May 2009 and also because the Houses will be beginning the summer recess soon.  By that I do not mean that we should rush legislation because of the recess.  The judgment delivered on 21 May 2009 has given rise to particular difficulties in the Dublin area, parts of the east and Clonmel and Cork, where up to 90% of the assisted admissions are undertaken by the external agency.  In order to ensure the continuation of externally provided assisted admissions, an <Col N="666"/>amendment to the Mental Health Act 2001 is required.  I made the point in the Lower House that the review of the Mental Health Act is due next year and we can then tease out specific issues.  Lest people are of the view that the external agency does not have any qualification and there have been queries as to the protocols involved and the level of standards involved, I will deal with these specifics.  There is only one agency involved.  All the employees of the external agency are qualified psychiatric nurses.  A qualification as a qualified psychiatric nurse is not in itself sufficient.  The status of all employees is reviewed annually.</P>
        <P>This is not a case of outsourcing and privatising the service.  Protocols had not been agreed with SIPTU and the PNA and often the required staff were not available.  The concern would be that people might harm themselves or others so there is a need for involuntary admissions.  This is an interim measure.  The external agency is working in close co-operation with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I will give Members some background in respect of the numbers.  The narrow interpretation of the term &ldquo;staff of an approved centre&rdquo; presents a difficulty in the ongoing provision of an assisted admission service.  In 2008 there were 2,004 involuntary admissions, of which 604 were assisted.  A total of 42% or 250 of these assisted admissions were provided by the external agency.  It is worth noting that all of the assisted admissions in the Dublin-mid-Leinster region were provided by the external agency.</P>
        <P>The point was raised by a number of Senators, and I appreciate it, that when we are dealing with mental health issues we must be twice as cautious as with any other area.  The issues raised by Senators on all sides of the House are genuinely founded and it is up to us to try to persuade Senators to realise that we are acting in patients&rsquo; best interests, with safeguards provided also.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that the external agency has provided a professional, high quality and safe assisted admission service for both the Health Service Executive and the two private psychiatric hospitals since 2006.  To date, over 600 people have been safely brought to hospital by this agency.  The fact that there have been no complaints either from family, garda&iacute;, advocates or anyone else shows that a standard has been set and that people have been safely brought to hospital by the agency.  The fact that no complaints have been made is noteworthy when one considers the sensitive and potentially difficult nature of the service.</P>
        <P>The provision of the assisted admissions by a central agency enables the development of a specialised expertise in the de-escalation of difficult situations, which is of immense value and ultimately makes the situation easier for the patient and the patient&rsquo;s family.</P>
        <P>I reaffirm what was said in the opening statement by the Minister of State, Deputy Brady.  Points were raised in the D&aacute;il about the nature of the company, the company setting up its business and in terms of advertising, interviewing or whatever.  The company employs only fully qualified psychiatric nurses, all of whom have received intensive specialised training, including appropriate interaction with service users and training on de-escalation and talk-down techniques.</P>
        <P>The most important point I can make on this area, before I deal with the other issues involved, is that the company complies with all Mental Health Commission guidelines and standards in terms of its work.  Guidelines and standards meet the minimum test.  I appreciate that protocols or guidelines are not sufficient but on balance, and the fact that so many involuntary admissions are required each year, I stand over this measure as being safe.</P>
        <P>The amendment proposed is necessary to ensure that the acutely mentally ill person who requires hospitalisation but refuses to go to hospital can be brought to hospital involuntarily by specially authorised persons.</P>
        <P>On the wider miscellaneous areas, as indicated earlier, the proposals in the Bill on the integration of agencies within the Health Service Executive and the Department of Health and <Col N="667"/>Children are consistent with and build upon progress to date under the overall health reform programme.  I take the point raised by Senator Buttimer regarding his area but it is about recognising the mission statements of the six agencies and retaining their purposes.  Unfortunately, because of the economic situation we find ourselves in this is a way of amalgamating services, while not curtailing services.</P>
        <?oasys _cl14.5- ?><P>The health reform programme acknowledged that there was a need to streamline the number of health sector agencies to ensure we have a better co-ordination of services.  That objective was a cornerstone of the plans announced last June on the rationalisation of State agencies generally.</P>
        <P>On the points raised about value for money and the money that will be saved by dissolving the agencies, the primary aim in rationalising these bodies is a streamlined service delivery and to promote service integration.  The proposals are consistent with and build upon progress to date on agency rationalisation within the sector under the health reform programme.  However, efficiencies will derive over time from economies of scale and the elimination of duplication in areas such as recruitment procurement, payroll and ICT systems.</P>
        <P>On the cancer strategy, while not specifically dealing with that area I accept the point made by Senator Burke on the need for a progress report.  I will bring that point to the attention of the Minister, Deputy Harney.  I recognise the Senator&rsquo;s concerns about the reform programme and the cancer strategy.  I will suggest an interim report on the progress on that to the senior Minister.</P>
        <P>On the National Cancer Screening Service, it is intended that the service will be integrated into the HSE&rsquo;s national cancer control programme.  The National Cancer Screening Service works closely with the HSE.  The Minister is confident that high quality national cancer screening programmes will continue and be expanded when the service is fully integrated into the HSE&rsquo;s cancer control programme.  I will put that position also to the Minister.</P>
        <P>Senators Maria Corrigan, Ivana Bacik and others raised the issue of the Crisis Pregnancy Agency.  The Bill expressly provides for the transfer to the HSE of certain functions of the crisis agency in line with legal advice.  It is important to state that the work of the agency will continue, and steps have been taken to ensure that happens.  The Minister will expand on later Stages on the steps involved in that.</P>
        <P>The HSE is examining how best to integrate and carry on the work of the agency.  The Crisis Pregnancy Agency, the HSE and the Department have already had a number of meetings to make plans in that regard.  In addition, the HSE has set up an internal group to progress and report on the matter.</P>
        <P>Senator Twomey asked about accountability.  There are well-established accountability arrangements in place.  The Minister for Health and Children is accountable to the Oireachtas and the chief executive of the HSE is required to appear before Oireachtas committees.  Those of us who have served on the Joint Committee on Health and Children are aware of the rigorous questioning by Oireachtas Members on foot of presentations.  There is accountability in that respect.</P>

That is important given that Professor Keane is operating within a certain timeframe.  He is on secondment here from British Columbia for a certain period.  Rather than simply waiting until the end of that period it would be important to assess the level of support for and success of the programme to date.  I will raise that with the Minister at the first opportunity.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 4, line 31, after &ldquo;of&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;chief&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">As the Minister of State will know, we on this side of the House support this Bill but our intention with this amendment and others is to ensure the legislation is immune from challenge.  As there is an interference with the right to privacy, it is all the more important the Bill should be drafted in such a way as to minimise the possibility of challenge and there should be adequate safeguards in place to ensure that is the case.  That is required under the provisions of Article 8 of the Convention of Human Rights whose criteria are reflected in our law.</P>
        <P>This amendment provides that under the definition of superior officer it would not be merely a &ldquo;member&rdquo; of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na but a chief superintendent who would grant the authorisation.  Nobody below the rank of chief superintendent could do so.  The amendment was drafted as a constructive suggestion to enhance the legitimacy of the interference with the right to privacy which is central to this Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Regan for his comments today and on Second Stage, and for broadly supporting this legislation.  The definition of superior officer in context, as currently drafted, provides for the person to be a member of the rank of at least superintendent in the case of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  To clarify this for the Senator, it is not merely a &ldquo;member&rdquo; of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The legislation, as drafted, is&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, I see that.  The rank stated is of superintendent.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="670"/>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy John Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>The Bill governs the use of surveillance, not only by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na but also by members of the Defence Forces and officers of the Revenue Commissioners.  It is intended in the Bill that members of an equivalent level of authority in each of these State agencies would apply to the court for authorisations to carry out surveillance and to grant approvals both in cases of urgency and for the use of tracking devices.  Although in some cases a member of the rank of superintendent may be directly involved in the surveillance operation, it is envisaged that another member of the force would be designated to undertake the surveillance by the superintendent to whom the authorisation is issued or who grants the approval.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P Just="Left">I do not believe it is necessary or appropriate in the case of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to provide that it must be an officer of a higher rank who makes an application or grants an approval, nor do I think that is practical.  It is my view that the competence and experience which attaches to the rank of Garda superintendent means that this is an appropriate grade for it and is an equivalence to the rank and grade in the Defence Forces and the Revenue Commissioners of colonel and principal officer, respectively, who deal with authorisations and approvals.  I believe that a Garda superintendent is of a sufficiently high authority to undertake this role, while at the same time being sufficiently close to the operational side of the work of preventing, detecting and investigating a crime, and for that reason I do not propose to accept this amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Leas-Chathaoirleach for allowing me to speak and I apologise for not speaking earlier on the Bill.  I support Senator Regan&rsquo;s amendment.  I heard the Minister of State&rsquo;s reply but, given the level of power we grant to superior officers in sections 7 and 8 of this Bill, it is critical we ensure there is a sufficient level of safeguard present to ensure there is no abuse of the power of surveillance.</P>
        <P>As I stated on Second Stage, I broadly welcome the Bill.  Section 3, in particular, sets out a very important principle to which we shall come.  However, it is vital to ensure we do not create powers that are so wide they may be abused.  We can all think of instances where covert surveillance powers used by the State might be abused.  Senator Regan&rsquo;s amendment would ensure an extra level of safeguard would be in place in that it would require a chief superintendent rather than a superintendent to authorise the placing of tracking devices under section 8 or, in circumstances of urgency, to authorise surveillance under section 7.  That is particularly important.</P>
        <P>We have seen a great deal of case law emerging on search warrant provisions and provisions in different pieces of legislation that allow searches to be carried out and search warrants to be issued, usually by a chief superintendent.  There have been a large number of challenges on the basis of the exercise of these powers by superior officers in the Garda.  We must be wary about allowing too broad a power to superior officers in this legislation.  I absolutely support Senator Regan&rsquo;s amendment and believe it would strengthen the Bill, as my amendments seek to do at a later stage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy John Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Bacik for her support for this legislation.  I considered the matter but was conscious  of the balance to be struck in what is practical and achievable. On the advice available, I believe the rank of superintendent has sufficient capacity and authority and, therefore, I will not accept the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I apologise for trespassing again.  I wish to make one specific point to the Minister of State that I raised on Second Stage.  I mentioned we already have powers to issue search warrants and have provided for superior officers in certain legislation, in respect of urgent circumstances, and so on.  It is interesting that in 2006 the Criminal Justice Bill, as it then was, in what I believe was its original 2004 format, sought in its section 5 to extend a <Col N="671"/>general power to Garda superintendents to issue search warrants in respect of all arrestable offences.  There was a good deal of outcry about extending that general power, not only in the context of specific offences such as drug trafficking or offences against the State, but, as this Bill would do, to all arrestable offences.</P>
        <P>Regarding section 5, I checked extensively through the D&aacute;il debates and, as far as I can see, this provision was withdrawn by the Minister on Report Stage in 2006.  The final version of the Criminal Justice Act 2006 does not allow for the issuing by Garda superintendents of search warrants.  I am concerned that in that context perhaps we are giving too much power to Garda superintendents in this legislation.  There is not only the power to have surveillance going on, about which arguments have been made in respect of breach of the right to privacy, but also the power to authorise entry to homes, which particularly concerns me.  &ldquo;Place&rdquo; in the Bill includes a dwelling and thereby allows the power to authorise entry to people&rsquo;s homes in order to place or withdraw tracking or surveillance devices.  That is an extremely powerful weapon, as one might term it, in the armoury of State investigation of potential offences.  I urge that we be cautious and ensure there are sufficient safeguards in place and that the inviolability of citizens&rsquo; dwellings will not be unduly breached, particularly under sections 7 and 8 where no judicial authorisation is required.  This is also Senator Regan&rsquo;s concern, in that superintendents should not have too broad a power where there is no judicial authorisation.  In light of the withdrawal by a former Minister of the proposed section 5 of what is now the Criminal Justice Act 2006, why is such a broad power for superintendents included in this Bill?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy John Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>I am advised that, from an operational and practical point of view, the rank of Garda superintendent is appropriate and would have sufficient authority.  We should not consider the matter in isolation.  Apart from the person making the application, a number of other checks and balances exist throughout.  The superior officer making the application must have reasonable grounds and so forth in the reporting and all that goes with it.  My advice is that the rank of Garda superintendent is appropriate and practical from an operational point of view.  Considering the operation of the provision, decisions and access are sometimes important, as decisions may need to be made in relatively short periods.</P>

        <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 3 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>As I stated on Second Stage, I support the prohibition on carrying out surveillance except in accordance with a valid authorisation or an approval.  This is an important cornerstone of the Bill and is one of the reasons for which the legislation has received a broad welcome from civil liberties groups.  It states that surveillance shall only be carried out in accordance with the procedures set out in the Bill.  I do not want to be on record as only objecting to aspects of the Bill.  I welcome this provision, since it sets out in a concise way a statutory framework for the carrying out of covert surveillance.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
        <P Just="Center">SECTION 4.</P>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 2:</P><Col N="672"/>
        <P LI="2">In page 6, subsection (1)(<i>b</i>), line 11, after &ldquo;or&rdquo; to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="3">&ldquo;to investigate and/or gather intelligence on gangland crime, or&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This section sets out the Bill&rsquo;s purpose.  The background to this and other legislation that we are considering this week is that gangland crime is out of control and that the Government is not succeeding with current resources, legislative or otherwise, in resolving or minimising the carnage being created by criminal gangs in different communities.</P>
        <P>The phrase &ldquo;for the purpose of preventing the commission of arrestable offences&rdquo; is quite specific in its intent, although I appreciate it does not refer to a specific arrestable offence.  My amendment suggests that there is a logic in having available covert surveillance of the type envisaged in the Bill to investigate and-or gather intelligence on gangland crime in general so that the information is available to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, providing it with better understanding, knowledge and expertise in tackling the problem, which is broader than specific offences.  It is a systems failure in the law and order regime that we try to ensure exists in society.  Therefore, there is a logic in broadening the purpose of the Bill and scope of the authority that it provides to conduct this type of investigative and intelligence gathering exercise.</P>
        <P>This amendment might be justified.  Given the provisions on judicial and police co-operation with other EU member states, such an amendment might be necessary to allow our authorities to co-operate with other member states in carrying out covert surveillance when requested.  This matter is provided for in the Schengen Information System II, to which we will become participants.  I propose my amendment against this background.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Senator Regan, in that a specific purpose of this kind would be useful, particularly as the legislation is being introduced with the express purpose of dealing with organised crime.  I told the Senator that I am not sure about whether the word &ldquo;gangland&rdquo; is the most appropriate for use in criminal legislation.  We all know what it means, but it has a tabloid or, unfortunately, sensationalising effect, despite the grubby and sordid nature of the crime, which has led to dreadful and tragic deaths.  A specific purpose to investigate and-or gather intelligence on organised crime, a better way of putting it, would be useful because this is the political reason for the legislation&rsquo;s introduction.</P>
        <P>The practice in the Criminal Justice Acts 2006 and 2007 of using valid and justified concerns about organised crime to widen nets is unfortunate, as laws that have changed criminal procedures for all types of offence have been introduced.  Under this Bill, arrestable offences are not confined to organised or gang crime only.  The criminal courts are showing flaws in the 2006 and 2007 legislation.  We must be cautious about the scope of legislation such as this Bill being overly broad.  In terms of gangland or organised crime, a more specific purpose would be helpful for the Garda, since investigating and-or gathering intelligence on that type of crime is what the Bill was meant to be concerned with.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy John Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>Section 4 provides the circumstances under which an authorisation may be sought.  Subsection 1 deals with applications made by members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The applicant must have reasonable grounds for believing that the surveillance is necessary for obtaining information about the commission of an arrestable offence, for the prevention of arrestable offences or for maintaining the security of the State.  The Bill provides for a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to apply for an authorisation for surveillance with respect to the investigation or prevention of arrestable offences.  This sufficiently captures the gangland crime-type offences mentioned.  For this reason, I do not propose to accept the amendment.</P>

        <P>Amendment put and declared lost.</P>
        <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 4 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>Broad purposes are provided in section 4(1).  It is a critical section because it provides for the application for authorisation to a judge.  The purpose for which the application may be made is broad, namely, &ldquo;as part of an operation or investigation being conducted by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na concerning an arrestable offence&rdquo; or &ldquo;preventing the commission of arrestable offences&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>I wish to address the broader purpose outlined in section 4(1)(<i>c</i>) on surveillance being sought to be authorised, namely, &ldquo;maintaining the security of the State&rdquo;.  This is also provided for under section 4(2) in respect of superior officers in the Defence Forces.  I wish to put on record the necessity of ensuring judicial authorisation where such a sensitive purpose is cited as the reason for seeking authorisation for surveillance devices.  We are all familiar with the history of the use of political bugging, and not just in this country.  In the well known Kennedy case, the right to privacy was discussed by the courts in the context of bugging.  In Britain it became public knowledge, after the event, that a good deal of bugging had been carried out on persons who were simply involved in legitimate civic protests.  The bugging was authorised under the very vague heading of &ldquo;maintaining the security of the state&rdquo;.  I am not arguing against it but simply saying I am glad judicial approval is necessary under section 4, particularly where that purpose is cited.  This is why I have tabled amendments to sections 7 and 8.  It is partly because it is rather dangerous to grant the power to a superior officer in the Garda or Defence Forces for the aforesaid purpose without there being very tight safeguards in place.</P>

        <P Just="Center">SECTION 5.</P>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 7, subsection (4), line 21, to delete &ldquo;privilege&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;legal professional privilege or any other privilege recognised by law&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This is an issue of language.  Section 5(4) states, &ldquo;The judge shall not issue an authorisation if he or she is satisfied that the surveillance being sought to be authorised is likely to relate primarily to communications protected by privilege&rdquo;.  This should be more specific, particularly in regard to legal professional privilege.  That is the essential intent of the Bill.  It would be preferable to state &ldquo;legal professional privilege or any other privilege recognised by law&rdquo;.  I have followed the argument of the Minister of State on this issue.  It has been indicated in the Lower House that what I propose is what was intended.  The framing of the provision as I suggest would be preferable.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy John Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>While the use of the term &ldquo;privilege&rdquo; generally refers to legal professional privilege, there are other types recognised by law, for example, discussions at Cabinet and sacerdotal privilege.  The current wording incorporates all forms of privilege recognised by law.  While I appreciate the Senator&rsquo;s motives, I do not believe his amendment is necessary and I do not propose to accept it.</P>

        <P LI="1">In page 7, subsection (7), line 38, after &ldquo;place&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and to interfere with that place&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Whenever this type of legislation is challenged, it will be done forensically.  It is vital that this provision be carefully crafted.  Section 5(7) states: &ldquo;An authorisation may authorise the superior officer named in it, or any member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na . . . accompanied by any other person whom he or she considers necessary, to enter, if necessary by the use of reasonable force, any place [&rdquo;any place&ldquo; is defined as a dwelling, building, vessel etc.] for the purposes of initiating or carrying out the authorised surveillance, and withdrawing the authorised surveillance device, without the consent of a person who owns or is in charge of the place&rdquo;.  While one is authorised to enter the place &ldquo;for the purposes of initiating or carrying out the authorised surveillance, and withdrawing the authorised surveillance device, without the consent of a person who owns or is in charge of the place&rdquo;, is a refinement of the language required to cover both entry to the place and the interference therewith in the placing of bugging equipment or whatever equipment is required to carry out surveillance?  Is there wording missing?  My amendment gives authorisation to enter a place for the purpose of surveillance and to interfere with that place &ndash; essentially a property &ndash; for the purpose of installing surveillance equipment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the amendment.  Senator Regan has identified a real problem with the provision.  As I stated, section 5(7) is very important because it is the one that authorises entry to a place, including a dwelling.  To put it bluntly, it allows the State to bug people&rsquo;s homes.  Doing so is subject to judicial authorisation in the context of sections 4 and 5.  Very well-developed case law on search warrants, which is the only real parallel we have in this jurisdiction, demonstrates the courts have applied the law on search warrants to ensure minimal interference with the right of citizens to the inviolability of their dwelling in the carrying out of any search.</P>
        <P>I declare an interest in that I am a practising criminal lawyer who has represented people who have been subjected to Garda searches.  Such searches can involve large numbers of garda&iacute; and can be extremely intimidating to people in the home, particularly if there are children present.  The courts, in recognising the encroachments on people&rsquo;s rights and liberties that searches involve, have ensured very strong judicial supervision of the way searches are carried out.</P>
        <P>Section 5(7) is very vaguely drafted in terms of what it allows officers of the State to do on entry to a home.  One assumes that because they want to place a covert surveillance device, they will not do so when people are in the home.  The procedure will be different to the application of search warrant powers in that, quite often, search warrants are used to search homes when people are present.  I presume the real application of this subsection would involve garda&iacute; entering a home when somebody is absent therefrom in order to place a device covertly and exiting without leaving any sign of their having been there.  In this were not the objective, the very purpose of the provision would be undermined.</P>
        <P>There is nothing in the subsection that guides garda&iacute; on the entry to a premises.  It does not determine how long they may stay or the interference allowed.  Senator Regan&rsquo;s amendment is the minimum that is required.  I am trying to anticipate case law that might arise in connection with circumstances where garda&iacute; stay in a home for a certain period and where there is more than minimal interference with the home in the placing or withdrawal of surveillance devices.  Is there a requirement for a code of practice?  If it is not in the legislation, there should be more detail on what officers of the Garda, Defence Forces and Revenue Commissioners are authorised to do while in a premises.</P><Col N="675"/>
        <P>Subsection (6) provides that a judge may impose conditions and that the authorisation must specify &ldquo;particulars of the surveillance device that is authorised to be used&rdquo; and &ldquo;the conditions (if any) subject to which the authorisation is issued&rdquo;.  At the commencement of the application of this legislation, a judge might be rather unclear as to the sorts of conditions he could impose.  He would very much be guided by what the Garda says about how surveillance devices may be placed.  It may be difficult for judges to have adequate levels of supervision over the placing and withdrawal of devices if they are not given clearer guidance on what they may authorise.  This amendment is designed to strengthen rather than undermine the legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy John Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>Section 5(7) already provides that an authorisation or approval may authorise a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Defence Forces or the Revenue Commissioners to enter any place if necessary by use of reasonable force for the purpose of initiating or carrying out surveillance and withdrawing a surveillance device without the consent of a person who owns it or is in charge of the place.  The Senator&rsquo;s proposal provides that the authorisation provision would also authorise interference with that place.  The present text is broadly drafted and deliberately wide to encompass all the different ways in which surveillance may be initiated and carried out.</P>
        <P>The definition of place in the interpretation section is also broadly drafted as the Senator rightly pointed out.  I believe it already encompasses the Senator&rsquo;s concerns.  We cannot consider one section in isolation and Senator Bacik rightly went on to acknowledge that a judge already has discretion under the Bill to attach conditions to the authorisation.  The procedure governing the right of entry into a place and the initiation of surveillance in whatever format would be subject to any conditions considered appropriate by the judicial authority in respect of the surveillance and for that reason I do not propose to accept the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State is being very polite in his rejection of all these amendments, including this one and presumably those that are yet to be discussed.  He should, however, reflect on the suggestions from this side of the House.  We support the Bill and are trying to be constructive.  Some reflection on this and other amendments is warranted.  I invite the Minster of State to consider this type of amendment which is designed very specifically to improve and strengthen the Bill.  On the basis of that reflection the Minister of State could introduce amendments on Report Stage.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Sections 4 and 5 provide for judicial authorisation for surveillance which we have all welcomed with the statutory framework and the criteria and so on, albeit that some of us on this side of the House think the criteria could be tighter and judges given more guidance on granting authorisations.  My concerns, however, are strongest in respect of sections 7 and 8 because these provide for surveillance and tracking devices to be placed without judicial authorisation but instead by the superior officers of the Garda, Defence Forces or the Revenue Commissioners.  Section 7 at least provides that this can be done only in urgent cases and section 7(2) provides three criteria for urgency which is important.  It is also important to note there is a time limit of 72 hours from the time when approval is granted under subsection (8).  There is a distinction between this sort of approval for surveillance and the sort of authorisation a judge can grant under sections 4 and 5.</P>
        <P>I did not table an amendment on subsection (2) but I do have a slight concern about it.  The first two criteria of urgency are straightforward and we are familiar with them from the bail laws, that a person might abscond for the purpose of avoiding justice or would commit an arrestable offence or where information is likely to be destroyed.  Those are very clear and logical cases for urgency.  I have some concern, however, about the broadness of the third condition under subsection (2)(<i>c</i>) where &ldquo;the security of the State would be likely to be compromised&rdquo;, particularly because this applies also to officers of the Revenue Commissioners even though under section 4(3) State security is excluded as a ground on which a Revenue officer can apply for authorisation.  That seems to be beyond the function of Revenue officers.  It would be highly unlikely in practice that a senior Revenue officer would be issuing authorisation in a case of urgency under section 7 because he or she felt the security of the State was likely to be compromised.  Is it an oversight that subsection (2) gives them this power?</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 5 is designed to create another level of safeguard and to insert a new clause into subsection (8).  It is important the time period is shorter where a judicial authorisation is granted.  I am concerned that &ldquo;place&rdquo; here includes dwelling place and I do not see why 72 hours is needed where a dwelling place is concerned.  I have proposed an amendment to the effect that where the surveillance is to be carried out at or in a private dwelling, it shall not be carried out for more than 24 hours from the time when the approval is granted.  My rationale is that it would always be possible in practice to get a judge within 24 hours.  I can accept there are circumstances in which a superior officer or a superintendent might have to grant the authorisation urgently in respect of private homes.  I am not saying they cannot do it but that a more confined time limit should apply where the surveillance is to be carried out in a private home.</P>
        <P>Section 7 allows superior officers to authorise the entry into private homes for the placing of covert devices and for continuing covert surveillance for 72 hours which is quite a long time in people&rsquo;s private lives and homes.  My amendments Nos. 6 and 7 give effect to that.  I apologise for the typographical error there because the phrase should read &ldquo;or as the case may be 24 hours&rdquo;.  That is to give effect to amendment No. 5 and provide for it in subsection (10).  I would be grateful for the Minister of State&rsquo;s considered view of the proposal to have some more confined provision in section 7 where the private dwelling is concerned.</P>
        <P>Several other safeguards are absent.  There is no provision, for example, in section 7 that the member of the Garda, Defence Forces or Revenue Commissioners would be independent of the investigation.  There is case law on this in other jurisdictions.  There should be a concern that a Garda superintendent who is leading an investigation would also be the person who authorises the surveillance and the placing of the device and entry into the person&rsquo;s home.  In the absence of that safeguard and the provision to enter private homes and place surveillance there, we should be wary of allowing non-judicial authorisation for any longer than is absolutely necessary and I am not sure it is absolutely necessary for 72 hours.  I am not wedded to the 24-<Col N="677"/>hour limit.  I put it in because I think from experience it might take 24 hours to get a District Court judge but a judge should always be available.  Some period shorter than 72 hours would be an important principle to reflect the constitutional significance attached to the dwelling in our legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>I support this amendment because distinguishing the dwelling or home would be proportional to the constitutional protections afforded in Article 40.5 and the inviolability of the dwelling.  I commend the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy John Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>I acknowledge the typo and I got the drift from the other two amendments that they were all related.  I gave this matter some thought from a practical point of view because I had listened to the previous debate.</P>
        <P>The amendment deals with where an approval is given in an urgent situation by a superior officer where there is insufficient time to apply to the District Court for an authorisation.  The amendment calls for the period for which the urgent surveillance would be approved to be confined to 24 hours where the surveillance to be carried out is in a private dwelling.  The situations which amount to urgency in the context of surveillance are strictly defined in the Bill.  As Senator Bacik stated, they are situations where it is believed that in the normal circumstances the court would grant an authorisation but that particular urgent circumstances are present which require immediate action to initiate the surveillance.  These include that the subject of the surveillance might abscond, obstruct the course of justice or commit an arrestable offence; that information or evidence may be destroyed or lost; or that the security of the State is likely to be affected.  Approved surveillance in cases of urgency is limited in the Bill to a period of no longer than 72 hours.  Any surveillance for longer than 72 hours must be authorised by a judge.  There is no possibility for renewal of the 72 hour period; a court authorisation is mandatory if the surveillance is to be continued.</P>
        <P>The ability to initiate surveillance immediately in cases of urgency is critical for the investigation and prevention of offences.  A number of safeguards underpin the Bill which recognise the privacy rights of the individual and take account of constitutional rights and rights under the European Convention on Human Rights.  The constitutional position on the inviolability of the dwelling is clear in that the dwelling is inviolable save in accordance with the law.  In the Bill, we are setting out statutory provisions which ground entry onto private property for the purposes of surveillance.</P>
        <P>In urgent situations, the limitation of approvals to 72 hours has been given careful consideration and has been included on the advice of the Attorney General and the views of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and other agencies concerned.  They agree that a minimum period of 72 hours is necessary for the initiation and carrying out of surveillance and for the withdrawal of surveillance devices where the surveillance is not to be continued.</P>
        <P>In dealing with the type of gangland crime at which this legislation is directed and in a situation of urgency, the officers concerned may not be in a position to determine whether a building or other location constitutes a private dwelling.  Moving from place to place is a characteristic of this class of criminal, using a variety of properties which may have the appearance of a dwelling but may not in fact be so.  The 72 hour period is sufficiently strict while being effective.</P>
        <P>To enable urgent surveillance to be carried out through two separate regimes, one for a dwelling and one for other locations in situations where quick action is required, would, from an operational point of view, be very difficult for the agencies concerned and it is on the advice of the Attorney General and discussions with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that I will not be accepting the amendment.</P>

      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I am grateful to the Minister of State for his considered response and for the information on the Attorney General&rsquo;s advice and that there are certain operational reasons for the need for a specific time period.  The reason for distinguishing a dwelling is not something I have plucked from the air.  I accept that sometimes it can be difficult to ascertain whether it is a dwelling but &ldquo;dwelling&rdquo; is a legal term used throughout criminal justice legislation and in the constitution as it distinguishes a dwelling from other types of buildings.  Case law on search warrants indicates that one can distinguish searches of a dwelling from other types of search of property.  The distinction is already there and I am simply seeking to give effect to it in this Bill.  I urge the Minister of State to place some distinction to provide an added level of safeguard for the dwelling.  It would not be that difficult to do so as I am not suggesting a different procedure but a shorter time limit.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I should have mentioned another matter with regard to section 7(3) to which the Minister of State referred, which provides that the superior officer shall approve the carrying out of such surveillance only if he or she is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for believing that an authorisation would be issued under section 5 and that the conditions of urgency apply.  I wish to express a little caution on this; according to the Bill the superior officer could, although constitutional issues might be raised, be involved in the investigation directly.  Is it a sufficient safeguard that he or she would have what seems to me to be the semi-judicial function of being satisfied there are reasonable grounds for believing an authorisation would be issued by a judge?  Will the Minister of State consider further making a distinction of some kind where the authorisation or approval relates to a dwelling?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy John Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>The advice received and concern raised from an operational point of view was that where decisions needed to be made in real time with a degree of urgency, it would not always be possible in a practical manner to determine whether a property was somebody&rsquo;s dwelling.  With regard to the more fundamental point on 24 hours or 72 hours, the provision is based on the very strong advice of the Attorney General and, from an operational point of view, from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>In those 24 hours one would have access to the building and I presume there would be analysis of why one is going into that building.  One would have background information prior to entering any building to install equipment for covert surveillance.  However, having entered the building and having full knowledge of what it looks like, in the 24-hour period during which one has installed the equipment one would be in a position to ascertain whether it was a dwelling in the legal sense of the term.  I do not understand the difficulties to which the Minister of State referred as the Garda would have actual knowledge of the building having had access to it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy John Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>It might be difficult to determine in the 24 hours whether the building was a dwelling and may not be as easy as Senator Regan suggests.  I wish to point out that it is not an automatic 72 hours, it is up to 72 hours and there are grounds on which the decision is made.  This is also to allow for the withdrawal of the device.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I am grateful to Senator Regan for making the very obvious point that 24 hours would be enough time to ascertain whether the premises was a dwelling.  The Minister of State&rsquo;s point on the maximum period reminds me of the old saying that housework expands to fill the time available.  I do not know whether the Minister of State is familiar with that.  Similarly, where there is a power to use surveillance for up to 72 hours, I suspect that the maximum period would almost invariably be used.  There is no requirement for any extra authorisation.  I am trying to remember the new provisions with regard to detention powers; after the first 12 hours there must be further authorisation and again after another 12 hours up <Col N="679"/>to a maximum of 72 hours.  Had I thought of it, I could have tabled an alternative amendment to require a review of the time period after 24 hours and at that point the superior officer could further authorise up to a maximum of 72 hours where a dwelling was concerned.  This would have been a relevant safeguard, and there is a precedent with regard to detention powers, because 72 hours is quite a lengthy period to have one&rsquo;s home under surveillance and we must keep this practical reality in mind as we debate the Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy John Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>The 72 hours was the subject of some considerable discussion.  It will be used only in very extreme circumstances and will not be the norm.  It is not possible to extend the period beyond 72 hours in this process; it requires judicial input.  From that point of view I cannot accept the amendment because the provision is based on the strong advice of the Attorney General&rsquo;s office and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>

        <P FLI="0">This amendment concerns tracking devices and the judicial supervision or authorisation I suggest should be applicable in this case.  I return to the European Convention on Human Rights, which has held that privacy issues arise where there is a systematic or permanent record of activities carried out by an individual, even in a public place.  The tracking of the location of a person, vehicle or thing and the recording of data relating to that person or thing amounts to an interference with the right to privacy within the meaning of the convention.  That interference can be justified where it is authorised by law, as we know, as long as there are adequate safeguards.  There is a very important case concerning surveillance, that is, Klass <i>v</i>. Germany, and it is acknowledged that abuse of surveillance is quite easy and that it is desirable to have judicial control in authorising such surveillance.  The question is whether there are adequate safeguards in this Bill to justify the procedure envisaged here.</P><Col N="680"/>
        <P>These amendments propose that judicial authorisation would be required, as in the case of surveillance <i>per se</i>, but this is another type of surveillance and should be subject to judicial authorisation.  It is included in this Bill, with the objective of being able to use information gathered in this way in a court as evidence, and in that light the same safeguards should be incorporated into the acquiring of such information to make it legitimate and ensure it is not subject to judicial challenge, or at least it is less likely, if subjected to such a challenge, to be found to be unlawful.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I support this amendment, which is a corollary to my amendment.  Section 8 appears to provide for a bypass to judicial procedure.  Reading the Bill carefully, it is clear in section 1 that tracking devices are a type of surveillance type with a more limited function, because they are only used for the purpose of providing information regarding location.  Location and movement are measured by tracking devices, whereas surveillance devices more broadly cover the content of conversations and of monitoring activity.</P>
        <P>Tracking devices are a type of surveillance device, therefore, a garda, Revenue or Army officer who wishes to mount a tracking device in somebody&rsquo;s home or another place can do so by applying to a judge under section 4(5) for authorisation.  I would be grateful for the Minister of State&rsquo;s clarification on whether an application for authorisation covers tracking and surveillance devices.</P>
        <P>The primary procedure under this Bill, if one reads section 3, 4 and 5, is that somebody who wants to plant a surveillance or tracking device must go to a judge.  Section 7 states in circumstances of urgency where a person wants to plant a surveillance device but does not have time to go to a judge, he or she can go to his or her superior officer.  Section 8 provides a rather extraordinary bypass mechanism, where one bypasses the judicial authorisation procedure provided for in sections 4 and 5 where one wants a more limited tracking device to be placed, rather than the broader definition of surveillance device.</P>
        <P>Why include tracking devices within the ambit of surveillance devices if one can go straight to a superior officer?  There is no requirement that there be circumstances of urgency.  I suggested an amendment where one could operate section 8 where there were circumstances of urgency.  Senator Regan&rsquo;s approach, which was recommended by the Irish Human Rights Commission, states that section 8 should instead be the mechanism for seeking judicial authorisation of tracking devices only.</P>
        <P>Either approach would be better than the current one, which envisages that one can go to a superior officer who it appears, although there may be constitutional problems, could be somebody involved in the investigation, to get permission for a tracking device for up to four months.  One can enter somebody&rsquo;s home to plant a tracking device under section 8(5) and re-enter it to take it away.  All of that can be done without judicial authorisation, even where there are no urgent circumstances.</P>
        <P>This could potentially breach the convention and I am grateful to the Irish Human Rights Commission for providing a very considered set of observations on the Bill.  It was very exercised by section 8, which it suggested provides for a separate mechanism for tracking devices.  Paragraph 20 of its report states section 8 of the Bill provides for a separate system of authorisation for tracking devices and that this type of surveillance should be subject to the same types of safeguards provided for in the other types of surveillance envisaged under the 2009 Bill and that, in particular, there should be judicial supervision of the use of such devices.</P>
        <P>On my reading, there can be such supervision under sections 4 and 5, because one can go to a judge where one merely wants to plant a tracking device as it is included as a type of surveil<Col N="681"/>lance device.  However, there is an automatic bypass, without the need for circumstances of urgency, in section 8.  I am concerned the provision might be too broad, particularly having regard to the case of Klass <i>v</i>. Germany to which Senator Regan referred and which is also dealt with by the Irish Human Rights Commission.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It recommends that there should be a requirement that a judge should authorise the operation of tracking devices so that the same safeguards are applied to the use of all types of surveillance devices, including tracking devices.  The Minister of State could make that change or take my proposal in amendment No. 9, that is, to limit section 8 to the circumstance of emergency as apply in section 7.  Either mechanism would allow superior officers to authorise tracking, but would also allow for safeguards to be in place to the same degree as are in place for the planting of surveillance devices more broadly defined.</P>
        <P>There is a lack of clarity about the definitions.  It is not clear, as Senator Regan and I have discussed, whether section 8 is envisaged to be the sole procedure for planting tracking devices or sections 4 and 5 should be read as applying to it.  Sections 4 and 5 do apply to tracking devices &mdash; that has to be the clear reading.  However, any officer who is involved in an investigation and is aware of these procedures will be aware he or she can simply go straight to his or her superior officer without going to a judge, if all he or she wants to plant is a tracking device.</P>
        <P>In practice, the judicial authorisation route will be bypassed because section 8 exists in its present form, and because there is great potential for abuse it is important that section 8 be amended, by Senator Regan&rsquo;s amendment or by mine.  Either would address the concerns offered by the Irish Human Rights Commission.  It has, as we have, offered a broad welcome for the Bill.  We are offering these amendments in a spirit of seeking to be constructive, to strengthen the Bill, to ensure it is less open to challenge than in its current form and to ensure there is less potential for abuse.</P>
        <P>As a colourful example of a recent high-profile bugging exercise, I read that the indiscretions of Italian Premier Silvio Berlusconi have come to light because of covert surveillance devices planted in the home of his hosts at a party he attended.  As a by-product of the bugging, which was to investigate a completely different set of dealings between different businessmen, various conversations Mr. Berlusconi had with women came to light and entered the public domain.  The case highlights the fallout that can occur from covert surveillance and the great deal of care that needs to be taken when we are authorising it.</P>
        <P>I do not say this by way of opposition to the Bill because I accept, as I have already done, that it is welcome and sets an important statutory framework.  However, we need to ensure it is a strong and watertight statutory framework.  I am not sure section 8 is sufficiently watertight in its current form.  I would be grateful to hear the Minister of State&rsquo;s considered view on this point.</P>

	<P>These amendments seek to make the use of tracking devices by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na subject to judicial authorisation rather than the system of approvals currently provided for in the Bill.  The use of tracking devices is regarded as a less intrusive means of surveillance compared to others.  Tracking devices are defined for the purpose of the Bill as devices to provide information on the location of a person, vehicle or thing.  In providing for a system of approvals rather than authorisations, the Bill seeks to achieve a balance between the necessity for fast action in the placing of tracking devices and the provision of an effective regulatory framework for their use.  While the tracking devices do not require judicial authorisation, they are subject to the oversight framework laid down in the Bill for surveillance devices.</P><Col N="682"/>
        <P>Tracking devices provide information on the location of persons, vehicles or things, and the opportunity and timing of their placement is critical if they are to be successfully used.  A tracking device can be attached, for example, to a package that is suspected to be a drugs shipment as it arrives in port, or to a vehicle.  In many cases its placement will be required at short notice; otherwise, the opportunity to prevent or solve a crime would be lost because the vehicle or package may have moved on.  As with approval of surveillance in cases of urgency, it is imperative that the Bill provides for an effective and practical system that can be used by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na which does not result in unnecessary delay while a court application is sought &mdash; a delay that might hinder or jeopardise an investigation.</P>
        <P>As a counterbalance, the Bill provides for a stringent system of control for the use of tracking devices, including rules on record keeping and reporting where such approval is given.  Although the function of tracking devices as surveillance devices is somewhat limited, the timely use of a tracking device can be an effective tool in the armoury of both security and customs personnel.</P>
        <P>For those reasons, I do not propose to accept the amendments.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>The background to this legislation is the extreme situation that exists with regard to gangland crime and organised crime.  In this extreme situation, it can seem petty to suggest safeguards and amendments to a Bill, the very purpose of which is legitimate and of vital importance.  However, if I read the Bill correctly, the application for these tracking devices and for surveillance does not have to be made in writing and can be made orally.  It is retrospectively that a superior officer draws up a report which sets out the justification for the authorisation.  Perhaps the Minister of State can clarify this point.</P>
        <P>The reality is that despite the context in which we are adopting this legislation, there is scope for abuse.  It is this we are trying to guard against and thereby ensure the Bill is drafted in the best possible way.  I ask the Minister of State to reconsider his objections to this amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>To echo Senator Regan, I take the Minister&rsquo;s point that tracking devices are less intrusive than surveillance devices more broadly.  Entry to people&rsquo;s homes is authorised under section 8 to plant and withdraw tracking devices and these devices can be placed for up to four months without judicial authorisation according to this section.  I take the Minister of State&rsquo;s point that they could be attached to packages or vehicles but they are not confined to goods in transit, where there might be a real situation of urgency.  This authorises tracking devices to be placed in any location.</P>
        <P>I am at a loss as to why it was considered necessary to have this bypass route for the placing of tracking devices.  Reading the section as a practising lawyer, one can anticipate that where section 8 has been used and applied, and where a trial then ensues, the superior officer who has approved the placing of the tracking device will in practice be cross-examined extensively on the basis of the written record of approval, the time, the conditions and so on.  It may be very problematic to operate in practice and I do not see why it was considered necessary to do this.</P>
        <P>It is very easy to go before a district judge.  The practice of getting peace commissioners and so on to issue search warrants became problematic and it is much easier to go to a district judge because that procedure is much more watertight.  Once something like this has received judicial authorisation and consideration, it is much harder for defence lawyers to go behind it, to put it bluntly.  To take section 5, the district judge hears the authorisation application <i>ex parte</i> and in private, and it can be any district judge and does not have to be the district judge assigned to any particular district &mdash; there was a case on this point.  The procedure for seeking <Col N="683"/>judicial authorisation for surveillance devices seems straightforward and I am not sure why it was considered necessary to have this bypass mechanism in section 8 for all sorts for tracking devices for up to four months, even where there are no circumstances of urgency.  I have no problem with the idea of section 8 in circumstances of urgency, as section 7 provides, but I am unclear as to why it is so broadly drafted.</P>
        <P>Another operational reason it may not be used in practice, although I am not sure this has been considered, is that the evidence of the tracking of people&rsquo;s location and movements is already routinely offered in criminal trials on the basis of mobile phone records which can be sought by the Garda from the mobile phone companies.  We have seen very high-profile convictions on the basis of people&rsquo;s location at crucial times having been proved in court on the basis of mobile phone records.  It begs the question of whether it is necessary to have this elaborate bypass mechanism in all the written records and ministerial regulations when there is already the alternative method of offering evidence of people&rsquo;s movements through tracking.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy John Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>To reiterate, the system of approvals was deemed appropriate where the use of tracking devices is regarded as less intrusive.  From a practical and operational point of view, it is important to try to get the balance right with regard to the necessity for fast action and, on the other side, the reporting and safeguards.  It is not just a question of a tracking device being switched on for four months and away we go.  There is much more to it than that.</P>

        <P LI="1">&ldquo;, in cases of urgency where the provisions of <i>section 7(2) </i>apply&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I will be brief because we have dealt with the substance of this amendment while discussing Senator Regan&rsquo;s amendment.  This is a corollary and may be more attractive to the Minister of State because it allows for the current system to operate.  Superior officers may approve tracking devices under section 8 but the amendment simply inserts a proviso that they may only do so in cases of urgency and in which the provisions of section 7(2) apply.  I am trying to ensure the general rule would be observed and that generally the Garda would require judicial authorisation before any tracking or other surveillance device could be planted.  Sections 4 and 5 provide for the default application procedures and sections 7 and 8 would only come into operation in cases of urgency.  Therefore, the power of a superior officer to approve tracking and surveillance devices would be limited to urgent situations.  I do not propose to limit the time although the Irish Human Rights Commission suggested that could be another way of limiting the effect of section 8.  It recommended a reduction in the maximum duration for which the use of a tracking device could be authorised.  However, I am simply saying that as a safeguard superior officers should only be able to grant approval where circumstances of urgency apply.  This seems to me a reasonable amendment which allows for non-judicial approval but <Col N="684"/>limits the cases in which non-judicial approval may be sought.  I do not see why there is a need for such a broad bypass as currently provided for in section 8.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy John Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>The amendment seeks to provide that the approvals system which applies to the use of tracking devices would only be utilised in circumstances of urgency as set out in section 7(2).  Tracking devices within the definition provided for in the Bill provide information on location only.  They are less intrusive in character than other surveillance devices.  They do not record sound or capture images.  If a particular device used carries out any of these functions in the course of a surveillance operation, it is no longer considered to be a tracking device and is subject to the same authorisation procedure required for the use of other surveillance devices.  It is because of the less intrusive nature of tracking devices that an approvals system rather than a court authorisation procedure is used.  In providing for a system of approvals rather than authorisations, the Bill seeks to achieve a balance between the necessity for fast action in the placing of the tracking device and the provision of an effective regulatory framework for their use.</P>
        <P>Tracking devices monitor the movement of persons, vehicles or things.  The opportunity for and timing of their placement is critical if they are to be used successfully.  A tracking device could be attached to a package, such as a drugs shipment at a port, or to a vehicle.  In many cases its placement could be required at short notice.  Otherwise the opportunity to prevent or solve a crime could be lost because the vehicle or package could have moved on.  As with the approval for surveillance in a case of urgency, it is imperative the Bill provides an efficient and practical system which can be used by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and which does not result in unnecessary delay while a court application is sought.  Such a delay could hinder or jeopardise an investigation.  As a counterbalance the Bill provides for a stringent system of controls for the use of tracking devices, including rules, record keeping and reporting in cases in which such approval is granted.  The kernel of the argument, as in the previous debate, is that tracking devices are specifically dealt with in the sense that they are deemed to be significantly less intrusive than other forms of surveillance.  It is in this regard that the distinction has emerged.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 13:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 15, lines 27 to 31, to delete subsection (1) and substitute the following:</P>
        <P LI="1">&ldquo;(1) The Minister shall invite a retired judge of the High Court to undertake the duties specified in this section and, if the invitation is accepted, shall designate the judge for the purposes performing those functions.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This provides for judicial oversight after the event by the appointment of a serving High Court judge.  Among the functions designated to him or her are to keep under review the operations of sections 4 to 8, the essential parts of the Bill, and to report to the Taoiseach from time to time and at least once every 12 months concerning any matters relating to the operations of these sections that he or she considers should be reported.  My difficulty with the provision is that a sitting High Court judge would act as adviser and report directly to the Taoiseach.  It embroils the Judiciary in the executive and legislative arm of the State in a manner which is inappropriate, bearing in mind the constitutional principle of the separation of powers.  I recognise that there is a similar provision in the Interception of Postal Packets and Telecommunications Parcels (Regulation) Act 1993 but I asked the Minister on Second Stage whether the Attorney General had advice specifically on the provision in this section in light of my question on the separation of powers.  It seems to be inappropriate that a sitting judge should act as adviser and report directly to the Taoiseach on this matter.  It does not sit well with the basic principle of the separation of powers.  I also raised other issues in regard to this but rather than oppose the section, I have tried to move an amendment which provides that the judge in question would be a retired judge.  This would deal with the concern I expressed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the amendment.  It seems to be a departure from practice to invite a sitting judge to undertake the function of reporting to the Executive and keeping under review particular provisions of the Bill.  It is sensible that the power would be instead delegated to a retired judge.  I understand this is more commonly the practice in such cases and I urge the Minister of State to consider the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy John Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>The amendment provides for the replacement of section 12(1) which provides that the President of the High Court having consulted with the Minister would invite a serving High Court judge to undertake the duties specified.  If the invitation were accepted the Government would designate the judge for the purpose of performing those functions.  The amendment provides that the Minister would invite a retired judge to perform the functions specified in the section and would designate the judge for those purposes if the invitation were accepted.</P>
        <P>The oversight functions of the designated judge set out in the section are not judicial functions nor are they intended to be functions for which the person concerned would be in receipt <Col N="686"/>of a stipend.  In carrying out functions under section 12, the judge would be performing neither legislative nor executive functions.  It is clear any judge who takes up such functions would have the approval of the President of the High Court in doing so.  In terms of the Constitution there is no objection in principle to a serving judge performing non-judicial tasks.  If the person designated to undertake these functions were a retired judge, he or she would require some form of fee or payment for the task and there is no provision in the Bill for the creation of a paid post.</P>
        <P>In reply to Senator Bacik, as Senator Regan said, this mirrors the 1993 Act.  Senator Bacik raised this point on Second Stage and while the Attorney General&rsquo;s office would have reviewed the legislation, I asked for clarification on this particular point at the specific request of the Senator and the Attorney General is satisfied.</P>

      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not have any objection to the wording but I note the Human Rights Commission made a very useful proposal that this section would be used to allow the relevant Minister to require particular codes of practice to be drawn up relating to the operation of the Bill.  I have already referred to the need for some form of code of practice governing the placing and removal of tracking devices.  I note that in the British legislation, section 71 of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 obliges the Home Secretary to issue codes of practice relating to the exercise of surveillance powers and duties.  The Human Rights Commission has suggested that this would be useful to include in this Bill because it would allow such a code to be proofed against and underpinned by relevant human rights standards.  This might be a useful aid in ensuring that the powers provided for in the Bill would be carried out in a proportionate and reasonable manner.  Section 16 as drafted allows for such codes of practice to be drawn up but I merely wish to put on the record of the House the fact that they would be very useful and really important in ensuring that the powers authorised by the Bill are carried out in a reasonable way.</P>

        <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
        <P Just="Center">SECTION 17.</P>
        <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 17 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>Section 17 proposes to preclude the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na ombudsman from availing of the provisions of this Bill when it may be in the course of carrying out its functions, which have been designated to it by the Oireachtas, as an independent oversight of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Not to be in a position to avail of the instruments which are provided for in the Bill limits the capacity of that body to fulfil its role.  I do not see the justification for this provision in section 17.</P><Col N="687"/>
        <P>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission has a very limited role in this Bill.  If it is to carry out its duties effectively, and where it is investigating abuses, it should have all of the necessary facilities to do so effectively.  I fail to understand the rationale for this provision and the reason the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission is specifically precluded from availing of this facility where it may find it necessary to carry out an investigation into the investigation by the police force of what can be very serious crimes.</P>
        <P>We know the background to the potential for abuse.  We have had the Morris tribunal and we have all been shocked by the extent to which abuses can take place.  Given the importance of this Bill and the interference with the right to privacy which we know is justified in the vast majority of cases where this will be used, there is potential for abuse of this system for personal gain by individuals in the force.  If this provision and facility was available to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, this would be a significant deterrent against any potential abuse and it would be an additional safeguard that should be included in the Bill.  I have difficulties with section 17 which I oppose.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I would oppose the exclusion of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission from the powers provided for in this Bill.  Again I am grateful to the Human Rights Commission for providing us with very extensive notes.  The commission points out that the functions of the commission include the investigation of complaints concerning the investigation of alleged arrestable offences involving members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It would be important and in keeping with the European Convention on Human Rights that where there has been an allegation of an arrestable offence having been committed by an agent of the State, the institution or the entity which must investigate such allegations should have the same or equivalent powers as agencies of the State investigating the allegations of arrestable offences committed by ordinary members of the public.  There is a difficulty where the commission does not have the same powers as the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in terms of the same sort of offences.  Indeed, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission also investigates complaints concerning death or serious injury to a person.  Excluding the commission from the surveillance legislation seems to be out of line with good practice in neighbouring jurisdictions.  It is unfortunate to see that it is excluded and that it does not have the same powers that are been provided for here. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy John Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>Under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, the investigative staff of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission have all the powers of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with the exception of the interception powers under the Interception of Postal Packets and Telecommunications Messages Regulation Act 1993 and any provisions of the Offences against the State Acts 1939 to 1998.  The decision taken at the time of the enactment of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, was that it would be preferable to wait until the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission had gained more operational experience before considering the application of interception powers to it.  It is the Minister&rsquo;s position that this should also apply to the surveillance powers under the Criminal Justice (Surveillance) Bill at this time and, accordingly, section 17 of the Bill has been included which amends section 98(5) of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005.  The provisions of the Criminal Justice (Surveillance) Bill do not apply to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission.</P>
        <P>The commission has a role under this legislation in that section 11 of the Bill allows the complaints referee to refer a matter to the ombudsman commission where he or she believes there has been a contravention of the Act by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>
        <P>The surveillance Bill is a very specific measure which has been brought forward specifically in the context of a robust response to the threats posed by serious crime.  It provides for the first time a basis in law for secret surveillance by State agencies concerned, principally the <Col N="688"/>Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, in their roles as the primary law enforcement and security agencies of the State.</P>
        <P>The exclusion of ombudsman commission from the provisions of the Bill is in line with practice in Northern Ireland.  The Office of the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland does not have the interception powers or powers of surveillance.  Under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000, the Office of the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland has powers of directed surveillance but those do not extend to their interception or the type of surveillance which is the subject of this legislation.  The situation in respect of the extension of both interception and surveillance powers to the Office of the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland is under review.  It was established in 2001 and the ombudsman commission has been modelled on that office.  Further consideration of the future application of additional powers to the office of the commission will be undertaken in light of the operational experience and in the context of an overall review of the efficiency and effectiveness of the commission and the adequacy of the functions assigned to it in the 2005 Act.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>Is it true that the situation is similar to that in England?  As I understand it, the practice in Northern Ireland, England and Wales, is that the equivalent bodies have this power.  The Minister of State referred to operational experience &mdash; I think that was the term he used &mdash; of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission but the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na must gain operational experience in the area of surveillance, particularly covert surveillance, if it is to work effectively.  On that basis I fail to understand the rationale for not making this facility, which would be used only in very exceptional cases by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission.  Nevertheless, the fact that the facility is available would act as a major deterrent against abuse and would be an additional safeguard in the Bill, which is warranted.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><NameTxt>Deputy John Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>The Office of the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland does not have the interception powers or the surveillance type powers envisaged in this legislation.

      </Speaker>
        <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill do now pass.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate the Minister has considered each of the proposed amendments, although he has rejected all of them.  I hope the Bill, when it is adopted and put into practice, will not fail because of the intransigence regarding some of those amendments, which were made in a constructive manner and were designed to improve and strengthen the Bill.</P>
        <P>We are adopting this legislation in extreme circumstances and extreme measures are needed to deal with the extraordinary problems we have with organised crime, drug dealing and gangland crime.  One is always conscious also of the theme in the film &ldquo;The Lives of Others&rdquo; that there is scope for abuse.  It is important adequate safeguards are in place to ensure that innocent people are not victims of misuse of this type of legislation and facility that is accorded to the guardians of the peace, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Revenue Commissioners and the Defence Forces.</P>
        <P>Fine Gael has supported the Bill.  We made some constructive suggestions and proposed amendments.  I appreciate that the matter has been debated thoroughly and I appreciate the Minister&rsquo;s attention.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="IvanaBacik"><NameTxt>Senator Ivana Bacik</NameTxt>
	<P>I express my appreciation also for the Minister&rsquo;s considered response to the amendments tabled by me and Senator Regan.  I welcome the opportunity to debate the Bill.  I welcome also the provision of a statutory framework for covert surveillance and tracking devices.  Report Stage was rushed through somewhat hastily and we did not have time to table amendments but I accept we had a considered debate on the amendments we tabled on Committee Stage.  I appreciate also that there is a need for urgency, given the number of horrific murders that have taken place in the context of organised crime.</P>
        <P>The amendments I proposed and the comments I made on Second and Committee Stages were made in a spirit of being constructive and ensuring that there are adequate safeguards in the legislation and that the legislation is watertight and will not be misused in any way.  I expressed concerns about some matters, particularly in sections 7 and 8 on which we must be particularly cautious because those provisions allow for non-judicial authorisation of surveillance devices.</P>
        <P>I expressed concern also about the State security ground on which surveillance could be approved because in the past we have seen peaceful protestors and people exercising their civic right to protest being subjected to surveillance.  Groups that spring to mind are the protestors such as those involved in the Shell to Sea campaign who might have valid concerns about State intrusion on their civil liberties.  In the interests of protestors who have been involved in environmental and various other protests, it is important we recognise their right to protest, legitimately and peacefully, and that we ensure the powers of the State are not abused where we are allowing for covert surveillance to be used.</P>
        <P>I welcome the statutory framework, however, and in particular sections 3, 4 and 5 that provide a clear framework for judges to provide authorisation for surveillance.</P>

	<P>Senator Bacik has said a lot of what I would have said and I will content myself by repeating the points that are of interest to me.  I believe there are some areas where there may be the capacity for too great an intrusion by the State.  Senator Bacik, in her professorial capacity, dealt with those very well and raised those concerns.  It remains to be seen what happens in the outcome in court through the legal system, whether those concerns are justified.</P>
        <P>Senator Bacik raised the question that is closest to my heart, among those questions which I only glanced upon rather than dealt with in full in my Second Stage contribution, in particular the question of groups like the Shell to Sea protestors at Corrib.</P>

I believe those people are doing us a service because a deal was done by a Minister, who subsequently served a jail sentence, and the resources of this State, which belong rightfully to the people, were handed to a multinational combine, which is regarded as probably the dirtiest ecologically.  It was awarded that particular distinction in recent days and was forced to pay $10 million for its implication in the murder of Ken Saro-Wiwa.

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>It is quite jazzy.  Whereas the activities of the State, in terms of surveillance, are examined in the Bill, what are not directly examined or challenged legally in the Bill are the activities of people outside the direct State apparatus.  I refer to the fairly thuggish security groups employed by various concerns, including Shell Oil.  That worries me.  I would like to know it will be covered, perhaps in other legislation.</P>
        <P>Senator Bacik expressed her concern about the invasion of privacy and I spoke about this matter at some length on Second Stage.  I regretted the fact that the Minister of State did not give more scope to this matter in his introductory speech.  I instanced, for example, the fact that someone could be legitimately targeted for surveillance but there could be innocent third parties and the evidence gained by this might make its way into the newspapers.

I listened intently to the very fair amendments put forward by Senators Regan and Bacik and to their arguments.  Desperate measures are needed to deal with desperate situations.  We are talking about very serious crime.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">8 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P Just="Left">I note the support for the Bill, subject to certain reservations.  I listened to the issues raised, including the time limit and whether a superintendent or chief superintendent was required.  In a very remote area of west Cork, the two biggest importations of drugs ever seen in the State were intercepted.  In one case the Garda came across the drugs by accident because a boat sank and in the other it found them as a result of intense monitoring by international police with the co-operation of the local authorities.  In certain areas of the country, whether west Cork or north-west Donegal, the availability of a chief superintendent or a District Court judge at short notice might not be practical.</P>
        <P>I thank my colleagues.  I also thank the Minister of State for his in-depth knowledge of the Bill.  I am delighted we have come to this conclusion.  I have no doubt the fruits of the Bill&rsquo;s success will be seen when drugs barons are put behind bars.</P>

I do not view the amendments as opposition but as attempts to tease out the contents of the Bill and to be satisfied that it is effective and robust.  I view the amendments in that spirit.</P>
        <P>The Bill pushes out the boundaries but we face a very difficult situation.  We must achieve a balance between tackling serious crime and protecting people&rsquo;s rights.  I listened to Senators&rsquo; arguments and I read the Bill carefully to be satisfied that it respected those rights and also afforded the Garda real and tangible facilities to effect its operations.  I believe we have struck that balance and that the legislation is proportionate.  I hope we will see the fruits of our efforts when people are brought to court for very serious crimes, especially where witnesses are being intimidated.  This type of evidence may be the deciding factor in many of the cases which do not reach the courts at present for all sorts of reasons.</P>
        <P>I thank everyone for their full support of the legislation.  The amendments challenge us to ensure that what we are doing is seen to be robust.  I assure Senator Regan that we did check the point with the Attorney General.</P>

        <P LI="1">&ldquo;2.&mdash;Notwithstanding anything in this Act, a property which has been the family home or principal residence of any person who is in residential nursing home care immediately prior to their admission to such residential nursing home or other residential care facility, shall not <Col N="692"/>be subject of any charge, save and except in circumstances where that property has subsequently been let to a third party.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This amendment speaks for itself.  It arises from the concern that I and many other Senators raised regarding the anomaly in the Bill which would ensure that a charge would apply to the family home of a person, most likely an elderly person, who might have to be admitted to a nursing home for residential care.  As the nursing home would be considered under the Bill to be the person&rsquo;s primary residence, we believe the matter of the family home must be addressed in the legislation to ensure a charge does not apply to it.</P>
        <P>Late in the debate on Committee Stage the Minister undertook to review this aspect of the Bill.  Everybody agrees that it was not the intent of the Bill to apply a charge in those circumstances.  However, that does not take away from the fact that the Bill as drafted permits the charge to be levied.  Fine Gael believes this is unacceptable.  There are thousands of elderly people throughout the country in this situation.  Obviously they face the high costs of nursing home care and to have this further charge imposed on them and their estate would cause unnecessary stress, a headache at local level for the local authorities that propose to collect it, and uproar in the community.  That is unacceptable.</P>
        <P>Fine Gael has framed the amendment to assist the Minister on this matter.  The amendment acknowledges that where the family home is let, the charge should apply, which is reasonable.  Fine Gael has been reasonable in tabling this amendment.  I would hate to see the Bill leave the House without an amendment to remove any likely charge on the family homes of people in nursing homes.  It would be remiss of the House to allow that to happen.  It was clear from yesterday&rsquo;s debate that there is general cross-party support for the Bill and the concept of raising revenue through a charge on second homes.  It provides for a new revenue stream for local authorities, which is welcome.  However, we must be careful when drafting legislation.  Rushed legislation is not good legislation.  This Bill appears to have been rushed to a degree and does not appear to have been fully considered, which is why there are anomalies in it.</P>
        <P>I look forward to the Minister&rsquo;s comments on this matter.  Fine Gael intends to protect elderly people who must go into nursing homes by ensuring that this charge will not apply to their family homes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment.  The Minister said yesterday that the most important exemption by far relates to principal private residences.  He also dealt with the issue raised by Senator Paudie Coffey.  It is important that we nail the definition of principal primary residence.  I do not believe it is the Minister&rsquo;s intention in this legislation to penalise the elderly &mdash; that would not be his form given his political philosophy &mdash; but consider what was unearthed in the Bill yesterday by Senator Coffey.  We must put people&rsquo;s minds at ease.  If, God forbid, I am put into a nursing home 20 years hence and my private residence lies idle, the Bill can be interpreted to mean that the &euro;200 charge would apply.</P>
        <P>The Minister and his spokesman last night accused Fine Gael of playing politics with this, or said something to that effect.  The Minister said during yesterday&rsquo;s debate that the charge will not apply to the principal private residence but I contend that the nursing home, maisonette or granny flat should also be exempt.  It is important that the Bill leaves the Seanad with the anomaly and ambiguity cleared up.  The language used in a Bill is important and rushed legislation is not good legislation.  There has been much confusion and uncertainty.  I hope the Minister will allay that concern tonight.  We are being helpful in putting forward this amendment.  It is drafted in explicit and simple language which will avoid confusion, allay the fears of many and put paid to the idea that we are imposing a tax on somebody for getting old.  I hope the Minister&rsquo;s reply is positive.</P>

	<P>I thank the Senators for their amendments.  As I indicated yesterday, it was never the intention of the legislation, nor would it have been the ultimate effect, that it would affect elderly and incapacitated people who are long-term residents of nursing homes.  However, for the avoidance of doubt, I undertook to make the legislation clear in this regard and to ensure the Bill does not apply the &euro;200 charge to these people.  I sought the advice of the Office of the Attorney General on the issue and, on foot of that advice, I will take whatever measures are required to ensure the charge will not apply to residents of nursing homes in respect of their vacated main or sole residence.</P>
        <P>Senators will appreciate that it is important when drafting amendments to be as comprehensive and accurate as possible.  I will need a little time to finalise this process.  As the Senators said, it is not good to rush into these things.  For that reason, I intend to table an amendment on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il and to report back to the Seanad.  I thank Senators for their engagement with me on this matter.  I hope they can agree to my proposal to copperfasten my intention of ensuring the charge will not apply in the circumstances I have described.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for explaining his position.  It is an awkward position due to the fact that this was not noticed when the legislation was being drafted.  I accept he is seeking the best advice available, which is the reasonable and right thing to do.  However, I am disappointed that the Seanad is not being given the opportunity to amend the legislation to remove this charge.  I acknowledge the right of the Minister to table his amendments in the D&aacute;il but we have debated this Bill at length and as the Seanad is, like the D&aacute;il, a House of the Oireachtas, we have every right to correct legislation where anomalies are found.</P>
        <P>This is an anomaly that would affect the elderly.  It is most disappointing that the Bill, if the Fianna F&aacute;il Party supports it, will leave the Seanad with this anomaly in place.  That is not acceptable.  It is the reason Fine Gael tabled this amendment and the reason we will put the amendment to a vote.  I hope it will be seen and accepted by all sides of the House as a genuine attempt by the Fine Gael Party to address this anomaly that will affect the elderly in a most unfair manner.  Those who will go into residential nursing home care, whether long-term or short-term, should not have the family home charged.</P>
        <P>I shall say no more.  We put a great deal of time and debate into this legislation.  I am disappointed that, as Senators, we will not have the opportunity to correct the legislation before it leaves the House.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 4, after line 44, to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;(<i>i</i>) a building which is occupied as a dwelling by a parent or both parents of the owner.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">During the debate on Committee Stage, the difficulty with regard to granny flats or dwellings where elderly dependent relatives live adjacent to the owner of the entire dwelling, be it a bungalow or semi-detached house, was identified.  We highlighted other situations, including that of the original family home on a cottage acre or family farm being signed over to a son or daughter who, in time, will build on the site, as is often the case in rural Ireland, with the elderly dependent relative remaining in the old family dwelling.  There is a case to be made for exemption as this example is not facilitated in the legislation.</P>
        <P>The definition of granny flats was heavily debated.  As other Senators and I outlined yesterday, families building dwellings for elderly dependent relatives on the sides of their homes is a commonplace occurrence.  Such dwellings are self-contained and have a kitchenette, a bedroom and a small living room.  In many cases they have their own electricity supplies and meters, but they are granny flats attached to the original dwellings.  Under the terms of the Bill, those flats will be liable for the second property charge.  This is unjust and unreasonable.</P>
        <P>Since a clearer definition is required, we have retabled our amendment on Report Stage to the effect that a building occupied as a dwelling by a parent or both parents of the owner would be included on the exempted list.  As Senators stated yesterday, families build onto their homes to accommodate elderly relatives to remove the burden from the State and to keep people in a comfortable social environment with family supports.  If enacted in its current form, the Bill will impose an unjust levy on the owners of such dwellings which are being used to care for elderly relatives.</P>
        <P>A right of residence clause attaching to an agreement signing a family farm and home over to a son or daughter is commonplace in rural Ireland.  In this way, an elderly parent or adult siblings can retain the right to reside in the original family dwelling while the son or daughter builds on the farm.  The problem is that the person to whom the farm is transferred will be liable for the charge despite the fact that nothing but the title has changed.  Until his or her death, the relative will continue to live in the original home under right of residence, yet the owner will be charged the second property levy.  It was not the intention of the Bill to levy <Col N="695"/>those people.  Rather, it was to levy large investors.  We have identified this problem area as being unjust and unfair to families.  For this reason, we have tabled our amendment.</P>
        <P>We would like our amendments to be accepted.  If they are not accepted yet there is still to be a change, we would like the Minister to table the amendments in this House, allowing the legislation leaving the Seanad for the D&aacute;il to be more complete.  No Member takes pride in the lists of D&aacute;il amendments being reported to the Seanad.  Last night, groups of amendments to the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill were reported by the D&aacute;il.  The Bill was initiated in the Seanad.  There is no reason for such amendments not to be dealt with in this House as opposed to in the D&aacute;il.  As the Minister stated yesterday, the Seanad is a relevant House of Parliament.  We want it to be so, but we take no pride in lists of amendments being reported back.  The cause is the ordering of business.  Important legislation is being squashed into the last few days of the current term.  As the Minister admitted, he is being rushed whereas he needs time to table his amendments.  Were the Bill introduced in the Seanad earlier, he could have tabled his Report Stage amendments in this House.  To some degree the Seanad is being slighted.  I do not say this in a nasty way but the situation is not acceptable.</P>
        <P>Our amendment proposes that a building occupied as a dwelling by a parent or both parents of the owner be exempted from the charge.  This provision is fair and Fine Gael believes the legislation should be changed to accommodate people in such circumstances.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I second the amendment and, like Senator Coffey, call on the Minister to accept it.  The premise of the Department&rsquo;s argument is that a property tax will lead to the greater utilisation of property.  It is unfair to people.  On the basis of the Ramsey rule, one will see this policy will not lend itself to people using property or to their being able to use it properly.  What is the principle behind holding on to a maisonette, granny flat or, as Senator Coffey suggested, the house on the family farm or piece of land?  Definition and detail are very important.  The approach in the Bill, as it stands, does not reflect what the Minister stated to the House in the course of the debate.  To use an old clich&eacute;, the devil is in the detail.  This is why there is a need for clearer definition.  Are we trying to create a new type of dwelling through this Bill?  If so, we will have to rethink the whole issue of property, be it land or a type of dwelling.</P>
        <P>While I know the Minister is open to suggestion, I believe it would be wrong if he did not outline clearly and specifically what is proposed for maisonettes and granny flats.  The people who are using these dwellings are saving the State a fortune on health care.  Are we trying to create a new type of dwelling?  What does the Minister intend in the legislation?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Senators Coffey and Buttimer are correct that it is a question of definition.  I strongly support the intention of the amendment and believe the Minister does also.  I heard him on the radio deploring the fact that what he had regarded as a positive engagement with the Seanad and his preparedness to accept amendments was, to a certain extent, turned into a political football.  He was accused of U-turns and so forth.  This kind of commentary is unnecessary and I am glad it did not happen in Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  The other House conducts its business according to its own rules.  The Seanad wants to be as constructive as possible.</P>
        <P>Granny flats are a comparatively recent phenomenon.  My saying &ldquo;recent&rdquo; is a function of my age.  Granny flats have featured in the past 30 or 40 years but were never heard of when I was really young.  I have seen examples all over the place, including very luxurious accommodation attaching itself to dwellings in the Ailesbury Road area, with which I am glad to say I was once familiar.  The scent of mown hay or grass in a well-cultivated front garden in the suburbs on evenings such as these causes a kind of Proustian flashback.  Granny flats range from those kinds of luxurious accommodations to others in more humble areas of the city or less refined suburbs, where I have also lived.  They were basically converted garages.</P><Col N="696"/>
        <P>The phenomenon of having granny flats was socially very positive because it held the generations together and meant that elderly parents, rather than going into a nursing home, could be afforded the comfort of proximity to their relatives.  They had a degree of independence, which is so important psychologically in every way.  At the same time, they benefited from the care of, and a relationship with, their children and, perhaps, grandchildren.  This is socially very constructive.</P>
        <P>The difficultly with the amendment is that it is not focused sufficiently.  Will this Bill be returning to the D&aacute;il?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Senator David Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister might consider this area and come up with a focused measure.  According to the amendment, it seems a dwelling does not even have to be attached to the main house.  It would be inappropriate if very wealthy people with very wealthy parents did not have to pay just because those parents lived in a structure that had been transferred to their children by gift of deed, for example.  A sum of &euro;200 is fairly modest.  The amendment is so broad that it fails to achieve its intention, with which I hope the Minister agrees.  I imagine he might do so.  If I were him, I would not allow myself to be intimidated or bullied out of accepting the principle of a good amendment simply because some less enlightened people in the Lower House would make a mockery of it because of his having done the right thing.  If one does the right thing, it has its own reward.  The intention of the amendment is very good but its scope is just too broad.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Senator Paul Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I support what my two Fine Gael colleagues have said.  I appreciate the Minister is paying serious attention to this Bill.  I am also conscious he may be making proposals on Seanad reform and I therefore advise my colleagues to tread carefully with him.  All our futures may be in his hands.  The Minister appreciates we are approaching this legislation with a view to clarifying some of the points of confusion and bringing about improvements, where necessary.</P>
        <P>The Bill started off small but has attracted public interest.  One or two anomalies have been brought to our attention over the past day or two.  One brought to my attention and that of most of my colleagues today relates to properties to which a right of residence attaches.  A property may be vacant but the elderly parent or sibling of the owner might have a right of residence in the house.  Once there is such a right, the property cannot be sold or made available for letting.  What is the Minister&rsquo;s intention regarding such properties.  There is a substantial number of them across the country.  The anomaly may not be fully covered by the amendment.  What is the Minister&rsquo;s thinking and has he proposals to deal with the matter?</P>
        <P>Can I take advantage of this opportunity, perhaps unfairly, to ask the Minister to comment on an issue I raised yesterday, namely, properties that have been repossessed by financial institutions and let to the former mortgagees?  The Minister did not get to comment on these in his Second Stage reply.  It is becoming more prevalent that financial institutions, rather than repossessing mortgagees&rsquo; homes and evicting them therefrom, are entering into rental agreements with them.  I presume the bank would own the house in such cases.  Will financial penalties be applied in such cases?</P>
        <P>There is some confusion over ground rent.  I am by no means an expert on the matter.  A significant number of properties in some towns and villages are subject to ground rent.  Is there a need for clarification of the duties of the property owners?  In Mallow, ground rent is still being paid or is theoretically owed to persons no longer resident in the jurisdiction.  Is the Minister in a position to clarify the position on the obligations of owners of properties to which ground rent attaches?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="697"/>
      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I was very taken with the last few contributions and the very pertinent issues raised by Senator Bradford.  Senator Norris&rsquo;s Proustian flashbacks give us all a moment of joy as we work into the evening.  The smell of mown grass is not unknown in east Galway and Senator Norris is welcome to visit any time.</P>
        <P>There is good sense in the Fine Gael amendment.  I accept the principle of the Bill and that it is a good Bill but I take Senator Norris&rsquo;s point that one can conceive of situations in which it might not be entirely just that people would escape payment of the moneys in question when they could well afford to pay.  Whenever legislation refers to parents it is especially significant.  My father told a story, which is less a Proustian flashback than a reflection on tougher times in Ireland, of a tenant farmer who boasted that he was raising a large family, putting money in the bank and paying off an old debt.  The old debt referred to having his parents living with him and he was putting money in the bank because his kids would one day take care of him and put a roof over his head.  Those days may be gone but the concept of granny flats or adjacent dwellings is known to us all and these dwellings vary greatly in standard and construction.  I support the amendment in general terms and do not doubt that the Minister will come forward with a provision to the effect that people who own the accommodation in which their parents live will not be liable for this levy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senators for their comments which highlight the differences between the Upper and Lower Houses because one does not often hear references to Proust or quotes from Yeats in the Lower House and it is quite refreshing.</P>
        <P>I thank Senators Coffey and Cummins for this amendment.  As I made clear yesterday I intend to exempt what are termed granny flats from the charge and have sought the advice of the Office of the Attorney General on suitable wording to achieve this.  One possible option is along the lines the Senators have proposed but the amendment may need to be fleshed out somewhat by the inclusion of a requirement that the property be made available free of rent.  I also want to explore with the Attorney General the possibility of some criteria in respect of a slightly more expansive definition of a qualifying relative and the inclusion of some proximity criteria of the kind to be found in the Revenue Commissioners&rsquo; provisions on home carer&rsquo;s tax credit.</P>
        <P>I propose to table an amendment which, with Senators&rsquo; agreement, I will table on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il and upon which I will report to this House in due course.  I hope this course of action is acceptable to the Senators.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>I acknowledge the effort the Minister is taking to try to address this anomaly.  Fine Gael supports this Bill in principle.  We will withdraw this amendment because the Minister has undertaken to address the issue of granny flats before the legislation finally goes through the Oireachtas.  I thank the Minister for listening to the concerns raised on all sides of the House.  It is important that we listen to the genuine and sincere concerns that we raise on behalf of people living in these situations.  We would not do this otherwise.</P>
        <P>I wish the Minister well because this is a complex area and it will be difficult to get the wording right but he has the best legal advice available.  We will wait and watch with interest as the amendment goes before the D&aacute;il and will welcome it back into this House.  I hope it will alleviate the problem and absolve people whose elderly dependent relatives live close to them of the charge.  This is a practice that the State and its agencies should encourage at every level.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 3: </P>
        <P LI="1">In page 4, after line 44, to insert the following:</P><Col N="698"/>
        <P LI="1">&ldquo;(<i>i</i>) an uninhabitable rural house.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This is an addition to the meaning of residential property in section 2.  In rural Ireland one often sees houses that have become vacant, whether cottages or old farm dwellings.  We would not like to see families being levied for this charge on a house that is uninhabitable.  If it is habitable there is the potential for it to generate income through letting or sub-letting.  The house may not be totally derelict because its superstructure, the roof and walls, might be in good condition but it might be uninhabitable because there may not be services and it might require a significant amount of work before becoming habitable again.</P>
        <P>Despite what Senator Norris says there are people in rural areas who may have small land-holdings but do not have large sums of money to spare to pay this charge on what might be an old farm cottage or dwelling.  That is the context of the amendment which we ask the Minister to consider.  I do not think it is the intention of the Bill to levy charges in those areas.  It is aimed at investment properties held by landlords up and down the country, mainly in urban but also in rural areas.  I am interested to hear the Minister&rsquo;s views on an uninhabitable rural house.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment.  Senator Coffey has made the case quite well.  Many dwellings are lying idle in rural Ireland where the landowner has either built a new house or has moved to a different dwelling on the farm.  Many of these houses are vacant and without services and the cost of upgrading or doing remedial work to make them habitable would be enormous.  This imposes a tax that is not in the spirit of the legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senators for this amendment.  We had some discussion about uninhabitable dwellings on Committee Stage yesterday.  In section 1 of the Bill &ldquo;dwelling&rdquo; is defined as including a building &ldquo;used, or suitable for use, by an individual as a separate dwelling&rdquo;.  Additionally in section 2 residential property is defined as &ldquo;a building situated in the State used, or suitable for use, as a dwelling&rdquo;.  The words &ldquo;suitable for use&rdquo; in these definitions are critical.  If a building is not suitable for use as a dwelling it follows that it must be uninhabitable, to use the word in the amendment.  I will reinforce this point in guidance I propose to issue to local authorities on carrying out this legislation.  It has always been my intention to issue these guidelines, even in respect of the matters we discussed previously.  It is clear the Bill as drafted provides that an owner of a residential property is not liable for a charge where the property in question is not suitable for use as a dwelling.  Similar terminology is used in several statutes, including stamp duty legislation.  In these circumstances I regret I cannot accede to the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept the Minister&rsquo;s explanation.  The amendment was an attempt by Fine Gael to acknowledge that uninhabitable rural houses would have some exemption from the charge.  We are willing, however, to accept in good faith the Minister&rsquo;s intention to issue guidelines, clarification and details, to local authorities that will collect the charges. </P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 5, line 10, to delete &ldquo;relevant local authority&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;Revenue Commissioners&rdquo;.</P><Col N="699"/>
        <P FLI="0">These amendments were tabled on Committee Stage and we had quite a debate on them.  The reason for the amendments being tabled is that Fine Gael is concerned local authorities may not have the capability and infrastructure available to them to properly collect all dues under the Bill.  We feel the Revenue Commissioners have the ability and capacity to capture all people who might be liable.  This is a genuine reason for tabling these amendments.</P>
        <P>Yesterday, I stated that I would favour the local authorities collecting the charge but I am concerned about the resources of and data held by the Private Residential Tenancies Board, PRTB, and other such agencies.  I am not sure the Bill is as clear or will function as easily as intended in the real world.  Issues are raised about data protection and I am not fully convinced at this stage they are fully cleared up.  The Bill allows for the transfer of data and registers from the ESB, the PRTB and the Revenue Commissioners to local authorities and I believe functional difficulties will arise in this area.  These amendments have been tabled to try to address this and to make the collection and administration easier and less burdensome on local authorities.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JerryButtimer"><NameTxt>Senator Jerry Buttimer</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGormley"><NameTxt>Deputy John Gormley</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senators for these amendments, which were discussed yesterday.  The Bill provides that income from the charge will accrue to local authorities.  This is a new form of local authority income and it is important it is administered effectively and efficiently.  I have full confidence that local authorities are well placed to administer and collect the charge and that they will assign sufficient staff and other resources necessary to implement it.  A considerable effort has been made by local authorities in preparation for the introduction of the charge and this work is ramping up all the time.</P>
        <P>Since the announcement of the charge in the budget a project board established by the County and City Managers&rsquo; Association has been working behind the scenes in planning and developing the necessary infrastructure to facilitate the charge.  The Local Government Computer Services Board has been engaged to design and develop an on-line portal similar to the very successful motor tax on-line system to enable the charge to be paid electronically.  This web-based system is at an advanced stage of development and I am assured it will be operational in time to accept payments from a liability date of 31 July next.</P>
        <P>Senators will be aware of the success of the motor tax on-line system where more than 50% of motor tax renewals are completed over the Internet.  The motor tax on-line system has proved to be a simple and effective way in which renewals of motor tax can be made and I see no reason it would not prove to be as effective in the case of the &euro;200 charge.  In addition to the on-line method of payment, the local authorities will also accept payment of the charge locally and this will facilitate persons who do not have access to the Internet.  Ample computer facilities are available in libraries throughout the country that can be utilised by persons who do not have personal computers for the payment of motor tax and the &euro;200 charge.</P>
        <P>It is clear local authorities have demonstrated their willingness to administer the charge effectively and efficiently given that the income from the charge will accrue to local authorities.  As I stated yesterday, I have no doubt they will ensure appropriate resources are put in place to secure the maximum level of compliance with the charge.  For these reasons I regret I cannot accept the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his explanation and I am happy to hear some groundwork has been done behind the scenes to plan for the administration of this in local authority structures.  This is a very important facet of the implementation of the legislation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I welcome the proposals for an on-line registration system.  The motor tax registration system is very laudable and successful.  It is very accessible for those who have computers, which a large percentage of the population does.  However, another large section of the population does <Col N="700"/>not have such access and is not computer literate.  I am sure they will have access to the local authority offices to make their payments.</P>
        <P>I will draw one difference between the motor tax system and this system, which is that the motor tax system is more easily enforced by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on the roads because garda&iacute; can see whether a car does not have a motor tax disc.  The issue we are raising is that responsibility for the charge is left to the individual owners of the second property.  To some degree it is a type of self-assessment.  The PRTB&rsquo;s database is not computerised and there is a large backlog but local authorities will be depending on that information.</P>
        <P>The Minister responded in detail to my concerns about the PRTB and how he intends to improve its workings.  It was identified that &euro;10 million is sitting in the bank account of the PRTB.  From my understanding of the Minister&rsquo;s explanation, local authorities need to carry out inspections prior to drawing down that money.  Obviously, a system is already in place between local authorities and the PRTB that is not functioning correctly and efficiently and needs attention and to be addressed.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">9 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>In the same light, we are depending on good co-operation between local authorities and these State agencies and boards to have proper data transfer and interchange.  To have the legislation functioning as intended, this will need to be fluent and easy.  Concerns have been raised about this but the Minister has assured Members he is taking measures and local government administrations, through their county managers and directors of services, are taking measures to ensure the implementation of this will run as smoothly as possible.  I still have concerns regarding the issue of data protection and perhaps the Minister will confirm the Department has consulted the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner on the measures in the Bill that affect the issue of data protection between various State agencies and companies.</P>

I also thank my staff who are present and everybody involved in bringing forward this legislation.  I thank Senators for their co-operation in facilitating early consideration of the Bill.  I look forward to reporting back to this House in due course.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaudieCoffey"><NameTxt>Senator Paudie Coffey</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister and his officials for the way they handled this Bill in the Seanad.  While I have been critical in part in regard to some of the shortcomings in the Bill, Fine Gael in principle supports its thrust and principles and we welcome the fact that it will create new revenue streams for local authorities.  They are at present starved of resources and any way we can assist them to become more autonomous and to raise funds will help the delivery of local authority services on the ground.  From that perspective, we welcome the Bill.</P>
        <P>Fine Gael is disappointed its nursing home-related amendment was not accepted.  We felt strongly about this, as was evident in the debate, where we identified that people in this category could be levied a charge.  However, the Minister has undertaken to deal with this before the Bill goes to the D&aacute;il.  We oppose the Bill for that reason because we feel it is incomplete <Col N="701"/>without the amendment.  We also have concerns with the issue of data protection that arises from the terms of the Bill.</P>
        <P>I wish the Minister well.  For a short Bill, it is a complex one and it will have a deep effect on communities and people throughout the country.  Hopefully, it will have a very positive effect for local authorities.  I wish the Minister well in drafting the amendments he has undertaken to draft following identification of those issues by Senators from all sides of the House.  I wish the Bill speedy passage for the remainder of its term in the Houses.  We look forward to it coming back to the Seanad with reports on amendments adopted in the D&aacute;il, which will complete the Bill and address the many issues of concern that Senators have raised in the House.</P>
        <P>The Seanad has performed extraordinarily well in recent days in regard to the Bill.  There has been deep engagement by Senators from all sides.  We have carried out our functions to the best of our ability in analysing and scrutinising the Bill so it will, when it gets to local authority implementation stage, have the best effect for those local authorities it is meant to serve.  I wish the Minister and the Bill well as it passes through the Oireachtas.</P>

I welcome the fact that the Minister accepted, at least in spirit, a number of the amendments that were proposed and argued strongly for in the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn"><NameTxt>Senator Camillus Glynn</NameTxt>
	<P>On behalf of the Government side of the House, I thank the Minister.  This is the first Bill in many years whereby a funding base has been provided for local authorities &mdash; it is an extra string to their bow.  Concerns were expressed by Members on the other side of the House, which I respect.  The response and assurances given by the Minister certainly addressed my concerns and I have no doubt about the sincerity of those assurances.</P>
        <P>The Bill is the first of a number of Bills that will give powers back to local authorities.  When we talk about locally elected members, we are talking about, first, the power to raise money and, second, the power to spend it.  Without that, one has no power.</P>
        <P>The Minister has done extremely well.  He came before the House and addressed the concerns, and I accept what he said.  He put down a marker in his address on Second Stage as to what he intends to do for the future in regard to local government.  My nominating body, the Association of Municipal Authorities of Ireland, is extremely grateful to the Minister.  He brought a number of issues to the House, not just the detail of the Bill and the effects it will have.  He has certainly given local government, particularly town local government, a shot in the arm.  Well done.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanBoyle"><NameTxt>Senator Dan Boyle</NameTxt>
	<P>In completing the Bill, we have undertaken a small but important step towards giving autonomy, independence and more effective use of spending to local government.  Hopefully, the recommendations of the Commission on Taxation and the decisions the Government will make through being informed on the White Paper on Local Government will help that process in the coming months.</P>
        <P>The House has played its important constitutional role in dealing with a Bill that constitutes a financial charge and, in doing so, helped to inform the definition of what the Bill constitutes.  This is a Bill about how we define what constitutes second-owned properties and many of the <Col N="702"/>contributions from all sides of the House have helped that process.  I am confident the Minister, in bringing this Bill through the other House, and subsequently back to this House, will have taken note and will make this Bill stronger as a result of all the contributions we have heard during all the Stages of the legislation.</P>

      <Speaker pid="KieranPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator Kieran Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House to take this Adjournment matter.  Last Friday my town of Rathdowney received the devastating news of the loss of 120 jobs at Meadow Meats.  The factory has served our town well for many years.  I recall in 1973 my late father was involved in a committee with the Golden Vale marts group to form a meat factory in Rathdowney and in 1974 this took place.  Some years later Guinness came in and took over the meat factory which continued to serve our town for many years.  Some years ago Dawn Meats came and took over from Guinness when it exited the meat factory business.  Last Friday, word came through that we would lose the boning section of the <Col N="703"/>factory.  After this takes place, some 80 killing jobs will remain in the factory but these are vulnerable because of the proposed new super killing line in Kilbeggan in the near future.  No funding has come through for the killing line in Meadow Meats in Rathdowney and it remains vulnerable.</P>
        <P>Arcon Mines, some four miles outside Rathdowney, closed in recent weeks with the loss of 200 jobs.  This and Meadow Meats were the two major employers in south County Laois, providing employment for the towns of Durrow, Ballacolla, Borris-in-Ossory and Rathdowney.  With the loss of these two companies there is no industry in the area.  I call on the Minister of State to form a task force to try to help to bring employment to the area, now classed as a blackspot.  There is now no industry in south County Laois, a huge rural area.</P>
        <P>I am not complaining about Meadow Meats which has served the farming business in the area well throughout the years and its staff has carried out trojan work to help the factory at all times.  I am saddened that some people who have worked there for up to 40 years will walk out next month with nowhere else to go.  I call on the Minister of State to relay to the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment the urgent need for a task force and any other necessary measures to help the local people and to try to bring employment back to the area.  I have no doubt the local community will do all in its power to help the relevant bodies to see whether labour can be secured for the area.  I look forward to hearing the reply of the Minister of State.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources </TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Conor Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Kieran Phelan for raising this matter on the Adjournment.  He is a good Senator who is very focused on his constituency and I have a certain sympathy for him in this case.  I am aware of the situation in Meadow Meats, a client of Enterprise Ireland.  I understand jobs are being transferred to Grannagh, County Waterford, as part of the company&rsquo;s rationalisation strategy to bring scale to its boning activities and I am conscious of the effect of the transfer of these jobs on the workers involved and their families as well as on the local community.</P>
        <P>I understand the company is rationalising its existing facilities to yield significant savings.  I understand the company submitted a business plan under the beef and sheepmeat fund which is under the aegis of the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.  The business plan was approved by Enterprise Ireland, the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the Government.  I understand this plan is being undertaken to increase capacity utilisation, cut costs, enhance scale and international competitiveness and is in line with the sectoral strategy for the Irish beef sector.</P>
        <P>I understand that as part of the company&rsquo;s rationalisation strategy, it is amalgamating the boning activities in Rathdowney with those at its site in Grannagh in County Waterford.  I understand 100 operative jobs will be transferred to Grannagh by the end of August 2009.  While 100 members of staff in the Rathdowney facility are being offered positions at the Grannagh facility, the remaining 100 people will be retained in slaughtering on the current site in County Laois.  With the implementation of this business plan, the company forecasts it will increase employment from approximately 1,400 to 1,500 people between 2009 and 2012 in the three plants.  Sales at the company are forecast to rise significantly and exports are also expected to increase significantly during same period.  The gross investment planned by the company in Ireland during this period is very significant.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In regard to Arcon Mines, I understand from my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, that the Galmoy mine is owned by Galmoy Mines Limited, formerly Arcon Mines Limited.  The mine operates under a number of State mining licences issued by the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources under the Minerals Development Act 1979.  These licences are due to expire in 2016.  The mine com<Col N="704"/>menced operations in 1997 and is coming to the end of its economic life.  The company announced in early 2008 that it would close the mine in April 2011 owing to exhaustion of reserves and had agreed the phasing of closure arrangements with the trade unions.  However, due to changes in economic circumstances and especially the substantial fall in zinc prices between 2008 and 2009, the Lundin Mining Corporation announced in January 2009 that it would cease mining operations on 29 May 2009.</P>
        <P>To ensure job creation and job retention, the Government, through the State development agencies and other interested parties, adopts a co-ordinated approach in dealing with the particular situation.  All the agencies work together in making people aware of the supports available to assist in finding new employment or to start their own businesses.  While there has been a decline in the multinational sector in County Laois in recent years, IDA Ireland is now marketing Portlaoise as a key location for investment in the globally traded services sector.  A significant investment has been made in a quality flagship business park in Portlaoise and this is now an integral part of the agency&rsquo;s international marketing programme.  In addition, the State development agency, Enterprise Ireland, which is responsible for the promotion of indigenous industry, continues to address enterprise development in County Laois.  Several of the agency&rsquo;s client companies in County Laois are actively developing their businesses.  The agency works intensively with companies, both individually and in sectoral groups, to help them exploit market opportunities and to promote innovation and enhance their international capabilities.</P>
        <P>The Laois County Enterprise Board continues to provide support for the micro-enterprise sector in the county.  This year, the county enterprise board will continue to be actively involved in the economic development of County Laois.  The county enterprise board will ensure available funds are targeted to maximise entrepreneurial development throughout the locality.  The strategies and policies being pursued by the State development agencies in County Laois will continue to support enterprise development and job creation in the area.  I reaffirm that the State agencies will continue to work closely with each other and with local interests to assist in maintaining an integrated approach to investment and enterprise development.  If further initiatives are needed over and above the work of the enterprise development agencies and local interests, the county enterprise board is in a position to assist.  I thank Senator Phelan for this timely intervention on behalf of his constituents.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KieranPhelan"><NameTxt>Senator Kieran Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his reply.  However, I appeal to him to call on the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Coughlan, to get the State agencies involved.  I realise he referred to IDA Ireland, which is in Portlaoise.  However, my town of Rathdowney is 25 miles from Portlaoise and I am keen for Enterprise Ireland and such companies to be contacted directly.  Our local community is prepared to become actively involved, with some assistance, to determine whether it is possible to bring in someone else to replace these very important businesses.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RonanMullen"><NameTxt>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it.  The issue I raise is of great sensitivity.  It is an issue many politicians and others would prefer not to receive in their in-tray because of the seriousness of the allegations involved in the case, the passage of time and the fact there are several interconnected issues.  There is the question of whether a crime took place which should have been investigated and which would have led to a prosecution.  There is also the question of the custody of a child, the fitness of particular persons to have custody of that child, the conduct of the courts and the role of the State in entrusting a child to the <Col N="705"/>custody of a person whom she alleges abused her.  There is also the question of the role of the legal team or teams who acted for that child and who were her protector and questions about how they discharged their duties.  These are the matters which arise in this case.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is not my place or role nor do I purport to make any definitive judgment on the various allegations made by members of the Bland family in this forum.  However, I have met Ms Sarah Bland and her mother and the allegations they have made have been raised in the Northern Ireland Assembly and have been made a matter of public record elsewhere.  I believe the allegation that Ms Bland was abused and that such abuse was caused or perpetuated by the failure of legal representatives and-or agents of this State and their claims that there ought to have been prosecutions on foot of the allegations made and, consequently, they are owed apologies and compensation by the State and others are all matters that call for investigation by a proper authority.</P>
        <P>This case has been debated on two occasions by the Northern Assembly.  It was alleged in the <i>Belfast Telegraph</i> that, at first, the members of the Bland family in question had great difficulty in getting Government officials in this jurisdiction to agree to a meeting and that, on foot of the matter being raised in the Northern Ireland Assembly by a number of very prominent Northern politicians, a meeting took place at which I believe the Secretary General of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Mr. Se&aacute;n Aylward, was due to be present.</P>
        <P>Arising out of these matters with which I am trying to deal in a manner that is fair and sensitive and given that this matter has been raised with me by Ms Sarah Bland, her mother, Ms Trish Bland, and by a senior member of the Northern Assembly, I would be grateful for answers on the following issues.  Given that a meeting took place, what was the outcome of that meeting and what is the view of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform of the Bland case?  Does the Department propose the establishment of any kind of inquiry into the various allegations to establish whether the State failed in its obligations?  Does it believe all necessary steps have been taken to establish whether criminal offences have been committed?</P>
        <P>The reason this issue was raised in the context of the Ryan report is because that report documented in very stark and revealing terms the extensive failure of, among others, the State to take the steps necessary to ensure children being entrusted to third parties or to the care of third parties were not abused by them.  There is a need for victims of abuse to be believed.  This is a key issue for people who have been abused and it is certainly the view of Ms Sarah Bland that their case has not been properly considered&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>As the Senator will be aware, the Ryan report dealt with the dreadful abuse which took place in residential institutions, so its direct relevance to the case referred to by the Senator is not immediately apparent.  In any event, the persons referred to by the Senator have, over a number of years, made a series of wide-ranging allegations against the courts, State agencies and professional and other persons.</P>
        <P>One set of allegations alleges that one of the persons was the victim of sexual abuse by a family member.  The persons are dissatisfied with the decision of the Director of Public Prosecutions not to prosecute that family member in connection with this alleged sexual abuse and <Col N="706"/>with the investigation of the complaints by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The other set of allegations concerns the dissolution of the marriage of one of the persons and the disposal of the family property.  They have drawn up what is described as a statement of claim against the State for an eight-figure sum and a demand for other actions by the State.  The most serious allegation, which is of sexual abuse, was the subject of exhaustive investigation by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  When the investigation file was complete, it was referred to the Director of Public Prosecutions who decided that a prosecution should not be entered.  Following a number of subsequent reviews of the case in light of additional material submitted by the persons, the DPP reaffirmed his original decision each time.  The Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions has informed the persons referred to that none of the material submitted by them was such as warranted a prosecution in relation to the original complaint of sexual offences or otherwise.</P>
        <P>As the Senator will be aware, the role of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is to investigate complaints which are made to it alleging an offence has been committed, to gather whatever evidence may be available and to submit a report to the DPP.  The question of whether a particular person should be prosecuted and for what criminal offence is, as a matter of law, the sole responsibility of the DPP who is independent in the performance of his functions and makes his decision on the basis of the Garda findings viewed against the background of common and-or statute law.</P>
        <P>The disposal of the family&rsquo;s property following the break-up of the marriage was the subject of litigation in the courts, as were certain family law matters which are heard <i>in camera</i>.  The Senator will also be aware the courts are subject only to the Constitution and the law and are independent in the exercise of their judicial functions, and the conduct of any court case is a matter entirely for the presiding judge.</P>
        <P>On 30 June 2008, the Secretary General of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform met the persons referred to. They were accompanied by a number of people from the DUP, Sinn F&eacute;in, the UUP and others.  The Secretary General undertook to consider the points made at the meeting and review the documentation in the case, although he emphasised he did not wish to raise expectations.  Following a review of the documentation, which included consulting the relevant agencies where appropriate, he subsequently wrote in October 2008 to one of the persons referred to, informing her of the outcome of the review, with copies of the letter sent to the members of the DUP, Sinn F&eacute;in and the UUP who had attended the meeting.  In his letter, the Secretary General said that following the process outlined, the position remained there was nothing in the documentation available or the points made orally that would enable or warrant a reconsideration of decisions made in the case over the years by agencies of the criminal justice system.  In particular, there were no grounds to doubt that the courts made their judgments on the basis of the evidence put before them and in accordance with the law.</P>
        <P>I appreciate this was not the response the persons referred to had hoped for.  However, the conclusion was reached only after a very careful consideration of all the facts available.  It follows from this response that there are no grounds on which compensation should be paid from public funds and there is no action required on the part of the State to take this matter further.</P>

    <Title>Garda Vetting Procedures. </Title>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>This matter relates to the Garda vetting application form.  This is a procedure applied by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in respect of a number of applications for F&Aacute;S programmes or from individuals who are involved in sports or youth clubs or charities.  It is a form which is provided to individuals who must complete it and bring it to the Garda station where it is completed and stamped by a garda.  The provisions of the Children Act 2001 provide in section 258 that where an offence is committed by a person who is under 18 years of age and where that person has a clean record following a three-year period, he or she shall be <Col N="707"/>treated for all purposes in law as a person who has not committed or been charged with or prosecuted or found guilty of or dealt with for that offence.  It also provides that information which may be required in any circumstances relating to that person&rsquo;s previous findings of guilt, offences, conduct or circumstances does not have to be revealed.</P>
        <P>A young person who may have been in trouble with the law previously is applying for a F&Aacute;S course, for example.  These are operated by many organisations and the one closest to home in my case is Monkstown community centre.  Young individuals who get into trouble with the law but are moving on and are being assisted by the State institutions and community groups in that regard are presented with this form.  They dutifully fill it out and record their offences if they exist, not knowing that section 258 of the Children Act 2001 does not require them to do so.  This can lead to problems.</P>
        <P>With regard to the Garda vetting form, the provisions of section 258 are identified in the form that where a person commits an offence while a child, that information does not have to be disclosed.  This is the essence of the matter I have raised.  It is an important point.  The mere act of being asked to fill out this form without informing the applicant of his or her rights under section 258 is an infringement in itself.  It is important that the form discloses the provisions of section 258 and that it is not necessary to provide that information.  A young person filling out such a form &mdash; they are required to do so by the Garda &mdash; would not know that he or she did not have to disclose that information.  It is to assist young people who may have got in trouble with the law in the past but are trying to improve their lives that this would be reflected in that procedure and the Garda vetting application form.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Conor Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>On behalf of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, I thank Senator Regan for raising this matter.  I assure the Senator that the provisions of section 258 of the Children Act 2001 are taken fully into account by the Garda authorities in the vetting process as a matter of routine.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Section 258 of the Children Act 2001 provides for the non-disclosure of certain findings of guilt in respect of a person if the offence in question was committed before the person attained the age of 18 years; the offence is not one required to be tried by the Central Criminal Court; a period of not less than three years has elapsed since the finding of guilt; and the person has not been dealt with for an offence in that three-year period.  Where all these conditions apply, a person shall be treated for all purposes in law as a person who has not committed or been charged with or prosecuted for or found guilty of or dealt with for that offence.  This includes where, as part of the criminal history vetting process prior to working with children and vulnerable adults, the person is requested to provide details of his or her criminal record on a vetting application form to be processed by the Garda central vetting unit, GCVU, as well as to any subsequent disclosure by the GCVU.</P>
        <P>The GCVU works very closely with a large number of organisations which are registered for the purposes of providing criminal history vetting related to employment.  As part of the engagement with the registered organisations, the GCVU provides targeted training and ongoing information and support to the organisations concerned on the wide range of matters related to the vetting process.  This training specifically covers the provisions of section 258 of the Children Act 2001 and includes disregarding any information that might be provided to which section 258 applies.  This allows the authorised signatory for each organisation to deal with each individual applicant in an informed way on these important vetting issues.</P>
        <P>It should be recalled that the primary onus in terms of the employment of any individual person rests with the employer who must take into account the range of factors relevant to an applicant, including any information that may be provided in the vetting process.</P>
        <P>Criminal history vetting, as I have indicated, is carried out by the GCVU for registered organisations in respect of persons who may be employed or engaged in circumstances where <Col N="708"/>they would have substantial unsupervised access to children or vulnerable adults.  This targeted vetting service has been successfully expanded on a phased basis in recent years to the point where the 78 staff members of the vetting unit processed in excess of 218,000 vetting applications last year and the turn-around time for processing has been reduced to an average of four to five weeks.  This is a remarkable achievement and the garda&iacute; are to be commended on it.</P>
        <P>The Garda authorities, in conjunction with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and in consultation with many other stakeholders through the implementation group on Garda vetting, keep vetting processes and procedures under constant review to ensure that best practice is applied.  The implementation group also allows for important interaction with the registered organisations in ensuring that the vetting process meets their needs as well as enhancing the safety of children and vulnerable adults.</P>
        <P>This review process includes the content of the Garda vetting form which is being updated and redesigned.  That process has taken fully into account the Children Act provisions which have been referred to and this will be reflected explicitly in the final version of the form.  It will also seek to include any elements that may be necessary arising from the vetting legislation currently being prepared by the Department of Health and Children.</P>
        <P>I thank the Senator for raising this point about the form.  If he has encountered detail in regard to this I suggest he communicate directly with the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, to ensure that if there is a glitch or an inadvertent problem in the area it can be resolved.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate the Minister&rsquo;s response.  I appreciate also that it is the responsibility of employers to ensure that whatever vetting is done the individual meets the requirements, but the reality &mdash; this is my net point &mdash; is that the form is open in terms of what one must put down as to one&rsquo;s history, whether any offences were committed etc.  It is important in the case of young people that if the offence was committed prior to 18 years of age, and there has been no other history of that nature, it should be expressly stated on the form that it is not necessary to include that.  That would reflect the provisions of section 258.  </P>
        <P>My raising this matter on the Adjournment in no way takes from the importance of this exercise.  The Minister highlighted the number of vetting applications, which is a chore for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I do not want to take away from that in any sense but I believe it would aid the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and any employer were section 258 of the Children Act to be expressly referred to in the application form, stating that if the offence was committed when the person was a junior, it does not have to be disclosed on the form.  That is the net point I want to make.  I appreciate the Minister&rsquo;s comprehensive response.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Conor Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senator for that.  It is important he makes that specific point directly to the Minister.  I will convey directly to the Minister that some reference be included on the form to acknowledge that.  I appreciate the point the Senator is making in that regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EugeneRegan"><NameTxt>Senator Eugene Regan</NameTxt>
	<P>I will follow up on that.</P>
      </Speaker>
