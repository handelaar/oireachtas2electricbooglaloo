	<P>I have received notice from Senator Finucane that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to outline when an application for a sewage treatment plant was first received by his Department for Dromcollogher, County Limerick, and the current status of this application; when he anticipates works will commence and when it is likely they will be finalised.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Morrissey of the following matter:</P>
      <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Transport to make a statement on the ongoing controversy relating to the completion of the port tunnel concerning the extensive water leaks.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Feighan of the following matter:</P>
      <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Health and Children to outline the reason Roscommon psychiatric foster care services are not receiving the necessary funding and support to continue this valued community-based service.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

	<P>The Order of Business is No. 1, statements on security of energy supply and the scope for developing renewable energy sources, to be taken on the conclusion of the Order of Business and to conclude not later than 2 p.m., with the contributions of spokesperson not to exceed 15 minutes and those of other Senators not to exceed ten minutes. The Minister will be called on to reply not later than ten minutes before the conclusion of statements; and No. 2, the University College Galway (Amendment) <Col N="1354"/>Bill 2005 &mdash; Report and Final Stages, to be taken at 2 p.m. and to conclude not later than 2.30 p.m. This is a Seanad Bill, which was amended by the D&aacute;il.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">A year ago yesterday the Supreme Court clarified the issue of nursing home charges, when it concluded that medical card holders were being charged illegally in public nursing homes. In May 2005, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children announced in the House that legislation would be introduced to effect payments to approximately 20,000 elderly people who were still alive. When will this legislation be introduced?</P>
      <P>The Minister also announced on that occasion that a private firm would be engaged to make the payments and it was stated last week that this could cost between &euro;30 million and &euro;50 million. This would be a terrible waste of funding. The Health Service Executive employs more than 150,000 people. The staff of public nursing homes are going through their records to verify the details of people who are eligible for this payment. It would be shocking if a private company was paid between &euro;30 million and &euro;50 million to make these payments. A total of 20,000 elderly people will receive the payment but they have also received an <i>ex gratia</i> payment of &euro;2,000 from the HSE at a cost of &euro;22 million. There is no necessity to involve a private company in these payments. Last December almost &euro;1 billion was paid to 116,000 farmers by the Department of Agriculture and Food under the single payment scheme. There is a tendency to look to external consultants but such usage of taxpayers&rsquo; money is totally unnecessary in these circumstances. This legislation has been promised for some time but, after a year, not a euro has been paid to the 20,000 people involved or the beneficiaries of their estates. When will this matter be resolved?</P>
      <P>Senator Minihan spoke recently about the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s achievements in the Department of Health and Children. I ask the Senator to consider the situation in accident and emergency departments on Tuesday, St. Valentine&rsquo;s Day. In Cork University Hospital, for example, 37 people were waiting on trolleys and there were 75 in a similar position in Tallaght Hospital. Senator Minihan noted the view expressed by one person that the accident and emergency facility in Tallaght should be named the &ldquo;Mary Harney suite&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>It is time for action. There is no necessity to spend the type of money envisaged to engage a private company to manage the repayment process. The resources are within the HSE to do so and all the research is being done internally. All it needs is a number of staff to collate the information within the service. God help us if such a group of persons cannot be found within a staff of some 150,000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I draw the Leader&rsquo;s attention to an issue I regret is once again missing from the Order of Business, namely, the proposed terms of reference for the Committee of Selection of the Seanad to inquire into the passage of CIA aeroplanes through Shannon Airport. I raised this issue at the end of November 2005 and on 6 December the Leader gave what seemed to be a clear commitment that the committee would be established. She had received advice from the Clerk and we were to have meetings to consider its terms of reference. We have had some such meetings but others have recently been cancelled at short notice.</P>
      <P>I addressed my growing concerns in this regard to a number of Government sources yesterday and I now understand this committee is dead in the water. This is regrettable and I ask the Leader to explain, if it is true, why this is the case. Where did the pressure come from to prevent the establishment of such an inquiry? I hear the Government had some part in the decision, as well as local councillors from the Shannon area. It seems extraordinary that the Seanad should be run by local authorities rather than deciding its own business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterCallanan"><NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is democracy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not democracy. It may be other Members&rsquo; understanding of democracy but it is not mine and I doubt it is that of the public.</P>
      <P>Today we have another report from the United Nations committee which recommends that the Guantanamo Bay detention centre should be closed immediately. It will be dreadful if we allow ourselves to be compromised in this regard. It seems we have once more given into pressure. The Leader has been forthright on the issue of the Iraq war and gave a clear commitment in regard to this inquiry. We are entitled to know why it has been shut down, especially in view of the performance of this grey little Government that seems so intimidated by the United States authorities and even by councillors from the Shannon area.</P>
      <P>The Government is clearly making a mistake in taking this action. The cat is already out of the bag given the establishment of a committee of the Council of Europe to consider the matter and the initiation of several court cases in Europe. This secret will out and the Government&rsquo;s action seems very much like evidence of a guilty conscience. It is worried about something. Why should it be concerned about such an inquiry? The terms of reference were simply to establish facts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid=""><NameTxt>A Senator</NameTxt>
	<P>Nonsense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">It is not nonsense. Let us have a debate on this matter. Senator Dooley is nodding in agreement. Perhaps more Members from the Government parties will also agree. I thank <Col N="1356"/>Senator Dooley for his implied suggestion and formally propose an amendment to the Order of Business to allow us discuss the establishment of this inquiry and its proposed terms of reference, which have already been agreed. We received legal advice on the matter and know how to proceed and Members have been selected for participation. Let us have a debate on this today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not a motion. Senator Norris has made a speech.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>In regard to the issue raised by Senator Finucane, there are not many Ministers whose Bills have been deemed unconstitutional. I understand the only Minister in this Government for whom this is the case is the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney. In introducing the legislation to retrospectively legalise illegal nursing home charges, she attempted to deprive elderly people of their rightful compensation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>That is incorrect. The reverse is the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>This wrong came on top of a wrong that had gone on for many years. The continuing delays over this issue further compound the wrong done by the Government in regard to the rights of elderly people.</P>
      <P>An article in today&rsquo;s edition of <i>The Irish Times</i> discusses the existence of an interdepartmental report which apparently proposes that elderly people should be obliged to sell or remortgage their homes to help fund their long-term care. The issue of care for the elderly is something Members increasingly encounter in their clinics. A recent poll published by the same newspaper indicates most people do not agree with the approach outlined in the report to which I referred.</P>
      <P>Elderly people have paid their taxes and contributed to society. Many of them paid the very high taxes in place in the 1980s. We must be more proactive in providing care options for elderly people, including public nursing homes and sheltered homes, as opposed to obliging them to sell their homes to pay for exorbitant private profit-making care. We must entirely reform the current approach to long-term care.</P>
      <P>There have been reports recently on the alleged discovery of cocaine in the vicinity of Leinster House. This is a serious matter that should be investigated. It should not, however, draw the focus from the need to do more about the issue of drugs within communities. Cocaine is an increasing element of the drugs culture. One of the main reasons for Mr. Fergus McCabe&rsquo;s recent resignation from the national drugs strategy team is the move away from the focus on community involvement in drugs strategy. We must regain that focus which has been successful in the past. It was established in 1996 by my party <Col N="1357"/>leader, Deputy Rabbitte, when he was the relevant Minister of State. I do not understand why the Government is moving away from that approach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a gross untruth to suggest that the T&aacute;naiste, any member of the Government or any Member on either side of this House does not want to do the very best for the elderly and to ensure their needs are met. It is worth recording that the genesis of the Bill regarding nursing home charges came after successive Administrations ignored the explicit advice they received on this matter. It was the T&aacute;naiste who finally acted on it and she did so in good faith by bringing forward legislation which, as is her right, the President referred to the courts. Such a referral has taken place in almost every year I can recall. The legislation is sometimes upheld and on other occasions is rejected, as in this case.</P>
      <P>I understand the new legislation is expected to come before the Oireachtas before the summer and we will deal with it then. Some of the comments made today must be rebutted and debated. As the Cathaoirleach is about to tell me, however, the Order of Business is not the time to deal with those matters in detail. I stress, however, that some of the remarks made are untrue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I formally second the proposal by Senator Norris that we set time aside to debate the position regarding the proposed Committee of Selection to discuss the Shannon situation. This issue was discussed on several occasions in this House before Christmas and it was indicated to us that the appropriate way forward would be to set up such a committee. A number of Senators appointed on an all-party basis have made great progress and were on the point of bringing forward a balanced and fair motion for debate and consideration.</P>
      <P Just="Left">As the Cathaoirleach will be aware, the purpose of this proposed committee was to inquire into the goings-on, for use of a better term, at Shannon Airport and those issues into which the Government is obliged to inquire in order that it can report to the Council of Europe. The war in Iraq and issues surrounding it have been debated here on numerous occasions. There is a central issue from which we cannot move away, namely, that the truth must emerge. The issue of concern to the proposed Seanad committee is to establish exactly what is or is not happening. The best way forward for this House to establish the facts is to set up the proposed committee.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Consideration of this issue was fair and balanced and we are all pleased with the proposed terms of reference. It would be regrettable if we were to renege on a commitment the Leader of the House, I and other Members gave to this House to put in place such a committee. We should reflect on and debate it. It is in every<Col N="1358"/>body&rsquo;s interest that we set up such a committee. I second the motion that we debate the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>We should commend the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children on her speedy action in regard to the refund of payments taken by her and the Government. This matter was ignored by former Ministers, Deputies Howlin, Noonan and others, throughout the years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator should not forget the former Minister, Deputy Martin, if he wants to be consistent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>He knew about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Leyden to continue without interruption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">It would be worthwhile to request the T&aacute;naiste to come into the House for a debate on the current position. Such a debate should take place in-house within the Health Service Executive because the practice of the yearly assessment of medical cards is unnecessary. Every year people&rsquo;s eligibility for these cards is reassessed. Why could the staff engaged in that work not be reassigned to implement the Government&rsquo;s decision to refund nursing home residents? It is not rocket science. There is a question of confidentiality involved. This work should not be given to a private sector company, rather it should and could be done in-house. It would be worthwhile to introduce a bonus scheme in this respect.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, will the Leader arrange for an early debate on the announcement by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, in regard to SSIAs? His announcement of the introduction of a pension scheme to provide for those who pay the lowest level of income tax is worthwhile. We should promote that scheme. Hundreds of thousands of young people have no private pension scheme. The introduction of this scheme presents a great opportunity. Furthermore, for those who would wish to retain their SSIAs, a roll-over facility should be provided to enable them to reinvest&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator can discuss that in the debate he has requested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>In advance of such a debate I want to whet the Cathoirleach&rsquo;s appetite in regard to the potential of this scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">There is a possibility for an infrastructural investment scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I call Senator Quinn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Leyden is working up his own appetite.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Our time is being wasted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I am delighted to get that off my chest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I add my voice to that of Senators Norris and Bradford. It is seldom we arrange to set up a selection committee in this House. It would be disappointing if that proposal simply disappeared and failed to appear on the Order Paper. The proposal is that the selection committee should appear on the Order Paper. It has not done so, therefore I support the amendment proposed by Senators Norris and Bradford.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader consider asking the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to come into this House to debate a prison-related issue? It is approximately six months since he was in the House dealing with the Prisons Bill. On that occasion he spent considerable time here and explained how he was proceeding. The main objective of that legislation was to outsource the transporting of prisoners. That is a valid and sensible idea.</P>
      <P>However, some figures published in Britain yesterday &mdash; a similar position is confirmed by the figures in Ireland &mdash; suggest that two out of every three young prisoners reoffend and find themselves back in prison and one out of every two adult male prisoners in Britain also reoffend and end up back in prison. The figures in Ireland are somewhat similar.</P>
      <P>With the exception of the two open prisons, prisoners are inactive for 16 to 17 hours per day. This leads to the development of the position I outlined in Britain characterised by the figures published yesterday. The Minister should come into the House and inform us about what he is doing in this regard and what progress is being made. He was very good when he was here six months ago. I would like to know what is happening in our prisons because this issue challenges us. If two out of every three pupils in a school failed to learn how to read and write and if one out of every two patients in a hospital died, there would be an outcry, but that is what is happening in our prisons. We need a debate on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMinihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Minihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I would welcome a debate on nursing home charges for one reason, namely, to clarify the position and to rebut some of the wild allegations made by the Opposition this morning and in recent days. Compensation should be paid to people who are entitled to it. There is no question about that, as the Government has acknowledged.</P><Col N="1360"/>
      <P>However, the State should equally defend cases seeking additional damages. Fine Gael is supporting a compensation culture. To lead its attack in this regard, it is putting forward a person who has a vested interest in this area, namely, a solicitor and Fine Gael councillor who placed advertisements in newspapers within 24 hours seeking cases and who has filed 70 cases in the High Court seeking up to &euro;6 billion. I make no apology for defending the T&aacute;naiste&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator should read the article in today&rsquo;s edition of the <i>Irish Examiner</i>.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMinihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Minihan</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;the Government and taxpayers. If Fine Gael wants to peddle a &ldquo;compo&rdquo; culture, let it do so, but it is peddling somebody with a vested interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>That is rubbish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMinihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Minihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I make no apology for saying that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator should read one of today&rsquo;s newspapers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Leader speak with the Minister for Transport, as a matter of urgency, regarding his proposal to contract out the appointment of a group of testers to expedite the backlog of driving test applications? I recently met a delegation of people from the west who are involved in testing. They have grave concerns about the Minister contracting out such appointments to people who have no previous experience of testing.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>If we are serious about seeking to ensure a decline in the number of road deaths, it is important we bring under the umbrella of the existing framework provisions regarding the training of driving testers. An additional eight personnel have been secured from the Department of Agriculture and Food. There is a strong feeling among people within this system that the way forward is to continue that process, as opposed to prolonging the delay through the advertising of posts and issuing of contracts to people whom we do not know have the necessary qualifications and who will be gone when the backlog of applications has been cleared. This is a serious matter. If we are serious about road safety and reducing the carnage on our roads, we should not tamper with the existing position but increase the number of personnel from internal sources.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I know Senator Norris&rsquo;s question is directed at the Leader and I am sure she will reply. I am spokesperson on foreign affairs and have a particular interest in this area. Ongoing investigations into rendition are being led by Senator Dick Marty who is a colleague of Senators Bradford, Ormonde and mine on the Council of Europe. The European Parliament has <Col N="1361"/>also embarked on an investigation. The Government is co-operating with both investigations.</P>
      <P>When this issue first arose, the Government, through the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, asked the American Administration about the possible illegal transportation of persons through Shannon Airport. The answer that was specific to Ireland initially&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Let both sides have their say. Given that there is such heat on the issue, it should be allowed to go forward for discussion.</P>
      <P>Following the points raised here this morning about the nursing home issue, we need a debate on it. I do not know where we are going on this matter. On numerous occasions I have asked that this not be turned into a political football. Every party has been involved in this at some stage, including Independents. We all have dirt on our hands on this one.</P>
      <P>As far as where we are now is concerned, I am appalled at some of the stuff I am hearing here this morning. I do not understand what Senator Finucane stated. First, there are many more than 20,000 people concerned; it is more like 70,000. Second, perhaps Senator Finucane can explain the idea and we should discuss it. If the policy is that we pay exemplary and other damages and that we ask civil servants to pay out this money without it being challenged, the idea is an absolute abuse&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>I never said any such thing.</P>
    </Speaker>

	<P>I am sorry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>

	<P>That is why we should have a debate.</P>

    </Speaker><Col N="1364"/>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I cannot understand how the Health Service Executive can itself handle the paying out of exemplary and other damages. First, it just cannot be done. Second,&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>I never said that at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">In terms of taxpayers&rsquo; money, I would be absolutely opposed to the idea of us paying exemplary and other damages at this stage. It is the duty of the Government to look after taxpayers&rsquo; money. We should pay and look after the people who are entitled to be looked after. It is appalling that they have not got their money yet. In terms of how it is done, however, we should not be handing out exemplary and other damages, and it is not a job for civil servants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>One of the issues that we have discussed most often here in this House is health. There are times I feel that perhaps we should also endeavour to strike a balance. In recent times I have been dealing with several families who have had to avail of hospital services and invariably they have been high in their praise of the service which they have received. We need to say that, if for no other reason than out of appreciation for the practitioners who are working in the health area.</P>
      <P>The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, demonstrated extraordinary courage and commitment in taking on the health portfolio. We should be seen to be helping her. No doubt there are certain functions that need to be improved and that will always be true in any expanding service in the country. We are not being fair if we expect miracles to be achieved by Deputy Harney in a short period of time. What we really need here is a partnership between all the practitioners, be they the consultants, doctors, nurses or whoever. It is important that we in this House show a united front because at the end of the day the most important person is the patient in the hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Leader is well disposed towards having a debate on the proposed sale of the Great Southern Hotels group. In view of the misconceptions and the spin evident, particularly on accumulated losses, when quite clearly at least &euro;24 million of it is investment in Killarney and Galway, I am naturally particularly concerned about those flagships &mdash; Parknasilla which is a real jewel in the crown and Eyre Square. The debate, if and when the Leader can arrange it, will be timely.</P>
      <P>Second, I am glad to see published this morning the long-promised Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Bill. It is great that it is coming to this House. It will be interesting to see <Col N="1365"/>the definitions in the seventh column, or how it is covered, as to what&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn"><NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the remarks made here by Senator Minihan and others on the role played by the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney. As Government spokesperson on health and children, I think she has shown clearly that what had been happening was incorrect. She put up her hand and said it is wrong. She brought in legislation and it fell.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>Now she is trying to legalise it.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>We cannot debate the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn"><NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
	<P>If I may, a Chathaoirligh, there is a category of people who could not get a bed in public nursing home, whether geriatric, psychiatric or whatever, and who had to pay in a private nursing home. While such people have a case, I decry the ambulance chasing of some politicians and some solicitors.</P>
      <P>I welcome the decision to have garda&iacute; travel with young people who are under age to discos. They will be in a position to detect any disorderly behaviour as a result of under age drinking. I hope they will relate information back to the parents and, if necessary, source the supply of alcohol. I am sure there will be many such cases.</P>

	<P>Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; referred to the great courage of the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children in taking on the health portfolio a year and a half ago.

	<P>Senator Bannon has lost his way again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like the Leader to invite the Ministers for Arts, Sport and Tourism and Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs to the House for a debate on rural development and tourism. Policies need to be introduced to improve economic and social conditions in small villages and towns which lack tourism infrastructure.</P>
      <P>The provision of funding and grant aid for off-farm enterprises has been neglected. I know several people who have put forward good projects for the development of rural tourism and off-farm enterprises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>Are these the people to whom the Senator has already referred?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>No grant assistance is available despite promises by the Government to provide funding. There is nothing there for people who seek funding for off-farm enterprises.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole raised the important question of rendition flights. I see no problem in holding such a discussion, and nobody else does but there is a difference between discussing it and establishing a select committee. Committees have been set up throughout Europe to deal with this matter. What other information could be gleaned by establishing a committee of <Col N="1367"/>this House? Establishing such a committee would insult a friendly nation at a time when we depend on our diplomats to work with the US Administration in respect of the undocumented Irish people in the United States.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a criminal regime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>It would send out the wrong signal. A committee would involve more than a discussion. Already committees throughout Europe are garnering that information. It would be a token gesture to establish a committee here that would be seen as an insult to a friendly nation with which we have had a long relationship, when we depend on that administration to assist us with the Kennedy-McCain Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>We would be insulting torturers. Does the Senator not think they should be insulted and investigated?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator should give Senator Dooley a chance to speak instead of trying to shout him down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>A charge was made here about democracy and the role of local councillors from County Clare and the Shannon region. It would be wrong to suggest that elected representatives from any county would not have a right to make their point. That would be the opposite of democracy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>It is the Senator&rsquo;s electorate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>That would be a totalitarian approach which I would not accept. As long as I am elected to this House I am prepared to listen to anybody from any quarter who has a role in electing me. It will be a sad day for democracy if somebody in this House suggests that his or her view is paramount.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Mr. Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>On several occasions Senators have mentioned mobile phone charges. I welcome the all-Ireland standard charges made by a mobile phone company. It is a step in the right direction. Not all companies, however, have introduced standard charges. One company has gone so far as to erect a sign in Dundalk bearing the message &ldquo;welcome to Ireland&rdquo;. A strong attitude change may be needed there.</P>
      <P>I agree with those Senators who do not wish to form a select committee on the rendition flights. The United States is a friendly nation. Contrary to what an Opposition Senator has said, it is not a criminal regime. It may not be the regime he wants to see elected but it is not criminal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a regime that consistently breaks international laws, therefore it is criminal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Finucane the acting leader of the Fine Gael group raised the issue of nursing home charges. We have made a telephone call to the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s office. The legislation is being drafted and will be published before the summer. That is the situation so there is no point saying it is not coming. It is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>

	<P>I wanted to say that because people will continue to say it is not coming but in fact it is.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The Senator also raised the larger issue that the computation of those owed money should be done in-house, in the Health Service Executive, so to speak. Senator O&rsquo;Toole, however, correctly raised the issue of a strong move, involving I understand 90 cases submitted by one solicitor &mdash; I will not mention any political lineage &mdash; regarding exemplary charges. Civil servants could not decide on exemplary charges. I would be totally against such charges. People are due the money that is owed to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>On a point of order, I never suggested that. Somebody else introduced that point.</P>

	<P>The Leader misinterpreted me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Exactly. This point raises another grave issue which I do not impute to Senator Finucane. He mentioned nursing home charges. The other grave issue is &ldquo;ambulance chasing&rdquo; which is completely incorrect. The T&aacute;naiste said that people owed money will receive their money but the Government refutes exemplary charges. To ask civil servants to engage in a forensic examination of that type&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I appeal to Senators to respect the decorum of the Seanad. It is most important to respect ourselves and this House of Parliament. I invite the Leader to reply without interruptions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Norris raised the matter of the establishment of a select committee. I wish to be perfectly accurate about this matter. It was raised here on the Order of Business before Christmas. I said it would be a good idea to look at the matter and asked the leaders of the groups to meet me in the ante-room which they did. Senators Bradford, Norris, Ryan &mdash; whom I could not contact this week, not that I looked to contact him but I was looking out for him &mdash; Minihan and myself met and consulted with one of the clerks to the Seanad. We read our comhr&uacute;n to find out how to set about setting up a committee.</P>
      <P>There would be no committee until it would appear on the yellow Order Paper and be voted in or out. In fact, there is no committee. There is a procedure for dealing with that eventuality, namely, a proposal to set up a committee is put on the Order Paper, which the House reviews and on which it decides in the affirmative or negative.</P>
      <P>Those running around saying a committee has been set up should be aware there is no committee. There was an informal grouping of leaders of groups, which met several times. Christmas intervened after which we met again and worked with the Parliamentary Counsel to draw up careful and proper terms of reference. It would then follow that the proposal would appear on the yellow Order Paper and there would be a vote on same. I wish to be clear because there is already enough misapprehension about this matter. I have found in political life it is better to tell the truth and be straightforward. One is never caught out then <Col N="1370"/>because the truth is easily remembered. Those who cannot remember &mdash; well, anyway.</P>
      <P>On Wednesday afternoon I spoke individually to Senators Norris, Bradford and Minihan instead of waiting for them to hear it from somebody else. We hold a parliamentary party meeting of Fianna F&aacute;il Senators before the House sits. I am sure all the groups do the same. At that meeting, before lunch last Wednesday, it was brought to my attention that there was considerable disquiet among our group of Senators on this matter. True democracy allows for everybody to be entitled to their own thoughts, to their disquiet and to make a case.</P>
      <P>In this instance I quickly ascertained there would be significant opposition to the matter appearing on the Order Paper and many would vote against it. I took a pragmatic rather than a principled decision because I can count numbers as well as anyone else and I knew well that it would be defeated. This was a pragmatic decision; I was not happy but I recognise the force of numbers and the numbers were clearly against it.</P>
      <P>Those Senators who expressed that view to me did so in good faith and the meeting concluded in a most harmonious and amicable way because I did not delay in clearing the air about the matter. This is not to say that other Members cannot table a motion on the Order Paper, putting forward the terms as legally constructed and advised by the legal adviser.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Leader allow a free vote?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Allow Senator O&rsquo;Rourke to speak without interruption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>The matter can appear on the Order Paper and it would then be a matter for a vote. A European investigation is under way by both the Council of Europe and the European Parliament. However, the investigation by the Council of Europe, chaired by Senator Dick Marty of Switzerland, seems to be the more pivotal one. I had hoped this House could contribute to that investigation and put forward Ireland&rsquo;s point of view.</P>
      <P>I also wish to scotch another perception. The Taoiseach did not intervene in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not say he did.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>I know the Senator did not say that but I wish to put it on the record of the House. I telephoned the Taoiseach before Christmas and again last weekend and he returned my call. We have quite a good telephone relationship. I wish to state clearly that he did not put any pressure or onus upon me to desist from my point of view. It is important to set the record straight on that matter. I acted in a pragmatic way &mdash; I am nothing if not pragmatic.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the long-held views of Senators Mooney and Dooley on the matter. Morality and <Col N="1371"/>jobs should not be linked. I understand the warm relationship between Ireland and the United States. I have my own views on the matter but that is another day&rsquo;s work. I responded to the pressure of numbers. I spoke privately to each of the three Senators.</P>
      <P>A motion has been proposed by Senators Norris and Bradford. The pictures from Abu Ghraib shown on television last night and this morning were awful. There is a lot I could say and I will do so when the House has a debate on Iraq. It is not possible to have a debate on Iraq today. It is not possible to pluck a Minister from wherever he or she is and haul them in here. The Senators are entitled to table a motion and have a vote but I am equally entitled to explain to the House that I cannot fish out a Minister and bring him or her in here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Tuffy raised the matter of the Bill which is deemed unconstitutional. I remind the House that Ministers take legal advice before drafting a Bill. I agree with the Senator that elderly people should not be forced to sell their homes. Their circumstances may change and people may become well again and will need a roof over their heads. There is something very chilling in this proposal and I agree the House should debate the issue.</P>
      <P>Senator Tuffy referred to cocaine being found in the vicinity of Leinster House. I did not know that and I am keen to find out more about it. The Senator may have more information. She also referred to the drugs strategy.</P>
      <P>Senator Dardis refuted the allegations that the elderly would be deprived of their rights and he defended the T&aacute;naiste. Senator Bradford seconded Senator Norris&rsquo;s request for a debate on Iraq to be held today. A Minister is not available but the Senator can avail of a mechanism. I agree with him that the truth must come out. I reiterate that we were a very amicable group when we met.</P>
      <P>Senator Leyden referred to successive Governments but he had a lot on his head&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>He asked for a roll-over system to be introduced for the SSIAs. I will try to arrange a debate on the SSIAs.</P>
      <P>Senator Quinn asked for a debate on the Prisons Bill. He noted that two out of three prisoners reoffend. He said that if this was the situation in education or health there would be a furore. I will ask the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to come back to the House.</P>
      <P>Senator Minihan referred to the issue of nursing home charges, which gave rise to debate here. <Col N="1372"/>He said that a particular party was peddling exemplary damages.</P>
      <P>Senator Ulick Burke asked the Minister for Transport to debate the proposals for driver testing. He suggests testers could be transferred from other Departments. Senator Mooney referred to Senator Dick Marty and to our relationship with the United States.</P>
      <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole asked for a debate on the nursing home charges and the action for exemplary damages. He does not agree with the proposal that civil servants should deal with the issue of exemplary damages. Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; stated he admired the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s courage in taking on the health portfolio and that the patient is the most important person in this debate.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Senator Coghlan asked for a debate on the Great Southern Hotels which I am trying to facilitate. I am pleased the major infrastructure Bill will appear on the Order Paper of this House. It will be a very interesting debate because there are strong arguments on both sides. It will be on the Order Paper in March.</P>
      <P>Senator Glynn is the Government spokesperson on health. He lauded the work of the T&aacute;naiste and raised the matter of garda&iacute; travelling to discos. I did not know they are doing so but I suppose it is a good idea.</P>
      <P>Senator Bannon is of the opinion that the T&aacute;naiste has let us down. He raised the matter of tourism in rural areas. Senator Dooley spoke about rendition. I agree with his point that the county councillors have a right to come here because they are elected public representatives. People often bring in groups of graduates. I have seen Senator Ross on occasions accompanied by a group of graduates.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and wish him well in his new role. I congratulate him on his new portfolio and wish him every success.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. J. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>Thank you, a Chathaoirligh. I welcome this opportunity to speak to Members of this House on the two important issues of security of energy supply and the development of renewable energy sources. Recent events in the Ukraine have brought these issues to the forefront of many people&rsquo;s minds.</P>
      <P>In common with other member states of the European Union, Ireland is consuming more and more energy products. Across the community, production is insufficient for the Union&rsquo;s energy requirements. As a result, external dependence for energy is constantly increasing. This, of course, reinforces the need to research and develop renewable energy sources as a matter of priority.</P>
      <P>As a statutory independent body, the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, plays a key role in ensuring security of supply. Its functions <Col N="1374"/>include regulation of both the gas and electricity markets, assuming the key monitoring and oversight role, and taking any measures it deems necessary to protect the security of supply. It also has responsibility for the preparation of the annual gas capacity statement and approval of the form of the ESB national grid&rsquo;s generation adequacy report.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the requirements of the Electricity Regulation Act 1999, ESB National Grid, EirGrid, published its most recent generation adequacy report in November 2005. This report informs and augments policy developments going forward. It sets out estimates of the demand for electricity for the period 2006-12, the likely production capacity that will be in place to meet this demand, and assesses the consequences in terms of the overall supply and demand balance.</P>
      <P>The generation adequacy report 2006-12 states that sourcing new generation capacity from 2009 is prudent. The generation adequacy position should be manageable from 2006 to 2009 provided that new generation stations come on stream as expected. This is contingent on electricity generation plant availability significantly above the average level of performance achieved over the period 2003 to 2005. It is also dependent on there being no unexpected plant closures from the current generation portfolio.</P>
      <P>Under the Gas (lnterim) Regulation Act 2002, the CER has responsibility for monitoring the security of natural gas supply. The commission is also required to publish an annual gas capacity statement. This statement also provides a seven-year rolling forecast of capacity, flows and customer demand in order to assess the adequacy of the Irish gas transmission system.</P>
      <P>The gas capacity statement considers whether projected supplies of gas from indigenous sources, imports and storage are sufficient to meet forecast demand. A key finding of the 2005 gas capacity statement is that, even under unusually extreme weather conditions, the transmission system will cope with forecast demand.</P>
      <P>In its role as the natural gas transmission system operator, Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann has developed contingency plans in the event of any curtailment in gas supplies. These plans include switching gas-fired power generation plants to alternative fuels, seeking voluntary reductions in consumption from large industrial gas consumers and utilising BGE&rsquo;s reserves from the south-west Kinsale reservoir.</P>
      <P>I am advised by the CER that the availability performance of some of the existing older ESB generation plant is giving cause for concern and has been for some years. Performance improved towards the end of 2004 and during the first half of 2005. It did, however, disimprove in the second half of 2006. This disimprovement, caused by the breakdown of several large generation units, means that at times during the winter the margin <Col N="1375"/>between demand and available generation has been lower than the design level.</P>
      <P>ESB National Grid works with generators to schedule necessary maintenance outages at times when margins are highest. It is also able to call on electricity imported from Northern Ireland and from Britain, via Northern Ireland, to supplement electricity production in Ireland. In any emergency situation the electricity transmission system operator has in place a number of specific emergency plans to deal with an incident quickly and effectively. These include power system restoration and capacity shortfall plans, which involve prioritising supply to critical users such as key telecommunications, security, communications, transportation and medical facilities.</P>
      <P Just="Left">In 2002, the CER conducted a public consultation process on investment in new electricity generation capacity. The CER decided to conduct a competition to bring additional capacity onto the system. Aughinish Alumina and Tynagh Energy were the successful bidders in the competition. As a result, significant committed new thermal generation capacity of up to 536 MW is scheduled to be brought on stream next month to augment the current installed capacity of 5,500 MW. Tynagh, County Galway, at 384 MW and Aughinish, County Limerick, at 152 MW, are currently undergoing full commissioning. In addition, in October 2004, Viridian, Huntstown Power Limited, announced its intention to proceed with a second new 400 MW generating station at Huntstown in north County Dublin.</P>
      <P>The issue of security of gas supply has re-emerged on the political agenda. Fortunately, the Russia-Ukraine situation did not have a direct impact on gas supplies to Ireland. Gas flows for all shippers and suppliers through the transportation system continued to operate normally and in line with nominated quantities.</P>
      <P>Currently, Ireland imports over 80% of its gas supply from the United Kingdom. Last year, the UK became a net importer of natural gas, relying on imports via interconnectors to mainland Europe and on liquefied natural gas, LNG, imports to boost its own indigenous supplies. My Department, the CER and Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann, BGE, are all in regular contact with their counterparts in the UK. I have been assured that in the event of an emergency any reduction to our supplies will be proportional, fair and balanced.</P>
      <P>As our gas imports from the UK account for only 4% of the total UK market, a supply interruption is unlikely. Were it to occur, however, BGE has estimated that such a reduction in supply could be effectively managed by switching gas-fired power generators to alternative fuels. The CER&rsquo;s task force on emergency procedures is currently reviewing the need to strengthen procedures in place in the event of a supply interruption. It is essential that the impacts upon electricity and gas customers from any such supply curtailment scenario be minimised.</P><Col N="1376"/>
      <P>In common with other EU countries, Ireland has commercial reserves of natural gas that are held by licensed natural gas shippers and suppliers. At current levels, BGE&rsquo;s Kinsale reserves would supply a significant amount of gas for a limited period. This is in addition to stocks held by BGE in the UK.</P>
      <P>The CER is currently in discussion with Marathon Oil Ireland Limited about the development of a commercial natural gas storage facility at south-west Kinsale. The CER has recently completed a public consultation on the proposed regulatory regime for the storage facility. It is planned that the storage facility will be operational by mid-2006. Scope for a common approach with our Northern Ireland counterparts on storage and liquefied natural gas has also been identified.</P>
      <P>Electricity and gas interconnection remains a fundamental part of the Government&rsquo;s energy strategy. It will provide increased security of supply, competition and integration of the Irish energy market into the wider European energy market. The Government remains fully committed to progressing the development of east-west electricity interconnection with Great Britain as a matter of priority. At the Minister&rsquo;s request, the CER has explored the options for such development. The CER appointed consultants to advise on the financial, technical, commercial and procurement aspects of the development. A consultation process was undertaken with parties who expressed an interest. The report of the consultants, which is now complete, includes a comprehensive technical and legal review and an analysis of regulatory and procurement aspects. A decision on how best to take the east-west electricity interconnection project forward, be it on a regulated or a hybrid regulated-merchant basis, is the next step in the process.</P>
      <P>With regard to North-South electricity interconnection, a joint intergovernmental endorsement was given in 2004 for plans put forward by the CER and the Northern Ireland Authority for Energy Regulation for the construction of a second North-South electricity interconnector. The transmission system operators are currently working on phase 1 of the project, including technical issues and route selection. This phase is likely to be completed by early 2007. Phase 2, the construction phase, will then commence and it is estimated that the interconnector will be operational by 2012. The proposed interconnector will provide increased system security and reliability and enhanced competition. North-South interconnector development will also facilitate the development of a fully functioning single electricity market.</P>
      <P>An all-island energy market, closely interconnected with Europe, requires the development of a holistic market in several areas of operation. Harmonising a common approach requires a convergence of systems and practices for both gas and electricity. To achieve this aim, in August <Col N="1377"/>2004 the CER signed a memorandum of understanding with its counterpart, the Northern Ireland Authority for Energy Regulation, NIAER, for an all-island electricity market. The memorandum describes the set of principles agreed by the regulators that will underpin the development of an all-island market. The potential benefits of a mature single electricity market or SEM include, <i>inter alia, </i>greater security of supply, a larger single market with competitive prices and open and transparent competition at all levels of the marketplace.</P>
      <P><?oasys _ic14- ?>With regard to gas, the Government approved in September 2001 the making of an Exchequer contribution of not more than &pound;10 million, or &euro;12.7 million, on completion of the gas network in Northern Ireland, which would include extending the natural gas pipeline from Belfast to Derry and the construction of a South-North pipeline. This proposed contribution by the State recognises that a cross-Border gas infrastructure is an essential part of the agreed North-South aspiration for an integrated all-island energy market. In the intervening period, work was completed in 2004 on the Belfast to Derry natural gas pipeline extension. Work is well advanced on the construction of the South- North pipeline and the project is due for completion this summer. Payment of &euro;12.7 million will be made to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Industry of Northern Ireland on completion of the works.<?oasys _ic0- ?></P>
      <P>Ireland has a rich vein of renewable energy resources, the development of which is an essential part of the Government&rsquo;s overall energy policy. The available large hydroelectric sites have already been harnessed as the most efficient form of electricity production from renewable energy sources. Future growth requires us to direct investment to other renewable energy technologies.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The proven alternative technologies at this time are wind power, small scale hydro and biomass technologies, including landfill gas. The most competitively priced of the alternative technologies in the last decade has been wind-power. Ireland, in line with the global trend, has concentrated on that technology as the initial growth sector. However, unlike hydro plant and other conventional technologies, wind-powered plant cannot be precisely regulated to match consumer demand. It can only produce electricity when an adequate wind resource is available. It is imperative, therefore, to see technological progress in other technologies if substantial movement towards other renewable energy technologies is to continue.</P>
      <P>The recent increases in the prices of oil and gas have acted as a catalyst for global investment in new solutions and have focused the public&rsquo;s mind on the high costs of energy. In Ireland, our competitiveness is particularly exposed due to our reliance on fossil fuel imports. Increasing the amount of renewable energy in the domestic <Col N="1378"/>energy mix is therefore even more persuasive as part of an ongoing programme to redress this significant imbalance.</P>
      <P>The current programme commenced with the alternative energy requirement programme, AER, in the mid-1990s. The programme supported the construction of new renewable energy powered electricity generating plant. The national programme was succeeded in 2001 by a key EU directive, commonly known as the renewables directive. The directive sets indicative targets for the increased consumption of renewable energy by each member state. In the case of Ireland the indicative target is to increase green electricity to 13% of total consumption by 2010.</P>
      <P>In 2004, the last full year for which figures are available, renewable energy increased its contribution to gross electricity consumption in Ireland to 5.2%, from 4.3% a year earlier. The most significant factor is that wind-power overtook hydro power for the first time in terms of renewable energy resources harnessed in 2004. The Government&rsquo;s target is to meet or preferably surpass the 13% target by 2010. This is a challenging target and when delivered will represent significant progress.</P>
      <P>In the areas of renewable heat and transport, my Department is introducing a range of new initiatives to promote the use of alternative, environmentally sustainable fuels and heating systems. The EC biofuels directive sets non-mandatory indicative targets of 2% market penetration for biofuels by the end of 2005 and 5.75% by the end of 2010.</P>
      <P>Ireland, like most member states, is still at a very early stage in developing biofuels policy. In 2005, my Department introduced a pilot mineral oil tax relief scheme for biofuels projects which has helped to kick-start market development of biofuels. Eight innovative biofuels projects were approved under the pilot scheme and the production and sale of a range of biofuels on the Irish market has already commenced as a result of this initiative. Of the eight projects, four are pure plant oil, three are biodiesel or other biofuel and one is a bioethanol proposal. It is estimated that the pilot scheme will result in 16 million litres of biofuels being placed on the Irish transport market by next year.</P>
      <P>Following on the success of this scheme, a second more ambitious scheme was announced in the 2006 budget. The new scheme will run over a five year period, commencing this year. This will place Ireland firmly on the map in terms of European biofuel production.</P>
      <P>In the area of renewable heat, in the 2006 budget my Department announced a major new multi-annual grants package of &euro;65 million for renewable energy projects. The package will include grants for domestic renewable heat technologies such as wood pellet boilers, solar panels and geothermal heat pumps; medium and large scale biomass boilers for the services, business and industrial sectors; a programme of <Col N="1379"/>investment in combined heat and power; and grants for the development of biofuels facilities in Ireland. These initiatives complement the existing programmes being rolled out by Sustainable Energy Ireland and are designed to make renewable energy more accessible to all sectors of the economy.</P>
      <P>In renewable heat and transport, the Government has made major strides in the past year. We intend to shortly launch the various schemes announced in the budget and these will impact directly on motorists, householders, and businesses. Ultimately, the Government&rsquo;s aim in this regard is to reduce emissions, increase the availability of indigenously produced heat and transport fuels and provide a low-cost alternative to traditional fossil fuel heating systems. Ireland&rsquo;s bio-energy sector is growing rapidly and a market for bio-energy products is swiftly emerging.</P>
      <P>Security of supply policy does not seek to maximise energy self-sufficiency or to minimise dependence but to reduce the risks linked to such dependence. The overall challenge is to gain a balance between economic and environmental needs while diversifying the various sources of energy in order to minimise dependence on a single source of supply. Ireland and the European Union must now face new challenges characteristic of this period of profound transition for the European economy.</P>
      <P>Matching supply to demand is crucial to ensuring security of supply policy. Ireland&rsquo;s modest domestic energy resources and its geographic distance from other countries make security of supply an especially important issue. Assuring security of energy supply while simultaneously protecting the environment requires a multifaceted approach with an optimal supply mix.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and wish him well in his new brief. I have been calling for this debate in the House for some time and I am glad we are hearing statements on the issue today because energy is of profound importance.</P>
      <P>I presume the latest Deloitte &amp; Touche report, which I understand the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources received prior to Christmas, will help frame policy in the future. We have not heard anything about the report&rsquo;s findings. Will they be revealed to the public eventually or are they so confidential that they will remain within the Department? The Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources has been examining the area of energy for quite some time and intends to produce a report on the issue. That the joint committee is deliberating on the matter indicates its importance. Members of the joint committee should have access to the consultants&rsquo; report, as it would help the committee in framing overall energy policy for the future.</P><Col N="1380"/>
      <P>There have been a number of leaks in respect of how the report questions the dominance of the ESB in the marketplace. Perhaps the report will not be revealed because having the ESB and its dominance criticised is regarded as unpalatable coming up to a general election in 2007. In such a situation perhaps a Government would not attempt to confront the issues raised by the report. Hiding the consultants&rsquo; report for this reason would be regrettable. If we are to frame energy policy, it is imperative that we examine the ESB&rsquo;s dominance in the marketplace.</P>
      <P>We discussed the recent liberalisation of the electricity market but that liberalisation has not made a great difference in the marketplace due to ESB&rsquo;s continued dominance. It has not made a whit of difference to the domestic consumer. In the context of a domestic consumer receiving his or her ESB bill every month, all he or she sees is one particular supplier supplying electricity. Will the Minister of State elaborate on whether we will ever see the consultants&rsquo; report? Will the findings be revealed? I am sure there was an excessive cost in producing the report. I would hate to see it gathering dust as it should be used in framing future energy policy.</P>
      <P>From time to time, the House has held debates on the issue of energy sources with the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Noel Dempsey. Unfortunately, when one puts forward a constructive proposal or suggestion, one is criticised for supposedly trying to close down power stations. As any consumer would tell the Minister of State, there is a public service obligation section in all of our ESB bills. The validity of this obligation from the Government&rsquo;s point of view is in light of peat power stations and other alternative sources of energy.</P>
      <P>It is a compensation mechanism within the bills. However, it is worth bearing in mind that the energy regulator, in answer to my questions, regards the public service obligation as an anti-competitive practice. As such, the Government should question whether it should retain the public service obligation. The dividend the Government receives from the ESB each year is in excess of the total amount retrieved through the obligation.</P>
      <P>To a certain degree all of the regulators have been good for politics and Ministers in that they have taken the heat on electricity prices. The Minister had ultimate responsibility a number of years ago and the buck stopped there but there is now a buffer zone in the form of the regulator. If there is any criticism, the regulator will be subject to it. We have witnessed a considerable increase in electricity charges over recent years. High energy users from different parts of the country such as Intel, Wellman International Limited, Aughinish Alumina Limited and many others attended the joint committee. They could negotiate with the ESB previously but can no longer do so as the energy regulator dictates the prices. <Col N="1381"/>Many of these companies now say that, due to escalating electricity prices, Ireland is not as good an option as an industrial environment as it was previously. They have witnessed their indirect costs increase significantly, especially as heavy users of electricity.</P>
      <P>One must recognise that, within the basket of fuels, we have a dependency on imported products. What happens in gas or oil producers such as the Ukraine or elsewhere impacts directly on the consumer and the ultimate user here. The Electricity Supply Board and the energy regulator state that many of these costs must be passed on to the end consumer. The chief executive of the ESB, Mr. P&aacute;draig McManus, recently addressed the committee and indicated that he expected electricity prices to decrease by 4% in 2007 due to the all Ireland market. He also indicated that the basket of fuels involved in the production of electricity will impact on the cost of electricity. It would surprise me if the consumer experienced a decrease in the cost of electricity.</P>
      <P>I have spoken on the topic of wind energy over a period of time. In this context, the national grid section of the ESB recently stated that it feels confident the 13.2% target figure will be reached. It is also confident enough wind energy projects are on stream, either those that have already been physically created or those waiting for final approval in the system. There is tremendous frustration among people promoting wind energy about the long gestation process from applying for planning permission to getting connected to the national grid and producing a small number of megawatt units for the electricity network. A stop-start regime seems to have operated in this respect for some time. The regulator tells people to stop so that the project can be examined. The ESB, as the primary producer of electricity, would view wind energy production as intermittent, a factor in the equation of this country&rsquo;s energy supplies.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I have met frustrated people who entered the market with an alternative energy project. I am sure the Minister of State has met them also. An example would be upland areas suitable for the initial location of wind meters in order to gauge the situation before embarking on the lengthy process described above. I spoke with a gentleman who, as late as August 2004, paid over &euro;500,000 directly to the ESB to access the national grid. He is as far from finishing now as he was then despite needing to pay that money up front.</P>
      <P>I welcome the discussion about wind energy involving the public and Ministers and the fact that people are excited about the concept but the issue is a jigsaw with many pieces and different players, such as the ESB, local authorities and the energy regulator. No one is putting the jigsaw pieces together, a view I recently expressed to the energy regulator. I have also expressed this view to the ESB and local authorities.</P><Col N="1382"/>
      <P>While the ESB spokesperson might state it has enough wind energy projects in the pipeline at national level, to what degree is this message communicated to local authorities and promoters applying for planning permission to the local authorities through the planning process? It is frustrating that many cases will never get connected to the grid. Why should they prepare impact assessments for county development plans that are being produced to identify the locations for suitable wind energy projects? Someone somewhere at some stage who has the proper type of capacity will want to get into the system. They should not spend a lot of money at that stage to prepare a planning proposal for approval.</P>
      <P>It is exciting to talk about the issue of alternative energy but we need a type of joined up thinking that is not currently in evidence. Will the Minister of State examine the matter with his officials? We may speak about alternative energy sources such as wave power, wind power or biomass but the most credible source in the public&rsquo;s view is wind power. Wave power has been tried but has not proven successful despite much money being spent, leaving us with the options of biomass and solar energy.</P>

      <P>Everybody understands the scale of economic and environmental difficulties if Ireland does not address the energy crisis. In order to neutralise the effect of global warming, it is generally agreed that the level of global greenhouse gas emissions must be reduced by 70% by 2100. As a first step the 1997 Kyoto Agreement was drawn up with the aim of reducing global emissions of greenhouse gases by 5.2% by 2012 based on 1990 levels. Under the agreement, to which Ireland is a signatory, we undertook to limit the increase of these emissions in the period 2008-12 to 13% based on 1990 levels. Without action, it is estimated our emissions would rise by 37%, almost three times the permitted level. Our emissions are currently 25% above 1990 levels. If agreed commitments on emissions are not met, Ireland will face a bill of &euro;400 million, an appalling vista that neither I nor my party is willing to tolerate.</P>
      <P>We must change the dynamic driving the alternative energy industry in Ireland. We must take steps to boost our production of biocrops, creating a market of biofuel, install an eco-friendly tax regime and establish a planning policy that works towards the creation of a first class alternative energy infrastructure.</P>
      <P>Fine Gael believes the Government track record in this area is appalling and has published proposals as a response. Biofuels have the potential to provide benefits to our farmers, our environment and our economy. Most European states have kick started the biofuel industry by using setaside land for growing biofuel crops. Ireland must act now to reach European standards. Irish agricultural land offers major potential to develop alternative energy crops. In the initial stages we must be practical in developing a viable <Col N="1383"/>biofuel industry but it makes sense to follow the examples of other EU states that are more advanced in such technology.</P>
      <P>Currently, the greatest potential for Irish farmers and industry lies in the development of biodiesel and bioethanol, not least because, as the Minister of State stated, such production is under way in Ireland, albeit on a small scale. We must focus on developing this area as a priority. The immediate focus must be on developing the process of fuel blending, blending standard diesel with rapeseed oil to produce biodiesel and petrol with bioethanol.</P>
      <P>Fine Gael is calling for a number of steps to be taken to kick start the biofuel industry. These include the removal of excise duty on biofuels produced from renewable energy crops. This will reduce costs and entice more players to the market. We urgently need producer grants for producer groups, consisting of up to 50% of the cost of setting up the group, subject to a maximum of &euro;300,000 per group. A public competition for the establishment and operation of a number of strategically located biofuel processing plants should be held. Capital start-up grants for these plants should be available to enable them to be established and begin viable processing operations. Greater links with international biofuel processors, fuel suppliers and relevant Departments, especially the Departments of Transport and Agriculture and Food, to facilitate the promotion of the biofuels industry are vital.</P>
      <P>Production cannot flourish if there is no market for what is produced. At present, the growth of biofuels is hampered by the absence of a serious outlet in which to sell them. Biofuels are indigenous, reliable and increasingly economic and Fine Gael proposes to legislate for all motor fuels to include a blend of fuel from renewable sources. All petrol sold at petrol stations will include a 5% bioethanol mix and all diesel will include a 2% biodiesel mix. This will not require the conversion of standard motor engines and would reduce emissions from cars. It would also provide an immediate market for farmers to sell energy crops. As the benefits become clear motorists may convert their engines to allow greater use of biofuel, thus reducing emissions further. At present, Ireland&rsquo;s consumption of renewable energy is extremely low.</P>
      <P>I am glad Moneypoint has been upgraded as residents in the estuary have tolerated acid rain and environmental damage. Much could be done in this area and the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources could contribute to this debate. The Deloitte &amp; Touche report should be published and this would assist the Department in framing energy policy. We could all contribute something to an extremely important area. Recently, we have had amber alerts and were fortunate we could use the wind generating capacity. This is a delicate phase in Ireland in terms of sustaining <Col N="1384"/>future productivity and the Celtic tiger. We will need more energy to be made available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanKenneally"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome my friend the Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Browne, and wish him well on his return to the Department. He has built up considerable knowledge of the area from his previous tenure, which he will put to good use.</P>
      <P>This issue will become a greater part of our discussions in the future. Today&rsquo;s debate is not only about energy but also about the environment. Management of the environment is crucial to our future in Ireland and also in a world context. Considerable awareness has been garnered on the environment over the past number of years and although steps have been taken in certain countries to make changes, these may not be enough.</P>
      <P>Like every other developing country we have become hugely dependent on oil and gas. We must ask ourselves if those sources of energy will always be available in sufficient quantity to serve our needs. We must pursue and develop other sources of energy as there is no point in waiting until supplies of oil and gas begin to run out, or become unavailable through political instability, natural disaster or other crises. We have seen such things happen in the past and paid the price through greatly inflated energy bills. We must commence practical development and further research on solar energy, wind and wave power and hydro sources.</P>
      <P>Three key policy issues must be addressed, namely, security of supply, cost competitiveness and environmental responsibility. At present in Ireland the total primary energy requirement is fulfilled mainly from the imports of oil and gas. Only 15% of the country&rsquo;s energy comes from indigenous sources. Natural gas provides 45% of the electricity generation fuel mix, which is much higher than the EU average. While gas may be a relatively clean fuel, we have little or no storage facilities for it, which leaves us exposed to a danger to our security of supply in future emergencies.</P>
      <P>Between 1990 and 2004, there was a 65% increase in oil imports to this country and in that same period, the cost of oil rose from $15 a barrel to approximately $65 at present. There is no reason to believe this figure will drop significantly in the near future. In the past OPEC countries increased output to stabilise the price of oil on the world market but this in turn has its own dangers in the faster reduction of reserves, which will hasten a scarcity. Ireland has a very significant wind energy resource, both onshore and offshore. However, in the absence of an economic means of storing the energy and the random and variable availability of wind, its contribution to a continuous electricity supply is limited. At present, this means of generation cannot be regarded as a substitute for thermal plant. However, as new <Col N="1385"/>technology is developed, this should change in the future. Despite those drawbacks, wind is the most proven, cheapest and one of the cleanest of available energy technologies.</P>
      <P>Security of supply in the future is a major cause for concern. Only one electricity interconnector exists between Northern Ireland and this country, and its transfer capability is restricted. The provision of a second interconnector has been studied and costed. However, there is no indication as to when this might come on-stream. The Minister of State alluded to it coming on-stream in 2012, which is to be welcomed. It is necessary and will bring us further benefits as there is an existing interconnector between Northern Ireland and Scotland.</P>
      <P>It is also proposed to provide two interconnectors between Ireland and Wales. This will allow for the future integration, if necessary or desirable, of Ireland into a wider European energy market, as has already happened in the gas industry. Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann already has two gas interconnectors to Scotland. In developing renewable energy sources in this country, we are enhancing the security of supply. In addition, renewable energy sources are a substitute for fuel imports.</P>
      <P>There is also a possibility, slim though it may be, that by developing our natural energy sources to the limits I outlined, we might become a net contributor to a European grid, with consequent economic benefits for us all. One of the technical difficulties is storage. However, I am sure that this, like many other technical problems of the past, will be solved in the future.</P>
      <P>Cost is also an important factor. In a full opening of the electricity market, all customers would be free to choose their suppliers and as more renewable energy resources go into the national grid, this will have the effect of improving choice. A number of independent generators already contribute to the grid, including Viridian, BGE, Airtricity, Aughinish and Tynagh. Hopefully this method of supply will develop further in the future, for as our demand for capacity continues to grow, so too will the need for further generation.</P>
      <P>The concept of an all-island market is supported by many of those directly involved in different ways, including the ESB and IBEC. In submissions to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources on 2 November 2005, the ESB stated it was committed to integrating the island network by July 2007. This will serve to encourage competition, providing economies of scale, sharing strategic costs and providing greater security.</P>
      <P>As I mentioned earlier, we must keep our environmental responsibilities firmly in mind, particularly in regard to greenhouse gas emissions. The greatest generator of greenhouse gases is energy supply, which was growing until recent years, but of late seems to have stabilised. The main contributors here are industry, transport, <Col N="1386"/>residential, commercial and agriculture. By agriculture I mean the energy used in that sector. The second biggest contributor to greenhouse gases is the agricultural industry itself. However, the amount attributable to this sector appears to have started to decline. In 2003 for instance, two sectors were responsible for 93% of the greenhouse gas emissions, with 65% attributable to energy and 28% to agriculture. This shows the need for other, cleaner types of energy to be made available.</P>
      <P>The renewable energy contribution to the total primary energy requirement was 2.2%. This came mainly from biomass, hydro and wind, with biomass being the largest component. I wish to comment particularly on the importance of bioethanol and biofuels in general and what the future holds. In June 2003, the EU adopted the biofuels directive, setting a target of a 5.75% market share for biofuels in 2010. Last December, the European Commission adopted a biomass action plan, setting out a number of measures to promote biofuels. By December this year, a report will be published on whether the biofuels directive needs to be further strengthened.</P>
      <P>I will return to the issue of security of supply. This issue is of increasing concern for this country, as the share of imported fuel grows, which it inevitably it will over the coming 25 years. There are security risks in many energy sectors. In the case of gas, the trans-eastern European pipelines are continually under threat from local terrorist attack. Such risks are greatest in oil, because our import share is highest in this fuel and our greatest dependence is on a few regions of the world. Oil is also the fuel which will be hit first by scarcity and involves the greatest economic risk as there are few large-scale alternatives to its use in the transport sector in particular. It is essential for us to promote those alternatives which exist. Liquid biofuels are common today and are the only direct alternative to oil use in road transport.</P>
      <P>In tackling the problem of climate change, it is important for all sectors of society to make a contribution. However, the transport sector has found it rather difficult to find ways of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Once again, biofuels are more or less &ldquo;the only game in town&rdquo; for road transport, at least in the short term, alongside the car-makers&rsquo; voluntary agreement to reduce new car CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions.</P>
      <P>We must work hard to develop other measures in the transport sector, such as rebalancing in favour of more environmentally-friendly modes or measures in the area of transport energy efficiency. One avenue to explore in more depth is the role of public authorities as consumers. In this respect, Cork City Council and at least one other local authority have given a major lead in beginning to convert their fleets, 250 vehicles in the case of Cork, to use only rapeseed oil as fuel. According to a recent newspaper report, a pilot project began in 2003, with 17 of the council&rsquo;s <Col N="1387"/>vehicles converted to run on rapeseed oil grown and processed in County Wicklow. It only cost &euro;23,000 to convert the vehicles from fossil-based fuels and the council now intends to convert its entire fleet to the new system when it puts out tenders for fleet renewal in 2007. It will cost between &euro;500,000 and &euro;750,000.</P>
      <P>One drawback is that vegetable fuels are still more expensive than diesel or petrol. On the plus side, they produce no noxious emissions and are a completely renewable resource. A slight drawback, the report suggested, is a &ldquo;chipper-like&rdquo; smell from the exhaust which some drivers complain about. That is a small price to pay for a cleaner environment and a healthier balance of payments. I have no doubt that as the popularity of the fuel grows, technology to make it even cleaner will emerge and it will be up to the Government&rsquo;s excise policies to make it cheaper and more attractive.</P>
      <P>The EU recently proposed a directive on clean vehicles which requests a minimum of 25% of annual procurement of heavy-duty vehicles of less polluting and more energy-efficient vehicles. Once implemented, these new rules should also help in promoting the use of biofuels. One of the most obvious fleets to target is that of buses, both under the banner of CIE and also in the private sector. It is always a source of wonder to me why buses serving provincial towns do not switch off their engines when waiting at bus stops, sometimes for long periods. School buses waiting for their passengers in the evening are a particular case in point and it also applies to longer distance buses which must wait for a scheduled departure from town stops. It is an unnecessary contribution to pollution and a waste of expensive fuel in large engines.</P>
      <P>For the reasons stated above and also because of the new opportunities offered to Irish industry and to farmers, I believe that increased use of biofuels must play a key role in Irish energy policy. Achieving the targets set in the biofuels directive will not be easy and will need a sustained effort on all sides. The European Union must put in place a policy framework that will give long-term confidence to firms considering investment in biofuel technology.</P>
      <P>They must re-examine technical obstacles to the greater use of biofuels and implement a balanced trade framework, particularly for ethanol, so domestic producers and those in least-developed countries, as well as the tropical sugar cane producers, benefit from the developing European biofuel markets.</P>
      <P>Industries, especially the vehicle and oil industries, will need to find ways to incorporate all kinds of biofuels &mdash; bioethanol as well as biodiesel. Crucially, there is also a need for research to accelerate the development of new biofuel production techniques capable of drawing on a wider range of raw materials.</P><Col N="1388"/>
      <P Just="Left">I welcome the recent budget announcement that Ireland should set an initial target of 2% of the fuel market to be taken up by biofuels by 2008 and that we should achieve this through targeted excise relief measures. The level of excise relief will start at &euro;20 million in 2006, will be increased to &euro;35 million in 2007 and to &euro;50 million in each of the following three years. This relief, when fully operational, is expected to support the production in Ireland of 163 million litres of biofuel every year. This is 20 times the current level of biofuel that is excise relieved. There are clear benefits to this initiative. The environment will benefit in terms of a reduction in CO<?oasys _of8- ?>2 emissions. It will enhance security of supply of fuels and create jobs and outlets for agricultural production. It is estimated that it could ultimately give rise to hundreds of extra full-time jobs in the State.</P>
      <P>More and more land has been set aside under EU rules each year. We are now seeing the demise of the sugar industry with the loss of growing potential in sugar beet. Perhaps it is time, both strategically and in conjunction with the reduction in farm produce, to look seriously at the biofuel market and seek to develop it among a farming community which generally does not like to see the land lying idle.</P>
      <P>Guarantee of fuel supplies in the future has always been precarious due to the factors I mentioned earlier, not least political instability. Add to that, the huge demand which has been created by the development of the Chinese economy and others which will rise in the Third World, we must look at the alternatives. We owe it to the people to have foreseen future difficulties and to be able to guarantee fuel supply going forward. It is one of the more pressing, although less obvious problems, we face and it is our clear responsibility to respond promptly and effectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I add my voice to the congratulations to the Minister of State. It is great to see him back in the House in this role which, I think, he enjoys. I was impressed by his contribution. One of the reasons I, along with Senator Finucane, asked for this debate is that we have become complacent. We have got to a point where we assume something which has always happened will always happen. Recently when I was in what one could call a Third World country, each time I went into a bedroom there were candles. The reason is they are used to having power failures. We have got so used to assuming that when we press the switch, the light will come on that we have almost forgotten the times that did not happen. In the past, that was not necessarily due to any failure on the part of ESB but perhaps due to strikes or otherwise. Back in the 1940s and 1950s, my father had to buy generators for his business because he could not have run it without them as there were regular power failures. In my business, the supermarket business, we always had to install generators because back <Col N="1389"/>in the 1960s and 1970s, there seemed to be regular power failures, I think, generally due to strikes. My point is that we should not assume we will always have power. That point is enhanced a little recently by what happened between Russia and the Ukraine. Senator Kenneally touched on the figures in respect of our dependence on imports to maintain our development.</P>
      <P>I welcome the debate and the Minister of State&rsquo;s words, particularly the contingencies being put in place. It is a reminder to keep them to the fore. However, I express my disappointment at how badly our political process deals with long-term problems which do not have immediate political implications. We are reasonably good at responding to short-term concerns as they arise, particularly when there is a feeling that a broad range of the public is agitated about them. If the public is upset about something immediate, we act on it but if it is long-term, we put it on the long finger, and we tend to have very long fingers. We are not good at responding adequately to long-term challenges &mdash; to chickens which will come home to roost long after the current Government has given way to its successors. That is a pity not only because the long-term challenges tend to be the really important ones but because they can best be addressed in the long term. If we ignore them until they become immediate crises, it is difficult to do something about them at that stage.</P>
      <P>A related problem is that in recent years, we have become worse at seeking our own solutions to problems which face us. If one looks back over the past ten years, it is striking how much of the legislation which has passed through these Houses has been driven by Europe. These days relatively few of our own initiatives are truly home grown. A case in point applies to the subject matter of this debate, energy. In recent years, the most prominent action we have taken in this area has been the establishment of the energy regulator which has been almost totally driven by Europe. We passed that legislation, as we were required to do so by Europe. However, we have not watched it carefully. We have not monitored how effective it has been in achieving its declared objective. If we did that, we would be faced with the question as to whether we are running our energy industry according to the right priorities.</P>
      <P>The first two priorities, and perhaps the overriding ones, should be that we should always have enough energy available to meet demand and that energy should be available to the customer at the lowest possible cost. I looked up the Commission for Energy Regulation website and it does not seem that these are the top two priorities. The website states that the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, is the independent body responsible for regulating and overseeing the liberalisation of Ireland&rsquo;s energy sector.</P>
      <P>I wish to touch on the word &ldquo;liberalisation&rdquo; because there is a confusion between the end and the means. In general, I am enthusiastic about lib<Col N="1390"/>eralisation but it is a means to an end and not an end in itself. Too readily we jump to the conclusion that liberalisation will automatically deliver what we want in terms of supply and price. The current threats to our energy supply show how shaky that argument is. Surely it does not matter how liberalised our system is if it ends up not satisfying the national need for power and if the end result is that customers pay more rather than less for electricity.</P>
      <P>The airline industry is a good example of where liberalisation was dramatically effective. Some 20 years ago, it cost &pound;239 to go from Dublin to London and, to the best of my knowledge, there were only two airlines on that route. Following liberalisation, we ended up with Ryanair and other airlines and Aer Lingus had to change its rules. We got far more effective airlines and far lower prices. However, that does not necessarily happen. One only needs to look at the energy industry to see that liberalisation on its own does not work miracles if one takes one&rsquo;s eye off the ball. As a nation, we have taken our eye off the ball and assumed liberalisation will achieve what we want.</P>
      <P>There is the crazy situation where the Commission for Energy Regulation, in order to promote competition in the market, approves higher prices because it states that without a certain level of profit, one cannot attract new entrants into the market. The whole point of wanting more players in the first place is to achieve lower prices and not higher ones. From the customers&rsquo; point of view, if a monopoly produces the lowest prices, then that is what serves them best. That usually does not happen, and it certainly did not in the airline industry, which is why the drive to liberalise has been so strong. It makes sense and I approved of the concept of liberalisation because I assumed it would bring down prices. In this case, however, liberalisation, or attempted liberalisation, is having the opposite effect to what we want, that is, taking the public interest into account.</P>
      <P>We want lower energy prices but all this pales into insignificance if we do not have energy in the first place. When one&rsquo;s power is cut off, one does not mind what price one must pay for it. All one wants is a restoration of power. That is my starting point in this regard and is why continuity of supply must always be the first national energy priority. It comes before everything else and our entire energy policy should be focused on getting that right before we meddle with anything else.</P>
      <P>It is also important to realise that annoying as power cuts may be for the ordinary household customer, they are much more important from a business perspective. Earlier, I spoke of being obliged to install generators in my supermarkets. I know of one American company that wanted to open supermarkets in Asia. It examined the possibility of so doing, decided it was a fantastic opportunity and invested heavily. However, the company failed and lost heavily on the venture. The company&rsquo;s misjudgment was that it did not <Col N="1391"/>realise that the power failures which occurred there on a regular basis meant that the business could not be run successfully, particularly in respect of fresh food.</P>
      <P>While it is annoying for households to make do without power, Members should consider what would happen to those companies which we have attracted into our country in order to build their businesses. To a large extent, the success of our economy has been built on them. Part of the reason we were able to attract them here was our ability to promise them continuity of supply, as far as electricity was concerned. The lack of a 100% supply would be a deal breaker for such industries.</P>
      <P>I have travelled to many countries where daily power interruptions are the norm. One of the characteristics of a Third World country is the uncertainty of its power supply. Up to now, Ireland has avoided this state of affairs so well that many of us take for granted the expectation that the supply of electricity will always be available when desired. However, we are perilously close to changing that situation and turning this country into one in which one cannot always depend on something happening when one turns on a switch.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The manner in which we have organised our energy industry has led us to focus on the wrong priorities and we should revisit the legislation. One point which has emerged from today&rsquo;s contributions is that the Minister should consider revisiting the legislation that set up the Commission for Energy Regulation. He should redefine its remit so that no one is in any doubt that its first priority should be to ensure continuity of supply and that the second should be to deliver the lowest possible prices. Anything else, however desirable, should be subordinate to those two objectives.</P>
      <P>I have dealt with the subject of electricity sufficiently. As other Members have noted, its supply is neither the beginning nor the end of our energy needs, important though it is. Our cars and trucks do not run on electricity and represent an ever-increasing part of our energy demand. In the past year, we have had two wake-up calls in this respect. Members have already discussed the first, namely, the rise of the spot oil price to a new plateau. Originally, people did not believe that a price of a barrel of oil could reach $70 or that such a price could be lived with. However, this is no longer a novelty and most people now appear to believe that we will never again see the price of oil fall below $50 dollars a barrel. This is reflected in the fact that according to the latest figures released yesterday, increased oil prices alone accounted for more than &euro;1 billion in our annual imports bill. The sum of &euro;1 billion simply reflects the increase last year over the previous year, as the total oil bill is much higher.</P>
      <P>Our second wake-up call, to which we have paid little heed thus far, was the news that this <Col N="1392"/>country is the most dependent in Europe on imported energy. This means that in a future in which the price of oil is likely to go in only one direction, we are set to become almost totally dependent on an input, the price and source of which we will have absolutely no control over. Members will have noted the recent events in Ukraine. This will become an increasingly significant element in determining our overall competitiveness on the international scene, as well as our ability to attract business and industry to Ireland to create jobs and boost our economy.</P>
      <P>Taken together, these two wake-up calls should spur us into action. They should make us determined to take seriously the question of alternative energy supplies. Developing those alternatives should become an urgent national priority, if we have any sense of the future or any sense of our responsibility to prepare for its needs, rather than simply focusing on our ability to continue to party on, as we do at present.</P>
      <P Just="Left">In recent years we have taken some tentative steps with regard to the development of wind power. It was interesting to travel to Dundalk last week and to see for the first time the production by Dundalk Institute of Technology of its own electricity from its wind generator. Such steps are welcome. Moreover, from my home I can see the wind turbines off the Wicklow coast. While we have taken those first steps, we have almost totally ignored the potential of wave power, despite our favourable position on the edge of the Atlantic ocean. Senator Finucane has already raised this point. I believe we should urgently seek to piggy-back on the research that is being carried out on wave power in, for example, Denmark. Members should note that geographically, it is far less ideally placed than Ireland to exploit its potential. While we do not initiate enough of our own solutions, we can piggy-back on the works of others.</P>
      <P>However, the biggest gap in our approach to energy is our refusal to actively explore alternatives to petrol as a fuel for our cars and trucks. There must be alternatives and Members have touched on this issue during this debate. It is not rocket science, as the technology already exists and is fully proven to run vehicles on ethanol rather than on petrol. Nor is there any economic problem in so doing, given the Government&rsquo;s total control over the excise duty charged on fuel. It would be in the national interest to forego completely the revenue from motor fuels if the substitute was a home-grown, renewable product.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The Minister of State mentioned Ireland&rsquo;s rich vein of renewable energy resources. As an agricultural nation, we are particularly well placed to take this step. The farming lobby should be pushing hardest in this respect. Instead of putting all their energy into producing crops that others can produce more efficiently, or in the pursuit of subsidies to compensate themselves for agreeing not to produce anything at all, farmers should rush to embrace this new market opportunity. They have <Col N="1393"/>the opportunity to produce something that the marketplace actually wants, at a price that will guarantee them a generous return for their efforts. They must put some work into this and Teagasc and others can help them do so. A side benefit would be that it would allow farmers to reinvent themselves as friends of the environment, rather than as its enemies, as they are so frequently portrayed today.</P>
      <P>If we continue depending on oil to the same extent as today, we will fatally undermine our future ability to compete successfully in world markets. We should grow our own petrol instead. It is that simple. This can be done, although it will entail changes of attitudes and will require us to focus our attention on the issue. I welcome both the Minister&rsquo;s comments on this subject and the opportunity to debate it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>I join with other Members in welcoming the Minister of State to the House and wish him well in his renewed interest in this field. All Members are pleased he has returned to this area of responsibility and look forward to working with him in the future.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I welcome the opportunity to make some points in respect of this issue. Although I am significantly younger than Senator Quinn, being from the west of Ireland I remember a time when power outages were a regular feature of the winter. While candles may have been a great novelty for a young child, this was a fact of life. Although progress has been made, as far as the west of Ireland is concerned it has not been to the desired extent. I will return to this point later.</P>
      <P>We face an enormous challenge. When people think of renewable energy, they think automatically of climate change. While this is an extremely important issue, we could induce the public to engage in the manner desired by Senator Quinn and other Members if we focus more on security of supply and highlight the dangers in that regard to people. Senator Kenneally can probably remember the time when a consultant appeared before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources. While he may have been scaremongering, he produced statistics which suggested that something in the order of 50 years&rsquo; worth of oil supplies and 70 years&rsquo; worth of gas supplies remain in the world. I very much hope that is not the case but it is a serious wake-up call. Nevertheless, given the increased development throughout the world, it is a major concern that supplies of oil, on which everyone is dependent, and gas are limited. If the focus was placed on this issue, people would embrace the need to develop renewable resources going forward.</P>
      <P>I commend the Department and the Government on the steps they have taken to achieve a renewable energy target of 13.2% of overall electricity consumption by 2010 but they have not been aggressive enough. The bar should be raised in this regard. While many wind farms have been <Col N="1394"/>established, it is disgraceful that many more await connection. Even though representatives of the ESB and the energy regulator have appeared before the joint committee, I am still not clear on why they cannot be connected. Bord na M&oacute;na, a semi-State body, has plans for the largest wind farm in the State but it is also having difficulty getting connected. I would like the Minister of State to put his energies into resolving that issue. There is significant potential in the west to develop wind energy. Four or five of my constituents are awaiting a grid connection but I do not understand what is the problem and I would like to get to the bottom of it as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>The renewable energy target should be increased because there is no shortage of wind in Ireland. We could be net contributors to a European grid, as Senator Kenneally stated. Research and development regarding the storage of such energy will be important. If a way can be found to store the energy generated by wind, it would represent a serious step forward and we would have no concerns if that were achieved.</P>
      <P>The potential of the ocean should also be harnessed. I do not know whether tidal energy is practical but energy generated by waves has potential. The Department has set a target of 6 MW to be generated by wave energy between now and 2020, which is ridiculously low. A more significant amount should be targeted because this resource is not being harnessed. To achieve a higher target, we need to focus on how to bring such energy ashore. Moneypoint on the Shannon Estuary is the only plant in the west that could harness wave energy. Perhaps a plant in the north west, preferably Sligo, should be considered.</P>
      <P>The e-tenders website called for a feasibility study on bringing gas to the north west, which I found confusing, because I recall the former Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise, Deputy Jacob, announcing that gas would be supplied to the region. In the context of the national spatial strategy and the national development plan, is the study a formality? Can the north west look forward to the security of supply enjoyed by other parts of the State? When can I look forward to the Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann transmission system reaching the north west, thereby giving me the option of using natural gas? Following meetings of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, there appeared to be a lack of willingness on the part of BGE to extend the gas transmission system to Sligo and Donegal. Its representatives stated that under the Gas Acts, they had a commercial mandate, which prohibited them from doing so. Given the former Minister of State&rsquo;s announcement, will the new Minister of State confirm it will happen and that the feasibility study is confirmation that the Government is planing to take matters forward apace?</P>

    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State and I congratulate him on his appointment. I wish <Col N="1395"/>him well in his new brief, which he has taken up at an important time. Energy provision is at crisis point. IBEC&rsquo;s recent report outlined its concerns about Ireland&rsquo;s production methods and its dependency on oil importation. I support Senator MacSharry regarding energy availability. Nothing is being done to harness the potential of alternative energy sources to offset the impending crisis.</P>
      <P>Last year, Ireland experienced 57 amber alerts, the most serious of which occurred on 13 December. A number of areas were close to blackout because of the inadequacy of the electricity supply. The Department has had ample warning but what will change this year? A new gas power plant has been commissioned at Tynagh, Loughrea, County Galway, near my home and it will enter production over the next month. It is being tested currently. The plant has a back-up system if the gas supply is interrupted but it is dependent on oil.</P>
      <P>Gama is an 80% shareholder in the plant. At the energy regulator&rsquo;s insistence, a contract was entered into for the production of energy, under which Gama is guaranteed payment on the basis of the plant operating at 100% capacity for ten years, even though usage at any given time may be as low as 40% or 50%. Consumers will have to pay for electricity that has not been generated or supplied, which is a rip-off. Will the Minister of State provide a copy of the contract? The role of the independent regulator, Mr. Reeves, must be queried. The consequences of this arrangement are serious, especially given the dominance of the ESB and the fact that the independent regulator was a former employee of that body. There is evidence of a preference to subsidiaries of the ESB in the area of access to the national grid, particularly with regard to wind energy, as Senator MacSharry observed.</P>
      <P>There are many people, along the west coast in particular, who have spent significant sums of money in an effort to secure access to the national grid. These are not major developers but ordinary farmers and landowners who have joined together, in pursuit of an alternative income, to form co-operatives seeking the necessary planning permission. They have had to contend with all the objections that arise, such as those relating to the impact on visual amenities, the displacement of wildlife and so on. The lifetime of their planning is coming to an end but there is no indication their efforts will be rewarded by the granting of access.</P>
      <P>One calls to mind the observation of Shakespeare&rsquo;s protagonist in &ldquo;Hamlet&rdquo; that &ldquo;something is rotten in the state of Denmark&rdquo;. The Minister of State, who is newly appointed to the Department, must investigate the area of access to the national grid. There is something rotten in what is going on and what has happened in recent times. The so-called &ldquo;independence&rdquo; of the regulator is questionable; I must put that word in inverted commas.</P><Col N="1396"/>
      <P>Will the Minister of State also investigate the terms of the contract awarded to Gama and say why it is necessary to guarantee payment on the basis of 100% capacity when the demand is far less? This is a terrible situation and the burden of it falls on the consumer. There has been a 100% increase in the price of gas and a 60% increase in the price of electricity in the last several years. Where will it stop if we allow our current levels of dependence to continue? Three major energy companies do not wish to do business here because they can see there is no real competition. A cosy cartel is in operation. The onus is on the Minister of State to ensure this is broken up in the interest of securing a guarantee of reasonably priced energy to consumers and industry.</P>
      <P>Some 300,000 jobs have been lost over a period of time primarily because of increasing energy costs. Can we allow this to continue? Who is responsible if it does? It is a pity that legislation passed by the Oireachtas in the past has given such control to the regulator. On various occasions in the other House, the Minister has refused to reply to questions because he says it is no longer his responsibility. It is incumbent on him to take responsibility in this area in order to safeguard a continuity of supply.</P>
      <P>We must take notice when an organisation such as IBEC strongly highlights the difficulties that may arise in terms of the continuation of energy supply. The Minister of State mentioned the doubts in regard to gas supply in the future. Other European countries were on red alert as a result of the Ukrainian interruption some weeks ago. We depend extensively on gas but there was no response or alert from either Government, Minister or regulator to that crisis. This is something that must be urgently rectified if we are to have a continuation of supply.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Will the Minister of State immediately examine the situation with regard to the granting of access to the national grid for those ready to roll if only they got the opportunity? Will he convey to me, at his earliest convenience, the terms of the contract with Gama and why it is that such preferential treatment is given to this company, which is an 80% shareholder in the plant at Tynagh? We must discover who controls the other 20%. Who is involved in Gama? Are there others under the umbrella of Gama who are investing in this and will take a quick cut of the profits?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly"><NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>I join other Members in congratulating the Minister of State on his appointment and in wishing him well in that office. I thank him also for his effective work in his previous Department.</P>
      <P>It would be difficult to discuss energy policy matters without referring to the work done by the ESB. I avail of this opportunity to express my appreciation of its work since the foundation of the State in developing energy policy and meeting our energy requirements. I especially compliment the ESB on the work it has done on the station in Moneypoint. There was some criticism in the <Col N="1397"/>past that emissions from that station were damaging the environment but the investment of &euro;1.5 billion by the ESB will ensure these emissions are substantially reduced. This investment will make it a more environmentally friendly station and means we will be able to utilise the coal reserve which is there in abundance. This will enable Moneypoint to continue producing electricity in an efficient and effective manner for the foreseeable future, at least for the next 25 years.</P>
      <P>Given the changes that have taken place in legislation and in terms of the entire approach to energy requirements, it is opportune and timely for the Government to consider the establishment of an energy agency on a statutory basis. It is necessary to have an overall view, apart from the economic view that would have chiefly comprised the financial considerations of bodies such as the ESB in the past. In the main, Governments got their energy policies from the ESB. An energy agency is required to oversee an energy policy that will deal with issues such as solar cell development, wave and hydro power, and wind energy, which is advancing very slowly, mainly because of some objections to the development of wind stations in the last several years.</P>
      <P>It was observed in this House some days ago that Sweden intends to eliminate entirely its dependence on oil. It has already substantially reduced its dependence from some 80% 20 years ago to approximately 20%. The speaker on that occasion was careful not to mention nuclear energy. The reality, however, is that Sweden has a number of nuclear stations generating electricity, although it has decided to phase out nuclear energy by approximately 2010. It seems certain, moreover, that the Irish public will continue to reject a nuclear dimension here.</P>
      <P>From both an ecological and environmental perspective, we must consider the issues relating to energy production and plan our policies in that regard. Senator Quinn mentioned the research done in Denmark in regard to wave power generation. Substantial and detailed research work has been done on the west coast of Clare by Limerick University and other institutions. A project was identified with the support of Scottish company Powergen to develop a wave station adjacent to Kilkee in west Clare. Funding of &pound;1 million sterling was set aside for that project but it was unwisely withdrawn. I appeal to the Minister of State to put it back on the agenda and to commence work on it from where it had finished.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>An issue arose whether the project was an economically viable proposition or a research study that was being developed. Whether it was to be undertaken for research or economic purposes, the conditions are suitable off Tullig, near Kilkee in west Clare for a wave station that would generate substantial amounts of energy at competitive prices and that would feed into the grid. People who visit west Clare, including Senator O&rsquo;Toole, are familiar with Tillig in the west Clare peninsula <Col N="1398"/>which is adjacent to the Moneypoint station. The national grid has a presence there. An investment of &pound;1 million sterling for that station was mooted four or five years ago and there is no reason the provision of a station could not proceed.</P>
      <P>Immediate efforts should be made to resurrect this project that was abandoned a few years ago. It was not the recommendation of the Department or the EU but of an outside agency that the project should not be funded in the manner proposed but should be done some other way. In any event, it transpired that it was not funded and we are much worse off as a result. It is timely to review the project.</P>
      <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole will be aware that a number of years ago it was proposed to build a station on Tountinna, the mountain overlooking the lake by Killaloe and Lough Derg similar to that on Turlough Hill. Tountinna would be suitable for such a station because it is adjacent to the lake and there are ample water supplies. Such a station would generate electricity from the natural resources and would only require limited imported products. A detailed analysis of the site was carried out a number of years ago before the ESB wisely decided to proceed with the station at Moneypoint. A practical decision has been made by the ESB to clean up its act at Moneypoint, which it is about to start.</P>
      <P Just="Left">While we have been dependent on oil and gas we will have to reduce our dependency on oil as it is becoming increasingly short in supply, even though some oil has been found off the west Clare coastline, off Spanish Point. I do know whether it is oil that has been there since the wrecks of the Spanish Armada fleet. The indications are that there is a substantial oil find in the vicinity of Spanish Point.</P>
      <P Just="Left">It is important that an energy agency is established. If there is to be exploitation of oil or gas off the west Clare coastline, detailed work must be done to ensure that we do not find ourselves in a position similar to that we faced in Rossport. It is necessary to examine all related aspects before decisions are made to exploit such resources. If we have a valuable asset, it must be exploited in a careful manner without upsetting the sensibilities and sensitivities of a sensitive part of County Clare that I represent.</P>
      <P Just="Left">It is timely and opportune for the Government to establish an energy agency that would develop an energy policy and not have to rely on the advice from what are essentially commercial bodies, unlike the ESB. While the ESB has done a good job since it was established, time has moved on and new energy challenges face this country. There were major objections to the notion of incineration. Members who spoke about the experience of incineration in Sweden would be well advised to note how incineration has been used in Sweden for district heating. Those who criticised the development of incineration in Sweden need to examine more closely <Col N="1399"/>what is happening there because it is much different from the view they presented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and congratulate him on his re-appointment to this political position. He has taken on an important task.</P>
      <P>I concur with everything that was said on all sides of the House and I agree very much with what Senator Daly said about the need to have a strong, politically driven energy agency. While we have groups such as Sustainable Energy Ireland we need to take on board the energy debate at a much higher level. There were times in the 1980s and 1990s when a senior Minister had responsibility for energy. At this crucial point in the energy debate, consideration of energy resources into the future must be given the highest political attention. Following the next election, I hope the Government elected will appoint a senior Minister to preside over a full-scale energy Department. With energy consumption having increased dramatically in recent decades and the threat posed to our oil and gas supplies, we have to come up with alternatives. While significant work has been done on this we are not yet getting results.</P>
      <P>I welcome the measures in this area announced in budget but we need to take the debate further. The grants scheme referred to by the Minister of State needs to be introduced at the earliest possible opportunity. It should commence in terms of domestic houses. Significant grant aid should be given for the use of solar panels and geothermal units, which are practical and useful units that are used widely throughout Europe. We should strongly promote the use of those products here.</P>
      <P>I concur with what Senator Quinn said about the farmland of Ireland and how it could be turned into an oil well &mdash; pardon the pun. We could grow crops for biofuels, especially in north Cork where the future of the sugar industry is under the gravest threat. I hope the Minister of State, in conjunction with his ministerial colleague in the Department of Agriculture and Food, is examining alternative options for sugar beet production. Sugar beet can be used for the production of biofuel and that option must be given serious consideration.</P>
      <P>I hope that energy is given much greater political attention. I also hope that a grants scheme will be put in place to encourage domestic households and those building houses to invest in alternative energy technology. I further hope the Minister of State and his ministerial colleague in the Department of Agriculture and Food are examining all the options in terms of biofuels, biodiesel and bioethanol with a view to ensuring that Irish farms can grow crops for all types of fuels in the near future and for them to be processed here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">
        
        I congratulate the Minister of State on his new responsibilities, wish him well in his position and welcome him to the House. I would like to pick up on a number of points made by Senator Bradford. Good ideas have emerged in this debate but progress will not be made on them without the necessary political push. I remember a time when grants were awarded for work carried out to houses that the State wanted done. We had a long discussion on planning yesterday, an issue in which we are all interested. Would it not be a good idea if certain initiatives were tied to planning granted for single unit housing, given that many people object to the building of such units? What would be wrong with a decision at national level that every single unit house development &mdash; any person building a house on his or her own site &mdash; would be required to provide a solar panel for water heating? That would not be an expensive inclusion in the cost of building a house. While it is expensive to fit retrospectively, it would be a reasonable provision when building a house. Every new house should have a 1 KW wind energy generator on the roof.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State correctly said that it is difficult to gauge the use of wind energy. The reason one cannot depend on wind energy, according to the ESB, is that for every watt that is potentially produced from wind energy, one must have an equal amount waiting in storage for the day the wind is not blowing. The way one deals with this is to have wind farms all over the country. Some 90% of the time there is wind blowing some place in Ireland and if the wind turbines are interconnected and we look at the 90% of the potential which will always be available, this could be tied into the grid.</P>
      <P Just="Left">People will say that the other big problem with wind farms is the cost of connecting up to the grid and the establishment of a substation. Senator Bradford spoke about farmers. If farmers were encouraged to install single, old-fashioned 500 wind generators, those generators, as far as I know, can connect straight into the grid without a substation. That is something that farmers, in particular, could do. In the past couple of months I have spoken to people from the IFA who feel that it is something worth developing. I spoke to a man from the IFA from the Minister of State, Deputy Browne&rsquo;s, county who has been investigating that particular matter. He was one of the beet farmers. The Minister of State probably knows the man; I cannot recall his name. He was dependent on beet and he is certainly working on that particular issue at present.</P>
      <P>I am sorry I missed the beginning of the Minister of State&rsquo;s speech. Approximately six months ago a decision was taken whereby the regulator would not accept any proposals for connection to the national grid for the next two years. Unless there is a good reason for it, that is regressive. It should not be happening.</P><Col N="1401"/>
      <P>A grant should be available for people who put up a wind generator and a solar panel in their homes, as long as they are properly fitted and will save us all money in the long term. We should have a strategic policy to be energy independent within a certain number of years. There is the Government&rsquo;s commitment to increase green electricity to 13% of total consumption by 2010. That is a worthwhile goal. Despite the fact that many of us had doubts about this three years ago, the Government is to be complimented on moving this forward.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I ask the Minister of State to take this point and I do not mind being quoted on it. While I would consider myself to be a conservationist and to be greener than most who label themselves green, it is utter selfishness for people to object to wind farms on the basis that they might spoil the view for a few of us living on the east coast who take trips to the west. It is such an environment-friendly kind of generation. It does not hurt the environment. It does not create any pollution. It is completely clean. The only difficulty is that it spoils the view. We should make a decision that we can live with that as long as it is done in a controlled way. I would hope that that comes under what comes under what is being published today in the Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Bill because wind farms are a crucial part of our strategic infrastructure for the future.</P>
      <P>The development of energy from biomass and wood pellets has advanced by leaps and bounds in the past couple of years. Many farmers who are experiencing difficulty in growing crops and getting adequate prices should be encouraged to diversify into biomass, in the form of growing trees that will be cut down and used for wood pellets, in those counties where that can be done efficiently and where a market can be created for them. As many Senators have stated already, energy based on ethanol, rape seed oil and various other oils should be encouraged as well.</P>
      <P>I would also ask the Minister of State to keep a close eye on the question of excise duty. As far as I am aware, the lifting of the excise duty was done on a temporary basis. It should be made clear that duty will not be reapplied for this reason, so that people can plan. I have spoken to farmers, again in the Minister of State&rsquo;s part of the country but not in his county, in the south-east, who are involved in the creation of biodiesel. Their problem is they cannot get farmers to commit, particularly after the beet debacle, to change their entire operation to get into the development of this area in the fear that the civil servants over in Merrion Street will reapply the excise duty in a couple of years time. The Government should at least state it will not be touched for another ten years so that people can plan and get into it. These are reasonable and sensible suggestions.</P>
      <P>We can justify many of the single house developments if we tie in certain measures like wind <Col N="1402"/>energy, solar panels and the other system which has not been developed in this country in recent times, micro-hydroelectricity. We all learned 20 or 30 years ago that we have harnessed the vast preponderance of what is available in hydroelectric energy. While that was the truth of it, new efficiencies have been created in this area with new micro-hydroelectric generators; even quite small streams and rivers can feed energy into the national grid. I saw what was available on Google and they exist in all shapes and sizes.</P>
      <P>We should have a structured approach to wind farming. The Government made a change in that regard in the Finance Bill three years ago to make it more difficult to develop wind energy and other alternative energies. We should put that back the way it was previously and we should encourage people to get involved in this. This is our security. I note that the main part of the Minister of State&rsquo;s speech correctly looked at the security and independence of our fuel supply. That is of significant importance and there is no gainsaying that. That we have gone into amber territory on a number of occasions recently is worrying. If we are to become independent of other countries&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;or reduce our dependence on other countries, we must open up any financial blocks. Thank you, a Chathaoirligh. I am sorry for exceeding my time. I wish the Minister of State, Deputy Browne, good luck in his new Ministry. Let us hope he will return with news of grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>In welcoming the Minister of State, Deputy Browne, to the House, I congratulate him on his new appointment. It is an area with which he has a considerable amount of familiarity and no doubt he will do an excellent job as he has done in many other Departments.</P>
      <P>This debate is welcome at this stage because I sense a considerable change in approach to the oil industry. The US President spoke about the fact that our society was addicted to oil in his recent state of the union address and that is a considerable shift. Recognising the role the Americans play throughout the world in setting the stage for what happens internationally, change is on the way, particularly given this statement from a US President with a significant interest in the oil industry. There is now a serious recognition that oil reserves will be depleted within a measurable timeframe.</P>
      <P>There are many alternatives, some of which have been mentioned. Certainly the generation of energy from the tide is an area which needs to be researched and on which more money needs to be spent. This will have to come from Government level, rather than expecting the operators to do it. The operators are running ahead with the <Col N="1403"/>system they know. They have done some work on wind but whereas they believe that to some extent is the panacea, I do not think it is. I would support a pilot project on energy generation from the tides in the Shannon Estuary. Due to the volumes of water in the area, it is an ideal location. Such a project would not have any effect on the shipping lanes in the area and would certainly get the support of other Senators.</P>
      <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole spoke at length about biomass. The Minister of State, Deputy Browne, in his former role, visited County Clare to launch a biomass project and heard at first hand the reaction of an industry that was prepared to look at it as a method of generating energy. They wanted an assurance that they would have continuity of supply so that if they made the investment in the boilers, which I understand is considerable at a sum in excess of &euro;100,000, the supply would be available. The day the Minister of State spoke to the farmers it was clear they wanted assistance in terms of grants to ensure they could continue because the transportation costs of bringing the raw material to the biomass burner is considerable and would need Government support. As Minister of State in the Department of Agriculture and Food, Deputy Browne, had experience of working with many of the forestry farmers. He did excellent work there in terms of reinstating some of the grants associated with the thinning. It is really the thinning from forestry that will be used for biomass energy. Timber is a cash crop and one would not want the entire crop reduced to producing pellets. It is the thinnings and cut-aways that are relevant. The Minister of State has a clear grasp of that and I hope he will bring it to bear in his new Department. Further research on biomass is required.</P>
      <P>Another area is causing a number of problems for us. The underlying theory in the planning process is that it is necessary to reduce the number of one-off houses, because dispersed housing will not be sustainable if people have no access to oil and cannot travel into villages for services. That is not a good way to proceed.</P>
      <P>While all agree oil is disappearing and we must therefore conserve energy by changing our lifestyle, we should look to alternatives in the transport sector, such as electricity. There has not been enough research into this alternative. There is no reason Ireland could not lead research on the concept of electric vehicles.</P>
      <P>This could achieve two ends. We regularly speak in the House about road deaths and the speed of petrol-fuelled cars which are capable of travelling far above the speed limits. We are told the disadvantage of electric vehicles is that they can only do 50 mph or 60 mph. That is close enough to the speed limit. The end of the era of oil might not be a bad thing. Maybe we will start to travel at speeds that are allowed on our roads and solve two problems. A great deal more money needs to be spent on research in this area. <Col N="1404"/>While there is doubt about whether an electric engine is capable of driving a heavy goods vehicle that could be resolved over time.</P>
      <P>Those are my main points. Many of the other points I intended making have already been made and I do not wish to be repetitive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Browne, to the House and congratulate him on his reassignment of responsibility for marine affairs in the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources. I welcome too his senior staff from the Department. I hope the Minister of State will also be given responsibility for energy policy because he has wide experience in forestry and related issues.</P>
      <P>Sustainable energy is safe, clean and a natural resource. It does not exploit countries or individuals. It gives security and peace of mind to individuals, communities and countries. Once installed, it is cost-effective to run and addresses fuel poverty.</P>
      <P>In 1997 the Kyoto Protocol was established and EU states agreed to a target of 8% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Ireland was allowed an increase in emissions of 13% above 1990 levels in view of its economic status as a developing economy; emissions were 27% above 1990 levels in 2002.</P>
      <P>Renewable energy sources include wind energy, biomass, wave and tidal current, small hydro, geothermal, solar or heat pump and cross-sector actions. I welcome the announcement by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, in this year&rsquo;s budget of excise relief for biofuels and vehicle registration tax relief for vehicles capable of running on biofuels.</P>
      <P>The most recent projections by the US Geological Survey are that oil supply will peak by 2037, and will decline to virtually zero by the end of this century. We are facing great uncertainty with which we must deal. That forecast does not allow for further unrest in the Middle East or the situation in Iraq.</P>
      <P>The depletion of oil reserves necessitates a revolution in our approach to energy policy, and it is vital that this revolution begin immediately. It concerns me that the announced measures have not been fully implemented as yet, and I call on the Minister to ensure that we do all we can to encourage the use of biofuel. Germany has become the world&rsquo;s biggest producer of biodiesel, and the German Government has committed itself to the conversion of 200,000 farms to the exclusive production of biofuel, while France already produces over 500,000 tonnes of biofuel annually.</P>
      <P>In Ireland we have the capacity to produce significant amounts of biofuel. Sadly, we are lagging behind our European counterparts, as biofuel accounts for only 1% of our energy consumption. This situation must change.</P>
      <P>All diesel engines can run on a blend of 5% biofuel and 95% diesel, and many modern diesel <Col N="1405"/>engines can run on 100% biofuel with no modification whatsoever. There is no reason for farmers not to grow and produce sufficient fuel to power their own machinery, if sufficient incentives were in place to encourage this approach.</P>
      <P>We should not forget that biofuel can be only one strand of our energy policy for the future. Even if we converted our entire farm production to biofuel, we would meet only a fraction of our energy requirements. Our electricity generation capacity depends heavily on imported fossil fuels, leaving us vulnerable to fluctuations in supply, as well as prices, that will inevitably spiral as fuel becomes more scarce. Only by fully exploring all possibilities for the production of sustainable energy can the Government secure the future of our energy supply.</P>
      <P>In Finland, 22% of energy is renewable and in Denmark, 27% of the energy requirement is generated from wind. We have a similar climate in Ireland and would equally have this capacity for wind energy generation. We need to develop a 20-year plan with specific renewable targets up to 2026.</P>
      <P>The last three recessions in the world were caused by sharp increases in oil prices. Oil is now a scarce commodity and when it reaches $100 a barrel, we will not be able to afford it. The problem with renewable energy is that the start-up costs are prohibitive. The new grants scheme will make renewable energy a feasible and real option for people building their homes.</P>
      <P>The civic building in Tralee, County Kerry, is heated by geothermal energy. We need to build on the capacity of the national grid to create self-sustainability for future generations. Renewable energy is not just a price decision, it is a life decision. People desire to be independent from the fluctuations in world oil prices, etc., and renewable energy gives them this independence and security. Building sustainable communities and protecting the environment are key elements of Government policy.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The European Union target is to double the contribution of renewable energy sources from 6% to 12% of total energy consumption by the year 2010. This target is stated in the Commission&rsquo;s 1997 White Paper for a Community strategy and action plan, Energy for the Future: Renewable Sources of Energy.</P>
      <P>The Green Paper on Sustainable Energy was launched on 20 September 1999. The policy document includes an increased target of 500 MW of electricity generation capacity from renewable energy sources in the period 2000-05. This report should be reconsidered in light of present circumstances.</P>
      <P>The bulk of the capacity is expected to come from wind energy. Other measures designed to accelerate the development of renewable energy in the Green Paper include the following: establishment of a renewable energy strategy group to examine all aspects of, and obstacles to, the further deployment of renewable energy <Col N="1406"/>technologies; a modified AER scheme; encouragement of community-based renewable energy development; provision for the sale of electricity generated from renewable sources directly to final customers; continuation of the existing tax relief measure; and consideration of other measures in the context of green taxes in future budgets. A revitalised approach to the promotion of research into the development of renewable sources of energy is also envisaged.</P>
      <P>I call on the Minister of State to put the grants announced in the budget in place forthwith. Numerous projects are on hold pending the decision on, and announcement of, the details of the renewable energy project announced in the budget. It is vital to bring this forward as quickly as possible. Hundreds of houses await the decision to develop this scheme. The grants will be very attractive. Some of the projects under way should be included in this grant scheme.</P>
      <P>I have contacted senior officials in the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources and the documentation is not yet finalised. The cluster scheme of ten operates effectively and the grant scheme has worked in that regard. Local authorities must be more conscious of the benefits of providing alternative energy for their houses. The budget has created the opportunity and I call on the new Minister of State to take a personal interest in this issue and produce the details in the next week or two. There is no reason for such a delay between the Government decision in the budget last December and the present. Why does it take so long for details to be announced to enable people proceed with projects which are on hold, pending the decision on the level of grant aid?</P>
      <P Just="Left">This is an important debate which should be held again. Energy is vital for the future of the country. The Minister of State&rsquo;s appointment will assist in realising the potential in growing more products that can produce oil. He is the right man in the right place at the right time. I wish him every success in the next general election after which he will be back in Government.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank all Senators for their contributions to this timely debate which has produced many good constructive ideas from all sides of the House. I thank in particular Senators Finucane and Kenneally for their contributions.</P>
      <P>Continuity of supply was identified as the priority. The Minister and the Department have been working long before I came to the Department to ensure this will continue. The country&rsquo;s <Col N="1407"/>economy is doing very well and it is important to have continuity of supply in the future so that those in business will have confidence in a continuity of supply.</P>
      <P>I will refer the points raised by the Senators to the Minister, who, along with me and the departmental officials will consider some of the worthwhile suggestions made. Senator Finucane raised the matter of the Deloitte &amp; Touche report which is currently being considered in the context of the Department&rsquo;s work to develop an energy policy. The policy paper should be available later in the year. I will bring to the attention of the Minister the Senator&rsquo;s request that the report be made public. Knowing the Minister, I doubt if he would have a problem with doing so because he acts in an up-front manner when dealing with issues.</P>
      <P>Senator Daly referred to the establishment of an energy agency. As I only joined the Department yesterday I am not sure if this is being considered but I will bring it to the attention of the Minister.</P>
      <P>A number of Senators raised the issue of biofuels. The EU does not permit any tax relief package to exceed six years in duration so a ten year commitment, as suggested, is not possible. The Government has allowed for a five-year package and is considering all policy options for the development of the sector. The subject of biomass was referred to by a number of Senators. As I have lately come from the Department of Agriculture and Food, I have been very involved in this area and in the area of afforestation. A total of 93% of afforestation is now carried out by farmers and it has become an important alternative crop for them.</P>
      <P>This year the Minister for Finance allocated &euro;137 million for forestry, the highest allocation ever. My only regret is I had not allocated the grant before I left the Department of Agriculture and Food but that will be the responsibility of the Minister, Deputy Coughlan and the Minister of State, Deputy Mary Wallace. They are considering a number of initiatives in the area of biomass. Johnstown Castle in my home county is in the process of being developed as a pilot centre for wood-burning boilers. As Senator Leyden stated, a number of local authority housing schemes are being heated by wood-burning boilers.</P>
      <P>The Wexford county manager informed me that two new housing schemes are being heated using wood pellets. An interdepartmental group produced biomass and alternative energy policies. The Department of Agriculture and Food, in conjunction with my Department, will shortly announce a number of packages.</P>
      <P>Senator Quinn raised a number of issues to do with continuity of supply and the future role of the regulator which was also raised by other Senators. Regulatory bodies have become the norm. In the past, people did not trust the Minister of the day to make decisions and regulators were established. I agree that the role of the regu<Col N="1408"/>lator needs to be reviewed on an ongoing basis and I will bring this issue to the attention of the Minister.</P>
      <P>The matter of grants for renewable energy in the domestic sector was raised by a number of Senators. A multi-annual finance package of &euro;65 million from 2006-10, was announced in the budget. This package will include grants to householders to install renewable energy technology such as solar power &mdash; which was raised by Senator O&rsquo;Toole &mdash; biomass boilers and geothermal heat pumps. The scheme is being developed and will be launched soon.</P>
      <P>I acknowledge the point made by Senator Leyden that the development is too slow but the budget was only announced last December and it is now early February. The Minister and his officials have carried out significant work in this area and the launch will occur shortly. This initiative complements similar funding programmes for housing developers run by Sustainable Energy Ireland.</P>
      <P>The energy performance and buildings directive has been implemented by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and includes new building standards for all buildings which will improve their energy performance. All large-scale buildings will be required to consider using renewable energy.</P>
      <P>All speakers referred to biofuels. Under EU rules, the Government is not permitted to insist that all petrol and diesel sold should contain a percentage of biofuels. However, biofuel suppliers can be obliged to place a percentage of biofuels per annum on the market. A number of member states have opted for this policy but it would take considerable time to establish such a system. The Department is examining all policy options, in close consultation with other relevant Departments and member states.</P>
      <P>The new excise relief package for biofuels will cost &euro;205 million over a five-year period. It is hoped this will encourage the development of indigenous biofuel plants. Their programme will be underpinned by capital grant aid for processing facilities and will commence this year.</P>
      <P>When the Minister and I made a case to the Minister for Finance, we were pushing an open door. He is very committed to the area of alternative energy and the biofuels sector. If there is a demand for the package announced in the budget, we will be in a position to rely on the co-operation of the Minister for Finance. He recognises that the dependence on imported gas and oil is not ideal. As Senators Quinn and Kenneally said, the long-term future needs must be considered.</P>
      <P>The problem with nitrates was first raised in 1991 but it was put on the long finger and then came the day of reckoning. We must make long-term decisions about alternative fuels and this is the Minister&rsquo;s intention.</P>
      <P>Senator Ulick Burke raised the issue of Gama. The new 384 MW power station in County <Col N="1409"/>Galway has been constructed following an open competition conducted by CER for the provision of new generating capacity for the security of supply of electricity. Tynagh Energy and Aughinish Alumina were the two winners of the competition. I wish to make it clear that it was an open competition and that Aughinish Alumina and Tynagh Energy were the successful bidders.</P>
      <P>A number of Senators referred to farming opportunities using alternative crops. Having just left the Department of Agriculture and Food, I know that the Minister, Deputy Coughlan, is working closely with farm organisations to see how they can develop new alternative crops. The beet industry is under pressure along with other areas and the Minister is working closely on those matters. We must recognise the fact, however, that farmers will only grow crops if they get a viable return. I am familiar with oil seed rape and a number of companies in Wexford are working in conjunction with farmers to produce biofuels from that crop. However, the amount of money that is available from Europe for this endeavour, at &euro;45 per hectare, is much too low. In view of the curtailment or death of the beet industry, the Minister, Deputy Coughlan, is working closely with Europe to try to obtain an increase in that figure to make it viable for farmers to produce oil seed rape.</P>
      <P>I thank Senators for their contributions to this debate. I will certainly take up a number of the issues they have raised today consider them with my officials. We do not have a monopoly on wisdom as to how the alternative energy sector will develop in future and, consequently, we are interested in listening to what people have to say in this regard.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I wish to thank my officials for giving me sound advice on this debate and in other areas that are coming to the forefront concerning alternative energy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science, Deputy de Valera, and her officials to the House. Before us is a Seanad Bill amended by the D&aacute;il. In accordance with Standing Order 103 it is deemed to have passed its First, Second and Third Stages in the Seanad and is placed on the Order Paper for Report Stage. On the question &ldquo;That the Bill be received for final consideration&rdquo;, the Minister of State may explain the purpose of the amendment made by the D&aacute;il. This is looked upon as the report of the D&aacute;il amendment to the Seanad. For Senators&rsquo; convenience I have arranged for the printing and circulation of this amendment. I remind Senators that the only <Col N="1410"/>matter that may be discussed is the amendment made by the D&aacute;il.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be received for final consideration.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
	<P>As Senators will be aware, the Minister for Education and Science brought the University College Galway (Amendment) Bill 2005 before this House on 14 December 2005. This Bill amends the University College Galway Act 1929 to remove the requirement to appoint candidates competent in the Irish language to offices or positions in the university. It replaces this requirement with an obligation to ensure that the strategic development plan of the university contains a provision for the delivery of education through the Irish language. The president and governing authority of the university are obliged under this provision to ensure that this aim is implemented.</P>
      <P>On Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il on 9 February 2006 the Minister for Education and Science proposed one amendment to the wording of the published Bill. The amendment will require the university to ensure that one of its principal aims in its future strategic development plans will be the provision of education through the medium of Irish. The wording in the original Bill stated that one of the aims of the university in its future strategic development plans will be the provision of education through the medium of Irish. This amendment strengthens the original wording of the Bill in that it will now be a principal aim of the university to ensure that its strategic development plans prioritise the provision of education through the Irish language.</P>
      <P>The university already has a long and proud tradition in the provision of Irish language courses and I am satisfied that this Bill places an adequate onus on it to ensure this continues to be the case. I am confident this amendment strikes the correct balance between the continuation of NUIG&rsquo;s role in the promotion of the Irish language and the need to ensure that NUIG can fulfil the role which higher education institutions are required to play in the realisation of national economic and social development.</P>
      <P>Knowledge is international and intellectual capital is highly mobile in nature. The quality of higher education in Ireland is now measured against the highest standards across the world. In competing internationally, it is counter-productive in the extreme to place limitations on the ability of one of our key institutions to attract the best available international research or teaching talent. In that context the requirements set down by the 1929 Act are no longer relevant. They represent an outdated and unfair impediment on NUl Galway in seeking to develop international standard excellence in research and teaching. If NUl Galway is to develop to its full potential in the 21st century knowledge era, it needs to be <Col N="1411"/>free to attract and appoint the very best academics and researchers.</P>
      <P>I know that NUl Galway strongly welcomes this legislation. It reflects the unique historical commitment of the college to the promotion of the language while providing it with the necessary freedoms to successfully compete in the national and international recruitment markets. It is an important piece of modernising legislation for NUl Galway. It underlines the strong commitment of the college to the promotion of our native language and reflects the progressive position of the language in the wider legislative and public policy context. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFeighan"><NameTxt>Mr. Feighan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome this Bill. It is helpful to replace the particular requirement with an obligation that the strategic development plan of the university contains a provision for the delivery of education through the Irish language. I thank the Minister of State for attending the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State and I welcome the bringing of this Bill to its conclusion in the Seanad. We were delighted to have this Bill initiated in the Seanad, and we noted on Second Stage that it represented another milestone in achievement for NUI, Galway, a very important one in the middle of the college&rsquo;s second strategic programme for development.</P>
      <P>NUI Galway is very forward-looking and progressive and the obligations on it belonged to an era in the past. They were serving no useful purpose for the promotion of the Irish language or for enabling the college to reach out and realise its vision of the provision of excellence and the securing of the best talents and intellectual capacity available around the world, which will allow it to make a very worthwhile contribution to the economic and social development of this country. The university has made its mark in a very formidable way since the Act of 1929. The legislation is sensible and progressive and I am sure nobody in this House has any quibble with the amendment being introduced.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Education and Science rightly brought forward an amendment which emphasises and puts into legislation the principal dimension of the promotion of the Irish language through NUI Galway courses and we welcome that. I thank the Minister of State and the Minister for the speedy progression of this legislation through Houses.</P>

T&aacute; m&eacute; s&aacute;sta tac&uacute; leis an reachta&iacute;ocht seo, &oacute;s rud &eacute; go bhfuil s&iacute; t&aacute;bhachtach agus praitici&uacute;il. Bh&iacute; an-bhr&uacute; ar an ollscoil go dt&iacute; seo ag fost&uacute; daoine mar bh&iacute; iachall orthu Gaeilge den scoth a bheith acu. R&oacute;mhinic, n&iacute; raibh an caighde&aacute;n sin Gaeilge ag daoine, go speisialta iad si&uacute;d as an iasacht agus n&iacute; <Col N="1412"/>raibh an ollscoil in ann postanna a thabhairt d&oacute;ibh. Bh&iacute; all sorts of difficulties aici idir an d&aacute; linn agus bh&iacute; s&iacute; os comhair na c&uacute;irte n&iacute;os minice n&aacute; uair amh&aacute;in nuair a chuir daoine ina haghaidh.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Bh&iacute; na various Irish language groups on the east coast who are very slow to see practical approaches to the Irish language corraithe faoin mBille seo cionn is nach mbeadh t&uacute;s &aacute;ite ag an nGaeilge a thuilleadh in Ollscoil na Gaillimhe agus chuir s&eacute; isteach orthu. T&aacute; seo i bhfad n&iacute;os t&aacute;bhachta&iacute; don Ghaeilge n&aacute; aon rud a bh&iacute; ann roimhe seo. Go dt&iacute; anois, c&eacute; go raibh ar dhuine a bheith in ann Gaeilge a labhairt sula bhfaigheadh s&eacute; n&oacute; s&iacute; jab san ollscoil, n&iacute; raibh aon bhr&uacute; n&oacute; aon fhreagracht ina dhiaidh sin ar an gcol&aacute;iste f&eacute;in an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn.</P>
      <P>T&aacute; s&eacute; an-t&aacute;bhachtach anois go bhfuil s&eacute; mar cheann de phr&iacute;omhaidhmeanna an chol&aacute;iste an Ghaolainn a chur chun cinn. Is m&oacute;r an trua &eacute; nach mbeadh an dearcadh praitici&uacute;il c&eacute;anna ar gach gn&eacute; de pholasa&iacute; an Rialtais i dtaobh na Gaolainne. Inn&eacute; sa Teach eile, bh&iacute;os ag &eacute;isteacht leis an Aire Gn&oacute;tha&iacute; Pobail, Tuaithe agus Gaeltachta, an Teachta &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, a bh&iacute; ag cur le liosta na gcomhlachta&iacute; a mbeadh orthu as seo amach a gcuid tuairisc&iacute; bliant&uacute;la a fhoilsi&uacute; i nGaolainn. Ba bhre&aacute; an rud &eacute; a bheith ag &eacute;isteacht leis agus a fheice&aacute;il c&eacute; chomh t&aacute;bhachtach agus a bh&iacute; s&eacute; seo. Do chuir s&eacute; isteach orm, agus bh&iacute; m&eacute; buartha go m&oacute;r agus m&eacute; ag &eacute;isteacht leis. Bh&iacute; s&eacute; an-t&aacute;bhachtach, de r&eacute;ir dealraimh, go mbeimis in ann teacht ar the National Roads Authority&rsquo;s tuarasc&aacute;il bhl&iacute;ant&uacute;il in a lovely glossy presentation ach go bhfuil s&eacute; i nGaolainn.</P>
      <P>Ar an taobh eile den sc&eacute;al, t&aacute; m&uacute;inteoir&iacute; tr&iacute;d an t&iacute;r, i ngach cuid di, Gaeltachta&iacute;, Galltacht agus Gaelscoileanna ina measc, ag iarraidh ceachtanna a mh&uacute;ineadh gan aon t&eacute;acsanna Gaolainne a bheith acu. I cannot for the life of me understand how it is more important to a Government that the National Roads Authority&rsquo;s report and Government strategic plans should be produced in Irish when no one cares &mdash; I will not say what was in my mind &mdash; about schools trying to teach Irish without Irish textbooks.</P>
      <P>Bh&iacute;os ag &eacute;isteacht leis an Aire inn&eacute;, agus bh&iacute; s&eacute; ag tabhairt ceacht staire d&uacute;inn ar Dingle, An Daingean, Daingean U&iacute; Ch&uacute;is, cad as a dt&aacute;inig siad, agus c&eacute; chomh t&aacute;bhachtach agus a bh&iacute; siad. That is fine. Bh&iacute; ceacht staire anseo, ach t&aacute; m&uacute;inteoir&iacute; ag iarraidh stair a mh&uacute;ineadh do rang 6 sna bunscoileanna gan t&eacute;acs Gaolainne staire a bheith ar f&aacute;il acu. That is despite the fact that c&uacute;pla bliain &oacute; shin tugadh all sorts of geall&uacute;int&iacute; d&uacute;inn that we would establish in west Cork &aacute;is nua a chuirfeadh ar f&aacute;il t&eacute;acsanna, leabhair agus gach rud a bheadh de dh&iacute;th ar mh&uacute;inteoir&iacute; agus ag teast&aacute;il uathu agus &oacute; scoileanna chun Gaolainn a chur chun cinn.</P>
      <P>However, it is the old story. We will do the whole glossy bit and see the National Roads Authority, the National Treasury Management Agency and the Government strategic policies publish in Irish, while no one cares that, where <Col N="1413"/>we are teaching in Irish, we cannot get our hands on Irish textbooks. It must be 24 times more important that we spend the money going to develop those documents on producing textbooks for primary and post-primary schools.</P>
      <P>If we have something left over, we should invest it in the provisions of this Bill for NUI, Galway, which has as a principal aim forbairt agus cur chun cinn na Gaolainne n&oacute; whatever the actual wording is, c&eacute; chomh t&aacute;bhachtach agus at&aacute; s&eacute;, agus t&aacute; an-jab ar si&uacute;l acu. They have a practical approach. They have outreach education acu si&uacute;d in &aacute;iteanna i gConamara agus, chomh maith leis sin, i dT&iacute;r Chonaill, &aacute;iteanna ar f&eacute;idir le daoine freastal ar ch&uacute;rsa&iacute; tr&iacute; mhe&aacute;n na Gaolainne.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Great work is also being done elsewhere. DCU in this city, for instance, has an accountancy course tr&iacute; Ghaoluinn.</P>
      <P Just="Left">That is what I want to see happen, namely, practical, sensible approaches. We must make Irish live, and it does not live on the other side of the National Roads Authority&rsquo;s annual report, since I do not know whether anyone will read it. I should say, before I get 24,000 telephone calls from those zealots who come back at me, that I am all for creating jobs making them available i nGaolainn, and the National Roads Authority being required to translate its report into Gaolainn. However, they can put that information up on the Internet. We need not publish it in hard copy, since it is enough if we have it available tr&iacute; Ghaolainn so that the translators and designers are kept in work without our wasting money producing stuff that will never be read.</P>
      <P>Ar an taobh eile den sc&eacute;al, we see an rud at&aacute; ar si&uacute;l anseo ag an ollscoil. They understand the importance, go m&oacute;rmh&oacute;r uachtar&aacute;n NUIG, an Dr. Iogn&aacute;id &Oacute; Muircheartaigh. Tuigeann s&eacute; an t&aacute;bhacht a bhaineann leis sin n&iacute;os fearr n&aacute; formh&oacute;r mhuintir na t&iacute;re seo. An rud a chuireann isteach orm n&aacute; that we are starting at the wrong end, c&eacute; go bhfuil s&eacute; chomh t&aacute;bhachtach sin, agus c&eacute; go dtaca&iacute;m go m&oacute;r leis. Is that not sad ar an l&aacute; a bhfuilimid anseo, when we are saying that promoting Irish should be one of the principal aims, although I totally support it? By the time students arrive at NUIG, they will have gone through primary and post-primary schools, where the teachers and management are trying to teach using English language textbooks.</P>
      <P>I had thought that day was gone. I attended school in Dingle i l&aacute;r na Gaeltachta and learned Latin through Irish from an English textbook. That is still going on. It was fine in those days when there was not a shilling around but given the amounts we are spending on other things, surely someone would say this is more important. Where is the hierarchy of importance? I could tell 24 stories about how centrally important and sensible this Bill is compared with some of the nonsense on the other side of the House.</P><Col N="1414"/>

It is his latest great plan. We have taken the most progressive move for many years and decided to recruit people from immigrant communities and newcomers into the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Everyone says that we must monitor them very closely and ensure they are the right people but that it is a brilliant idea. Cad a chualamar anois &oacute;n Aire Gn&oacute;tha&iacute; Pobail, Tuaithe agus Gaeltachta ach gur ch&oacute;ir iachall a chur ar gach duine acu, whether they be Chinese or whatever, that they complete a three-month intensive course in the Gaeltacht before they may be recruited into the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na?</P>

	<P>I listened to the speeches of the Minister and the Minister of State on this Bill. The issue then was the central importance of developing Irish in education and the community. I am not straying one word from that issue. If we are to develop these ideas, we must have central people who will stand up as Gaolainn, tr&iacute; Ghaolainn and le Gaolainn against zealots trying to destroy the language.</P>
      <P>The people who are taking all of the wrong decisions on the Irish language will be enjoying their pensions before the people see the death of the language as a consequence. The decision makers will turn people against Irish while people in the Gaeltacht must put up with what is left. Everyone I know in the Gaeltacht and education who cares about the Irish language would support the Bill. It is positive because it is proactive.</P>
      <P>One could ask a person from the west what is more important, making 100 different major public companies produce their annual reports through Irish or making Irish textbooks available.

	<P>I have raised this matter because Dromcollogher is an expanding community and I am aware of the housing implications of potential developments and an existing housing development there. Public-private partnerships are filling a vacuum regarding sewerage facilities. If a developer moves into a small village and decides to expand the scheme to embrace the village community a certain proportion of his or her costs are paid. It may not be suitable in all cases and a larger community, such as Dromcollogher, requires a dedicated sewerage scheme.</P>
      <P>In 1998, Limerick County Council requested permission to employ consultants for a preliminary report. The Department did not approve it at the time as Dromcollogher was number 16 on its priority listing. The scheme was not eligible for the 2000-02 programme or the subsequent programme. I am aware it was scheduled for the 2004-06 period but, to date, I am unsure of what progress has been made as it was bundled with other sewerage developments. I hope the Minister of State can indicate the status of the project, suggest when it will go through the required programme and indicate the likely target date for commencement, thereby allowing us to calculate a timeframe for conclusion.</P>
      <P>This will give some degree of optimism to the community as I recognise many other sewerage schemes, perhaps 22, are awaiting approval and are caught in the logjam of the current programme. No tangible construction phase has taken place and the sharing of information between the council and the Department must be examined.</P>
      <P>Speaking on radio, a Fianna F&aacute;il councillor was critical of the impediment sewerage schemes present to the development of housing. I agree with him but he placed much blame on the local authority and I am not sure this is correct. Progress is difficult considering the lengthy sequence of events that must be followed from the initial stages of a project to the commencement of work. I hope the Minister of State will give some indication when progress will be made on the sewerage scheme in Dromcollogher.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Finucane understands the history of this case. My Department is continuing to promote investment under the national development plan for the provision of modern environmental infrastructure to support social and economic objectives. Last December the Department published the Water Services Investment Programme 2005-07, consisting of almost 900 water and sewerage schemes at different stages of development.</P>
      <P>The programme includes funding for more than 20 schemes throughout Limerick, with a value of approximately &euro;158 million. Towns and villages like Adare, Patrickswell, Athea, Askeaton, Foynes, Glin, Shanagolden and Kilmallock can all look forward to new sewerage schemes. Many areas will also benefit from improved water supplies from the major upgrade planned for the Clareville water treatment plant, improvements to the Shannon Estuary water supply scheme and extensions of the Limerick county trunk water mains.</P>
      <P>Funding has also been set aside in the water services investment programme for the Dromcollogher sewerage scheme, which is being advanced as a grouped project with schemes at Hospital, Pallasgreen and Bruff. This substantial project, with an estimated cost of more than &euro;10 million, will provide new and upgraded sewage treatment and collection networks that will allow Dromcollogher and the other areas to develop their residential and commercial sectors in an environmentally-sustainable way.</P>
      <P>Limerick County Council originally submitted a brief for the appointment of consultants to prepare a preliminary report for the Dromcollogher scheme in June 1998, as Senator Finucane stated. The Department requested the council to submit an economic and environmental assessment of the scheme in July 1998 but this was not received. As a result, the proposal advanced no further at that stage.</P>
      <P>The scheme was 16th on the list of water and sewerage schemes submitted by the council in February 2000 in response to my Department&rsquo;s request to local authorities to undertake fresh assessments of the needs for capital works in their areas and to prioritise their proposals on the basis of the assessments. The priority lists were taken into account in the framing of the Water Services Investment Programme 2000-02 announced in July 2000. Given the priority rating afforded to the scheme by the council, the level of competing demand, and the funding available, it was not possible to include the scheme in that programme. However, the scheme was approved in a later phase of programme published in May 2004, after the council revised its priority list and upped the ranking of the Dromcollogher scheme to sixth place. A revised brief for the appointment of con<Col N="1417"/>sultants to prepare a preliminary report for the grouped project that the council subsequently submitted to the Department in April 2005 was approved in June 2005. I understand that Limerick County Council is finalising the arrangements for the appointment of the consultants for the project and that it will shortly be submitting the selected consultant&rsquo;s fee proposals and an economic assessment of the scheme to my Department for approval.</P>
      <P>The Department dealt promptly with all aspects of the scheme when they were submitted for approval. I have noted the case the Senator has made for the scheme to move ahead quickly and he can rest assured that the Department will give it the earliest possible attention when the proposals needed to advance it are received from the council. The Department understands that will happen soon.</P>
      <P>Action is being taken. I note what the Senator stated regarding the number of projects on the list. Various Members of both Houses discuss delays on projects. However, the money is being spent and progress is being made. If the Senator at any time feels that delays are caused within the Department, he should let someone in the Department know. A recent departmental circular stated that projects of less than &euro;5 million would be subject to a fast-track streamlined system. This is a larger project which covers more than Dromcollogher and so it must go through a more rigorous process.</P>
      <P>The Department reacts as quickly as possible. Sometimes we get blamed and sometimes we are responsible. However, on other occasions the delay is at county council level. I understand this project is due to be received soon and I hope we can progress it as quickly as possible. If Senator Finucane feels the Department is causing a delay at any stage, he should let me or the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State. It is regrettable that no reason was given for the economic assessment requested from the council in July 1998 not having been received. I do not know why the council did not acknowledge it. In his reply the Minister of State mentioned June 2005 regarding that economic assessment. It is a pity he did not receive that economic assessment a long time ago.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State stated the Department responds fairly rapidly. There appears to be a logjam at local authority level. I do not know whether it is the scale involved. Subsequent to initial approval of projects, the Department must revise everything again. Does the Minister for State know whether this project is grouped with Pallasgreen and Oola or two other locations?</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="1418"/>
    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not know what other projects are involved. It is grouped with Hospital, Pallasgreen and Bruff. My knowledge of the geography is limited. Is Oola on the Limerick road?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomMorrissey"><NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
	<P>It is on the Tipperary road.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for his latitude. Some sewerage schemes began as stand-alone projects. Afterwards, because of economics, local authorities decided to group them with projects in other areas. The Department had to reinvent the wheel in many cases and change everything. That accounts for many delays.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes. I do not suggest that everything comes out of the Department on housing or waste water in the same week as it is received. However, if the Senator can identify where the logjam is, he should by all means let us know. This case was way down the priority list. That may have been revised over the years because of pressure at local level. For good or bad, attempts are made to group projects and take them on a regional basis. When the Department receives notification of this project, I will discuss it with officials and try to push it along.</P>

    <Title>Dublin Port Tunnel.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="TomMorrissey"><NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for attending to reply to my motion on the Dublin Port tunnel. As we all know, the Dublin Port tunnel is a major infrastructure project for this country, and for this city in particular. Depending on what figures one reads, it is over budget or on budget, and it is either on time or over time. That is not what I want to raise today.</P>
      <P>I am raising the issue of the confidence and reassurance we must have that the specifications for what we are building are correct and that it is constructed according to those specifications. I received a press statement yesterday from Dublin City Council, stating that all is well and there is nothing to worry about. For any construction company to let somebody loose with a kango hammer near a membrane of a port tunnel seems to be careless in the extreme. When one views the television footage, one cannot have great confidence in the project.</P>
      <P>I want reassurance that when people use this tunnel after in opens in a few months time, any leaks will be properly and adequately dealt with. We all realise that water finds its own level and if there is a leak it will move on to the next weakest spot. It is quite alarming to hear that the initial problem in a major infrastructural project was due to the unsatisfactory thickness of cement in the walls and cavities. It calls into question the type of overseeing at the time of construction.</P>
      <P>The Department of Finance is strenuously examining whether to have a metro in the city <Col N="1419"/>and Transport 21 has given the go-ahead for one, which will require extensive tunnelling. We must have assurances that we have the experience and expertise to construct correctly any tunnels we build. As I stated, the Dublin City Council press statement, which perhaps was sent to the Minister of State&rsquo;s office as well as mine, seems to state we should not worry about this and that it will all be fixed in two weeks. If a membrane has been cracked, it will be difficult to repair it correctly, given the water leakage, and ensure that it cannot recur at that spot again.</P>
      <P>When one sees the level of scaffolding holding that membrane in place, one wonders whether it raises a health and safety issue. I asked Dublin City Council for an answer to that question. I have not received a reply. What assurances can the Minister for State give?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>On behalf of the Minister for Transport, I would like to point out that the planning, design and implementation of national road improvement projects, including the Dublin Port tunnel, is a matter for the National Roads Authority, NRA, and the local authorities concerned, in this case Dublin City Council. The Minister for Transport is, of course, anxious that the Dublin Port tunnel is completed as soon as possible and successfully commissioned into the overall road network for the Dublin area.</P>
      <P>As we know, the design and build contract was awarded in 2000 to Nishimatsu-Mowlem-lrishenco, NMI, a Japanese, British and Irish consortium. Construction supervision is provided by Brown and Root Limited, an internationally known company in that regard. The scheme is managed on site by a Dublin City Council team.</P>
      <P>The Dublin Port tunnel will run from the M1 motorway to Dublin Port. It is approximately 5.6 km in length, of which 4.5 km will be in tunnel. Progress continues to be made on the construction of the tunnel. The civil engineering work within the tunnel has now been largely completed and the main focus of work has shifted to the installation of the mechanical and electrical systems which make up the safety and control features of the project. The tunnel is expected to be completed and open later in the year. The total estimated cost remains at &euro;751 million, which has been the estimate for some time.</P>
      <P>As Dublin City Council has publicly stated, the tunnel is a major infrastructural project and its construction involves many challenges every day. The construction work has been monitored in detail since the project commenced in 2001. Design and construction is monitored by the construction supervisors appointed by Dublin City Council. When problems arise, as they inevitably and routinely do with projects of this size, the council and its construction supervisors ensure they are detected and rectified.</P><Col N="1420"/>
      <P>The Minister for Transport understands from Dublin City Council that the recent leaks are part and parcel of the issues that arise on large engineering projects such as the tunnel. If remedial measures are called for at any stage, the contractor is required to implement them at its own expense.</P>
      <P>The Minister also understands from Dublin City Council that contrary to the impression that may have been created, the leaks have no safety implications, either for the workers on the tunnel, for the structural integrity of the project or for the buildings and houses above the tunnel. Some people, including Members of the Oireachtas, who engage in scare tactics almost on a weekly basis in trying to promote themselves rather than anything else, should reflect on their words and how they might be perceived by those who live near the tunnel.</P>
      <P>The items in question do not have any cost implications for the project as they are being paid for by the contractor. Measures to remedy the leaks are ongoing with the support of specialist subcontractors and are expected to be completed within weeks.</P>
      <P>As a major new element in the road network, the Dublin Port tunnel will have a major beneficial impact on traffic flow in the Dublin area. It will be of particular benefit in facilitating improved access to the port for heavy goods vehicles while reducing HGV traffic from the city. The Government is conscious of the issues that will arise following the completion of the tunnel and pending the upgrade of the M50.</P>
      <P>The Minister and his Department are consulting with all stakeholders to ensure that a co-ordinated traffic management strategy is developed for the opening of the tunnel. As part of this process, the council is preparing a HGV traffic management plan to ensure optimum use of the tunnel.</P>
      <P>We talk all the time about the need for major infrastructural projects and we all accept they are required. We probably do not have a history of having so many of them. The reason they attract so much attention from the media and others is perhaps due to the novelty factor. These are major projects and small problems, such as this, arise presumably on an ongoing basis. Experts are carrying out the work and there are expert supervisors. I am sure they will get it right quickly. Some of these things look dramatic on television but I am inclined to think the attention is due to the novelty factor. Professional people are overseeing the work.</P>
      <P>The Senator mentioned the issue of health and safety. I visited the tunnel once and it seemed health and safety are given a high priority. There were many health and safety people around &mdash; perhaps too many. I look forward to later in the year when this project is finished. I hope we learn much from it and that when it comes to con<Col N="1421"/>structing the metro, we will have matured in our thinking rather than requiring that everything look wonderful from day one. This project is being professionally carried out and I hope it will be finished shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomMorrissey"><NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his reply. I could not but notice the sentence that the recent leaks are part and parcel of the issues that arise on large engineering projects such as the tunnel. Dublin City Council is on record as saying this problem arose because a jackhammer went through a membrane. I would not consider that to be part and parcel of the issues. That was the basis of my question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Professionals, including Tim Brick and his team of engineers, are working on this project. Brown and Root are the international supervisors of the work. The Minister is not supervising the project in person. Of course accidents should not happen but minor ones do. I am sure it can be put right. It is a matter of timing. I do not believe work on the tunnel has stopped as a result. The experts regard it as something which will be fixed in the coming weeks. It is not putting the tunnel in jeopardy or otherwise. Of course, people should be careful when using jackhammers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFeighan"><NameTxt>Mr. Feighan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Tim O&rsquo;Malley, and look forward to a favourable reply to this matter. Will he explain why Roscommon psychiatric foster care service is not receiving the necessary funding and support to continue the valued community-based facility? I am sure the Minister of State has become aware of many of these facilities over the years.</P>
      <P>Those who provide this service in the old Western Health Board area in County Roscommon are not getting the recognition they deserve. Over the years, people in psychiatric care have been sent out to the foster care service and at a time when there was less money in the country, those who provided the service, effectively, bailed out the health service. This was not a simple job and they cared for and fed and clothed people in their own home. They became part of the family.</P>
      <P>Those who provided the service put so much effort into extending their homes to ensure they reached a certain high standard. These people are now being cast aside despite the investment they made in terms of time, energy and finance over the years and the wonderful service they provided. I believe there is nearly a turf war in the health service and these people are being forgotten.</P>
      <P>It is unfortunate that I must raise this awkward and critical situation. However, this service was the way forward even though I know there is a new vision for psychiatric care. We cannot forget <Col N="1422"/>about these people who, during tough times, bailed out various Governments, health boards and, more importantly, the psychiatric services. We, and this Government, should not forget the sacrifice made and the work done by these people. Again, I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House and look forward to his reply. I want to ensure these people are not forgotten.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimOMalleyPD"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. T. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Feighan for raising this matter. The Roscommon mental health services have undergone significant changes over the past two decades. The move away from institutional care to community care has brought the mental health services in Roscommon closer to the service user. The move from hospital-based care to individualised care has empowered the user to take a more proactive role in their care and treatment. This has been further complemented by care and treatment being provided by multidisciplinary teams in partnership with other health care professionals and the voluntary agencies.</P>
      <P>The boarding out-foster care service to which the Senator referred provides accommodation and a normalised system of care for 21 people with mental health problems in the Roscommon mental health services catchment area. The programme, which commenced in 1980, has contributed to the provision of an independent life for those people living in the community.</P>
      <P>Some years ago, the Department of Health and Children agreed with the management of the former Western Health Board that the boarding out-foster care service in Roscommon would be phased out over the coming years, to be replaced by more appropriate arrangements. I understand the HSE is currently considering alternative options in respect of those persons receiving services under this scheme.</P>
      <P>The acute admission unit at Roscommon General Hospital opened in 1992. This was in response to Government policy on mental health as outlined in the 1984 document, Planning for the Future. I am informed that this was a major turning point for the Roscommon mental health services. As a result, St. Patrick&rsquo;s Hospital, Castlerea, was closed, community-based mental health services have expanded and a large range of treatment options for service users has been provided in the community.</P>
      <P>These changes have been in line with the model of service provision now recommended by the recently published report of the expert group on mental health policy, A Vision for Change. This report is the first comprehensive review of mental health policy since the publication of the document, Planning for the Future, in 1984. This report has been accepted by the Government as <Col N="1423"/>the basis for the future development of mental health policy.</P>
      <P>The report recommends that a programme of capital and non-capital investment in mental health services adjusted in line with inflation should be implemented in a phased way over the next seven to ten years. The proposed new workforce will comprise more than 11,000 staff throughout the service. Allowing for the assimilation of all existing posts, the expert group has estimated that a total of 1,803 new posts across the services, together with a total non-capital investment of &euro;151 million per annum, in addition to existing funding, will be required.</P>
      <P>This programme of investment has already begun with an additional &euro;25 million allocated to the Health Service Executive in the Estimates for 2006 for mental health services. Significant capital investment will also be required to implement A Vision for Change in respect of the provision of new and replacement facilities for mental health services. This has been estimated by the expert group to be of the order of &euro;796 million and much of it could be realised from the value of existing hospitals and lands. The proposals in A Vision for Change will allow for further significant expansion in community services and in specialised services for groups such as children, older people and those with particular needs.</P><Col N="1424"/>
      <P>The implementation of this policy will be a matter for the Health Service Executive in accordance with the provisions of the Health Act 2004. The national mental health directorate within the Health Service Executive is in the process of establishing an implementation group to ensure that the recommendations are realised in a timely and co-ordinated manner. As Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children with special responsibility for mental health, I will seek the active support of all involved in the mental health services so that together, we can bring about the far-reaching improvements contained in A Vision for Change. I will shortly appoint a group to monitor the implementation of the recommendations, as suggested in the report.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, I stress that A Vision for Change details a comprehensive model of mental health service provision for Ireland. It describes a framework for building and fostering positive mental health across the entire community and for providing accessible community-based specialist services for people with mental illness. On that basis, the Senator can be assured that in line with this policy, the level of mental health service provision will be improved and enhanced in the coming years.</P>
