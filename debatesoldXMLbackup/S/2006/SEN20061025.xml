	<P>I have notice from Senator Finucane that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to confirm when work will start on the Athea sewerage scheme, County Limerick, as housing development is being impeded owing to a lack of an appropriate sewerage scheme.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Kitt of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to outline the position on the Mountbellew sewerage scheme, County Galway.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Ulick Burke of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1" Just="Left">The need for the Minister for Health and Children to provide details of the amount of subvention and enhanced subvention allocated by the Health Service Executive western region for nursing homes in the west, the way in which the subvention criteria are applied, and the reasons for the variations in subvention from one HSE area to another.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Bannon of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to clarify the position regarding the inequity of charging fees of more than &euro;6,000 for a student repeating a college year, with the allied loss of third level grant provision, in circumstances where she is relying for funding on a widowed parent whose sole income is disability benefit, and to outline how, under natural justice, such a punitive measure can be enforced.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I <Col N="1830"/>have selected the matters raised by Senators Finucane, Kitt and Ulick Burke and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senator Bannon may give notice on another day of the matter that he wishes to raise.</P>

    <Title>Order of Business. </Title>
      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>I know that there may be a specific protocol for such matters, but I would not like to let the occasion pass without expressing our regret at the losses suffered by our Chief Whip, Senator Moylan, and Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute;.</P>
        <P>The Order of Business is No. 1, statements on the Government White Paper on Irish Aid (resumed), to be taken on the conclusion of the Order of Business and to conclude no later than 5 p.m., with Senators&rsquo; contributions not to exceed eight minutes and the Minister to be called upon to reply no later than ten minutes before the conclusion of statements; and No. 25, motion 23, to be taken from 5 p.m. until 7 p.m.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I echo the condolences to both Members&rsquo; families.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>This is unusual, but I understand the circumstances.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>It is very difficult to know what to say when asked to reflect on the carnage witnessed on the roads over the weekend.  The most graphic case was that in Threemilehouse in County Monaghan in which five young men died, but I know of others.  I believe that nine young men under the age of 25 were killed in night-time accidents over the weekend.  We must respond to this issue because, whatever one says, the road safety campaign is not working for that age cohort.  We will have to consider much more radical measures to get the point across to people of that age that society must address this serious issue.</P>
        <P>One circumstance has been brought to my attention.  Manufacturers and distributors can now install a limiter to determine the maximum speed at which a vehicle can travel.  Will the Government consider whether we might take that route to ensure that everything possible is done to get the message across to the age group in question that action must be taken?  If it requires limiting the maximum speed at which vehicles registered to owners in a certain age group can travel, we must consider that.  It is simply unacceptable that such carnage be allowed to continue without a considered response.</P>
        <P>When we returned following the summer recess, I asked the Leader when we might debate the reports of the Morris and Barron tribunals.  We have now been back four weeks without such debates.  The tribunals were asked to report to the Houses of the Oireachtas expeditiously, and it is no service to anyone if time passes without our being able to reflect on the reports&rsquo; conclusions.  It is now urgent that both debates be brought for<Col N="1831"/>ward because they concern very important matters we asked the two judges to determine.  The House is obliged to discuss their conclusions in the fullest possible sense.  I ask that debates be tabled on the reports as soon as possible.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>We have had debates on road safety on many occasions in recent years, but there are still outstanding issues.  The most difficult manoeuvre on the road is overtaking, but there is no overtaking manoeuvre in the driver test &mdash; <i>quod erat demonstrandum</i>.  This is the kind of nonsense we maintain continually.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach was interviewed recently on &ldquo;News at One&rdquo; and he made the point that he had spent two or three happy weeks in August in County Kerry, specifically in the town of Dingle.  In answer to a question, he pointed out to the nation that nobody had mentioned or raised with him the way people felt about the high-handed manner in which the name of their town had been changed.  Will the Leader convey to the Taoiseach that Dingle people are used to seeing national and international figures on their streets and have rules about not interfering with them, but that he should now be aware of their feelings?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator should keep to the Order of Business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I refer to No. 8 on the Order Paper, the Official Languages (Amendment) Bill 2005, in my name and that of Senator Coghlan.  Since we last met, the town of Dingle has voted on the name of its town.  The result of the vote was that 1,005 were opposed to the decision that has been made as against 70 in favour.  I look forward to debating this in the House.</P>
        <P>However, there are two reasons I do not want to call for the debate now.  First, the Minister intends to talk to Kerry County Council and the Dingle group over the next month and I would like to see how that plays out.  Second, the plebiscite in Dingle took place under the Local Government Act 1946, but the Minister seems unclear about that and keeps mentioning the Local Government Act 2001 and the Official Languages Act 2003.</P>
        <P>Under the 1946 legislation, after the plebiscite the returning officer is required to forward the result to the Government which will make the next decision on the town&rsquo;s name.  Lest there be any doubt, this is now a decision for the Government, unless the Minister intervenes somewhere along the way.  Will the Leader find an opportunity to ask the Taoiseach where we stand on that and whether the Government is likely to take a decision on it soon?</P>
        <P>Another issue of concern is the position of the unfortunate woman in County Cork who suffered sexual abuse as a child at the hands of her principal teacher and tried to find compensation through the State.  Having failed in her case, <Col N="1832"/>which is understandable from the point of view of the State, it is horrific that she must continue to worry about losing her property, perhaps even her house, although in fairness the Taoiseach has said she will not.  Nonetheless, the State is pursuing her for costs.  This is wrong.</P>
        <P>The last time a Government and Minister in similar circumstances apishly stood with legal advice was in the case of Mrs. McCole in Donegal.  It was the worst political decision and especially bad for a decent man, Deputy Noonan, and damaged him eventually.  The same could happen in this case.  The people do not want to see this woman pursued for those costs.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>We should have a regular debate on road safety.  Two students from a class of 28 students I teach have been killed in road accidents in the past six months, one at Easter and another last week.  One could not meet a nicer bunch of young people; they are a credit to their age group.  These deaths are an appalling tragedy.  If we are to do anything for our young people, we must do what is necessary to curb some of their excesses of enthusiasm.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Ag tagairt do ruda&iacute; a tharla le d&eacute;ana&iacute; sa Daingean, n&iacute;l m&oacute;r&aacute;n le r&aacute; agam ach aire an T&iacute; a dh&iacute;ri&uacute; ar litir san <i>Irish Times</i> inniu.   The letter is from an Englishman, but I will not quote it all.  It states: &ldquo;I have cancelled my two-week trip to Dingle next Easter.  I will be holidaying in Scotland instead&rdquo;.  He gives many reasons, including the assertion that &ldquo;the Scots are proud of their Gaeltacht and actively promote it to their foreign visitors&rdquo;.  The gentleman in question is apparently a regular visitor to Ireland and is insulted by the suggestion that he would not be able to find his way to a particular town if it was called An Daingean instead of Dingle.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>We should be careful not to have a debate on the matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am being a good deal more restrained than the previous speaker and just because I was on the losing side&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I was the essence of restraint.</P>

	<P>I was informative.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The first impact on tourism of this allegedly pro-tourism decision was to reduce the number of tourists.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>By one.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>By one who made it public.  Nevertheless, he is the person who felt obliged to do so <Col N="1833"/>and I hope that the people of Dingle have not made a profound mistake in terms of their tourism identity.</P>
        <P>This morning, the treatment of mushroom pickers was discussed on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo;.  For too long, I have heard of the treatment of migrant workers in that industry.  People talked about being paid &euro;5 per hour, a 60-hour week and seven days per week.  They are paid by cash in envelopes and do not get payslips.</P>
        <P>During the programme, a defender of the industry made the vigorous point that the workers are not productive enough and, if they are to be paid the legal minimum wage, they must increase their productivity by 40%, which is a nonsense.  A second point made was that supermarkets have forced down the price of mushrooms by 25% in recent years.  Approximately six major supermarkets could sort out this problem between them by asking their suppliers for guarantees that the workers, while not given significant privileges, are treated in accordance with the law.  I want to call on the public to stop buying mushrooms in supermarkets if that guarantee is not given.</P>
        <P>Senators make speeches in the House about fair trade around the world because many of them take it seriously, but the place to start fair trade is at home and its first principle is that people should be employed in accordance with the law.  I cannot depend on the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment to protect the workers&rsquo; rights because it has failed to do so time and again.  Therefore, the only course open to me is to appeal to the public.  I also ask Senators to appeal to the public to tell supermarkets that they will not buy products if proper treatment for their producers is not guaranteed.  This is the most effective way to address the problem and a one-week boycott would solve it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>There was a show of hands to indicate that Senators wish to contribute on the Order of Business.  I ask Senators to be aware of Standing Orders relating to time and to be brief.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn"><NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
	<P>An editorial in last Monday&rsquo;s <i>Irish Independent</i> had another go at local councillors and asked whether what they do is democracy or &ldquo;codocracy&rdquo;.  This article is media codology.  It is obvious that the writer, like previous writers, knows little or nothing about what a local authority member does.</P>
        <P>A number of Members, possibly including Senator Leyden and I, asked the Minister for Health and Children for a rolling debate on health.  Will the Leader arrange the debate as soon as possible?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Road Safety Authority&rsquo;s request for submissions from the public on its 2007 to 2011 safety strategy.  Will the RSA examine the 1998 road strategy report, in <Col N="1834"/>which it was stated that there would be spray suppression measures in respect of heavy goods vehicles?  We all know the inherent dangers if one tries to pass a truck in rain, namely, one can be blinded by spray for ten to 20 seconds.  The European Union has wanted these measures to be introduced since 1989.  In that context, if the Road Safety Authority and the Government are serious about road safety, I want them to introduce these spray suppression measures for trucks which have been laid out by the European Union.  That could certainly help improve road safety.</P>
        <P>My other point has to do with the driving test.  A previous speaker is correct on the point that one cannot overtake.  The driving test is undertaken in an artificial environment, usually within an urban area.  We see learner drivers practising in housing estates, reversing around corners, etc.  None of that learning is done on the open roads or on dual carriageways, or during the hours of darkness.  The entire driving test should be examined.</P>
        <P>I welcome the report on salmon stocks produced by what were described as the three wise men.  It has been known for some time that scientific evidence has shown declining stocks.  While there is no compulsion on the Government to introduce compensation measures for fishermen, the document stated that at least &euro;30 million should be earmarked for hardship encountered for those involved in the drift net and draft net fishing who will be bought out owing to this proposal.  This has been a raging debate throughout the country for some time.  I welcome the document and I trust that its recommendations will be implemented.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonScanlon"><NameTxt>Mr. Scanlon</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I wish to raise a matter brought to my attention by two families who contacted my office in Sligo yesterday.  They have elderly family members in St. John&rsquo;s geriatric hospital in Sligo town, and they wish to take them home but cannot do so without getting home help.  Apparently, there is a dispute at present &mdash; it is a national problem &mdash; where the people who organise the home help are in dispute with the Health Service Executive.  This is creating hardship for elderly people in our communities because for each of those who want to get out of these hospitals, I am sure there are many others who wish to get into them.  I call on everybody concerned to resolve this problem as quickly as possible.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the calls for a debate on salmon drift net fishing.  I raised this matter previously, as have other Members, over many years.  We know, for example, that the Government previously received scientific advice which it did not accept.  The situation on fish stocks is now regarded as catastrophic, according to an independent group headed by Professor Tom Collins which has made a clear recommendation that drift netting should cease altogether.  Although <Col N="1835"/>this is not required, the group also has suggested the provision of &euro;30 million plus to compensate for the hardship of displaced fishermen.  We should use a debate in this House to urge the Government to accept at last the scientific recommendations.</P>
        <P>With regard to the tragic recent road accident, I send my condolences to the grieving families and community.  I stated two years ago in this House that a clear profile was emerging and, tragically, at least some elements have been borne out by that dreadful accident.  The profile is of young men travelling at speed on country roads in the early hours of a weekend morning, sometimes with drink taken.  There were five or six elements, which I listed previously, and therefore we know the target group.  There is a possibility, as Senator Brian Hayes stated, of installing a governor in cars.  There is also a commercial product available, a device fitted to a car, that will alert parents immediately, wherever they are, to the fact that their car is being driven at excessive speed.  This is a matter that we need to look at again.</P>
        <P>This is quite a historic day.  I have just come from the launch of an important document in the National Library.  It was launched by the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science, Deputy de Valera.  It relates to a programme called Making Your School Safe and it has the endorsement of all the teaching unions, the Department of Education and Science, etc.  It is about the alarmingly high levels of homophobic bullying in schools.  This is a very destructive issue for young people and often it carries on into adult life with tragic consequences.  In the past week, I have been dealing with two serious cases of bullying of adults in the workplace on this basis.  It is time this was brought to an end.  I was very proud of this country to sit in the National Library an hour ago as two young confident, courageous and articulate schoolgoing people &mdash; one man and one woman &mdash; talked about their experiences and demanded the right to be treated equally.  The young man said somebody known to him had been bullied so much at school that he had to be hospitalised.  He then left the school and education.  That is a reproach to all of us.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GeraldineFeeney"><NameTxt>Ms Feeney</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Like other speakers, my mind was focused over the weekend on the terrible tragedy played out in Threemilehouse, County Monaghan.  One wonders about the request for a debate on road safety because we have had umpteen debates on the issue.  I was very taken by the words of Fr. Martin O&rsquo;Reilly during the funerals of the two little cousins, as they were thought-provoking and laden with common sense.  Perhaps Members are too gentle and politically correct when the House debates road safety.  Young men aged between 17 and 30 years who are caught speeding should be put off the road and their cars impounded.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1836"/>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GeraldineFeeney"><NameTxt>Ms Feeney</NameTxt>
	<P>Perhaps then we would not witness a repeat of the terrible pain and agony inflicted on all those families in Monaghan.</P>
        <P>Could a debate on road safety cover both drug and alcohol testing?  Many young people may be doing drugs rather than drinking and no testing is conducted for drugs.  Other European countries carry out such testing and it should be mandatory in Ireland.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I support the call for a debate on the salmon drift netting report and I ask the Leader to arrange this as soon as possible.  Senator Norris&rsquo;s reference to the dangerously low fish stocks is correct.  People involved in snap net fishing on the rivers Nore, Barrow and Suir in my constituency have witnessed low fish stocks in recent years and unless firm action is taken by the Government, the situation will be beyond repair.</P>
        <P>I also support the comments of previous speakers about road safety and we should have a debate.  Senator Feeney is probably right that we have been too politically correct in our comments but, at the same time, all young people should not be labelled dangerous drivers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid=""><NameTxt>Senators</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Norris outlined pretty well the cohort of drivers involved and it is not long since I was in that age group.  As a young man in a rural area, one must have a car to have a life because there is no other way to get around and to do what one wants.  Most of the horror accidents occur in rural areas and involve young men.  One must have a vehicle to socialise and work.  There is a danger of casting all young people as villains on the road.  Many road accidents are caused by drivers who are not in this age cohort and there are serious problems in that regard.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P Just="Left">Will the Leader ask the Minister for Health and Children the status of the primary school medical examination?  I have been trying to find out for the past number of months because the implementation of the examination differs throughout the country.  The Minister says it is still in use but I am aware of a number of schools in my constituency where it is not undertaken.  The examination is important in preventing illness among children.  A thorough primary school examination should be implemented, as happened in the past.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Many Senators are offering and I would like to accommodate everyone.  I ask for brevity, otherwise a number of Members will be disappointed.</P>
        </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMauriceHayes"><NameTxt>Dr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Leader ask the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to attend the House for a debate on the proposals to exclude citizens of the new accession countries, <Col N="1837"/>Bulgaria and Romania, from the labour force?  At a time when we are protesting about quotas being applied to our people in America, this decision sits badly with our traditions.  I appreciate the preservation of the common travel area, as it affects me every day of the week, but the British proposals in this regard are not well thought out either, nor can they be policed.  Therefore, I would like us to have a debate on this matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">In deference to the Cathaoirleach&rsquo;s request, I will be brief.  We will deal with child care legislation relating to fostering and adoption tomorrow which is welcome, but I ask the Leader of the House to arrange for a debate specifically on the publication by the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, of proposed new regulations in the child care area.  I very much welcome their publication, having called for them in this House for a considerable time.  The regulations were published on Monday, 9 October and service providers have until the end of the year to give their response to them because the new regulations will come into place on 1 January next.  I understand from providers that this is too short a period and they need a longer time to meet the requirement for the putting in place of them, that they have implications for the Garda vetting unit in Thurles and providers are greatly concerned that the new regulations will further increase the cost of child care for parents.  That is not acceptable as many parents and providers are at the pin of their collar in trying to cope.  I ask the Leader to arrange for a debate in this House on the proposed regulations in the next month or two.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CyprianBrady"><NameTxt>Mr. Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>I call for the resumption of the debate on No. 17 on the Order Paper, the drugs strategy.  There was another major seizure of heroin in Dublin last night, which is the second one in as many weeks.  I congratulate the Garda units on their success.  Guns were found along with the drugs.  We must start to think radically in regard to tackling this problem.  It is generally accepted that the drug seizures represent only 10% of drugs available on the streets.  Therefore, I call for a resumption of the debate on the drugs strategy.</P>

Now that we have had a decisive democratic decision from the good people of Dingle, unless the Minister responsible is a language fascist, I hope he will not choose to ignore their wishes.

      <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

	<P>Brevity is my middle name, as the Cathaoirleach knows.  </P>
        <P>On an another matter, I would be grateful if the Leader would enlighten the House.  I have asked her before about the Privacy Bill which is on the Order Paper, but I missed some comment the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform made in the meantime about having some further consultation on it or whatever.  This is where the Leader will come into the picture, namely, in being able to enlighten us all on it.  Does this mean tweaking the Bill or dropping it?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnMinihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Minihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I join previous speakers in calling for a debate on the report on salmon conservation published yesterday.  The report is welcome and its recommendations should be acted on promptly.  I seek a debate on it in the short term given that the salmon season will start on 1 January next and if the lead-in time is to be given to a Government decision, this House could play an active part in debating the report in the near future.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Cathaoirleach and other Senators may have heard on radio this morning that Fr. Peter McVerry has published another report on the deplorable state in which people leave our prisons, particularly St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution, and that they are more likely to become involved in crime after they have been in prison than they were before they went to prison.  I have asked the Leader &mdash; I know she has tried &mdash; to arrange for a debate in this House on the Inspector of Prisons and Places of Detention&rsquo;s report for 2005 and the reports of the visiting committees.</P>
        <P Just="Left">More than 20 years ago the Whitaker report recommended that St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution be closed.  It is deplorable to think there is still no training or education provided there.  It costs the taxpayer &euro;86,000 per person, per year, to keep people there and Father McVerry says they come out worse than when they went in and I agree with him.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Henry in her remarks.  I have read much of what she has contributed on this subject in the House, which was like something from a Charles Dickens novel.  I could not believe what was going on in an institution that was supposed to be engaged in the rehabilitation of young offenders.  We talk in this House about road safety and responsibility among young people, yet here is an example of a situation where those who are at the lower end of society &mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>In that context, I support Senator Henry because&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I am seeking brevity from Senators.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>I will give the Cathaoirleach as much brevity as I can.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I will decide on that.</P>

      </Speaker>

	<P>If there is an item on the Order of Business the Senator wishes to raise, I ask him to do so now.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>If we are to have a debate on road safety, I ask the Leader to consider drawing together the various recommendations, especially in light of the establishment of a road traffic authority.  If that authority is like any of the other statutory bodies set up recently, Members of this House may not have any direct input whatsoever because the authority will make its own rules and regulations.</P>
        <P>The ESRI published a report on the national development plan which questioned the priorities of the National Roads Authority regarding the development of the road network.  It specifically referred to two roads, namely, the one from Mullingar to Athlone and the other going through the spine of the country, through Birr, Roscrea and into Tipperary, which carry enormous volumes of traffic.  I have never been able to understand why bringing those roads up to dual carriageway standards was not made a priority.  I hope the forthcoming debate will give us an opportunity to discuss that issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Senator Scanlon on the roll-out of the home care packages for our elderly people.  What is happening is scandalous and disgraceful.  We are told by the HSE that there is nobody in place at the moment to sign off on the packages.  The delays are all due to bureaucracy and red tape.  At the same time, we had HSE representatives circling this House all day today&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Senator seeking a debate?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;promoting their image and so forth.  It would be better if they stayed within their remit and get rid of their answering machines.  Last week I had to make representations on behalf of a very elderly person&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>We will be able to hear all of that when we have the debate.  That can be a subject for the debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I encountered 11 voice mailboxes rather than a human being at the other end of the <Col N="1840"/>telephone line.  This is something of which the HSE must get rid.  </P>
        <P>I also call for a debate on the condition of our county, secondary and regional roads in the context of road safety.  Some of our roads and signage are in a deplorable state.  What is happening in this regard is scandalous.  One sees overgrown hedges, badly maintained surfaces and very poor sign posting.  Indeed, the latter is particularly also true of the N4 from Dublin.  It is virtually impossible for people to access the old N4 because of bad signposting.  It has caused several accidents&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sure the Leader will accommodate the Senator with a debate and he can raise these matters then.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>It is important that we have a debate on the condition of our roads, many of which are in a deplorable state, despite what the Minister has said on numerous occasions, namely that there is plenty of money for our county roads.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanKenneally"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
	<P>With regard to the salmon report to which other Members have referred in the House this afternoon, I wish to make it clear that the report is only a recommendation and no decision has been made as yet.  I have no problem supporting the call for a discussion in this House on the subject.  However, other reports have been prepared on the topic, including one by the Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources.  I hope the final Government decision will involve a meshing together of the recommendations in those two reports.  I wish to make it clear I am not happy with what is in this report, but there will be much discussion before the final decision is made.</P>
        <P>Many contributors have raised the matter of road safety.  A person in my constituency is developing on his own land a simulated driving instruction area.  He is installing roads, roundabouts, traffic lights and everything that could possibly be met on the roads to train people to drive properly.  He is not being funded to do this, and the Government should consider this and support that type of enterprise.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the calls for a debate on road safety.  I sympathise with the families of the recent victims of road accidents, especially that which occurred in Monaghan.  We must discuss the issue in terms of its broader application.  I live in a community where there is a constant sound of the revving of car engines.  It is becoming a significant feature of life in estates.  Young drivers go into estates to do wheelies and turn-arounds, among other types of very dangerous practices.  We should be very conscious that there is a part of popular culture that is normalising and glam<Col N="1841"/>orising speeding as well as displays of bravery by motorists.  It involves very popular films, television programmes and games being viewed by children and young adults.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a point for the debate, when we have it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>It is very important to look at other countries, because it is not just unique to Ireland.  Perhaps we need to look to bringing in legislation dealing with dangerous driving practices.  We do not have it in this country yet.  It is called anti-hooning legislation in other countries, such as New Zealand.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>There are many Senators offering.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a time limit and the Senator has made her point.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>I have been briefer than any other speaker.  That is not fair.  The Cathaoirleach is not being fair to me.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I am fair to everyone.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>We need a debate on bringing in legislation where cars can be confiscated from dangerous drivers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I call Senator Kitt.  I should point out at this stage that I am trying to be fair to everyone.  I have only four or five minutes and I will have to break the rule to accommodate everyone.  To be accused of not being fair is completely wrong.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>I join in the calls for a debate on road safety.  A Drive Safe programme has been devised by a young person in County Galway.  The Department of Education and Science has deemed to accept much of the programme, except for the question of driving tuition.  The Department does not agree that this should be part of <Col N="1842"/>the course.  This should be included.  It has already been carried out in Carndonagh in County Donegal and Dunmore in County Galway.  If driving tuition can be carried out there it can be done in a general programme.</P>
        <P>I hope if we have a debate on road safety and this programme is implemented by the Department, the driving tuition section will be part of it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>There will be a debate but we cannot have it now.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>It is very important.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I call for a debate on fireworks.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Which fireworks?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>There are time constraints.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Leader for a debate on fireworks.  The Criminal Justice Act 2006 introduced changes which we hoped would make a difference.  The situation is worse than ever.  In the past three years there have been 11 court appearances relating to fireworks, yet there was not one conviction.  While I accept it has not been a full year, this year there have been 30 seizures in comparison with 126 for 2005.  The changes made have had zero impact and the situation is worse than ever.  I understand one man in Clontarf had his car burnt out lately.  Every part of Ireland is badly affected by fireworks.  We must have a debate to see what we can do to resolve the matter.  The changes made last year did not work.</P>
        <P>I also call for a debate on road safety.  It is regrettable that Fianna F&aacute;il voted down the drug testing element in the Private Members&rsquo; Bill in the D&aacute;il last week.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I join with everybody in complimenting the Garda Commissioner and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on the &euro;10 million haul of drugs last night in Clondalkin.  I agree with Senator Brady that many drugs come into the country through small airports.  Weston Aerodrome is the focus of attention at the moment but other small airports are totally uncontrolled.  Drugs are coming into the country and they must be coming in somewhere.  There should be a clampdown on smaller airports in that regard.  Air traffic control should know the number of aeroplanes that have come in through Weston Aerodrome in the past five years and there should be an investigation into every person using that facility, as well as every other private airport, so that we can find out the extent of the drugs coming in.  There is an insatiable appetite for drugs and we need more awareness.  I call for the Minister to report to this House on the actions of his and other Departments in that regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeMcHugh"><NameTxt>Mr. McHugh</NameTxt>
	<P>I have learned, from representations made to me this week and from speaking to colleagues in other parts of the country, that a <Col N="1843"/>wave of anti-social behaviour is spiralling across the country in the form of the annual pre-Hallowe&rsquo;en use of bangers and other fireworks.  In one example, which illustrates the link between anti-social behaviour among young people and driving, young people threw bangers out of a car at a petrol pump attendant.  People now live in fear of the potential consequences of such incidents, because had there been a leakage of petrol at the pump in question there would have been serious trouble.  We must call on parents to be extra vigilant, because their children regard such anti-social behaviour as fun.  However, it is not fun and the consequences could be serious.  </P>
        <P>In a further link between anti-social behaviour and driving, some young people drive up behind cyclists and try to knock them off their bicycles.  I call for a debate on anti-social behaviour.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sure there will be a debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Leader to set up a sub-committee of the House to deal with advertising, in particular to address the peculiar activities of some Members.  I wake up in the mornings and listen to Senator Henry telling me I should have a happy heart, followed by Senator Norris telling me I should buy Tesco products, which are very bad for a happy heart.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>What about Senator Ross himself?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator will not listen to that in the Seanad.  If he does not want to listen he may turn off his radio.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>Then I hear Senator Quinn&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>This is not relevant to the Order of Business.  The Senator&rsquo;s time has elapsed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a very important issue.  If the Cathaoirleach sat beside the Senators in question on the backbenches he would feel rather left out.  We are all entitled to a gig of that sort.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>We must not spend the morning giggling.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senators will undoubtedly make declarations of interest over such activities.</P>
        <P>I agree with Senator Norris and others that we must have a debate on salmon drift net fishing.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>There will be a debate.  I call Senator Coonan.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P Just="Left">Following the deaths of two young people, aged 17, in Templemore I support calls for a debate on road safety.  Our sympathies go to their families.  Not only were the families of the young people who lost their lives devastated but so were those of the other people involved in the accident.</P>
        <P>A debate is necessary on three issues.  It is time road safety was a part of the national and secondary school curricula.  We must examine facilities for young people, particularly in rural areas, because there is very little for them to do, though that is not an excuse.  The third issue for debate is the implementation of legislation which already exists and the necessity for appropriate deterrents and penalties.  For example, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na caught a person speeding at 197 km/h but it was not deemed to be dangerous driving.  We must have consistent implementation of the law.</P>

      <?oasys _cl11.5- ?><Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I support calls for a debate on road safety.  Many Members have mentioned target groups but one group has escaped the net in that regard, namely, the local authorities. It is alarming to see that the Health and Safety Authority has issued proceedings against 29 local authorities with regard to sections of the roads which are being repaired or realigned, etc.  As long as local authorities neglect their duties there will be road accidents.  This is highlighted by the fact that only yesterday did Meath County Council at last put up its hand and accept responsibility for the tragic event in Meath more than 12 months ago.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Leader ask the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, who also has a role to play, to advise local authorities that road safety is of the utmost importance, especially when so many road repairs are under way around the country? </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Senator Brian Hayes, the Leader of the Opposition, brought up the topical, sensitive and sad issue of carnage on the roads, accentuated by incidents involving groups of young men.  The recent events in Monaghan brought us all up short but there were disturbing aspects of that crash which people are not inclined to discuss at a sensitive time.  Nevertheless, they are serious facts.</P>
        <P Just="Left">He also asked about debating the Morris and Barron tribunals.  We have been trying to arrange those debates in this House.  The Minister wishes to attend himself, rather than give them to a junior Minister.  The question is when he will have the time to do so.  We pursue him on the matter every week.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole spoke about the recent vote in Dingle and the 1946 Local Government Act. <Col N="1845"/> The result of 1,005 to 70 was brilliant.  He also mentioned Ms O&rsquo;Keeffe.  As the Taoiseach said, she will not lose her home but the case is <i>sub judice</i> at present because she has appealed to the Supreme Court.</P>
        <P>Senator Ryan asked for a road traffic debate.  He wonders if the people of Dingle have not made a great mistake in their vote.  That is up to them.  He also called for a boycott of mushrooms until the mushroom pickers receive their due entitlement in pay, etc., because we all talk about fair trade.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Glynn spoke about the editorial referring to councillors and asking if this is democracy or &ldquo;codocracy&rdquo;.  He requested too a rolling debate on health.  Senator Finucane said that the public has been asked for observations on the road traffic programme.  He also mentioned spray suppression equipment for trucks.  We have all experienced dirt from wheels being thrown onto the windscreen when no matter how good one&rsquo;s wipers are, they are not quick enough to clear it.  He also mentioned the discussion document on salmon by the three wise men.  We will try to organise that debate.</P>
        <P>Senator Scanlon mentioned a dispute between home help staff and the HSE as a result of which elderly people cannot get the necessary home help.  Senator Norris mentioned salmon drift net fishing and a fund of &euro;30 million to buy out the fishermen.  He asks that the Government consider the recommendations which have been submitted to it.  He also spoke about the profile of young men involved in car accidents.  He said too that he had been to the launch by the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science, Deputy de Valera, of a document called Make Your School Safe.  This deals with homophobic bullying which can be terrifying for young people.</P>
        <P>Senator Feeney also spoke about the tragic deaths in Monaghan at the weekend and the priest who gave a homily at one of the funerals.  Everybody is desperately seeking a scapegoat for these sad occasions but in the end young people and their parents must exercise control.  Ladling out blame at a time of great sadness is not correct.  She also spoke about the need for drug testing as well as alcohol testing.  Alcohol used in abusive measures is a drug.</P>
        <P>Senator John Paul Phelan wants a debate on drift netting.  He also wants to know the status of the primary school medical examination.  It would be an ideal subject for an Adjournment matter.  From working in Departments, I have found that when an issue is raised as an Adjournment matter, the minds of officials become sharply focused as they prepare a reply.</P>
        <P>Senator Maurice Hayes called for a debate on the stay put on Romanian and Bulgarian workers entering the Irish labour force after their countries join the EU.  Senator O&rsquo;Meara requested a debate on the proposed new regulations, promul<Col N="1846"/>gated on 9 October, for providers of child<?oasys _jy ?>care.</P>
        <?oasys _cl11.2- ?><P>Senator Brady wants to resume the debate on the drugs strategy.  He congratulated the Garda on the massive haul it made last night.  From the quantities involved, one cannot imagine the huge devastation that would have been wrought on communities.  I guess it is only the tip of the iceberg.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Coghlan said he would not move the Official Languages (Amendment) Bill 2005, No. 8 on the Order Paper.

        <P>Senator Minihan raised the issue of salmon conservation.  He pointed out that 1 January is the beginning of the new salmon season and decisions on the salmon conservation report will have to be made by then.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I love hearing Senator Henry&rsquo;s voice on her recent radio advertisements.  She raised the deplorable state of our prisons and again asked for a debate on the Inspector of Prisons and Places of Detention 2005 report.  The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, again, wishes to deal with this matter himself so it is a question of him being available.</P>
        <P>Senator Mooney called for a debate on road traffic safety and raised the ESRI report.  I am tired of professors telling us what we should be doing with ourselves in our country and how we should not spend any more money on this, that and the other.</P>

        <P>I agree with Senator Bannon on the roll-out of home care packages.  He is aware I raised the matter at a recent HSE meeting.  He also called for a debate on the conditions of secondary and regional roads.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Kenneally wants a debate on the salmon conservation report.  He pointed out there were other reports, including that of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Communications, <Col N="1847"/>Marine and Natural Resources.  He praised a simulated driving instruction area in his constituency developed to train people to drive properly.</P>
        <P>Senator Tuffy spoke about the revving up of cars and dangerous driving in residential estates.  The day after the awful crash in Monaghan, I saw an exhibition of dangerous driving on single line roads.  Senator Kitt also called for a debate on road safety and a drive safe programme which was implemented in Galway.</P>
        <P>Senator Browne raised the issue of fireworks.  Senator Leyden congratulated the authorities for the latest drug haul.  He also highlighted the issue of private airports and drug trafficking.  Senator McHugh bravely raised the matter of young people&rsquo;s anti-social behaviour and the need for parental vigilance.</P>
        <P>Senator Ross has taken issue with those fellow Senators appearing on radio advertisements.  I find their voices very reassuring when I hear them on the radio.  He is on the radio himself and I enjoy listening to him too.  He also has a whole newspaper to himself every weekend which makes for very good reading.  Why is he going after other Senators?  He also called for a debate on salmon drift netting.</P>
        <P>Senator Coonan called for more facilities for young people, particularly in rural areas.  Senator Ulick Burke called for local authorities to be targeted with regard to negligence in road conditions which could lead to road deaths.</P>

    <Title>White Paper on Irish Aid: Statements (Resumed). </Title>
      <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan, to the House.  I thank him for this excellent White Paper and congratulate him on the manner in which he has taken to his brief and the energy and enthusiasm he has shown in his work.  He and his staff are to be commended.</P>
        <P>Those who work with Irish Aid at home and abroad must be complimented on the way in which they carry out their work.  I also commend the public on their generosity in contributing from their own pockets whenever a disaster occurs anywhere in the world and, more gener<Col N="1848"/>ally, through their tax contributions which allow aid to be distributed by the Government through various agencies in different locations.  It is difficult for us to appreciate the terrible hardship people must endure in some parts of the world, whether through famine, war or natural disasters.  This reality has been brought home to us on many occasions.  The tsunami of St. Stephen&rsquo;s Day 2004, for instance, showed us how well the Irish people can rally when others are in need.</P>
        <P>The White Paper presents a strategy that we must work on in coming years.  At The UN Millennium Summit in 2000, world leaders from developed and developing countries, including the Taoiseach, adopted the millennium development goals.  Those goals are as important today as they were then, and I look forward to their implementation.  The White Paper includes a commitment that they will be fulfilled by 2015.  I would like to see that date brought forward, if possible, because their implementation will make an enormous difference.  Nothing happens overnight and I recognise that progress takes time.  However, whatever can be done to bring them to fruition is welcome.  Many parts of the world are in need of aid and it is impossible to assist every deserving cause.  We must focus on particular areas and that is what we are doing through our various programmes.</P>
        <P>As it is impossible to comment on everything in the White Paper, I will focus on a number of issues.  In regard to health, the White Paper states:</P>
        <P LI="1">The entitlement of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health is the fundamental human right.  While the state of health globally is improving, there is still an unacceptable level of preventable illness and death.  In 2005, more than 12 million children died before their fifth birthday and 500,000 women died from complications of pregnancy and childbirth.</P>
        <P FLI="0">These figures are startling.  It is difficult to comprehend the deaths of so many children.  We all know the extent of the outcry that would arise if any number of children in this country were to die of starvation.  We must keep in mind that children are dying every minute in other countries, either through starvation or neglect of one type or another.  Many parents are obliged to stand by and watch their children die while, in many cases, they themselves are dying.  The deaths of 500,000 women through complications of pregnancy and childbirth are preventable.  We must ensure help is available to as many of these women as possible.</P>
        <P>Overseas development aid is critical for the campaign to advance sexual and reproductive health and rights.  Family planning allows families to invest more in each child&rsquo;s nutrition, health and education.  Prenatal care and the ability to prevent high-risk births helps reduce child mortality.  Preventing unplanned pregnancies and <Col N="1849"/>providing care in pregnancy and childbirth saves women&rsquo;s lives.  Sexual and reproductive health programmes help prevent HIV-AIDS and other sexually transmitted infections.</P>
        <P>For many people, particularly women, access to information, health care services and education is a major factor.  Last year, I was honoured to be part of a group of parliamentarians from throughout Europe who travelled with the Inter-European Parliamentary Forum on Population and Development to examine the reproductive and sexual health policies of Peru and Brazil.  Although I have never travelled to Africa, I have listened to the experiences of those who have been there.  These experiences tell of the dreadful conditions in which people must live.  To see at first hand the conditions many families endure in Peru and Brazil was an eye-opening experience.</P>
        <P>During our trip, we met officials from the UNFPA, politicians, NGOs, religious leaders and local community groups who work with children, adolescents and those suffering with HIV-AIDS.  The NGOs are doing wonderful work.  Ireland does not directly intervene in Latin America but we provide assistance to NGOs there.  I could see this money is being well spent in helping support the projects undertaken by NGOs in the area.  They are dealing with very poor people.  While there is a great mix of people in Peru and Brazil, the difference between the wealthy and the poor is enormous.  We visited the poor who live in little wooden huts on the side of mountains with no sanitation.  One can imagine what happens when it rains.  Families live in one-roomed wooden huts and one can imagine the problems which result.  We met families and various local community groups and young girls, in particular, are at great risk.</P>
        <P>I refer to the section in the White Paper entitled, Building Better Government and Combating Corruption.  That is very important, especially in the case of Peru and Brazil.  I am concerned about the influence of the Roman Catholic hierarchy on sexual and reproductive health in these countries.  We should call for the separation of church and state when church interferes in matters of sexuality and health care.  I am thinking of the provision of contraceptives in that area.  Such interference does nothing for the welfare of either males or females and particularly impacts on the health of women.  I would welcome it if the Minister of State spoke out if he sees interference from any church.  I speak, in particular, about my experience in Latin America where there is interference by the Catholic Church in state affairs in the area of health.</P>
        <P>I mention with great sadness that the US, especially under President Bush, has reduced the amount of aid it gives to Latin America.  Again, it is as a result of President Bush&rsquo;s conservative view in the area of sexual and reproductive health.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1850"/>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>I am delighted we are having this debate because many Members have called for one on development aid, or Irish Aid as the Minister of State called it.  I thank him for his great work, the considerable enthusiasm he has shown for this issue and for producing the White Paper on which there was consultation, which is evident in the paper.</P>
        <P>I agree with Senator Terry on the generosity of Irish people.  The tsunami and hurricane Katrina were two examples of where much funding was made available.  I refer to Irish people who have gone on their own or with small groups to countries in which there has been a disaster or where there is great need.  Mr. Alan Kearns has been working in Zambia and the Minister of State knows of his work there.  Mr. Jack McCann brings a medical team from Galway to Albania to provide medical aid there.  The Friends of Chernobyl has also done great work.  All these groups have received funding from the Department which is important because sometimes when we talk of non-governmental organisations, NGOs, perhaps we do not recognise the work individuals and small groups can do.</P>
        <P>When reading the White Paper, I was conscious of the number of children who do not receive a basic education, the number of people who go to bed hungry and the thousands of people who die each day from preventable diseases.  It is welcome that the Minister and the Government have finally said that we will reach the UN target of 0.7% of gross national product, GNP, by 2012.  On current projections, the figure will be &euro;1.5 billion.  Even this year, &euro;734 million will be spent on Irish Aid.  I am delighted the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs will be known as the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Irish Aid.  That is recognition of how important Irish Aid is in the committee system and the Department.</P>
        <P>We have rightly placed a strong focus on Africa.  The issue of human rights there is most important.  I visited Tanzania some years ago with the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and there has been a dramatic increase in primary education in that country.  Foreign aid is important in increasing participation in primary education.  Another country which the committee visited was Ethiopia where a new welfare system has been put in place which is helping the poorest people there get basic food and education.</P>
        <P>As other speakers said, the issue of HIV-AIDS is important.  An interparliamentary conference was held in Cape Town last May under the Austrian Presidency of the European Union.  For the first time, members of parliaments in the EU and Africa came together.  I was honoured to attend that conference and discussions between parliamentarians from both continents on the most effective way to deal with this issue were very worthwhile.  We often talk about corruption in countries and people say we should not give aid to such countries but that conference was able <Col N="1851"/>to focus clearly on what parliamentarians in Africa could do.</P>
        <P>Another interesting development was the work of the Government of Mozambique and the Clinton Foundation on HIV-AIDS in which Ireland was also involved.  The Minister recently announced funding for Timor-Leste to deal with the aftermath of the crisis there.  Eastern Europe is another area which has been dealt with but the focus is always on Africa and Timor-Leste.</P>
        <P>The Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs discussed Darfur yesterday.  It is tragic that so many people have lost their lives as an indirect result of the conflict there and that more than 2 million people have been displaced from their homes and livelihoods.  I hope we can apply more pressure in that regard.  As one of my colleagues, Deputy Carey, suggested, we should at least have debates in both Houses to ensure the deployment of a UN force and to show clearly the opposition of the Irish people to the conflict in that region which has resulted in terrible loss of life.</P>
        <P>An issue which I raised at yesterday&rsquo;s meeting and about which I am very concerned is the safety and welfare of NGOs operating in Darfur.  Mr. Rory Montgomery and his staff from the Department of Foreign Affairs said that 12 NGO staff working in that region have died.  Organisations such as Concern, Tr&oacute;caire and GOAL do great work there but it was clearly pointed out that they have had to leave some areas because of the difficulties.  I hope the Minister of State might be able to address some of those issues, for example, the safety of personnel there and whether we can get a positive reaction from President al-Bashir, who seems continually to refuse any deployment of UN peacekeeping troops in Darfur.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The position of women in Darfur has been extremely difficult.  There has been violence and abuse of women, and children have also suffered difficulties.  It amounts to a major issue that the international community must address.  We are obviously improving flows of humanitarian assistance and wish to see a proper peace agreement, since previous initiatives have not been lived up to.  I hope that when the Minister of State replies, he might address some of those issues.  I congratulate him on his work.</P>
        <P>It is both useful and welcome to debate the White Paper, and perhaps we might do the same regarding Darfur.  While that is perhaps more of a matter for ourselves to decide, I record my hope that it will happen soon.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I too welcome the Minister of State, who made a very energetic and useful contribution to the debate on this subject by the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs on 10 October.  I would like to pick up on one or two things said there.  One significant matter perhaps not yet mentioned in this debate was the Government suggestion that the committee be renamed the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs <Col N="1852"/>and Irish Aid.  That has been universally welcomed, since it helps to place at the centre of foreign affairs the commitment of the Government and the people to aid programmes.  It was very heartening to hear from the Minister of State that the ten new member states of the European Union are sending delegations to Ireland weekly to learn how they might construct similar programmes.  It is flattering that it should happen.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State also stated that we have made a significant contribution, and some other European and world states are watching what we are doing and following on our coat-tails.  That too is a good thing, showing that we are becoming a headline community in the area.  I also welcome the idea of creating a dedicated unit for conflict analysis and resolution.  We are in the end game in the North of Ireland, and we may have learnt some lessons useful to the rest of the international community.</P>
        <P>The development of a hunger task force was also mentioned.  However, underlying all those issues and much of the conflict throughout the world is a catastrophic population explosion to which very few people nowadays refer; it is simply not fashionable.  From the time I entered university to now, a matter of approximately 40 years, the global population doubled.  That inevitably produces strains regarding overcrowding, competition for resources, international conflict and so on, and it must be addressed.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister of State also mentioned the establishment of a governance unit to ensure that aid given is properly applied.  I was very interested but also sorry to see that in the full White Paper he refers to the disastrous situation in Congo, where he has said the aid was useless.  I would have liked a little more information on that, since it is helpful to know why it is useless.  It is devastating to state that millions of euro were sent to that tragic country without anything happening except that it was all sequestered away.  I would like to know how, why, where and when that happened and what we can do to address matters regarding governance.</P>
        <P>I welcome the commitment to raise aid contributions to 0.7% of GDP by 2012.  However, I remember commitments being given in this House regarding which, when we on this side poked the Government, we were told that they were not absolute.  How absolute is this commitment?</P>
        <P Just="Left">I remember Deputy O&rsquo;Donnell making a passionate appeal in the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs that this not be decided yearly but built into the heads of financing so that it is structural.  I do not believe that it has been done, but I would like it to happen.  Although the Taoiseach is intent on going the full run, one never knows what might happen.  There could be an accident; stranger things have happened.  There might even be a different Government after the next general election, and one Government&rsquo;s commitments are not always fulfilled by another.  I would like <Col N="1853"/>this stipulated structurally to clarify that our commitment is real.</P>
        <P>Another very important point is that, as the Minister of State said, we are now a very wealthy country.  Although in absolute terms our contribution may not be as substantial as that of which other countries are capable, there will be a considerable increase, and now is the time for us to plan.  We must have trained personnel on the ground to ensure that these programmes can be delivered.  As the Minister knows, in the past in the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs we have been told that there is no point in our increasing aid in financial terms because we lack sufficient trained personnel for delivery.  We must examine that now and ensure that we have them.</P>
        <P>I recently attended some meetings with the Irish Family Planning Association, which the Minister of State will know is affiliated to the UNFPA.  I commend the Government on its strong and continuing support for the latter organisation, which is vitally important for precisely the reasons listed by Senator Terry.  There is ecclesiastical interference from both ends of the spectrum, extreme Protestants on the one hand, and the Vatican on the other, to impede certain programmes.  That is wrong, and it is very important that Ireland at least continue to lend its moral support.  It is welcomed by Members across the party spectrum in both Houses.</P>
        <P>At one of our meetings we referred to President Bush&rsquo;s cutbacks.  From a very primitive perspective, he is cutting back in areas such as contraception.  We should appeal to him not to make an absolute cut.  He is in control and he will have ideas, but he should invest any shortfall in other areas.  For example, my colleague, Senator Henry, pointed out that in certain African regions that she visited, she was astonished by the high maternal morbidity rate.  One reason was the degree of haemorrhaging.  She witnessed such situations and could not believe that a woman might die from such a minor flow of blood.  However, when shown the haemoglobin counts, she realised that even a small haemorrhage was disastrous for women in such circumstances.  That can be countered very simply by adding iron to the diet.  President Bush, even if he is not prepared to pay for condoms, should make the surplus available to save the lives of women in childbirth if he is the kind of Christian about which he is always proclaiming.</P>
        <P>Senator Kitt referred to the situation in Darfur.  It is a very worrying trend, and the peace agreement has led to the fragmentation of forces, making matters worse, since former allies are now attacking each other.  In the camps there is the horrible situation that the men are terrified to go out, instead sending the women to collect firewood, only for them to be routinely raped.  The Sudanese Government is directly responsible for the use of rape as a weapon of war against women.  It is disgusting and repulsive, and that <Col N="1854"/>should be made clear to the authorities in question.</P>
        <P>Yesterday I raised the issue of disinvestment.  I understand that the Department will be entertaining the Sudan Disinvestment Campaign.  There are several firms, including Chinese petroleum companies and Canadian and American investment companies, as well as some that even have Irish connections.  Since they operate through shell companies it is not always clear who are the owners.  Through the National Treasury Management Agency, which controls substantial sums from our pensions, we have been investing in companies that support and prop up the Sudanese Government.  The group has suggested including an ethical investment clause in the NTMA&rsquo;s terms of reference.  I have spoken to colleagues across the party spectrum in both Houses and they are in favour.  I would like the Minister of State to speak to his colleague in the Department of Finance about that.</P>
        <P>Among the good points in the White Paper was the high priority accorded HIV-AIDS, women&rsquo;s health and gender issues.  However, those issues always seem to be discussed in terms of reproductive rights.  Let us insert the word &ldquo;sexual&rdquo;, since that word needs to be there; sexuality must be mentioned.  It is not only a matter of violence against women, something on which the Minister of State is absolutely right, since there is also violence against gay men.  A situation in Iran may not have a direct link with Irish Aid, but it illustrates that this type of violence is global.  In Iran, two lovely young men were savagely and brutally murdered because of their sexual orientation.  It is not just women who are on the receiving end of violence.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In the context of HIV-AIDS, there is no mention of gay men in the White Paper.  Women are mentioned.  I remember speaking ten years ago at an interparliamentary union conference in India where I remarked on the absence of any reference to homosexuality, gay men, the gay community, etc.  While I know homosexuality is a sensitive issue, I warned the conference that the issue was a time bomb.  If we give in and do not include sexuality and homosexuality in our White Paper, the others will regard our omission as acceding to their view.  Colleagues of mine on the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and members of our political group who support the UNFPA have said many countries assert there are no gay men in their countries. That is rubbish.  The issue needs to be examined.</P>
        <P>It is a pity there is no mention in the White Paper of our commitment under the 28-year programme of action, POA, adopted by the international conference on population and development in Cairo.  There is also no reference to the fourth conference on women in Beijing and no specific mention of the UNFPA.  Will the Minister take another look at this and include a statement of support for the UNFPA?</P><Col N="1855"/>
        <?oasys _cl11- ?><P>Senator Kitt mentioned the useful meeting the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs had yesterday where the issue of Darfur was raised.  There was also a very interesting presentation by a courageous Afghani woman, Mary Akrami, who was sponsored by an Irish group called SAFE.  Ms Akrami made some very valid points about the waste of money.  She pointed out that many European countries send people to Afghanistan who do not speak the language or know the culture and who remain for six weeks and then go home.  I call this crisis tourism.</P>
        <P>We should consider carefully the point Ms Akrami made that what would really help is the kind of assistance being offered by the Rape Crisis Centre which has offered to train Afghan personnel in counselling and in managing the repercussions of a rape situation.  This gives better bang for our buck.  It is also safer because we retain our Irish personnel in our community exposed to no danger while passing on skills to courageous Afghani and other people who will bring them back to their countries.</P>
        <P>This approach is also in our interest because if matters improve, these people will turn out to be leaders of their community and, perhaps, leaders of their country.  We must be civilised, generous and flexible and not always insist the money is earmarked for overseas or that we must send so many people abroad to do an academic programme.  That is hogwash.  We should bring people to this country and train them.</P>
        <P>One thing I like about the Minister of State is that he is prepared to take a bit of a risk, to think unconventionally and break the boundaries.  This is something that could help make his name.  He should look again at this area and decide &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;, that in addition to sending money abroad, he will institute programmes in universities, medical faculties, hospitals and centres such as the Rape Crisis Centre.  He should decide to support people by giving them the skills to deal with disastrous situations in their countries.</P>
        <P>I welcome the White Paper which I believe is useful and welcome the change of name mentioned.  I have some reservations, but they are not matters on which I find myself in contradiction with the Government.  On the question of Congo, for example, I only seek further and better particulars.  I have also suggested that when the paper mentions gender-based violence, it should automatically include gay people because we are such a target throughout the world.  Ireland&rsquo;s relatively decent attitude in this area puts us in a position to include this reference, which would invite praise rather than ridicule.</P>
        <P>I welcome the White Paper and the implications of its publication.  I welcome the change of the name of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs to the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Irish Aid.  I also welcome the measures included in the paper to supervise the aid we give.  I compliment the Minister of State and the Government on continuing their support <Col N="1856"/>for the UNFPA.  This is critically important, especially in circumstances where powerful groups such as the Bush Administration shamefully cut back on funding because they object, on allegedly moral grounds, to the inclusion of contraception education, etc.  This makes it even more vital that the Minister of State makes it clear to the international community our continuing and unwavering support of the remarkable and valuable work done by the UNFPA.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. C. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Members for their strong engagement with the development issues that are my responsibility in Irish Aid.  I reaffirm that the White Paper is about reiterating, reaffirming and confirming our commitment to achieving our 0.7% target by 2012.  One might well ask why we do not legislate for this.  We have decided legislation is not a good precedent to set in this area because then the Government would come under pressure from other interest groups to legislate for their area.  For these reasons, it is deemed inappropriate to legislate for the commitment.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Finance and his Department have backed our commitment with hard cash.  For example, in the two years since I have been in charge of this portfolio, our emergency and recovery budget has gone from &euro;20 million to &euro;60 million.  This is likely to increase further following the Estimates to be published at the end of the month.  We are meeting our targets.  When I decided to reverse the commitment of 2007, I felt it was important to set down clear milestones against which the public and the Oireachtas could gauge whether we were meeting our commitments.</P>
        <P>These milestones were an interim target of 0.5% in 2007, 0.6% of gross domestic product, GDP, in 2010 and finally the achievement of 0.7% in 2012.  We are well on the way to achieving that.  For a coincidence of reasons, this year we will achieve 0.5%.  This is mainly because of a contribution from the Department of Finance of &euro;60 million, a commitment which should have been made over a number of years but which was front-loaded into one year because of a commitment to multilateral debt relief.  Even when this is taken out of the equation next year, we will maintain our commitment of 0.5%.</P>
        <P>We are meeting our targets and there is no question of the commitment not being met.  I have full confidence that even if there is a change of Government, something I do not anticipate, Members opposite will be more than willing to meet the commitment.  The target is realistic and achievable, whereas the previous target was neither and had to be overturned.</P>
        <P>Senator Terry raised the issue of moneys being spent on NGOs in Central America.  I visited Nicaragua, Central America and South America.  It is important to remember that while Ireland concentrates its aid in eight programme countries, six in Africa and two in Asia, we support projects <Col N="1857"/>in approximately 128 countries.  We support projects across the globe without prejudice.  Much of this support is led by the good work done by our missionaries and I am sure Senator Terry saw that when she made her visit to Latin America.  Our missionaries are there and they also have a footprint in Asia.  We make our contributions in that area.</P>
        <P>Senator Kitt raised the issue of Sudan.  The Minister and I were answering questions in the D&aacute;il on the issue less than an hour ago.  We are anxious to facilitate a D&aacute;il or Seanad debate on the situation.  What is going on is horrific.  Prime Minister Blair has organised a conference which it is hoped will have some effect.  The Minister and I have been to Darfur where we have met Ministers and Prime Ministers.  However, as the Minister said in the D&aacute;il, one really needs to affect the President of Sudan if we want to achieve real change.  Thankfully, he will attend the conference organised by Prime Minister Blair.  We need to maintain focus and pressure on him to accept the deployment of a strong multilateral force to protect the people there.  The situation has worsened.</P>
        <P>In that context, Senator Kitt also raised the issue of security for NGOs.  In the wake of the tragic death of Margaret Hassan in Iraq, I initiated a security review of our overseas aid personnel so that they would be aware of dangers in the field.  Owing to recent events in Darfur and elsewhere, I am of a mind to offer the same security advice and assistance to NGO personnel when they return at Christmas.  I hope to organise this during Christmas and the new year because NGO personnel work in dangerous situations where the Government and governmental actors cannot be present for various reasons.</P>
        <P>We are keen to add to NGOs&rsquo; capacity to continue their good work.  It is not often pointed out that Ireland gives &euro;100 million to NGOs every year.  This money goes to Irish-based NGOs predominantly, but we also support international NGOs, such as the Red Cross, that are important in crisis situations.</P>
        <P>I agree with Senator Norris regarding enhancing local capacity rather than bussing out Irish people.  This has been the approach of Irish Aid.  While domestic governments and employees of NGOs working in the tsunami-affected regions complained about people crowding in, giving unneeded blankets and providing unwanted and unfocused help, this criticism was not made about Irish NGOs, which are effective.</P>
        <P>The mainstay of our support for the Red Cross and many international NGOs that play a part in emergency situations relates to raising local capacity.  We fund the Red Cross in particular to enhance capacity locally for emergency preparedness.  The approach is&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>What about training people in this country?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1858"/>
      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. C. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;being followed.  We agree with the thrust of the Senator&rsquo;s comments about bringing people to Ireland to avail of the excellence on hand, but we prefer to deliver training locally because it can be expensive.  Where appropriate, we try to seek out centres of excellence near or in the region in question.</P>
        <P>We are proud to remain a strong funder of the UNFPA notwithstanding the criticism of that agency, none of which is based on evidence.  Frequently, I receive letters from domestic and international groups on this subject stating that we fund all sorts of services, but that is not the case and the UNFPA does not carry out those services.  For example, it does not support or fund the one child policy in China, a main focal point of the criticism we receive.</P>
        <P>The UNFPA is a good agency and enjoys our total confidence in its work to date.  It is central to the empowerment of women, gender issues generally and the provision of health, sexual and reproductive advice.  I apologise to Senator Norris that we did not use the phrase &ldquo;sexual and reproductive rights&rdquo; in the White Paper, but we are not shy about using the word &ldquo;sexual&rdquo;.  The Senator knows that I mention sexual and reproductive rights in virtually every speech I make.</P>
        <P>That certain donors, including the United States of America, have pared back funding for anti-AIDS programmes involving the use of condoms in some countries, such as Uganda, is of concern.  We are not one of those donors.  European donors and those of like mind to the Irish have made up the shortfall, but the Ugandans have accepted the other donors&rsquo; conditional support and President Museveni is of an opinion that may not be shared by the international donor community.  However, we are ploughing ahead in providing assistance in respect of sexual and reproductive rights undeterred by these changes in the landscape.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We are aware of the AIDS situation confronting homosexual males and the gay community in general.  At an international conference I attended in London a few months ago, this issue arose in respect of Asia more than Africa.  There has been a startling upsurge in AIDS cases in Asia because of economic growth and changing sexual practices, that is, people engaging in both homosexual and heterosexual sex but not informing others or being unaware of the health implications.  This is a phenomenon in Asia rather than Africa where the focus is on an alarming increase in the number of women affected by the virus.  Part of our programme will address this issue.</P>
        <P>Our aid is predicated on social interventions in terms of health, education and hunger.  The purpose of the hunger task force is to give an international and domestic lead.  Hunger and food security issues and the deeper matter of rural development and making African farming practices more productive are of concern.  We all know the history in question.  For example, India&rsquo;s recent success was built on the green rev<Col N="1859"/>olution of the 1950s when the nature of farming changed radically and more productivity was introduced to the methods.  However, that has not been the African case and we are keen to determine how to improve the situation in terms of removing the dependence on external donors&rsquo; assistance, be it food assistance or cash to buy food in local markets.  We want to ensure that local and regional markets are strong enough for people to feed themselves, which is a basic requirement.  It is a tragedy that, during the past 20 to 30 years, all international donors have ignored this subject.</P>
        <P>Ireland hopes to take the lead through the creation of the hunger task force and I hope to make announcements regarding its terms of reference and chairman in the next month or two.  We will announce the full membership at the beginning of 2007 with a mandate to report in six months and provide international leadership.  Many people at the international level are hopeful that Ireland will take a necessary lead.  Kofi Annan, who is facing into retirement, wants to address this matter because a green revolution has not occurred in Africa.  As an African, he is keen to see international efforts focused in this regard.</P>
        <P>We have doubled our spending to tackle AIDS to &euro;100 million.  Together with the 0.7% by 2012 target announced at the UN, this was one of the bravest decisions made by the Taoiseach in consultation with me.  We did so owing to the issue&rsquo;s absorption capacity, that is, it can absorb money.  Dr. Peter Piot of UNAIDS referred to an &euro;8 billion shortfall in AIDS funding and it is in this respect that we want to provide leadership.  Deputy Gormley was present for the announcement and stated in the Lower House that the considerable applause received by the Taoiseach made it heartwarming to be an Irish citizen.  The applause came from across the board and may have been the most generous response to any statesman addressing the UN summit on AIDS.  Ireland is taking the lead and people, including the Irish public, are watching how we deploy and spend money.</P>
        <P>As we increase spending to meet the 0.7% target, we are approaching a medium-term review of our staffing requirements.  We were fortunate to receive 20 extra staff as an immediate short-term response from the Department of Finance.  In our last Estimates campaign, the Department saw the merits of my argument that we needed those people immediately.  Some 14 of the 20 staff will be involved in the monitoring and evaluation of our growing programme directly and all of the 20 are present to meet the short-term need of ensuring that the programme is well evaluated and monitored and that taxpayers&rsquo; money is spent appropriately.</P>
        <P>The medium-term needs include the level of staffing required to meet the programme&rsquo;s significant expansions.  This year&rsquo;s allocation is &euro;732 million and, while the Estimates have yet to be <Col N="1860"/>published, Irish Aid&rsquo;s spending will probably exceed &euro;800 million next year.  By 2012, the allocation will be &euro;1.5 billion, a considerable amount that must be deployed appropriately.  I am anxious to do so in a planned fashion.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I accept contributors&rsquo; statements that we must involve more people who are not involved in the Irish Aid programme, be they members of NGOs or volunteers.  In the new year, we will announce a number of measures in respect of volunteering, a one-stop shop as it were, to advertise the opportunity for Irish people to volunteer.  That is hugely important because for this first time in our history we in Ireland have the human capacity as well as the financial resources to make a difference and to play our own personnel into the picture in a much more meaningful way.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We are keen to do something in the third level sector, which is beloved of Senator Norris.  We published a strategy document with the Higher Education Authority, which will be the central focal point for our efforts and our engagement with the third level sector.  There has been the phenomenon in the past year or two of various universities and third level institutions coming to us with bold and imaginative proposals, all of them dependent on securing funding.  We are anxious that whatever we do with the third level sector is coherent and properly organised and orchestrated in that sense.  We have chosen the Higher Education Authority to be the focal point through which our engagement with the third level sector will occur.  That does not stop institutions coming to us with their projects which may not fit into that.</P>
        <P>This process will be twofold.  At education level, we want to deepen public understanding, both academic and non-academic, of development issues.  We are facing into a busy year, where we want to broaden the knowledge of what we are doing in Irish Aid, plus deepen the existing knowledge of development issues within our institutions and among the citizenry.  A broadening and deepening of that knowledge will occur between now and 2012.</P>
        <P>We will spend a great deal of money on public information campaigns, particularly on the White Paper and on where the money is being spent, and we will continue that in the new year and onwards to 2012.  The information campaign will not be excessive, but at this point, given the amounts of money involved, the public should have a strong knowledge of how that money is being spent.  We hope the debate will mature, as it has in other areas, where people get a full understanding of the issues that face us.  It is easy for people to point to local needs such as in the health or education services in Ireland and ask why we are spending all this money abroad when we could spend it at home, but it is part of our international responsibility.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I will publish the human development index in the next month or so. The UN has asked us specifically to launch the index in regional terms. It brings good news for Ireland; we are climbing <Col N="1861"/>up the index again.  We were eighth when it was published last year.  Although I have not received the full report, I understand from the draft reports and indications that we are climbing even higher in wealth terms.  With that wealth comes considerable responsibility, moral and otherwise, and we should not be afraid to step up to the line in the area of development.  It is altruistic and charitable work.  Irish aid is untied and therefore not given with a specific geopolitical or other immoral purpose.  We are not an arms supplier.  We do not see ourselves as a major player in any of those settings.</P>
        <P>We are a moral voice in the world and the White Paper places development at the heart of our foreign policy.  We are not delinking from foreign policy.  Some other European countries have separated their development assistance programme into an agency type status but we do not favour that for Irish Aid.  The name change was important because it reaffirms the role of the Department of Foreign Affairs.  The White Paper, in substantial terms as opposed to the name change which is superficial at one level, puts development assistance at the heart of our foreign policy.  Let us be straight and honest about the fact that Ireland is influential on the world stage because of its policy on development.  People take a leaf from what we do.  We listen and are listened to, and we are welcome in various settings across the world precisely because of what we do on the development aid side.  The proof of that in a real sense was when my senior colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, was chosen as the only developed country representative to be a UN envoy.  That was unusual and is reflective of the strong role we play in development.  It is recognised, by Kofi Annan and the UN generally that Ireland is a model UN member and we hope to continue as such.  The area of development assistance is where we can prove to be the best and show the kind of leadership which is wanted by everybody in this House, irrespective of party political or no political affiliation.  They want us to show a lead because, with Irish people, it comes not just from the heart, but from the head.</P>
        <P>I am proud to be part of this expansion in the programme.  I know it will enjoy cross-party support in the future.  We need to rally around on a cross-party basis to support this.  Notwithstanding our obvious wealth, when one considers the deficiencies in infrastructure and continuing pockets of poverty here, it would be easy and open to the unscrupulous political operator simply to state we should cut back on Irish aid and put it into domestic areas.  It is important there is an all-party approach to ensure we, as parliamentarians and citizens of the world, can robustly make the point that aid can work and it is valuable for a country to spend large amounts of money in this area.</P>

	<P>I move: </P>
        <P LI="1">&ldquo;That Seanad &Eacute;ireann:</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash142" />congratulates those progressive local authorities, such as Fingal County Council, who are now predicating planning permissions with energy and insulation standards which are twice as efficient as those of the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash142" />recognises that following the delayed introduction of an energy rating label for all houses from next year that regrettably hundreds of thousands of existing houses with poor energy efficiency, such as hollow block built homes, will have a lower energy rating and consequently a lower resale value and that home owners will continue to pay more every single year into the future to pay for the heating of those homes;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash142" />is conscious that this and the studied indifference of the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to our commitments under the Kyoto Protocols with regard to insulation and energy standards for the last eight years has resulted in the construction of at least 250,000 substandard houses, and that these facts may well leave the Department open to charges of misfeasance or malfeasance and the State exposed to claims for compensation; and</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash142" />demands that the Government take immediate action to bring Ireland into line with Kyoto Protocols by adopting the Fingal standards as national standards and by completely prohibiting the use of hollow blocks for home building;</P>
        <P LI="1"><Miles com="mdash142" />Additionally this House rejects completely the attempts to transfer <Col N="1863"/>responsibility for this mess to the citizen who is being asked to turn down the heat as part of the Power of One campaign when the truth is that this problem can only be resolved through the power of two departments.&rdquo;</P>
        <P FLI="0">I welcome the Minister of State to the House and I look forward to the debate.  This is the fourth time I have raised this issue and I know I will not make any progress, but what I am highlighting is highly irresponsible and scandalous.  There is a lack of understanding, which may be deliberate or otherwise, in high places.</P>
        <P>The energy regulations for buildings are made by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government on the advice of the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources.  Two Departments are caught in the middle on this issue and that is causing a problem.  I am raising the issue because young couples are paying top dollar for their houses.  They will pay mortgages for 30 or more years but they will also pay twice as much as they should to heat those houses.  The saleability of their houses will be much reduced when the building energy rating is attached.  On 1 January 2007 every new house on the market will have to have a building energy rating, which outlines how sound is its insulation, how much it costs to heat and how it retains its heat.  Houses built in the Dublin area since 1998 will be in the rating&rsquo;s second class.</P>
        <P>The political issue relates to the Kyoto Agreement, to which Ireland signed up in 1997.  The State agreed to meet certain commitments and the Government was required to take decisions regarding heat loss and so on.  Appalling decisions were taken and, according to a well publicised document released under the Freedom of Information Act 1997, the reason for them was the protection of the hollow block industry.  The strategy at the time was to protect the industry.  A letter signed by an official in the Department of the Environment in May 1998 states:</P>
        <P LI="1">We have to review our technical guidance documentation due to CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions targets that we now have to meet under the Kyoto Convention 1997.  However, we do not want to signal this to the outside world just yet because the next leap in building standard installation will probably involve making it difficult for hollow block construction, used widely in the Dublin area, to survive.  This has implications for manufacturers of hollow blocks.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This is appalling.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In 1992, Albert Reynolds returned from the Edinburgh Summit with &pound;8 billion in his back pocket to spend on the people.  A survey conducted on where the money was spent some time later found that &pound;6 billion of this passed through one company, CRH.  These are the people we are trying to protect for all the wrong reasons.  In <Col N="1864"/>1998 the Minister was poorly advised to take this decision and it was completely wrong.</P>
        <P>Since then 250,000 houses have been built in the greater Dublin region with hollow blocks, which would be used to build cow sheds in the Minister of State&rsquo;s constituency if people could not afford any better.  They would not be used in Cork, Kerry or elsewhere in Munster to build houses but such blocks are used everywhere in Dublin for speculative housing.  It is completely and utterly wrong to protect an industry that does not need protection.</P>
        <P>On television last week, the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources stated one of the reasons the changeover from hollow blocks did not take place was it would add &pound;800 to the cost of a house and he did not want to get into the issue.  The Minister of State and I debated the first-time buyer&rsquo;s grant on a number of occasions and I could not disagree that builders added the grant to the price of the house and, therefore, the buyer gained nothing.  I opposed my Fine Gael colleagues by stating there was sense in that argument and we had to be careful about it.</P>
        <P>However, on the other hand, if the price of the house was increased, the grant would not be added to the price because people were only paying what they could afford.  The reality is the change from hollow blocks would have come out of the builder&rsquo;s pocket.</P>
        <P>I draw attention to what is being done in this area.  I am pleased to advise the House that Fingal County Council, in my local authority area, is attaching to planning permissions a condition in respect of energy and insulation standards, which are twice as efficient as those required by the Departments of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources and Environment, Heritage and Local Government, whichever of those Departments we want to blame for that.  I am informed that Bray, D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown, Clare and Galway county council areas are also considering the requirement of these precise standards.  A position will develop whereby we will be left behind in terms of the Government requirement and national figures in this area.</P>
        <P>The energy label that will come into play on 1 January next, which is stated in the Government&rsquo;s amendment to the motion to be an advance, is being delayed.  It could have been in place from 1 January this year.  I asked in the House this time last year that it be brought into operation in January of this year, but the Government refused to do that because it wanted to help the building industry again.  Is it any wonder that the Government is tied in so much with the building industry and that it gets such bad publicity in that respect?  This was wrong.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On 1 January next year every new house put on the market will be required to have an energy rating.  That rating will show that houses built with hollow blocks will be of a lower standard than houses that are insulated.  That requirement should also apply to second-hand houses from <Col N="1865"/>next year and should not be deferred to a later date.  I ask the Minister of State to examine this requirement carefully.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In their amendment, Members on the Government side congratulate the Government on its prompt action in implementing the EU energy performance directive by bringing in the new rating from 1 January 2007, but that is factually incorrect.  I asked the Government in this House a year ago to implement that directive on 1 January, which was when it was due to come into operation, but it delayed its implementation.  The Government side will vote here tonight on something that is incorrect; its amendment is factually incorrect.  Members on the Government side should check the record of the House.  This time last year when I asked for this directive to be brought into operation at the time Europe required us to do so, namely in January of this year, the Government delayed it implementation.  It did not implement it early.</P>
        <P>The amendment to the motion congratulates the Government its prompt action in implementing the EU energy performance of buildings directive, but that is not correct.  The reality is that the standard of insulation has been reduced, on foot of reasons given by the Government, on the basis of the energy research group set up effectively by the Department and known as the Building Regulations Advisory Board.  The Government did this to partly facilitate the building of certain constructions.  The Government is effectively saying that it will not apply the required standard because it is too difficult to build or it is easier to build without adhering to it.  The reason for this is that hollow block building involves one row of blocks while cavity wall building involves two rows of blocks with a space left in between, and buildings with cavity walls cannot be slapped up as quickly as those with hollow block walls.  That is what the Government was considering in terms of the building of constructions.  Another reason for its action was to avoid our going too far ahead of the UK where currently proposed values are less ambitious.  What is being done in this area is being determined by the UK in terms of it protecting its building industry.</P>
        <P>The last paragraph of the amendment to the motion states that the House endorses the performance-based approach, which facilitates a choice of building materials, etc., but what does that mean?  I will explain it but in doing so I will probably quickly lose my audience.  This is the difficulty we have in getting the media and ordinary people to consider this problem.  They will not know about it until they are caught.  The problem is that there are two methods of measuring in terms of insulation.  One is the elemental method whereby all that is measured is the value of the insulation of what is put into the House and the other method, which is the one that has been decided to be used here, is the overall heat loss method.  A recent approach taken by the building research establishment in the UK, which <Col N="1866"/>is independent, is the correct way, namely to measure how much energy it takes to heat a house.  The reality is that hollow block built homes require twice as much energy to heat as timber framed homes and those in which other insulation methods have been used.</P>
        <P>I guarantee that the Minister of State will not deal in his reply with what I propose.  If we were to take on board what I suggest and if the Government was to bring the national figures in line with has been adopted by Fingal County Council, that would result in a 70,000 tonnes reduction in Ireland&rsquo;s CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions per year not only for one year but forever.  If the Minister of State was to accept what I have proposed, in approximately 12 years&rsquo; time we would save a million tonnes in terms of the level of our usual emissions, which would bring us well into line with what is required of us under the Kyoto Protocol. These measures could be introduced now.  If they were we would gain by them.  They would also result in a gain for house buyers, our energy requirements and the global environment.  There is no reason the Minister of State should not accept and adopt my proposals.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I second the motion introduced by the Independent group.  I have spoken on this issue previously and raised it on many occasions in this House and in other forums on which I serve.  I commend the Independent group on introducing this motion.</P>
        <P>I also commend the initiative taken by Fingal County Council on energy and insulation standards, which will require new houses to be 60% more energy efficient than the existing minimum standards and which will cope with what is essentially a Dublin-based problem, the scourge of hollow brick built homes.  In taking the bull by the horns, Fingal County Council is highlighting the gross inaction by the Departments of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, which have failed dismally to tackle the problem of poor energy efficiency and ignored our commitment under the Kyoto Protocol.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Another example of efficient initiatives was put in place by Longford County Council which has installed an energy efficient heating system in 40 existing houses in St. Matthew's Park, Ballymahon.  This project was featured and highlighted on a recent RTE programme presented by Mr. Duncan Stewart.  With mounting environmental concerns over energy use, conservation is more important than even.  The concept of green buildings constitutes a way to dramatically conserve energy and to contribute to a healthy internal and external environment in various ways.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Ireland has many reasons to improve energy efficiency in houses.  Finite fuel reserves and global resources are under pressure, as demonstrated by the Ukrainian-Russian gas supply dispute and Ireland currently has a very high energy dependency, of some 88%, compared with other EU member states, as shown in the breakdown <Col N="1867"/>of figures for 1990 to 1998.  For many, the debate comes down to cost &mdash; energy efficient buildings are simply cheaper to run.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Some 40% of all energy used in Europe goes into building; thus, almost half of the energy consumed in Europe is used in building for the basic requirements of light, heat and power.  Most people&rsquo;s idea of fuel consumption is that large industrial plants consume vast amounts of energy and they find it difficult to realise that they also use energy and that inefficiencies in energy use are to be found in their own homes.  In the United States, building accounts for 37% of all energy use and 68% of all electricity use and the building industry causes six times more damage than cars in terms of energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions.</P>
        <P>In 2005, our greenhouse gas emissions levels were 25% above the 1990 level and if we do not reduce such emissions by 2012, the State faces a &euro;5 billion EU fine.  Our national target under the Kyoto Protocol is to be 13% above the 1990 levels, or just over 63 million tonnes a year.  This figure becomes legally binding between 2008 and 2012.</P>
        <P Just="Left">By 2004, the rise was already at 23.1% and it is estimated that Ireland will overshoot the Kyoto target by more than 7 million tonnes per year by 2008.  The Government is required to cap the emissions that industry is allowed to produce.  Arising from this, an emissions trading system has been created, allowing companies that have exceeded their individual caps to buy credits from companies and countries which have achieved, or exceeded, their target reductions.  In an attempt to avoid fines caused by its own lack of action on the Kyoto targets, the Government is to buy 3.7 million tonnes of credits per year which will cost between &euro;180 million and more than &euro;1 billion, depending on the price of carbon credits during the period.</P>
        <P>In Ireland, 30% of all CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions emanates from the heating of buildings.  In fact, 50% of all CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions is generated by the construction and heating of buildings.  The construction industry is one of the largest contributors to CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions.</P>
        <P>Ireland is suffering from the lack of a coherent national energy policy, for which one can point the finger at the incompetence of the Departments of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and Communications, Marine and Natural Resources.  The national development plan from 1999 to 2000 set aside a mere &euro;145 million for energy infrastructure.  Both Fingal and Wicklow county councils are running pilot projects in which new houses must be 60% more energy efficient than the existing minimum standards.  D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council also has plans to introduce a similar scheme.</P>
        <P>From January next, every home built in Ireland will have an energy rating, from A1 to G3, similar to that found on refrigerators and washing machines.  This will extend to all houses sold or <Col N="1868"/>rented from January 2009.  Pending the introduction of the regulations, Sustainable Energy Ireland has proposed to give all new houses a B rating.  This is farcical, to put it mildly.  Ratings will have to be revised within a short period of time if houses constructed to current regulations receive a B rating, which is not a true indicator of their real energy efficiency.  As those living in new homes know, they are incredibly expensive to heat and extremely wasteful of energy.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In 1998 the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government engaged in a cover-up with regard to the revision of the building regulations on the grounds that such a revision would require a change in building-standard insulation, which would make it difficult for hollow-block constructions, used widely in this country, to survive.  New regulations were not introduced until 2003, with an exemption for all planning applications lodged before 31 December 2003.  This meant that up until the end of 2005, tens of thousands of new homes were built to 1997 regulation standards.  The Government put the interests of the building industry ahead of the public interest.  Once again, the hard-pressed buyer was hit by this uncaring Government.  The interference of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in the marketplace, to the benefit of the building industry, has inflicted an enormous cost on home owners and the environment.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Fine Gael is committed to increasing the funding available to Energy Action and all of those similarly engaged in energy efficiency initiatives with the specific target of bringing existing housing stocks up to the insulation standards of newly built homes.  It is also committed to extending grant aid to householders so those who wish to convert existing home heating technologies to renewable energy can do so.</P>

        <P FLI="0" el="5">I welcome this debate, which is a natural follow-on from our earlier discussion on the Green Paper, Towards A Sustainable Energy Future for Ireland.  One of the issues mentioned in that discussion was the Government&rsquo;s Greener Homes grants for the installation of renewable energy systems in individual dwellings.  The Department has received almost 8,000 grant applications since the scheme was introduced in March 2006.  At present, grants are only payable for wood pellet and wood chip systems but it would be useful if they were made available for other alternative systems, such as heat pumps, windmills and so forth.  It was pointed out that it can be difficult to get wood pellets and wood chip in some parts of the country.  I know of one company which produces such products in north Galway but availability is not uniform throughout the country.  This should be investigated further because it is important that people have access to the raw <Col N="1870"/>materials which come under the scheme being promoted.</P>
        <P>With regard to the Green Paper itself, the Minister made reference to economic competitiveness, the sustainability of the environment and our commitment to secure 30% of electricity from renewable sources by 2020.  The overriding issue of concern, however, is that of energy efficiency and the Minister has set a target of 20%, to be achieved over the same period.  Security of supply is also important and is of particular concern to older people in winter.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Climate change was raised in the context of our discussion on the proposed ban on drift net fishing.  We now see exotic species of fish off our coast, which is a clear indication that the climate is changing.  We must deal with this issue in the context of the global environment.  An important element of any discussion on energy efficiency is the question of saving money, both in households and businesses.  However, by cutting down on our energy use, we also fulfil our international obligations with regard to greenhouse gas emissions.  Climate change is a major global environmental issue.  Our membership of the European Union and the international community obliges us to respond to global climate change in a co-ordinated way.  While we have taken small steps to date, we would all like to see more progress towards the 2020 targets, to which I referred earlier.  Ireland must be to the fore in continuing to make gradual improvements in the response to climate change.  We are participating in the EU emission trading system and are taking all necessary measures to ensure that Ireland meets its climate change commitments under the Kyoto Protocol.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Significant progress has been made since the national climate change strategy was adopted in 2000.  That strategy is now being reviewed and a more ambitious one will be put in place by the end of the year.  This will assist Ireland in reaching the Kyoto targets set down for the period 2008 to 2012.</P>
        <P>Since 1997, a huge range of policies spread across many Departments and agencies have been implemented by the Government.  Most recently, a bio-energy ministerial task force has been established to drive an ambitious programme of climate change measures.  I hope some of these measures adopted by the Government will be successful.</P>
        <P>I wish to comment on the hollow block construction referred to by Senator O&rsquo;Toole.  I am not that familiar with such hollow block construction in Galway or rural Ireland.  It is mostly in Dublin that hollow block construction is used.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>We use it in cowhouses in Galway and Kerry.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>We will talk about the human population first.  An independent study in 2000 carried out in UCD demonstrated that hollow block construction could be insulated to comply with <Col N="1871"/>higher thermal performance standards.  I am more familiar with the two-block cavity wall, as Senator O&rsquo;Toole called it.  The wooden house type of structure, often referred to as American-style houses, are very popular now, but they are very expensive, as the Minister of State would appreciate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>They are not.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>There has been a debate involving a particular building company to get rid of the hollow block.  If that company wishes to make the case, I am prepared to listen to what has been and will be said.  I do not believe it is as big a problem as Senator O&rsquo;Toole has suggested.</P>
        <P>I do not foresee the Government suggesting it has any preference for a particular form of house building.  The Irish Timber Frame Manufacturers&rsquo; Association has co-operated with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to implement a package of measures to facilitate timber frame construction.  This was recommended in a report on timber frame housing in Ireland commissioned by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  Timber frame houses are clearly very effective and are more popular.  We should put in place some measures to lower the cost of providing that type of house.</P>
        <P>We have a very interesting motion that covers two Departments, as Senator O&rsquo;Toole has noted.  We have had some debate on the Green Paper.  The progress we have made should be recognised, and I commend the Department for that.  We clearly must make more progress to try to meet the standards laid down.  I hope the Government can do that as soon as possible.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I would also like to compliment my colleague, Senator O&rsquo;Toole, on tabling this motion.  I know the Senator and Senator Brian Hayes have been pushing this matter.  When I was considering it myself, I thought I had struck it lucky because I found something that was so absurd it would grab the attention of the House.  Senator O&rsquo;Toole beat me to it.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am referring to this extraordinary and shameful Department memo pointed out by the Senator which states the Department does not want to signal the situation to the outside because it might create some difficulties for hollow block manufacturers.  It is staggering that the welfare of the country, our commitment to the Kyoto Protocol and the welfare of people purchasing these homes should be of less significance than a section of the building industry to which, lamentably, this Government appears to be still in thrall. That is something which is utterly shameful and which has not been faced in any contributions.  I sincerely hope the Minister of State will have the guts to address the issue and apologise for this utterly shameful and unforgivable attitude.  I hope the Irish people get to know a bit about this mem<Col N="1872"/>orandum, the cynical attitude and the favouring of one section.  There was a green cement company here but the Government did absolutely nothing to encourage it because of its commitments to the major cement groups.  That is absolutely regrettable.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We are in a boom, and many houses are being built.  From time to time the Government compliments itself on the number of houses being built.  The problem with this is that houses consume much energy and produce various by-products.  Buildings of all types account for at least 40% of our energy consumption, with a cost of &euro;3.5 billion a year.  As a result, and particularly with the projected rise in mortgages, young people especially will find great difficulties.</P>
        <P>I am quoting to a certain extent from an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> by Mr. Frank McDonald from a very fine series of investigative reports.  He quotes Sustainable Energy Ireland in estimating the average household&rsquo;s annual energy bill for electricity and space heating at approximately &euro;1,700.  Associated CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions are 8.5 tonnes a year for each household.  One of the reasons for this is that the building of the houses is not energy efficient, as Senator O&rsquo;Toole has indicated, particularly with the hollow block construction.</P>
        <P>We have known this for a long time.  Some ten, 20 or 30 years ago I remember people talking about the need to insulate houses, even just to keep the heat in.  We were not worrying about Kyoto at that stage.  We have done precious little to address this subject.  This places the memo in a singularly cynical condition.</P>
        <P>The new regulations were not introduced until 2002, and there was an exemption for planning permissions lodged before the end of the year.  The consequence of that was nearly 300,000 homes being built with the old standards.  They were energy inefficient.  The Government, as I have stated, put the interests of one section of the cement industry above everything else.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We are part of the European Union.  Whether it comes early or late and whether we procrastinate, delay and seek derogations, we will have to face our obligations eventually.  The European Union is involved in this area through the performance of a buildings directive.  Under that, every house offered for sale or rent will be required to have a building energy rating.  It will be just like the labelling spoken of earlier.</P>
        <P>Again, this was supposed to come into effect on 1 January 2007 for new houses.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>It was 2006.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I stand corrected.  Regardless of whether the introduction was 2006, it will not be put in place yet anyway.  Cynically, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, got a transitional arrangement agreement under which construction works for which planning permission was sought on or before June 30 last are exempt provided they are substantially completed by the end <Col N="1873"/>of June 2008.  It is another exercise in procrastination, another delivery of a large number of energy inefficient houses on to the market.  This is to the detriment of the customers and our obligations.</P>
        <P>We have mentioned the Kyoto Protocol.  We have already had to buy &euro;185 million of carbon credits.  If this matter is not properly addressed, it is estimated we could pay up to &euro;5 billion in a few years&rsquo; time.  That is a big bill for the taxpayer.</P>
        <P>The general standard is still relatively low because nothing has been done.  This is another area in which the Minister could be involved in, part L of the building regulations.  That section deals with energy efficiency.  Nothing has been done to strengthen the area since we adopted the current version in 2002.  It will not be revised until 2008, as once again an option not to do so was exercised by the Government.  It has again weaselled out of it, deliberately avoiding the targets set.</P>
<?oasys _ic10- ?>
        <P>This makes the amendment to tonight&rsquo;s motion one of the most laughable I have ever seen in this House.  Senator O&rsquo;Toole is completely correct.  The penultimate paragraph has the gall to congratulate &ldquo;the Government for its prompt action in implementing the EU energy performance of buildings directive&rdquo;.  Is the Government stark raving mad?  How can it congratulate itself on actions it has not taken?  It is congratulating itself on an absolute dereliction of duty in this area.  I am surprised even the brass necks on the other side of the House are prepared to try to pull this one off.</P>
<?oasys _ic0- ?>
        <P>The issue does not just concern homes, but businesses.  There are a significant number of new office blocks, particularly in Dublin.  These are not especially energy efficient.  Office blocks, by and large, consume twice as much energy as naturally ventilated alternatives.  I do not want to be seen to attack authority all the time so I wish to acknowledge that Fingal County Council has produced an environmentally friendly building in the shape of Fingal County Hall.  It is energy efficient and the type of building we could construct everywhere instead of environmentally destructive buildings.</P>
        <P>I have spoken about the way the Government, for its own reasons which may be fairly murky, favours one sector of the cement industry over another to the disadvantage of the green cement sector.  The cement industry represents a highly carbon-intensive part of our industrial framework and is the second largest industrial source of emissions.  It emits into the Irish atmosphere one tonne of CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2 <?oasys _cf1- ?> for every tonne of cement it produces.  A tonne for a tonne is a staggering statistic but it can be reduced and has been reduced by up to 300,000 tonnes per annum, or 7%.</P>
        <P>In 1990, when wooden houses were first constructed, they represented 1% of the total but that figure now stands at 27%.  In a few years it will be 50%.  Senator Kitt might have been correct that in the early days they were relatively <Col N="1874"/>expensive, but they are now cheaper as well as more efficient than other methods of construction.  They are much more comfortable to live in, being cool in the summer and warm in the winter.  They can also be built much more rapidly than other forms of house.</P>
        <P>Information on wastage in buildings and on suggested alternatives was communicated to the Government by Mr. McCaughey, who also drew attention to the Government&rsquo;s obligations, in the course of evidence to the Joint Committee on Environment and Local Government.  He said:</P>
        <P LI="1">Although I sent my original letter to the then Minister, Deputy Dempsey, informing him of the British Government Departments&rsquo; research on 4 February 1998, nothing was done about it until 1 January 2003.  During those five years, a staggering 250,000 houses were built to a standard of energy efficiency that was 35% below what it should have been.</P>
        <P FLI="0">Again, this was a bad deal for the country, the house buyer and the house owner and something of which this Government should be thoroughly ashamed.</P>
        <P>I commend Senator O&rsquo;Toole on putting this motion on the Order Paper.  I am astonished at the gall of the Government in tabling such an unrealistic and not entirely honest amendment.  It is about time we faced up to our obligations to our young people trying to buy decent houses that will not bankrupt them in energy costs nor spoil the environment.  I congratulate the Senator.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CyprianBrady"><NameTxt>Mr. Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment.  I welcome the Minister of State and the opportunity to discuss this issue as a member of the Joint Committee on Environment and Local Government.  The issue arises regularly and has been discussed with most of the stakeholders involved.  My experience with the committee tells me that huge strides have been made in recent years.  By the introduction of firm but fair policies over the past ten years, we have made huge progress.  The figures speak for themselves.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>They certainly do.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CyprianBrady"><NameTxt>Mr. Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>Emissions from the average dwelling have fallen by 30% in the past 14 years and are on target to fall by over 50% by the time we have to meet our commitments under Kyoto.  That is a sign of prudent Government.</P>
        <P>A certain amount of hysteria surrounds these issues.  For example, approximately 250,000 native Irish are employed by the construction industry.  If we were to interfere with that or try to change regulations governing certain areas of the industry just because some people do not like them, we would do a disservice not only to ourselves but the country.  When so many people are employed in an industry, it must be strongly regulated.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1875"/>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Could they not be employed building better houses?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CyprianBrady"><NameTxt>Mr. Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>We are on target to fulfil commitments made even by previous Governments.  At EU level, Ireland has led the way in many cases.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Why do we have to buy carbon credits?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CyprianBrady"><NameTxt>Mr. Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>We all remember the 1970s and 1980s when one could not walk down the street in Dublin without choking on smoke and fumes.  The introduction of smokeless fuel was a simple measure but has proven highly successful.  Over the years, successive Governments have made huge strides in fulfilling their commitments.  I see it in my own area, especially in housing for senior citizens.  A particularly active group in Dublin city, Energy Action, visits senior citizens, whether widows or widowers living on their own or elderly couples and assists them in insulating their houses in simple ways such as sealing their windows, doors and attics.  It is a Government subsidised initiative and very effective.</P>
        <P>Nobody has mentioned education in the past hour of debate but this Government and previous ones have expended huge resources on educational and promotional programmes, especially in schools, where the green flag programme has been hugely successful.  I know from my own children that young people&rsquo;s awareness of the environment and energy commitments are different from that of previous generations.</P>
        <P>Ten or 15 years ago we could not talk about these issues because of the economy.  Now, because of prudent Government, our economy is in a position whereby we can afford to do so.  A large percentage of homes now have solar panels and different forms of energy generation are encouraged, which are highly subsidised by the Government and enjoy a huge take-up, with 8,000 participants since the last programme.  People&rsquo;s awareness of the environment, the ozone layer and greenhouse gases is enhanced by constant coverage in the media.  Awareness is crucial both within and without the industry.  The majority of developers, builders and employers in the construction industry are very sensitive to energy and environmental issues.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Dublin City Council is another example of a local authority taking responsibility by consulting developers and builders on what materials they use and how they are used, and then attaching conditions to planning permissions that are granted.  I congratulate Fingal, as does the motion, because it has made an excellent effort, which is owing to a couple of conscientious officials who are concerned about the environment.  Local authorities have a huge role to play, particularly given some of their stock, especially in the inner cities, which was state of the art when it was built in the 1950s and 1960s but which is now energy inefficient and costs more to run than is economically justifiable. Sig<Col N="1876"/>nificant resources are being put into this area.  For example, the simple matter of replacing windows in flat complexes in recent years was a major undertaking.  This saves energy not just because it keeps heat in the flat but because it prevents emissions from leaking out.  Some of the promotional programmes such as &ldquo;reduce, reuse and recycle&rdquo; have become part of people&rsquo;s psyche.  The introduction of brown bins is another example.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The sooner we debate incineration from the point of view of energy and emissions, the better.  We have made great strides.  Who would have thought ten years ago that every house in Dublin would have a black and a green bin for segregated waste?  These issues have been tackled through education, promotion and sound policies.  There is much more to do but if we continue to pursue present policies, we will fulfil our commitment to meeting our targets at the EU and wider international levels.</P>
        <P>In my experience of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Environment and Local Government there are committed officials and other individuals throughout various Departments who are aware of the environment and how to protect it.  We have more to do but every country is in the same position and we have made great strides.  I support the amendment to the motion and congratulate the Department on its work to date.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanKenneally"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I am glad to have the opportunity to speak to this motion.  We seem to speak often on energy in the Seanad which is probably a good thing because it exercises our minds and will continue to do so in the coming years.  We had a major debate on the topic last week.  The more debates we have on the topic the better.  I commend the motion tabled by the Independent Group, although we have tabled an amendment to it.  We are all trying to achieve the same end and move towards better regulations, better insulation of houses and so on.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Government continues to propose challenges and co-ordinate actions to move towards sustainable energy and to bring Ireland into line with the Kyoto Protocol.  While there are difficulties with those at the moment we are running in the right direction.  The strength of the economy, which the Government continues to build and maintain, and an increasing housing sector entail a greater demand for energy than ever.  That will grow in the future.</P>
        <P>The Government continues to seek solutions to strike the balance between development and energy conservation.  It is committed to introducing a rating label for all houses which will be implemented following the EU directive on energy performance and buildings.  From 2007 houses will require an energy performance label to improve energy performance and awareness of energy efficiency.  The draft action plan to implement this directive envisages the introduction of a building energy rating for new dwellings from 1 January 2007, for other new buildings <Col N="1877"/>from 1 January 2008, and for existing dwellings and other existing buildings when offered for sale or rental with effect from 1 January 2009.  The Government has also introduced several grant schemes to promote sustainable energy in the housing sector.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I have met many people in my constituency recently and, amazingly, I am learning from them about their innovations to promote energy efficiency in their houses.  Some months ago I received an extraordinary e-mail from somebody in County Mayo who had studied energy efficiency in his mother&rsquo;s house.  He decided that if he put a small windmill onto her house, it would pay for itself within two to four years and after that her energy bills would be halved.  This would ensure that fossil fuels were not being overused.  His plan, however, ran into various difficulties because he discovered he needed planning permission for the windmill which was smaller than the satellite dishes on houses.  He could not go ahead with the plan.  We need to examine that issue and promote such innovative thinking.</P>
        <P>The greener homes grant scheme offers assistance to home owners who intend to purchase new renewable energy heating systems for new or existing homes.  It is administered by Sustainable Energy Ireland and aims to increase the use of sustainable energy technologies within Irish homes.  It has already attracted approximately 8,000 grant applications since its introduction last March.</P>
        <P>The house of tomorrow grant scheme provides funding to developers to encourage them to design and construct clusters of energy efficient houses.  Projects integrating renewable energy features will be given preference.  The Government welcomes the suggestion from the Opposition to work more closely with local authorities to develop planning permissions with energy and insulation standards to help bring Ireland in line with the Kyoto Protocol.</P>
        <P>I saw a new housing development in Waterford recently, comprising affordable and local authority housing, where solar panels have been built into the roofs.  Local authorities making efforts such as this should be encouraged.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P Just="Left">I reject the claim that there is an attempt to transfer all responsibility to the citizen.  To be successful in reaching the environmental targets set out in the Kyoto Protocol it is necessary to implement a programme that involves consultation and co-operation with all stakeholders.  The Power of One campaign promotes awareness of energy efficiency and is based on the concept that each of us contributes to making a difference.  The Government believes that through collective responsibility we can tackle environmental challenges.  Each of us has an obligation to the next generation to create sustainable energy for the future.  We are finally making great strides in this area, and although we must traverse a long path, we are moving in the right direction.  I commend <Col N="1878"/>the Government&rsquo;s actions and commend the amendment to the House.</P>

      <?oasys _cl11- ?><Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the motion moved by the Independent group.  My colleague in the D&aacute;il, Deputy Broughan, asked this week why the Government has not prepared the national energy efficiency plan as required by the EU.  With only a few months for the Government left to run, will it bring forward an energy efficiency plan?  If so, when?  The Power of One advertising campaign is welcome but much more needs to be done to back it up.  Our energy efficiency plan needs more concrete proposals.  The Labour Party spokesperson on energy, Deputy Broughan, argues Ireland should follow the lead of the European Commissioner for Energy, Andris Piebalgs, who last week launched a 75 step programme in ten priority areas, including new energy performance standards for electrical appliances and buildings.</P>
        <P>Deputy Broughan has also pointed out that most energy use is in the home.  This year, house production is expected to peak at 90,000 units per year but no substantial measures are in place to ensure new houses are energy efficient.  While I welcome the small energy efficiency programmes that have been introduced, little has been done for the bulk of new houses being built.  These are the houses in which many families will live for 30 years.  It is an opportune time to tackle the issue.  Strong regulations on energy efficiency for new homes are needed and with which builders and developers must comply.  They must also be enforced, supervised and inspected.</P>
        <P>Yesterday <i>The Examiner</i> carried a supplement on energy efficiency in the home, highlighting grants available for solar panels and water pumps, etc.  However, one article raised a concern that training for those installing energy efficiency appliances was insufficient.  The article pointed out appliances could be improperly installed, leading to more inefficiency than efficiency and turning people off them.  In turn, that may defeat the objective of the grants programme.  If grants are provided for energy efficiency installations, proper guidelines must be in place for their installation.</P>
        <P>One current requirement for energy efficient houses is that they are well insulated and draughts excluded.  However, with many chemicals used in home cleaning products and the risk of radon gas in some locations, the health implications of such a requirement must be kept in mind.  An energy efficiency policy must be comprehensive to take into account other aspects of living in a home, such as good ventilation.</P>
        <P>What measures are in place for public buildings, including Leinster House, to be energy efficient?  For example, is there any promotion for not leaving computer and other electrical appliances on stand-by in public offices?</P>
        <P>More money needs to be devoted to research and development into energy efficiency.  The main issue of this century will be about how we <Col N="1879"/>will secure future energy resources.  Ireland could make a niche for itself in research and development in this area but, unfortunately, little is devoted to it.</P>

	<P>Security of energy supply, climate change and improving the energy performance of our building stock are significant issues.  They are vital for the future of our planet and the quality of life for future generations, impacting on our potential for sustainable economic growth and social development.  The Government has taken major initiatives in this regard.  The landmark Government Green Paper on energy is an honest acknowledgement that the country must up its game over a range of policies if it is to successfully meet the energy supply and environmental challenges facing it.</P>
        <P>The Green Paper, Towards a Sustainable Energy Future for Ireland, launched on 1 October 2006, sets out where the Government wants Ireland&rsquo;s position on energy resources to be in 2020 and how it will be achieved.  By 2020, Ireland will have scored well on the three energy pillars of energy policy &mdash; security of supply, environmental sustainability and competitiveness.  The overall vision in the Green Paper is coherent, where these pillars interact and reinforce each other.  Success in one leads to success in all.  Any success depends on our willingness to lead.</P>
        <P>In 2020, Ireland will have met the challenge of security of energy supply by the integration and interconnection with the UK and Europe.  It will <Col N="1880"/>have achieved a diverse fuel supply regime, including optimum use of domestic fuel sources, world class fuel storage facilities, an enhanced network and transmission infrastructure and expanded oil and gas strategic reserves.</P>
        <P>Increased integration and interconnection with other markets is crucial.  Enhanced electricity interconnection with Northern Ireland and the development of a new electricity interconnector with Britain will be completed by 2012, and sooner if possible.  An all-island energy market will have the capacity to deliver the cost efficiencies, transparency and investments needed to promote an efficient and secure electricity market that will contribute positively to competitiveness.</P>
        <P>Fuel diversity is another method of ensuring security of supply.  By 2020, we will be using a much changed fuel mix in our electricity supply.  This will include the use of clean coal technology in further coal-based electricity generation, co-<?oasys _jy ?>firing with biomass and a significant expansion in renewable energy production.</P>
        <P>The second pillar of our energy policy is environmental sustainability.  The Green Paper envisages an ambitious target of 30% of electricity produced by renewable energy by 2020, a doubling of the 15% target set for 2010.  Renewable energy is a key to sustainability.  It must become centre stage within our overall energy demand in coming years if we are to achieve the 2020 target.</P>
        <P>We have taken the first step towards 2020 with the new &euro;119 million renewable energy feed-in tariff, REFIT.  At the end of September, the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources announced support, under REFIT, to 55 new renewable powered electricity generating plants.  These plants will have a combined capacity of more than 600 MW, where wind power accounts for 98% of all the new support.  This additional capacity is capable of generating power for 1 million homes.  It can also prevent the emission of more than 2 million tonnes of polluting greenhouse annually.</P>
        <P>The Green Paper sets the target of a 20% reduction in energy demand by 2020.  Through energy efficiency, individuals can contribute to the 2020 vision.  Relatively small changes by each of us can have a major impact on our environment, security of supply and competitiveness.  This is the basis of the recently launched Power of One campaign.  I regret that the Private Members&rsquo; motion was somewhat belittling of this imaginative initiative.  It is reasonable to seek to achieve changed behaviour in industry and in the home by showing how to start with small actions and build on the new behaviour.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The third pillar of the Green Paper is competitiveness.  We want to see, well before 2020, a stable and transparent market and regulatory and investment framework.  This must be underpinned by infrastructural and technological <Col N="1881"/>development.  Such a framework will enable the energy sector to be competitive and to support national competitiveness in a high-growth economy and inclusive society.  High global energy costs are now a fact of life, with the inevitable impact on prices.  A large proportion of the higher prices experienced in Ireland is explicable by our fuel mix and the existing structural constraints of the market.  These factors limit our ability to manage and mitigate future energy price increases. Our focus therefore must be on addressing controllable costs.</P>
        <P>To enhance competition, the go-ahead has been given to plan the construction of a 500 MW electricity interconnector between Wales and Ireland by 2012 or sooner.  This vital strategic asset should remain in public hands and will be owned by EirGrid on completion.  The CER and EirGrid will fast-track the design of a competition and the technical studies respectively, to ensure a speedy completion.  The Green Paper allows a period of two months for debate and public consultation and the comments of Senators will be particularly welcome.</P>
        <P>In July the Government published a report on the implementation of the national climate change strategy, entitled Ireland&rsquo;s Pathway to Kyoto Compliance.  This report is an important milestone in the development of national climate change policy.  The 2000 climate change strategy set out the framework for Ireland&rsquo;s response to global warming and to achieving its target under the Kyoto Protocol.  The report provides a comprehensive update on policy developments in the sectors of the economy responsible for greenhouse gas   emissions.  It also sets out measures that have been put in place since 2000 to address those emissions.</P>
        <P>The report shows that up to 8 million tonnes of emissions reductions can be expected each year between 2008 and 2012 with measures that are already in place.  These measures include strengthened energy requirements in the building regulations relating to the conservation of fuel and energy; regulations requiring all new cars for sale to be labelled with fuel economy and CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions information; meeting our target under the renewable energy directive; excise relief of more than &euro;200 million between 2006 and 2010 to reduce emissions from transport &mdash; equivalent to taking 76,000 cars off the road; fewer and younger animals in the national herd as a result of reform of the Common Agricultural Policy; and the Government&rsquo;s forestry programme.</P>
        <P>Ireland has some way to go to reach its Kyoto Protocol target.  However, we are not alone among EU member states and are in a much better position than some.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>How many and which states are they?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Col N="1882"/><Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not the case in regard to Dublin.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. B. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>Emissions in Ireland have been on a downward trend in the last several years and this trend must be judged in the context of sustained economic growth over the past ten years.  There are an additional 300,000 people living in Ireland since 2002, bringing our population to 4.2 million, and there has been an increase in industrial production of more than 300% since 1990.  House completions are now running at in excess of 80,000 units per annum; Ireland has the highest house building rate in the EU at more than 20 new dwellings per 1,000 population.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Emissions from the average dwelling fell by 30% between 1990 and 2004.  This was owing to higher building insulation standards under the national building regulations and a significant shift away from solid fuel use towards less carbon intensive fuels such as natural gas.  Continued decreases in emissions are projected for the period 2008 to 2012 due to ongoing improvements in building efficiencies and continued fuel switching.  By 2012, average emissions per household will have fallen to 55% of their 1990 level, or by almost 4 tonnes per household.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The uptake of energy efficient practices is being stimulated by House of Tomorrow grants for housing schemes, greener homes grants for individual houses and the installation of renewable energy systems in local authority social housing schemes.  As well as promoting energy efficiency technology, such initiatives are immensely valuable in allowing the Government to assess the feasibility of requiring, at some stage in the future, the use of renewable energy technologies through the building code.  It would be inappropriate to make such technologies mandatory without a full assessment of the costs and benefits of doing so through the relevant regulatory impact analysis, which is now mandatory for all categories of proposed regulations.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Despite Ireland&rsquo;s success in decoupling our economic growth from growth in greenhouse gas emissions, current projections show that we expect to be an average of 7 million tonnes in excess of our Kyoto target during the 2008 to 2012 period if no further action is taken.  Ireland&rsquo;s approach to bridging this gap is based  on three broad strands, namely, further measures throughout the economy to reduce emissions in addition to those already in place; emissions reductions or purchase of carbon allowances by installations participating in the EU emissions trading scheme; and use of the Kyoto Protocol flexible mechanisms to address any remaining shortfall.  The Government has already decided that the emissions trading sector will be responsible for 3 million tonnes of the 7 million tonnes gap.  We have also begun to put in place further measures building on the existing measures described in <Col N="1883"/>Ireland&rsquo;s Pathway to Kyoto Compliance.  Many of these are set out in the Government&rsquo;s Green Paper on energy.  We will prepare a new national climate change strategy that will provide a sound basis for Ireland not only to meet its Kyoto Protocol targets but to set a course for the more stringent emissions reductions that are likely to be required in the period beyond 2012.</P>
        <P>The criticism in the Private Members&rsquo; motion of our building energy performance standards is not justified.  The building regulations aimed at conserving energy have been updated and improved by this Government.  They were introduced in 1992 and the standards improved in 1998.  Changes with effect from 2003 and 2006 require higher thermal performance and insulation standards for the construction and reconstruction of both dwellings and non-domestic buildings.  This will reduce carbon dioxide emissions by approximately 300,000 tonnes per annum by 2012 and meet the target set in the national climate change strategy.</P>
        <P Just="Left">That is not to say the building code standards are perfect or immutable.  They must be kept under review in the light of improvements in insulation technology, the development of more energy efficient boilers and the emergence of renewable energy technologies.  For this reason, and as required by the EU energy performance of buildings directive, the Government is committed to reviewing part L standards every five years.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. B. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The next revision of part L standards for dwellings is due in 2008.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In this context, I endorse the initiative of Fingal County Council in using the planning process to impose building energy performance standards in excess of part L of the building regulations in certain areas.</P>

	<P>This practical experience will feed into our upgrading of the regulations which apply at national level.</P>
        <P>The Private Members&rsquo; motion is also critical of the continued use of the hollow concrete block method of house construction, an area of interest to Senators O&rsquo;Toole and Norris.  I listened to two very erudite men who, as part of their scientific education&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>We read the UCD report if that is what the Minister of State is going to say.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. B. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;I would have expected to have ascertained all the facts before reaching a conclusion.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Col N="1884"/><Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I have the UCD report in front of me.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. B. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>One would have expected their research to have been complete rather than half-baked.  One would also have expected their honesty and declared lack of gall, which they would attribute to others, to have divorced them from the sound bite in order to deal with the facts.</P>
        <P>I wish to set out the facts on the hollow block issue.  It is important when one receives information under the Freedom of Information Act that one reads the full text.  In the information concerned, one would have read that it could adversely impact on hollow block manufacturers who generally also manufacture solid blocks.  However, one would also have read that it would have an adverse impact on the house building capacity in Dublin where hollow block construction is used as a quicker and cheaper method of house construction.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>The same argument was made seven years ago.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. B. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">One would have seen that the other negative impact mentioned, and emphasised so strongly as a saving to the house purchaser, was that it would increase the cost of housing in Dublin owing to the higher labour and material costs associated with solid block in this construction.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I mentioned &pound;800 per year in my contribution and I explained how it would work.</P>
      </Speaker>

      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. B. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and Senator Norris, in particular, to an august body, namely, University College Dublin.  The broadly based Building Regulations Advisory Body commissioned an independent study by the Energy Research Group, UCD.  That was published in November 2000.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I quoted from it twice in my contribution.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. B. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>The results of that study showed that the hollow block construction could be insulated to comply with the proposed higher thermal performance standards.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>It could but it is not.  The Minister of State should be honest.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. B. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a fact.</P>
        <P>I emphasise that the Government does not have a preference for any particular form of house building.  The Irish Timber Frame Manu<Col N="1885"/>facturers Association and the Department are co-operating closely to implement a package of measures to facilitate timber frame construction as recommended in a report on timber frame housing in Ireland commissioned by the Department.  We are also considering steel frame building.</P>
        <P>The Private Members&rsquo; motion is critical of the transitional exemptions from the 2003 revised Part L standards of new dwellings for which planning permission was applied for on or before 31 December 2002 provided the dwellings concerned were substantially completed by 31 December 2005.  Such transitional exemptions are a common feature of major changes in the building code and are designed to avoid delays in the commencement of new houses which are at an advanced stage of planning.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government was required to speak to the EU about it but it did not do so.  It did not get the exemption.  The Minister of State is misleading the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. B. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not.  Without such pragmatic and temporary exemptions, the house building programme would not be running at the current all time record level now approaching 90,000 new dwellings per annum.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I wish to clarify the position as regards the timetable for the introduction of building energy rating.  The EU energy performance of buildings directive set 1 January 2006 as the deadline for legal transposition of the directive.  However, the EU directive recognises the administrative and technical complexities of introducing building energy rating and allows an additional period of up to three years, ending on 1 January 2009, for the introduction of such rating.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no argument there.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. B. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Ireland is one of only two EU member states which are known to have produced an integrated action plan for the implementation of all aspects of the directive.  The plan was published on 1 August last.  Ireland has made substantial progress in the legal transposition of the directive.  Ireland is one of only 11 member states against whom the European Commission is not taking infringement proceedings for failure to transpose the directive.</P>
        <P>The action plan proposes that the building energy rating will be phased in as follows: energy rating of new dwellings from 1 January 2007; energy rating of new non-domestic buildings from 1 July 2008; and energy rating of existing buildings when offered for sale or letting from 1 January 2009.</P>
        <P>These are challenging deadlines but they are evidence of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to improving energy efficiency.  I am sure the House will agree that in the light of the policies I have <Col N="1886"/>outlined, the Government has a very creditable and ambitious sustainable energy plan.  In the circumstances, I hope the House will accept that Ireland has a creditable record in implementing building energy rating, notwithstanding the complexities involved.</P>
        <P>I wish to refer to Senator Tuffy, who is not here.  The last amendment of the building regulations in 2002 increased energy performance standards by between 23% and 33%, depending on the size and type of house.  That is a substantial increase by any measure, and for a few years it put Irish standards ahead of those of the UK.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I commend Senator O&rsquo;Toole and the Independent group on tabling this motion tonight.  I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, for attending and peddling exactly the same arguments made to me when I first raised this matter in 1999 as housing spokesperson for my party in the other House.  The Minister of State&rsquo;s speech could have been cut and pasted from what his colleague, Deputy Noel Dempsey, the former Minister for the Environment and Local Government, told me in 1998 and 1999.</P>
        <P>The use of hollow block construction in the Dublin residential property market is one of the greatest scams in the construction industry and took place under the noses of successive Government for the past 20 years.  A future Government will have the courage to stop this practice and ensure decent homes for young people who wish to buy in the capital.  No other part of this country accepts the use of hollow block construction.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister of State is right when he endorses the view of UCD research published in 2000: &ldquo;The results of this study show that hollow block construction could be insulated to comply with proposed higher thermal performance standards.&rdquo;  The issue turns on the word &ldquo;could&rdquo;.  There is no doubt that it can be used, but even if that construction method can meet the thermal performance range to which the Minister of State refers when he speaks of technical guidance part L of the building regulations, it requires twice as much time as cavity wall insulation, three times as much time as timber frame housing and twice as much insulation foam to make the house and external walls safe.  That is the problem.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>That is exactly right.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no doubt that hollow block construction can be used without any problem, but it requires twice as long as cavity wall insulation.  In a booming property market, it is no surprise that everyone wants to slap houses up quicker, that shortcuts are made, and that inspectors are not present, as Senator Tuffy said.  Under such circumstances, we have a problem.</P>
        <P>We have built 250,000 houses in the past seven years in the greater Dublin area with insufficient <Col N="1887"/>thermal efficiency by the Government&rsquo;s own measure.  If one speaks to builders in London, Brussels or anywhere else in Europe, they laugh when told that the Irish Government permits nine-inch hollow block construction.  One is laughed out of court, and the request under the Freedom of Information Act 1997 to which Senator O&rsquo;Toole referred when moving the motion confirmed that the then Minister of State, the former Deputy, Bobby Molloy, was told that in 1998.</P>
        <P>This is a serious issue, and the Government has allowed 250,000 houses to be built in Dublin over the past seven or eight years to an insufficient thermal standard, since it failed to outlaw the practice of nine-inch hollow-block construction.  I am very happy that Senator O&rsquo;Toole used this forum to comment tonight under parliamentary privilege.</P>
        <P>The last time I raised this issue, in 1999, I received three threatening legal letters from the product&rsquo;s manufacturers regarding what they felt were my outrageous remarks concerning that form of construction.  I am therefore glad to use the privilege of this House to record what most people in this country do not know, namely, that if one lives in Dublin, one has an inferior house because the Government refused to enforce the decent thermal efficiency standards that apply everywhere else in the country.</P>
        <P>When preparing for this motion, I spoke to the architect who heads local authority housing at South Dublin County Council about nine-inch hollow block construction.  He told me that not a single local authority house had been built in Ireland in the past ten years using nine-inch hollow blocks.  The method is simply not used; again one would be laughed at.  The building standards for social housing do not apply to the speculative market, and that is unacceptable.  If one speaks to any group of architects, they will laugh one out of court regarding the notion that they would accede to nine-inch hollow block construction.</P>
        <P>The case is proven, but the Minister of State is at it again tonight.  When I first raised this issue, I was told that I was trying to stop housing construction in Dublin by demanding that young couples have the same standard of insulation enjoyed in Limerick, Cork and Galway.  However, because it is Dublin and we must slap the houses up quicker, we are told that we should have a different standard.</P>
        <P>I was told in 1998 that I was trying to halt housing construction in Dublin.  The same argument was peddled in the House tonight in a cut-and-paste job from 1998.  This is an absolute scam, and in many respects it is too late because we have allowed the situation to develop under our noses for the past eight years owing to an inept Government that refuses to confront international evidence regarding hollow block construction and is <Col N="1888"/>far too close to the building industry when it comes to enforcing the standards that apply elsewhere in Europe.</P>
        <P>The biggest investment a young couple or individual will make in life is purchasing a home, and we have allowed them to buy houses in Dublin built to insufficient insulation standards.  They will pay a double price when the new European regulations enter force.  Not only will their house be insufficiently insulated, they will have to pay a penalty to be imposed in coming years.  We must put this issue on the agenda, and I compliment the Independent group on doing so.  We must highlight that the Government sat back and allowed the situation to develop.  Shame on it and on the Minister of State for his reply.  I hope that this issue will be top of a new Administration&rsquo;s agenda upon reaching office.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State and thank Senator O&rsquo;Toole for tabling the motion.  Of all those on the Independent benches and the Opposition side of the House, I tend to agree with him the most, on almost everything.  However, that is not the case with the entirety of this motion.</P>
        <P>Looking at the text, I join in congratulating Fingal County Council and those others throughout the country that followed suit.  Carlow, D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown and others are considering similar guidelines.  They are to be commended on what they are doing.  However, that is about all in the motion with which I agree, and I will support the amendment.</P>
        <P>Fingal County Council used section 19 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 to override current building regulations requirements in local area plans.  Therefore, there is nothing to prevent any other local authority from doing the same while we carry out the measured and balanced review of overall building regulations that is due.  I congratulate the councillors, who elect most of us in the House, on their vision in voting through those amendments to parts of the local area plan.  I know that Fingal County Council, in the Balbriggan south-east local area plan, was first to do so.  It is reasonable to mention that it did so in April 2006.</P>
        <P>It is clear that hollow block construction seems less than efficient in the context of the other possibilities.  It is also clear that all agree that it is possible to insulate it properly.  I have an interest to declare, since I am involved in the auction business and I have not witnessed a hollow block being used on any building site that I have attended for a long time.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>In the context of other building regulations, it is also fair to say that no Administration in the history of the State has done more to improve matters.  The original regu<Col N="1889"/>lations from 1992 were improved in 1998 and 2002, and we continue to make improvements.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Brian Hayes mentioned that we were threatened in 1998 by business interests that manufacture particular types of brick.  I will not condemn or promote those interests, any more than I will promote the companies that produce the type of house pushing this debate and which have engaged public relations people who operate in senior political circles, not Fianna F&aacute;il.</P>
        <P>Market choice is another issue and involves a cultural factor.  People looking for a house are not looking for energy efficiency, but I welcome the fact that in January we will have an energy rating on every house.</P>
        <P>I have a serious problem with the attitude expressed in the motion to the Power of One campaign.  We need to address the culture of wastage of which we are all guilty.  We spoke earlier today about the carnage on our roads at weekends.  The solution is not about enforcement or the speed of cars but about changing the culture among people.  Equally, the Power of One campaign can do most in the shortest period of time in the context of energy efficiency.  For example, how many of us at home or here have a laptop plugged in while not in use?  How often do we leave our mobile phones plugged in, even when they are switched off?  These actions involve a significant waste of energy, but could be simply addressed.  I commend the Government on the Power of One campaign, on its greener home scheme, the various grant aid programmes for combined heat and power and the excise relief scheme for biofuels, etc.</P>
        <P>I would be the first to admit that we have a lot done, more to do.   In his speech the Minister of State outlined some of the targets we have set.  I would like to think we could set the bar higher or push the boat out further.  This would be possible if the unit in the Department could be further resourced to bring forward the review on building regulations.  We could then see if it was possible to universally adopt recommendations that would do, such as those adopted by Fingal County Council and other local authorities.  In the meantime, there is nothing to stop other county councils from doing the same and we would encourage them to do so.  Fingal County Council enjoys the full support of the Minister and the various Departments involved.</P>
        <P>We need to do more.  Under the current national development plan some &euro;6 billion was originally allocated for roads, but only &euro;145 million to energy.  We should bear this in mind in the preparation of the next development plan and ensure we provide sufficient resources so that we can reach and exceed our targets.  It would be even better to try to push the boat out.</P>
        <P>I welcome the fact that we have had two debates on the issue of energy in a period of three weeks.  They are possibly the only two debates we have had on the issue in the past five years.  Energy is one of most important challenges to face the country and we should factor in at least four debates a year on the issue.  I thank Senator <Col N="1890"/>O&rsquo;Toole for raising the matter.  I support the amendment and reiterate our maxim &mdash; a lot done, more to do.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Senator MacSharry has been well trained on the party message.  I commend Senator O&rsquo;Toole on his tenacity in following this problem over the years.  He has raised the issue on several occasions, as has Senator Brian Hayes.</P>
        <P>Having been involved in research within the universities, I hate to see the independent study by the energy research group in UCD, published in 2000, misused by the Minister when he says that the results of the study show that hollow block construction could be insulated.  Nobody has said it could not be insulated.  One could insulate a wigwam which would be quick and cheap to erect and take up little space.  However, nobody suggests we should do something like this.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We agree hollow block houses could be insulated, but the problem is that this means young people will have to buy houses on which they will have to spend significant amounts to ensure they are energy efficient.  This means they must spend significantly more than if the house had been built with solid blocks initially.  The Government has known this for some time.  It appears from Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s research that a great favour was done for producers of hollow blocks by suggesting they were quicker and cheaper, etc.</P>
        <P>The Minister did not mention the word &ldquo;quality&rdquo;.  Does it matter what we erect or what sort of houses people must live in?  Why can we not try to ensure the quality of what is being put in place.  It is all very well to try to build them quickly and cheaply, but we need to ensure we also have quality housing, particularly in the social and affordable housing area.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A person contacted me recently about an apartment he was offered under the affordable housing scheme.  People are desperate to get apartments, but this apartment was tiny.  The kitchen was like a galley, rather like something one would find in a holiday apartment in Majorca or similar, which is fine for two weeks.  There was no room for the fridge in the kitchen and it had to be in the utility room.  There was space for a dishwasher, but what is the need for a dishwasher in that size of an apartment?  The washing machine also needed to be in the utility area.  The kitchen had no room for a table and only had a small worktop.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In the living room there was room for a sofa and an armchair, but no room for a table at which one could eat.  We are trying to promote family life, but I do not know where two people could have sat to eat in these apartments unless they had TV dinners on their knees.  It is outrageous to encourage people to live in such situations.  The apartment had two bedrooms.  The second bedroom was there to allow the owner let it to help pay for the mortgage because even though the apartment was part of affordable housing, it still cost &euro;300,000.</P>
        <P>If we continue to build and promote such schemes, we cannot complain about the fact that <Col N="1891"/>we have problems within family life.  Who could bring up children in such situations?  If people in such small apartments have a child, they have little room for them, but because they buy under the affordable housing scheme, they cannot sell it for ten years without paying the market price.  This is an appalling situation for any young couple.</P>
        <P>In the context of energy, the apartments have the old dinosaurs of heating &mdash; storage heaters &mdash; in very small rooms.  These are expensive to run and take up an enormous amount of space.  Also, electricity has risen 30% this year.  We need to address this not just as a housing issue but as an issue that concerns the social fabric of the country.  These apartments are cheap and quick to erect, but impossible to live in.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I commend Senator O&rsquo;Toole on having raised this motion.  The debate is timely because we must consider the sort of environment we want to bring forward for our young people.  We spoke about young people being out racing their cars, but there is not much point in them sitting in if they live in this sort of situation.  I suggest to the Minister of State that his response had little quality.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Killeen, to the House and thank those who have contributed on this issue.  This is an issue I and Senator Brian Hayes have been pushing for many years.</P>
        <P>In opening the debate I said that because the issue crossed two Departments, Ministers did not always get the proper flow of information to help them understand the issue.  Having listened to my colleagues on the other side, I am convinced of this.  No Member on the Government side set out deliberately to mislead the House, but those Senators were given misinformation.  I could recite what they said.  For example, Senator Brady spoke honestly and with self-belief about a loss of employment.  However, the reverse would be the case.  The Government did not change construction methods from hollow block building to cavity walls or timber-frame housing in 1998 because it would have needed a greater employment input.  There was no question of reducing employment.  Cavity block walls can be built more quickly, the only correct argument made by the Minister of State, but it is unacceptable in terms of quality.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I want Senator Brady to consider this matter.  I know why he stated that emissions have decreased; the reasons were set out by the Minister of State in his speech.  I hope that I do not lose people when I explain my point because I do not have time to address other points.  The Minister of State said:  &ldquo;Emissions from the average dwelling fell by 30% between 1990 and 2004&rdquo;.  What is the average dwelling?  The statement is factual, but a main reason for the reduction is that one in every three houses are timber-framed or other constructions.  The briefers did not tell <Col N="1892"/>Senator Brady that, since 1990 &mdash; the date used by the Minister of State in all of his references &mdash; our emissions have increased by 29%.  I am not suggesting that the Senator misled the House deliberately, as he was not given that information.</P>
        <P>I wish to be taken up on another matter.  I have read every piece of research and information, including the reports of NuTech Consultants, UCD and the Building Research Establishment, and all of the regulations.  I have also spoken to architects and people in the building industry.  I am prepared to talk and would enthusiastically go out of my way to meet anyone who can disprove even a word of my comments tonight.  Quicker than anyone else, I will correct myself if I have misled the House in the slightest way.  I am not in the habit of tabling motions and do not want to take cheap shots at the Government, but I am trying to point out the issues.</P>
        <P>Senator Brian Hayes picked up on the Minister of State&rsquo;s comment that the UCD report claims that &ldquo;hollow block construction could be insulated to comply with the proposed higher thermal performance standards&rdquo;.  Does anyone want to know how this could be done?  I dare not put it on the record of the House, but the corner boys in Dingle long ago had a great saying about &ldquo;could&rdquo;, namely, &ldquo;my aunt could be my uncle if she had&rdquo; whatever.  &ldquo;Could&rdquo; is a word I do not accept in this context.</P>
        <P>One house in 1998 was built with cavity walls &mdash; two rows of blocks &mdash; and another was built using cavity blocks.  How could one insulate them to the standards found in Fingal or wherever?  In the case of the former, one would drill holes along the bottom or top of the wall and fill it with insulation, a job that could be done in two hours or half a day at most and that would achieve full insulation standards.  In the case of the latter, it would be impossible to insulate because the blocks are laid across one another and the cavity between them cannot be filled.  In that situation, one must take everything out of the house and off the walls &mdash; possibly including the plaster, although the UCD research avoided telling us what one would need to do &mdash; and insulate the inside or outside or build another wall.  It would be too much work.  Saying &ldquo;could&rdquo; is unacceptable.</P>
        <P>Senator Kitt made important and telling points with which I do not disagree, but he also made a substantial, accurate and articulate point about grant applications and so on.  It is frustrating that the grants given to people to erect energy saving devices such as solar panels actually serve to replace energy needlessly that was initially sustainable.  We should provide those measures for houses that cannot meet the requirements.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State did not answer the question asked by Senator Norris and I, that is, why did we pay &euro;185 million in fines?  Senator MacSharry is correct in that we need to raise the bar, but we have not done so.  How can one deal with this matter?  If we were to put the Fingal conditions, which have been examined by a number of local authorities and supported on the <Col N="1893"/>far side of the House, in place elsewhere, it would save 70,000 tonnes of CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions from new houses each year.  During the next 12 years or so, we would save 1 million tonnes per year of CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions and considerable amounts of money, helping us to meet our Kyoto Protocol obligations.  It could be done with the stroke of a pen.  Will the Fianna F&aacute;il Parliamentary Party discuss this suggestion when none of us is present to contradict it?</P>
        <P>I contradicted the Power of One campaign to get a reaction more than anything else.  There is nothing wrong with the campaign, but using it to replace action at Government level is unacceptable.  In terms of the Kyoto Protocol, is a failure to regulate now or to extend the Fingal conditions to the rest of the country not irresponsible?  Why are we not doing so?  The Minister of State spoke about meeting sustainable energy <Col N="1894"/>requirements in house building.  It may be an important issue, but I am not pushing for it.  Rather, I am pressing to advance matters.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The Minister of State was partially right when he told the House that he worked within the EU requirement of three years, but why have we waited three years and pushed the date from 1 January 2005 to 1 January 2007?  Why are we delaying the requirement for an energy rating for second-hand houses and why must people buying houses in the next two years wait until 2008 for that rating?  This question was not asked, for which reason I tabled this motion.  We are doing young people buying houses a disservice in terms of the global environment and our requirements under the Kyoto Protocol.  We are making a mistake.  Even if the Government votes against my motion, I ask that it take on board the issues raised.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Prior to the last general election in 2002 the residents of Athea, County Limerick, <Col N="1894"/>were promised that a sewerage scheme would commence in the near future.  As we face another general election, they are correctly asking when the scheme will commence.  The scheme is urgently needed, as housing development in the area is being impeded.  The lack of housing also has an impact on the local primary school.  In addition, the existing deficient sewage scheme is also polluting rivers.  The proposed scheme has been bundled with schemes for Shanagolden, Askeaton, Foynes and Glin.  The bundled project is estimated to cost &euro;16 million and the intention of the bundling process was to reduce to cost of the overall project.  However, it is a bureaucratic nightmare that ten different phases must be com<Col N="1895"/>pleted from inception to construction before a major capital project can proceed.  While the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government announced this red tape would not apply for projects costing less than &euro;5 million, because of the bundling of schemes, it is rare that a sewerage project costs less than this in County Limerick.</P>
        <P Just="Left">When I raised the issue on 14 June last, the Minister of State said he had received fee proposal and cost estimates from Limerick County Council.  When can the council commence construction on this project?  With regard to the provision of water and sewerage schemes generally, the Government has neglected west Limerick.  Adare, Askeaton, Patrickswell, Glin, Shanagolden, Foynes, Athea, Dromcollogher, Bruff and Kildimo are all in urgent need for upgraded sewerage schemes, yet none has been provided.  I look forward to the Minister of State&rsquo;s response.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. B. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank the Senator for raising this issue again.  The Department&rsquo;s water services investment programme 2005-2007, published last December, includes funding for more than 20 water and sewerage schemes throughout Limerick.  Rather than leaving Limerick behind, we are looking after it well.  Towns and villages such as Adare, Patrickswell, Askeaton, Foynes, Glin, Shanagolden, Kilmallock, Dromcollogher, Hospital, Pallasgreen and Bruff can all look forward to new or upgraded sewerage schemes.  Many areas will also benefit from improved water supplies from the major upgrade of the Clareville water treatment plant, improvements to the Shannon Estuary water supply scheme and extensions of the Limerick county trunk water mains.  In total, almost &euro;158 million has been allocated under the programme for water and sewerage schemes in Limerick.  It is clear from all of this that a very large number of towns and villages in Limerick are directly benefiting from the drive to bring our water and sewerage infrastructure up to a modern standard.</P>
        <P>I am pleased to confirm that the Athea sewerage scheme is also included in the investment programme.  It is being advanced as part of a grouped project, which includes the Askeaton, Foynes, Glin and Shanagolden sewerage schemes and which is scheduled to commence construction in 2007.  The Department is awaiting submission of Limerick County Council&rsquo;s preliminary reports for the project.  These reports will set out details of the proposed scope and costs of the schemes and of the council&rsquo;s proposals for advancing them.  Approval of the preliminary reports will allow the council to draw up contract documents on which bids for the construction of the schemes can be invited.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I assure the Senator that I am as keen as him for the scheme to get under way, that funding has <Col N="1896"/>been allocated for it and that the Department will deal with the preliminary report as urgently as possible as soon as it is received from Limerick County Council.  Perhaps the Senator might have a word with council officials so that they might expedite the report to my Department.  I assure him that we will deal with it expeditiously as soon as we receive it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for allowing me to raise this issue and I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House.  Mountbellew, County Galway, is an expanding market town but it has been hampered by the lack of an appropriate sewerage scheme.  A number of improvements are needed because new housing estates have been built around the town and others are planned.  It has reached the stage where a contractor must install a treatment system for each scheme of houses, which is a bad reflection of the way in which waste and waste water are dealt with in this day and age.  Recently, planning permission was granted for a new factory in the town.  Improvements in the sewerage scheme are badly needed, given the impending development of new housing estates and a new industry.</P>
        <P>In the various water and sewerage programmes over the years, Mountbellew has been mentioned.  It is listed as a project to be completed in 2007 involving a cost of &euro;2.2 million.  It is urgently required.  With the amount of development that is taking place, I hope the Department will ensure that provision of this scheme will soon be announced.</P>
        <P>A public meeting will be held in Mountbellew on 6 November and people are seeking answers in regard to the provision of this scheme.  They are frustrated there is such a delay in providing the scheme in this town in which there is considerable development.  I hope the Minister of State will have some good news for the people of Mountbellew in the not too distant future.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. B. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank Senator Kitt for raising this issue.  The Department&rsquo;s water services investment programme 2005-2007, published in December 2005, includes some 60 major water and sewerage schemes, with a value of more than &euro;451 million, for Galway.  The Mountbellew sewerage scheme is being bundled with a number of other schemes in the county for procurement purposes and is scheduled to commence in 2007.  Funding has been allocated and it will be able to go to construction once the planning and procurement procedures have been completed.  My Department is currently awaiting Galway County Council&rsquo;s preliminary report on the proposed scheme.  As the cost of the scheme is under &euro;5 million, it will benefit from the more streamlined procurement procedures introduced earlier this year, which reduced from four to two the number of approval stages.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The scheme is an important one for the local community.  It will ensure that the town has a <Col N="1897"/>sewerage scheme capable of meeting current and future demands, and that environmental standards will be preserved and improved for the benefit of the town and its residents.  I assure Senator Kitt that I am keen to ensure the scheme gets under way and I understand the frustration of the people in Mountbellew in this regard.  My Department will deal with the preliminary report and treat it in as urgent a manner as possible once it is received from Galway County Council.  The Senator might discuss it with Galway County Council so that it can be expedited and forwarded to the Department.</P>

      <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank the Cathaoirleach for selecting this item for discussion.  What is happening in the Health Service Executive, HSE, western region in regard to providing for the needs of the elderly is nothing short of a scandal and it greatly discriminates against the elderly in the west.  The failure of the HSE to rectify the position must be seen as a failure in the organising and carrying out of its functions.  The Minister should intervene and address it.  The Government&rsquo;s failure to recognise the needs of elderly people cannot be allowed to continue.</P>
        <P>Some 20% of the total population who are aged 65 years and older live in the west.  County Galway has the highest percentage of people in that age bracket of all of the HSE western counties, which represents a substantial proportion of the total population.  The area of greatest concern is the inequity between the HSE western area, County Galway in particular, and the HSE eastern area covering Dublin.  In County Galway the maximum rate of subvention for a private nursing home is &euro;190 per week, whereas a person with less or, in some cases, more means can receive a subvention of &euro;600 in the eastern region.  Why does that level of discrepancy exist?  We cannot find the answer to that and we do not know who will be responsible for it.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The O&rsquo;Shea report clearly outlines three reasons for the difference, including the different treatment of assets between the HSE regions.  In other words, in the western region, an assessment of the assets of a person &mdash; each and every penny he or she has &mdash; is taken into account, as against the position in the eastern region where there is wide variation in the interpretation of assets.  That difference accounts for one reason in the variation in the level of subvention.  Another reason is the different rules governing who is entitled to what are termed &ldquo;contract beds&rdquo;.  There is also the difference in eligibility for enhanced payments and the application of those.</P>
        <P>We are told that the responsibility for private nursing home subventions at senior management level varies from health board to health board <Col N="1898"/>and from programme managers to regional managers to co-ordinators of services for elderly people.  While such a variation in level of subvention exists, there will be no consistency and hence elderly people in the west and the HSE western area are falling out.</P>
        <P>The differences in assessment of needs and the way in which they are interpreted has caused a problem.  Added to this, the assessment of social factors also varies.  According to the O&rsquo;Shea report, assessments tend to include a social variable which takes account of the social, democratic, spatial, housing and family need circumstances of the older person.  There is a strong subjective element in the consideration of social factors in placement of decision-making, which further exacerbates the position.  The position with regard to the dependency assessment for the purposes of awarding subvention is therefore unsatisfactory.  That is stated on page 54 of the O&rsquo;Shea report.  It clearly states that such assessment is unsatisfactory.</P>
        <P>The variation of assessment in application of rules has led to both horizontal and vertical inequities in the treatment of older people applying for subvention both within and among the health boards.  People with the same level of dependency are not being treated in the same way and there is a wide variation among the health boards in the proportion of applications being awarded subventions in the dependency categories which are placed.  This leads to an unacceptable variation throughout the country.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In County Galway some 804 people are on the standard rate of dependency and 340 of those are on the enhanced rate.  There is a wide gulf in regard to the rates at which they get that enhancement compared with the percentage in Dublin.  Such variation is unsustainable.  I ask the Minister of State to request the Minister for Health and Children to rectify this position immediately.  It is not a case of Galway versus Dublin; it is a question of the provision for the needs of people in the west where there is a high percentage of people who are in the dependency category, the number of whom are increasing rapidly.  This matters requires urgent attention, and the sooner the better.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. B. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to have this opportunity to deal with this matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney.  I thank the Senator for raising the matter as it provides me with an opportunity to outline to the House the current position with regard to the nursing home subvention scheme.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A nursing home subvention may be paid towards the cost of private nursing home care, where a person is unable to meet the cost and where he or she has been assessed as needing nursing home care by the Health Service Executive and where the person has also satisfied a means test.  The amount of subvention granted <Col N="1899"/>will depend on the degree of nursing home care required, that is, medium, high or maximum level, and it will take into account the amount of the person&rsquo;s assets, including property, stocks and shares, savings, etc.  The rates of subvention payable are as follows: in the case of medium dependency, the rate is &euro;114.30 per week; in the case of high dependency, the rate is &euro;152.40 per week; and in the case of maximum dependency, the rate is &euro;190.50 per week.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The nursing home subvention scheme was introduced to assist with the cost of private nursing home charges and was never intended to cover the entire cost of nursing home care.  Under article 22.3 of the Nursing Home (Subvention) Regulations 1993, the HSE may enter into an arrangement with a registered private nursing home to provide inpatient services under section 52 of the Health Act 1970.  In making such an arrangement the HSE may pay more than the maximum rate of subvention, relative to an individual&rsquo;s level of dependency, in cases where, for example, personal funds are exhausted, in accordance with article 22.4 of the Nursing Home (Subvention) (Amendment) Regulations 1996.  The application of these provisions, however, is a matter for the HSE in the context of meeting increasing demands for subventions.  The average rate of subvention paid by the HSE generally exceeds the current approved basic rates mentioned above.</P>
        <P>Spending on the nursing home subvention scheme has increased from &euro;5 million in 1993, when it was introduced, to a figure in the region of &euro;140 million in 2005.  The Government allocated an additional &euro;20 million towards the nursing home subvention scheme for 2006 to provide for extra subvention payments and to address the variations in payments in different areas, as alluded to by the Senator.</P>
        <P>The projected expenditure on nursing home subvention, which includes enhanced subvention for the HSE western region in 2006, is &euro;48,591,000.  The HSE western region provides subvention and enhanced subvention on an individual needs basis in line with current legislation, namely, the Nursing Home Act 1990, and regulations, that is, the Nursing Home (Subvention) Regulations 1993.  Applications for enhanced sub<Col N="1900"/>vention are dealt with on a case by case basis in each local health area.  The supports paid by the HSE vary from person to person and region to region, depending, for example, on nursing home fees.</P>
        <P>The Health (Nursing Homes) (Amendment) Bill 2006 is designed to ensure that the existing subvention scheme for private nursing home care is grounded in primary legislation and to help the HSE to implement the scheme on a standardised basis across the country.  In addition, national guidelines on nursing home subvention are currently being developed by the HSE to ensure an even and equitable application of the scheme nationally.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The future of residential care funding was discussed by the social partners as part of the Towards 2016 negotiations.  The ten-year framework social partnership agreement 2006-16 states that there should be appropriate and equitable levels of co-payment by care recipients based on a national standardised financial assessment.  In addition, the agreement also states that the level of State support for residential care should be indifferent as to whether that care is in a public or private facility.  The Department is currently drawing up proposals as agreed with the social partners in Towards 2016.</P>

	<P>In cases where a glaring inequity between one patient and another existed and equalisation measures are put in place, will retrospective compensation be given to those who were penalised by the system, particularly in the west?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. B. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The question of retrospective payment does not arise because in each area the subvention depends on the cost of the nursing home care.  Nursing home care costs differ greatly between areas like Dublin, Cork, Galway and areas of rural Ireland.  In some rural areas, the costs of care are much lower than in others.  I do not envisage any retrospective payment being made.  There will be some equalisation of the system but that will always take into account the cost of the nursing home in the specialised area, the ability of the individual to pay and his or her income and assets.</P>
