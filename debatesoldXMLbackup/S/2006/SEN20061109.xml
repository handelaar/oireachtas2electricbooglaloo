	<P>I have notice from Senator Terry that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1" Just="Left">The need for the Minister for Finance to introduce an incentive for private sector workers to leave their pension funds intact by forgoing the tax-free lump sum, thus ensuring a higher income stream in retirement.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I regard the matter raised by the Senator as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment, and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

    <Title>Order of Business. </Title>
      <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>The Order of Business is No. 1, a motion which extends the time for the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights to consider the report of the Independent Commission of Inquiry into the Bombing of Kay&rsquo;s Tavern, Dundalk, to allow it report back to Seanad &Eacute;ireann by 1 December 2006 rather than 17 November 2006, which was previously agreed on 5 July, to be taken without debate; No. 2, Patents (Amendment) Bill 1999 &mdash; Committee Stage, to be taken on the conclusion of the Order of Business and to conclude not later than 1.00 p.m.; and No. 3, Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Bill 2006 &mdash; Order for Committee and Committee Stage, to be taken from 2 p.m. until 4.30 p.m.  There will be a sos from 1.00 p.m. to 2 p.m.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>Colleagues may have seen reports in today&rsquo;s newspapers of the serious sexual assault on a woman in Dublin in recent days.  The young victim was on her way home in the early hours of the morning when she was taken to one side by three young men and sexually assaulted in an apartment block close to O&rsquo;Connell Street.  What is particularly outrageous about this latest attack is the fact that the young woman called out for help on a thoroughfare on <Col N="166"/>which many hundreds of people were walking by but simply looked the other way and walked on.</P>
        <P>This issue must be raised in a public forum such as this.  Regardless of how many closed circuit television systems are installed and how many garda&iacute; or members of the Garda reserve force are patrolling the streets, there is ultimately a responsibility on citizens to look out for and help each other.  It is an appalling indictment of modern Ireland that a young woman could cry out for help and people would simply look the other way.</P>
        <P>We in this House have a responsibility to highlight this issue in view of the depravity of the assaults being perpetrated on women and men.  We must ask citizens to assist the Garda and help vulnerable people in order that we may stem the tide of criminality engulfing cities and towns throughout the State.  In debating this issue, the House should send a clear signal to society that this issue must be addressed once and for all.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach has stated his clear intention to hold a referendum to ensure the rights of children are embraced in our Constitution.  This is something I endorse and welcome.  I note, however, that only two weeks ago, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, said he did not believe there was any necessity for a constitutional change in this area.  If the Government wishes to proceed on this basis between now and the general election, I ask all parties in this House which endorse the views of the Seanad Sub-Committee on Seanad Reform, in which I, the Leader and other colleagues are involved, to see if we could use a referendum to push through reforms of the Seanad.</P>
        <P>We all say we are committed to Seanad reform and on the first day back after the election of the new Seanad, we tasked a sub-committee to address the matter.  The sub-committee has produced its report and there are constitutional implications in terms of a new Seanad.  Let us hold that referendum at the same time as the other one if it is to be held between now and the general election.  All the leaders of the groups in the House should meet the Taoiseach to put that suggestion to him.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Yesterday on the Order of Business I raised the issue of the committee dealing with the Judge Curtin affair and the House was of the view it should not be discussed here.  As I said, I have no interest in, or views on, the issue.  I am interested in the process this House set up.  The response I got was that it was not to be discussed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>I said I could not discuss it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to be absolutely clear.  I have nothing but the highest respect for the members of that committee and nothing I have said on this issue takes from them.  I am supportive of them in everything they do and I know of <Col N="167"/>the work they are doing.  I have no problem with the way they discharge their business nor do I have a scintilla of criticism about the way they do their work.  They have been diligent, have given two summers to it and no one could ask for more from them.</P>
        <P>The issue is that we set up this committee and we should get reports on what is happening.  Having raised the matter yesterday, I woke up this morning to hear a whole news report on it on the 7 o&rsquo;clock news.  Why can we not be told?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>As I understood it, the committee was set up to investigate this matter and to report back to the House.  There was no mention of interim reports.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the Cathaoirleach.  I am not trying to undermine that process; I am completely supportive of it.  My only point is that we were told the matter would be dealt with very quickly and dates were suggested but for reasons beyond the scope of the committee, it did not reach those dates.  Where do we go from here?  We will be asked questions at the next general election.  There is something wrong if I cannot get the answers in the House but can get them in the public press.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Since I was elected to national politics 20 years ago I have regularly come across members of political parties and elected representatives who firmly believe the words &ldquo;cherishing all the children of the nation equally&rdquo; are somewhere in the Constitution.  For the first time we now have an opportunity to include a commitment to the rights of the child in the Constitution.  I suggest on this the 90th anniversary of the publication of the Proclamation that we show a certain respect to the fourth and fifth paragraphs of that document by considering using the words &ldquo;cherishing all the children of the nation equally&rdquo; in any commitment.  They are vital, powerful paragraphs of protection from which successive Governments have always shied away until now for reasons that we could understand, that is, resources.  I fully agree with the point made by Senator Brian Hayes and appeal that whatever way we go about this, we get all the parties involved and try to get some agreement because it is not a political issue.</P>
        <P>The issue raised by Senator Brian Hayes on the rights and duties of citizens in a democracy is well worth discussing in the House.  A couple of weeks ago in a very tragic case, a Catholic priest in Monaghan tried to tell us society was at fault for people not exercising free will.  Citizens have free will and must take decisions.  They also have responsibilities as part of a democracy.  If we have to start with the parable of the Good Samaritan and the requirement of a citizen to be there for other citizens, then that is what we should do.  Senator Brian Hayes made a very important point.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="168"/>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>My sympathies are with Senator O&rsquo;Toole.  I can never understand why matters cannot be reported or discussed in the Oireachtas which can be discussed elsewhere.  It is for us to organise our business but I believe the Senator has a genuine point.</P>
        <P>Yesterday&rsquo;s report by the Central Bank of Ireland on lending had many items in it which would concern one.  However, the most disturbing item I heard was the projection that within another five years, only 20% of households will be able to afford to buy their own houses.  If one wants a recipe for incredible social tension, that is it.  The idea that people will not be able to have a secure home in which to live and have a family will create the type of tensions which I thought we would be able to avoid in a successful economy.  While I know we discuss it regularly, I would like us to discuss yet again the issue of housing, affordability of housing, the failure of the Government&rsquo;s policy in the area of social and affordable housing and the failure of a number of projects to deliver the amount of housing needed.</P>
        <P>Another issue I wish to raise, which perhaps we could discuss in the context of corporate power, is the extraordinary attempt by a private hospital funded by the State, but nevertheless officially private, to intimidate a former patient into silence in respect of her criticisms.  It is very easy for a corporate body where individuals will not be personally liable for costs to take a defamation case against an individual who will be.  We should change the law to ensure that if corporate bodies decide they want to take defamation cases, the individuals who run that corporate body should be held personally liable for the consequences of that action.  That would soften the coughs of many people who seem to be quite happy to take an individual, who has suffered from cancer, to court to try to intimidate her.  Whatever the rights or wrongs of the situation, it is a disproportionate and over-the-top response which should be condemned as out of keeping with any proper behaviour.</P>
        <P>I again raise an issue I have raised every month.  There has been yet another massacre of civilians in Gaza.  They are becoming too frequent.  Super-duper, high-powered technology missed its target and 18 people, including children, were killed.  The world blinks, makes the ritual condemnation and then sells more arms to the country which perpetuates these atrocities.  It is time the world said &ldquo;Stop&rdquo; and recognised that the sense of moral ambiguity which states that we will not speak to Hamas but will arm the other side is a profound moral affront.  Anybody who saw the Channel 4 programme during the week on jihad will know that most young Muslims do not support suicide bombers or any such brutalities but they all support armed resistance to what they see as the extraordinarily one-sided view in the western world about the struggles of the Palestinian people.</P><Col N="169"/>
        <P>As another relic of the struggles of the 1980s, I welcome the re-election of Daniel Ortega as president of Nicaragua.  The destruction of democracy by international terrorism in Nicaragua in 1989 was among the worst things the world has ever done.  It was international terrorism funded by the United States.  It is delightful to see Daniel Ortega finally vindicated and back where he should have remained had it not been for the imposition of a civil war by a malevolent United States.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>Those of us who set out our stalls from day one and opposed the invasion of Iraq believed we were reflecting the decency and fair-mindedness of the American people.  This has been borne out by the results of the mid-term elections in the United States in recent days.  What happened in those terrible years was immoral and unjustified.  The question now is, where do we go from here?  We must first recognise that the right leadership was not provided to the American people.  There was flawed leadership very often based on misrepresentation and even on lies.</P>
        <P>It is important at this stage to focus on the future.  What does the future hold?  We must take this as an opportunity.  It is not a matter of saying &ldquo;I told you so&rdquo;.  There is an opportunity now for the diplomats to take over from the hawks.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Members must also accept &mdash; as must America &mdash; the independence and sovereignty of each individual nation.  We cannot impose our concept of democracy on such countries.  If we do not take these steps, we will encounter the same problems again.  Although America has been a beneficial force in the past, it has been repeatedly demonstrated that it cannot act as the policeman for the entire world.  It is vital that vested interests do not drive foreign policy in respect of the Palestinians because Members cannot stand by idly and watch the terrible persecution that can be seen day in and day out.</P>
        <P>It is important to note that we have not honoured the memory of those people who died in the terrible atrocity on 11 September 2001.  We have done quite the opposite and events have distracted from the grief and suffering.  There is now an opportunity to embrace reality and failure to do so will result in it coming back to haunt us.  This haunting process has started in the past few days.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>Every day, one reads in the national newspapers or sees on television that health specialists encourage active lives and lifestyles for young people.  However, in the past three years, a crisis has developed within schools, and in particular within national schools, in which the authorities who try to run them are obliged to fundraise for all items, including cleaning, water charges, hygiene, insurance and so on.  At present, most national schools curtail and restrict active participation during playtime due to the effect of <Col N="170"/>overly-costly insurance and the many claims that have been taken regarding serious injuries in playgrounds.</P>
        <P>Clearly, the Minister for Education and Science should improve insurance cover for schools.  It is unbelievable that principals should be obliged to spend most of their time organising fundraisers to provide for the day to day running of schools.  At present, capitation grants come to &euro;145.  How can any school maintain itself to a reasonable standard with such a grant level?  I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Education and Science before the House to inquire whether she has a plan for the proper financing of primary and post-primary schools.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I read in today&rsquo;s newspaper that the Department of Finance is obliged to provide an additional &euro;50 million to finance the unexpected retirement of teachers.  For the past three years, almost 1,200 teachers have unexpectedly retired each year in addition to those predicted.  There is a reason for this and no one is paying attention to the approaching crisis in education.</P>
        <P>Yesterday, the Minister announced 70 projects nationwide regarding the building of primary and post-primary schools.  The list included a school at Donabate, County Dublin, which was one of the few schools which were to have been built under the public private partnership, PPP, scheme.  However, this plan has been abandoned and the traditional method of building will be employed.  Obviously, lessons have been learned from the high costs associated with the earlier PPP schemes in Cork and Sligo&mdash;&mdash; </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Senator seek a debate on such matters?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Members have tried to have a debate with the Minister in attendance on this matter on numerous occasions.  However, she has not appeared before the House to debate education for a long time.  The Leader should invite the Minister before the House in order that Members can discuss the crisis that now emanates from many fronts in education.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMauriceHayes"><NameTxt>Dr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I should have thought it was fairly clear why Members cannot be as free as the media to discuss the case the Cathaoirleach does not wish them to discuss.  Theoretically, Members might end up being judge and jury in the case in question and they cannot prejudice that position.</P>
        <P>I support Senator Ryan&rsquo;s call for a debate on housing.  Members have called for such a debate for some time, particularly with regard to social housing and in respect of people such as garda&iacute;, teachers, nurses and street sweepers who are needed to run a city but who can no longer afford to live in this city.  This will become a major problem.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Moreover, in respect of a point raised by Senator Ryan, I also deplore the use of corporate muscle to frighten off people and to smother criti<Col N="171"/>cism.  Moreover, if Members follow the lines proposed in the Privacy Bill, they will make it even easier for rich people and corporate people to prevent others from complaining about them or investigating them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I also support Senator Brian Hayes&rsquo;s comments regarding the Mater Hospital&rsquo;s attack on the former cancer patient.  This issue raises a serious problem.  A good article by Mary Rafferty in today&rsquo;s edition of <i>The Irish Times</i> points out that previously, the same hospital had problems when its ethical committee, from a narrow sectarian point of view, prevented people from getting cancer treatment drugs.  She investigated the members of the board, one of whom is a Sister of Mercy and is the person who was responsible for negotiating the disgraceful deal on compensation.</P>
        <P>The Mater Hospital will be the location of the new children&rsquo;s hospital.  I raised this issue some time ago and Members must reconsider this matter.  It is outrageous that individuals should be subjected to such pressure from a legally bullying and factually inaccurate letter from a firm of Dublin solicitors.</P>
        <P>I was amused to hear Senator Brian Hayes again raise the subject of Seanad reform.  It would be great if he was serious in this respect.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">On the question of children&rsquo;s rights, all Members are in favour.  Senator O&rsquo;Toole rightly referred to the fact that while many people seem to think the noble provisions within the 1916 Proclamation are included within the Constitution, this is not the case.  However, it refers to the rights of the individual.  Why not consider holding a referendum that would guarantee and underwrite people&rsquo;s inalienable rights as individual citizens, rather than the rights of sections, groups, families, children or whatever?</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I agree with Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute;&rsquo;s powerful and passionate indictment of what has been happening in the Middle East.  It is morally revolting and shaming to see attacks that routinely kill women and children.  Is Ireland serious about this?  The Minister should call in the Israeli ambassador to indicate Ireland&rsquo;s revulsion in this regard.  If we were really serious, we should reconsider the external association agreement with Israel, attached to which are human rights protocols.  I have been making this point for the past three years.  Failure to ever act on such protocols diminishes the standing of human rights.</P>
        <P>As for the question raised concerning the attack on O&rsquo;Connell Street, it is appalling that a young woman should be dragged down a street, pushed into an apartment block and then allegedly assaulted.  One of the problems is that people are afraid to intervene.  I have intervened on numerous occasions and I had to receive three stitches in my lip after one intervention.  I was attacked two years ago and received&mdash;&mdash; </P>

	<P>I was also attacked on another occasion.  It is not funny.  I am amazed Members find it entertaining that people get attacked.  If they do find it entertaining, they are part of the problem.  If they do not understand how serious it is to trivialise these situations, they are on the side of the attackers.  At least, I did get stuck in.  </P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>The point I was making was that many young people in this city take drugs like crack cocaine.  One of my assailants was taking crack cocaine.  I was walking down the boardwalk along the River Liffey last week when I saw three young lads smoking something in a glass pipe, which was obviously crack cocaine.  People are afraid because those who take these drugs become out of control.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn"><NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
	<P>I would welcome a debate in this House on the responsibilities of the citizen with obvious reference to the stomach-churning revelations made by Senator Brian Hayes.  I compliment him on bringing these to light.  His revelations bring into clear focus the very ugly face of the NIMBY syndrome.  I recall reading an article about an incident on the streets of New York some years ago which was similar to the incident reported by Senator Brian Hayes.  I said at the time that it was outrageous but such incidents now take place among us.  I would welcome a debate on the obligations of the citizen and what he or she should do because this incident clearly shows the NIMBY syndrome may be prevalent today but such incidents could take place in our own backyard tomorrow.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>I also condemn what happened to that young woman in O&rsquo;Connell Street.  It is appalling enough that any young male or group of males would even contemplate committing such a dreadful act on the main street in our capital city or anywhere else but the fact that it took place in full view of many people who, for whatever reason, did not intervene is even more appalling.  Perhaps Senator Norris is right when he stated many people were afraid to intervene.  It is a reflection on our society that such an act could happen and that people could stand by and watch it happen.  It is time we had a debate around this area and people&rsquo;s responsibilities.  </P>
        <P>I also ask for another debate in respect of issues raised by a report on demographics and population change in Ireland by NCB Stockbrokers, which I understand was published towards the end of last week.  The report produced some very interesting statistics, none of which surprised me.  One statistic that struck me was the finding that by 2010, Ireland will have the highest percentage of young people under 15 and the lowest number of people under 65 in Europe.</P><Col N="174"/>
        <P>This goes against all the arguments from the Government about the future and the pensions time bomb.  This argument has been thrown out the door because of the way our population is growing.  Our pensions will be very secure because of the young population.  We will have enough workers to look after the pensions of the future.  Our priorities are skewed in the wrong direction.  We should be more concerned about how we will cope with all the young people, babies and young children in our country and how we will provide them with schools and related facilities instead of putting by billions of euro for pensions for the future when we know we will have sufficient workers to provide for them.  It would be worthwhile discussing the NCB report here.  Alternatively, representatives from the Government could come before the House, explain from where its data are coming and why its priorities are skewed towards the older people of the future when we know there is a time bomb in respect of how we are going to look after young people.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the call for a debate on housing, particularly affordable housing.  I also examined the report by the Central Bank which, it is fair to say, is predicated on house prices continuing to increase in the 12% to 14% per annum range.  However, it is not clear this will happen.  If interest rates increase by a few more quarter percentage points, this will have a dampening effect to some extent.  However, it is an area where we need to ensure people, particularly young people, as Senator Maurice Hayes noted, are able to afford to buy their own houses.  This is very much part of our culture and tradition in this country.  While income levels in general and increasing income will drive up house prices, there is the fear that increasing house prices are driving up incomes to possibly uncompetitive levels.  It is a very serious issue.  </P>
        <P>I ask the Leader to arrange for a further debate on pensions at some stage.  I am aware Senator Terry has carried out a considerable amount of work in this area and has strong views on it.  However, I cannot share her view that we will not experience difficulties and challenges in respect of pensions simply because of the findings of the report by NCB Stockbrokers.  We heard reports last week that approximately 50% of babies born today, particular females, will live to the age of 100, given the improvements in medical care.  This area will, undoubtedly, present a very strong challenge.  I am a strong supporter of the very courageous move by the former Minister for Finance, Charlie McCreevy, in this area when he put a number of billions of euro away to plan for this.  We need to do this.  Senator Terry has a different point of view, which is worthy of debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelCoonan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coonan</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the call for a debate on the issues raised by the incident referred to by Senator Brian Hayes.  Such incidents are not con<Col N="175"/>fined to the capital but, unfortunately, take place in rural Ireland.  We can never underestimate the profound impact such an incident has on the victim and his or her family.  The issue deserves both debate and serious action.  </P>
        <P Just="Left">During the week, Food and Drink Ireland issued a report on the food and drink sector in Ireland.  This sector is extremely important to the economy and employment as it generates in excess of &euro;18 billion and employs 250,000 people directly or indirectly, including the farming community.  The Departments of Agriculture and Food, Enterprise, Trade and Employment, and Health and Children are all concerned with promoting the industry.  It would be very worthwhile debating an allegation in the report that the three Departments are pursuing different agendas.  The report also states the food industry in this country is suffering due to costly overregulation, such as the farm to fork policy pursued by the EU, and an unbalanced policy by the World Trade Organisation which favours large corporate producers in Third World countries like Brazil, China and India.  This is a serious issue for our country and is worth debating.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I support the call for a debate on housing, particularly Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000, which concerns social and affordable housing.  I understand that in many instances, developers have got around the need for social and affordable housing by virtue of broad sweep outline planning permission and I want to find out if this is true.  I also wish to debate the unevenness of practice throughout the country.  Some local authorities will accept cash in lieu of social and affordable housing, while others will accept other sites.  There is also the question of whether some local authorities insist it must be in the particular development itself.  I would like a debate on the matter to enable us establish the definitive rules or if such exist.</P>
        <P>I strongly support what Senator Terry said about pensions.  I hope the Minister for Finance in the forthcoming budget will provide greater flexibility in regard to encouraging the provision of pensions, of which there is such a shortfall.  In particular, he should allow more flexibility in terms of all the cash that is supposed to, and no doubt will, flow from SSIAs, as he has been restrictive in regard to the rules in place pertaining to them.   He could allow much more flexibility in that respect and hopefully he will do so in his Budget Statement.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Leader of the Opposition, Senator Brian Hayes, raised a matter I read about in a newspaper this morning.  I was shocked by what I read.  It was the worst case of sexual depravity I ever read about suffered by a young woman when walking down a street in Dublin.  As the Senator said, passers by turned the other way, although there could be many reasons they did <Col N="176"/>so.  Senator Norris told us explicitly what happened to him when he went to help a person, but it is easy for us to stand back from this attack and say it was a dreadful event and comment on how it was handled.  On another level, it awakens the debate on active citizenship.  However, surely in a purely humble, biblical way, one does not turn one&rsquo;s face away when a person is in trouble, rather one goes to the person&rsquo;s aid.</P>
        <P>Senator Brian Hayes raised the matter of a referendum on the rights of children.  He rightly asked in that context if a referendum could be held on matters related to reforms of the Seanad, as more than one referendum will be required.  I agree with the Senator and he said we should meet the Taoiseach on this matter.  I propose that the five leaders of the parties would go to see the Taoiseach and put this proposal to him.  I will arrange that and report back to the Senator.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole raised the Judge Curtin case.  The deputy leader of this House said he could not report on it because he is a member of the relevant committee and it would be entirely wrong for him to so.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">None of us can report on it because it was laid before this House that there would be one report on it and that it would be then debated.  We will not give interim reports on it.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Neither will we give comfort to anyone.  The matter must be proceeded with.  </P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole spoke about a proposed referendum on the rights of children and the powerful paragraph in that respect which is in the 1916 Proclamation but which everyone believes is in the Constitution.  He also spoke about the rights of citizens in society.</P>
        <P>Senator Ryan raised the matter of the report of the Central Bank of Ireland on housing and its projections, which in some respects are terrifying.  The Senator also raised the matter of a private hospital which is up in arms over a book written by Janette, whose second name does not come to mind, in which she outlines her treatment in a particular hospital.  I saw her being interviewed on television and thought she was plucky, factual and down to earth.  There is something of the mighty taking on the weak in this episode.  I agree with the Senator that the hospital&rsquo;s reaction in this case was an over-the-top response.</P>
        <P>Senator Ryan also raised the situation in Gaza, the arms dealing and the case of the Palestinians.  He welcomed Daniel Ortega&rsquo;s return to power in Nicaragua.  I believe everybody was thinking back to other times and welcomed his return.  He has given constant reassurances since he was re-elected &mdash; although &ldquo;re-elected&rdquo; is the wrong <Col N="177"/>word as he was gone for a number of years &mdash; that he will do things not in a radical but in a common-sense way.  It is interesting because all around us the great and the good of the stars and stripes are falling.</P>
        <P>Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; blamed the flawed leadership in America for the situation we are in and I agree with him that we must now focus on the future.  As Ambassador Bruton said here yesterday, we are where we are, regardless of looking back and reflecting on those of us who spoke out so strongly at the time.  The Senator said that the diplomats should take over from the hawks and that the vested interests should no longer drive foreign policy.  That is what drove foreign policy in Iraq, namely vested oil interests while another group of vested interests were involved in the reconstruction process.</P>
        <P>Senator Ulick Burke raised the matter of a crisis in schools.  He called for a debate on many school matters.  I will endeavour to arrange for such a debate in the House with the Minister concerned.</P>
        <P>Senator Maurice Hayes called for a debate on housing.  I remind him that on 12 October, which was only three weeks ago, we had quite a good debate on housing here.  However, the matter has moved on because of the recent report of the Central Bank and the facts that have emerged.  We could consider that.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Maurice Hayes also agreed with Senator Ryan on the way in which the hospital concerned handled the matter of the book written about it.  Senator Norris supported Senator Maurice Hayes's comments in that respect.  Senator Norris raised the matter of children&rsquo;s rights and he wants Seanad reform.</P>
        <P>I remind Senator Norris that Senator Ulick Burke is already standing for Galway East so he cannot possibly take up the Senator&rsquo;s kind offer.</P>

	<P>It has not affected the Senator&rsquo;s lip in generic terms, what he can say or how he says it.  We were not laughing at the idea of a person going to the aid of another person and being attacked.</P>
        <P>Senator Glynn raised the matter of the ugly face of the NIMBY syndrome which is prevalent here and he sought a debate on the responsibilities of citizens.  Senator Terry raised the matter of pensions and I accept her point.  We will have the highest percentage of young people under a certain age in a few years&rsquo; time and many of them will be able to work to provide for us in later life.  This matter is tied up with the issue of pensions.  Perhaps a general debate on the issue would be useful.  The Senator said that the NCB report was good and interesting.</P>
        <P>Senator Jim Walsh also called for  a debate on housing, particularly affordable housing.  Different mechanisms are used by county councils to implement the obligations under Part V of the planning legislation.  Some of them buy houses in other estates.  It seems a random way to deal with it, but they are getting to grips with the problem.  In my county a determined attempt has been <Col N="179"/>made to secure social and affordable housing in different housing estates.  Difficulties arise, and people complain about the problem, but the way in which it is tackled by different county councils is random.  Perhaps a standard approach should be taken to the implementation of obligations under Part V of the planning legislation.</P>
        <P>Senator Coonan spoke about the sexual assault of a woman in O&rsquo;Connell Street.  He raised in particular the report of Food and Drink Ireland.  Three Departments, namely the Departments of Agriculture and Food, Enterprise, Trade and Employment and Health and Children are involved in overseeing this kind of business.  He said there tends to be over-regulation in food production, but I wish to point out that we have very good small producers engaged in organic production and there are also some major producers, including some corporate Irish food producers, who are internationally acclaimed throughout the world, some of whom are based in the Senator&rsquo;s area.</P>
        <P>Senator Coghlan called for a debate on Part V of the planning legislation and the different approaches to this aspect of housing.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The proposal is to delete lines 27 to 46 and substitute the text as outlined in the amendment.  The substance of the section remains the same, apart from subsection (3).  For drafting reasons the Parliamentary Counsel found it necessary, in order to facilitate the introduction of the subsection, to set out the entire provision.  The purpose of the section is to reflect Article 11 of the Patent Law Treaty relief in respect to time limits, which requires that a right to a one-off extension of a time limit fixed by an office &mdash; in this case the controller &mdash; must be allowed as a right and not subject to the exercise of discretion on the part of the controller&rsquo;s office.  This is a most important provision.</P>
        <P>Subsection (3) is being introduced to reflect that Article 11 of the Patent Law Treaty requires that a minimum length of extension be allowed from the date of expiration of the extended time limit.  This limit will be prescribed in the patent rules.  Subsection (1) is unchanged from that passed by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  Subsection (2) provides that the controller shall grant the extension, as I explained.  Subsection (4) provides that if an extension of time is granted, the legal consequences of the failure to observe the time limit shall be deemed not to have ensued.  Subsection (5) provides that any further examination of time will be at the discretion of the controller.  Subsection (6) provides that this section does not apply to proceedings before the controller.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>From previously being in the position of the Minister of State, I understand it is important to give 100% co-operation.  Under the circumstances, if the Minister of State feels the Department is satisfied we can deal with Report Stage, and it would be of benefit to pass the Bill, I will concur with his request.  The Leader of the House requires Bills to be given detailed consideration.  Sometimes Bills are brought forward in the House in a hurry.  If an early signature motion is required, we will agree to it.  It is a matter for the Minister of State.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ahern, for this Bill.  It is technical but important and will have major repercussions on the protection of patents in this country.  Perhaps after the Bill is passed the Minister <Col N="185"/>of State will promote patents and encourage people to take them out.  Sometimes people create important inventions but neglect to go through the proper patent process.  As such, they lose rights to those products irrespective of the benefit they would have had personally, to their companies or to the country.  I strongly recommend the Minister of State and the Department promote the benefits of patents in any way they can.</P>
        <P>The acting director of the Patents Office was anxious about this matter.  I understand a new director has been appointed.  I do not know whether he or she has taken up the position yet.  It would be worthwhile for the Minister of State to meet the new director and make patents more meaningful.  It should be as simple as possible to patent.  It is off-putting to have to go through an extremely expensive process and patent agents are not always necessary.</P>
        <P>I thank the Minister of State and his efficient and effective departmental officials.  It is nice to see three ladies in such prominent positions in the House.  They are welcome and I congratulate them on this detailed and technical Bill.  I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Killeen, for coming before the House.  I also thank the Leas-Chathaoirleach and the Opposition for being so co-operative in passing this Bill.</P>

	<P>I also thank the Ministers of State, Deputies Killeen and Michael Ahern, and their staff.  I hope I did not upset anything between Senator Leyden and his Leader in this House.  I would hate to do so.  I understood from previous discussions I had with the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ahern, that because this matter is non-contentious and has overrun, it was more expeditious to conduct our business as we did.  The Minister of State, Deputy Killeen, mentioned time constraints may arise.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Leas-Chathaoirleach, Senator Coghlan for his suggestion and Senators Leyden and Hanafin for their co-operation.  On behalf of the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ahern, I thank the Senators for facilitating the passage of the Bill.  It must return to the D&aacute;il and time constraints will arise.  I also commend the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ahern, on his work on this extremely technical Bill which is important for the protection of intellectual property.  I also thank the hard-working departmental officials who included in this Bill several provisions which will save us introducing primary legislation in the future.</P>

	<P><i>Prima facie</i> we would believe land includes anything which composes that land, be it earth, soil, rock, minerals or other<Col N="187"/>wise.  Therefore, I wondered about the exact purpose of the amendment.  If there were some point of substance, I would have to ask the expert drafting group to examine it.

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome that.  There is a need to address that area where there are anomalies.  Some management companies exert influence beyond what was intended, sometimes to the detriment of the people who have purchased properties.  When it is being examined there is a need to look at interim arrangements whereby the developer controls the management company until all the apartments in a development have been purchased, and sometimes beyond that.  Service charges are often unrealistic and there are sometimes contingent liabilities to be made subsequently.  I welcome the fact that the Minister is <Col N="189"/>examining the issue as it warrants a degree of evaluation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>I also welcome the fact that the study is being carried out.  The problem is in urgent need of attention.  With the many apartment complexes being built in Dublin and throughout the country, these management companies and charges cause serious problems for those who buy apartments in those complexes.  I appreciate that somebody has to maintain a block of apartments.  They are different from housing estates in which each individual is obliged to maintain his or her own property while the council looks after the common areas.  Apartment blocks need management companies to do that.  My knowledge is of those in my area and the Dublin area where they cause serious problems.  I do not know how the Minister will sort it out.</P>
        <P>In recent years where, in many cases, investors have bought most of the apartments in a complex, the landlords are not paying the management fees.  I would like the Minister to examine that.  Paying the management fee is the obligation not of the tenant but the landlord.  However in many cases the bill goes to the apartment and the tenant perhaps throws it in the bin and does not pass it on to the landlord.  It is up to the landlord to ensure the management fee is paid.  Many complexes in Dublin suffer because the fees are not being paid to the management company which gets into difficulty as a result.  In some Dublin developments a number of management companies have gone out of business because they do not have the necessary funding.  It is a complex and difficult situation and strict legislation needs to be brought in to ensure this area will be dealt with properly in the future.  I welcome the fact that this study will be done and I urge that good, strong legislation be introduced to deal with the problem.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 19:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 27, before section 28, but in Part 6, to insert the following new section:</P>
        <P LI="1">&ldquo;28.&mdash;Where a co-ownership is to be established, it shall be established as a tenancy in common and no joint tenancy shall be created unless&mdash;</P>
        <P LI="2">(<i>a</i>) it is the stated intention of all parties to the co-ownership to create a joint tenancy, and</P>
        <P LI="2">(<i>b</i>) each party to the co-ownership has signed a declaration to the effect that he or she understands&mdash;</P>
        <P LI="3">(i) the difference between a tenancy in common and a joint tenancy,</P>
        <P LI="3">(ii) that the creation of a joint tenancy means that, upon his or her death, his or <Col N="191"/>her interest in the land passes automatically to the surviving co-owners(s), and</P>
        <P LI="3">(iii) that a joint tenancy cannot be severed other than in accordance with <i>section 28.</i>&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I am standing in for Senator Cummins, who has put a good deal of work into this amendment, as indeed he has into all of those he has tabled.  I shall endeavour to cover what he had prepared for it.</P>
        <P>This amendment is an important one, and its function is to make tenancy in common the default status of co-ownership.  People generally understand that if a person owns a share in a property, land or building, it will pass to his or her heirs on death.  That is the situation where a tenancy in common is concerned, yet very often co-owners inadvertently create a joint tenancy, thereby denying their heirs any right of survivorship.</P>
        <P>People should not be put in a situation where they may sleepwalk into a joint tenancy.  The law on this issue at the moment is that in the absence of a specific instruction to the contrary a joint tenancy is assumed.  Undoubtedly there are circumstances where a joint tenancy is exactly what is required.  Certainly we see entirely intentional joint tenancy in marriage, between business partners etc.  The concept of a joint tenancy is important for such circumstances and the obvious flipside is that in the event of the death of a tenant in common, his or her heirs could sell the inherited interest in the property from under the other co-owners without any consideration for their concerns.</P>
        <P>However, many people will be unaware of the consequences of the establishment of a joint tenancy, and it should be made very clear to them beforehand.  I would urge the Minister to accept this amendment for the three following reasons.  Many joint tenancies are unintentionally created by buyers and they are unaware of the consequences of their actions in this respect.  This amendment would not make the creation of a joint tenancy any more difficult, but it would ensure informed decisions by buyers.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Joint tenancy is a common law doctrine and therefore unfamiliar to most jurisdictions.  With the increase in population in Ireland, particularly from other EU countries, the majority of which operate a civil law system that would not allow a joint tenancy to exist, it would be prudent to accept this amendment to ensure that buyers are fully aware of the pitfalls of the type of co-ownership they create.  While ignorance is never a defence, it is surely worthwhile guaranteeing that all buyers are equally informed at the time of purchase.</P>
        <P>With the increased measures laid out in section 28, it would be all the more difficult for joint tenants to sever a joint tenancy or convert it to a tenancy in common.  This should be accompanied <Col N="192"/>by increased safeguards against purchasers making decisions on the basis of misinformation or misconception.  I should welcome the Minister&rsquo;s response to the proposed amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I am supportive of the sentiments expressed by Senator Terry.  I have come across instances where people have inadvertently gone the route of joint tenancy without realising that their successors in title will not be beneficiaries of the land and that it will accrue to the party that lives longest.  Something needs to be put in place.  In many instances, a good solicitor will explain the implications fairly thoroughly to his or her client and the difference between tenancy in common and joint tenancy.  However, there may be instances where it is perhaps overlooked or of malfeasance and therefore it does not happen.</P>
        <P>The Minister will, no doubt, comment on the merits of the amendment, but there is a need for a degree of certainty in this area.  The point made by Senator Terry is correct, given the number of immigrants we have who will be totally unfamiliar, as are many Irish people, with the joint tenancy implications.  There is a need, perhaps, to have them redesignated so that their meaning is clearer.  There might be another way of doing it, but there is need to do something further in the Bill to provide for this area.  I urge the Minister to try to come up with something that will satisfy the concerns expressed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>My only concern as regards amendment No. 19, as it stands, is about the fact that I believe the majority of people who opt to buy property in co-ownership intend that there will be joint tenancy.  The effect could be that people might presume they were going to inherit a property when a partner in the property dies.  It means that surviving spouses, for example, might be left in a vulnerable position because they might not be aware of the ramifications and suddenly find that it was not a joint tenancy, despite their having previously thought it was.  It is a matter of changing from one common predominator to another.</P>
        <P>In general up to this, when people have bought property they intended it to be in joint tenancy.  The advantage of having a joint tenancy is that the other half of the property does not go into the estate of a person on  his or her death.  It is automatically transferred to the surviving partner.  If it went into the estate, there are all the probate costs to be considered.  It would mean that probate would have to be granted before a surviving partner could get his or entitlement for the part of the estate held by the person who died as a tenant in common.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>It is very interesting to listen to the two arguments, both of which are persuasive, in one sense.  If one is to have a default or presumptive mode in the joint purchase of property, there will be consequences, no <Col N="193"/>matter how one looks at it.  As Senator Tuffy says, there are major advantages in a joint tenancy from the viewpoint of neatness.  If a joint owner dies, the other joint owner could be completely frozen, while some type of dispute goes on over whether he or she died intestate, or a dispute arises with a spouse over the legal rights, etc. All kinds of features can arise which have the effect of immobilising property. </P>
        <P>On the other hand, as Senator Jim Walsh has said, not merely do most immigrants not know the law, most Irish people do not know it either.  If one were to ask people in the street the difference between a tenancy in common and a joint tenancy, one could be locked up.</P>

        <P>We have a problem here.  I will examine Senator Cummins&rsquo;s amendment for the reasons outlined by Senator Terry.  I will consider whether the issues raised by Senator Tuffy outweigh those in the amendment set down by Senator Cummins.  We may be in danger of substituting one set of problems for another.  The traditional presumption may be as good as the new presumption.  I am agnostic on the matter but Senator Tuffy&rsquo;s argument is quite convincing.</P>

	<P>Senator Tuffy and the Minister are members of the legal profession and understand the point.  I do not seek to delete the provision of joint tenancy but those who enter into a joint tenancy must clearly understand the difference between it and a tenancy in common and the implications for family members.  We must deal with it in a way that ensures clear understanding without affecting the benefits of joint tenancy for owning property.  That is the challenge for the Minister.</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister for examining this matter again, particularly in light of a changing Ireland with many people moving here from Europe and buying property.  Irish residents must also know the difference between the two tenancies and this should be pointed out to them.  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s response.  I will resubmit this amendment on Report Stage.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 23:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 30, subsection (1), line 21, to delete &ldquo;only on registration of a court order&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;on registration of a court order or otherwise&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The requirement in section 33 that an easement or <i>profits &agrave; prendre</i>  should be required at law by prescription only on registration of a court order would appear to be unduly onerous.  I am not sure how good is my pronunciation of French.  Surely a deed can be created to acknowledge such a right without the necessity of a court order.</P>
        <P>There is a contradiction in section 38(2) which states: &ldquo;A conveyance of land creates for the benefit of that land any easement or <i>profits &agrave; prendre</i>  over the land retained by the grantor which it is reasonable to assume, in the circumstances of the case, was, or would have been if they had adverted to the matter, within the contemplation of the parties at the date of the conveyance as being included in it.&rdquo;  It is assumed that, had the matter been discussed at the time of the agreement, it would have been accepted that the easement or <i>profits &agrave;</i><b><i> </i></b><i>prendre</i>  formed part of the conveyance.  The rule in <i>Wheeldon v. Burrows</i> is to be abolished.  No court order appears to be necessary in respect of section 38 and this appears to contradict section 33.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I can reassure the House that when using Norman French legal terms one can pronounce them as if they were bog standard English words.  Everybody can pronounce them in any way he or she wishes and knowing the French pronunciation is not necessary.</P>
        <P>I do not propose to accept the amendment tabled by Senator Cummins.  Introducing the <Col N="195"/>words suggested, &ldquo;or otherwise&rdquo;, without any definition of what that means would render the section vague and uncertain.  The provisions in section 33, which replace the provisions in the Prescription Acts, are based on detailed Law Reform Commission recommendations in 2002 set out in its report on the acquisition of easements and <i>profits &agrave; prendre</i>  by prescription.</P>
        <P>Before a right over the land of another person is considered an easement there must be a dominant and servient tenement.  In other words, a right is an easement only if there is a property in whose favour the right is created and a property subject to it.  The servient tenement is the land over which the easement is exercisable while the dominant tenement is the land, owned and occupied by another person, that benefits from the easement to which it is attached.  When the land is transferred, the easement is included in the transfer to the new owner.  Examples of easements include drainage pipes and overhead cables, rights of support and rights of access to the dominant land.  A right of way must be in favour of land in order to be an easement.  If, for example, someone includes in a land document the right for me to walk up and down the garden, this is a licence rather than an easement because it is not in favour of some other land.  The most usual and straightforward way of creating an easement is an express grant.  That happens when a grantor sells land and gives the grantee an easement over that land, such as a right of way.</P>
        <P>On the other hand, an easement can be reserved for a person who sells land but retains an easement for the benefit of the land retained, such as a shortcut across a field.  In such circumstances, an implied easement may arise in the case of access to a landlocked parcel of land or mutual support between two houses.  If one sells land and retains a landlocked portion in the middle the courts will infer an easement of access to the land and a right of way to it on the basis that no one should make one&rsquo;s land inaccessible.  Likewise, if two houses are in a terrace, even if there is no express grant of a right of support easement, the courts will infer such an easement.  If one buys a house in a terrace, it is assumed that one of the property owners is not in a position to tear down his house and cause the other house to collapse.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Easements can be also acquired by prescription under the old statutes, the Prescription Acts, to which I have referred.  Where previous owners have, over a long period, continuously acted as if they were entitled to the easement, the court may recognise that a person has acquired an easement over the servient land by prescription.  Section 33 clarifies and simplifies the existing law by providing that legal title to an easement or profit by prescription may be obtained by a claimant only on the basis of a court order that is registered in the Land Registry or the Registry of Deeds.  Section 69 of the Registration of Title Act pro<Col N="196"/>vides for the registration of easements and profits created by express grant or reservation after first reservation or by court order.</P>
        <P>The words &ldquo;or otherwise&rdquo; that Senator Cummins proposes to add do not make the meaning clear.  I am unhappy that some meaning would be attached to them but I will consider the amendment before Report Stage to see if there is any merit in introducing it.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 27: </P>
        <P LI="1">&ldquo;46.&mdash;In page 35, before section 46, but in Chapter 3, to insert the following new section:</P>
        <P LI="2">Where a person complains that trees or hedges grown or maintained by a neighbouring owner are of such a height as to constitute an unreasonable interference with any easement enjoyed by the complaining owner, or unreasonably interfere with light whether or not an easement exists in that regard, the person may apply to the court which may make such order, including an order directing the neighbouring owner to remove or reduce the height of any trees or hedges.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">We have tabled this amendment after consulting legislation in the United Kingdom to control the problem of high hedges or trees.  I have encountered this issue in my role as a public representative, as I am sure has the Minister.  A person who raises this issue with a neighbour or the local authority must depend on the neighbour&rsquo;s good will.  While court should be a place of last resort if the complainant has the possibility of going to court, as in other cases of nuisance, that can pressurise the neighbour into resolving the issue.</P>
        <P>We are trying to find a way to give a person in this situation the legal ground to ask his or her neighbour to deal with the problem.  Elderly people have often raised this issue with me because they are not able to persuade their neighbours to do something about a situation that causes hardship to those elderly people.  What does the Minister think of our proposal?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate the problem raised here.  The <i>cupressus leylandii </i>used in suburbia can create mayhem for an adjoining owner.  The law is unsatisfactory because one does not have the right to instruct another to keep a <i>leylandii</i> hedge to a reasonable height.  I am sympathetic to the purpose of this amendment which is designed to give a real remedy to a person in that position.  This, however, is not the correct Bill in which to deal with this issue.</P>
        <P>The phrase &ldquo;grown or maintained&rdquo; in the text of the amendment could give rise to terrible disputes.  For example, if there is a 100 foot high beech tree growing on a person&rsquo;s land people could say they are afraid it will fall on their houses or that it interferes with their view.  The <Col N="199"/>real issue is to find a legislative vehicle to deal properly with the problem Senator Tuffy has raised.  It would be better to enter this provision in some planning Bill than in the Land Law and Conveyancing Act.  Many issues arise, because apart from the cypress hedge it applies to fully grown trees.  I suggest therefore that the Oireachtas examine this genuine issue in some other context.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>I, too, have sympathy with the proposal in the amendment and appreciate the Minister&rsquo;s response.  This is a serious problem for people in suburban areas where <i>leylandii </i>or other trees grow to 30 or 40 feet and block sunlight from adjoining houses or cause problems with boundary walls and grass which will not grow within a few yards of <i>leylandii</i>.  When neighbours cannot come together to reach agreement on what should be done the law should be available as a last resort for them.  This legislation is not the correct context for such a provision.  The Minister stated it could be provided for in planning legislation.  Will he suggest it to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government?  All public representatives have had to deal with such cases.  I have sympathy with the thrust of the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I appreciate the support of the Minister and Senator Terry for the thrust of the amendment.  The UK system to which I referred comes under environmental legislation and it probably would be the right context for this amendment.  A clause should be inserted requiring some attempt at alternative dispute resolution to have been made before parties go to court.  A formal system of arbitration for the cases I described must be put in place.  It could also include noise and nuisance regulations.  The courts are not the place for these cases to be resolved.  Some formal structure needs to be put in place that puts pressure on the other person to negotiate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I will communicate with the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government on this issue.  It deserves legislative treatment.  I agree with Senator Tuffy that a quick and simple solution rather than a court case is desirable.  One does not need solicitors and barristers arguing about the height of bushes in people&rsquo;s gardens if it can be avoided.  I am not saying there is anything wrong with solicitors or barristers but ordinary people cannot afford any more to go to court for relatively minor issues such as this.  Some system of arbitration by a local authority may offer the best system.  At least a local authority has a grasp of planning laws and the like.  Giving the right in this legislation would only clog up the courts with arguments about the heights of bushes.  The matter requires more reflection.</P>

	<P>Subsection (2)(<i>b</i>)(i)(IV) provides that a deed is correctly executed if it is &ldquo;signed and sealed by the individual&rdquo;.  Is it a requirement that such a deed should be witnessed?  Will the Minister explain what is required to make the deed &ldquo;sealed&rdquo;?</P>
        <P>My understanding of current conveyancing law is that the witness does not have to be in the presence of the signatory to validate the deed.  Will the Minister clarify whether this is the case?  The function of the witness is to endorse the individual&rsquo;s signature, but I understand that endorsement was not required to be made in the latter&rsquo;s presence.  However, subsections (2)(<i>b</i>)(i)(I), (2)(<i>b</i>)(i)(II) and (2)(<i>b</i>)(i)(III) specify &ldquo;in the presence of a witness&rdquo;.  Are we introducing a new requirement into conveyancing law with these provisions?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>The purpose of having a witness sign the deed is to ensure the signatory cannot subsequently claim it is not his or her signature.  The witness&rsquo;s role is to validate.  Subsections (2)(<i>b</i>)(i)(I), (2)(<i>b</i>)(i)(II) and  (2)(<i>b</i>)(i)(III) make reference to &ldquo;in the presence of a witness&rdquo;.  Subsection (2)(<i>b</i>)(i)(IV), however, refers to &ldquo;signed and sealed by the individual&rdquo;.  I am unsure in what circumstances an individual would have a seal, which is usually associated with corporate entities.  If a seal is used, however, I assume it is tantamount to the witnessing of the signature.  If the seal of an individual is also endorsed on the document, it would be difficult for him or her subsequently to disown the signature.  Will the Minister clarify this provision?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>Like Senator Jim Walsh, I ask the Minister to explain what a seal involves.  On my previous question, I see that subsection (2)(<i>b</i>)(i)(III) provides that the individual may acknowledge the signature in the presence of the witness, which implies that the latter need not be present when the signature is made.  However, I am still unsure of what exactly is involved here.  I recall checking the definition of &ldquo;witness&rdquo; and my understanding is that the witness must validate the signature but that this validation is not necessary to be done in the signatory&rsquo;s presence.</P>
        <P>According to custom and practice in conveyancing, deeds are generally said to be signed, sealed and delivered in the presence of the individual concerned.  I would have thought, however, that a deed signed by an individual and subsequently validated by a witness  would be valid regardless of whether the individual was present when the validation was made.  Are we making existing law more strict in this regard?  I am sure it sometimes happens that witnesses sign deeds at a later time than they were signed by the individual concerned in circumstances where the former may or may not have seen the signature being made but is certain it is valid.  I understood such a procedure would be valid so long as the witness <Col N="204"/>understands the seriousness of what he or she is doing.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Section 62 is intended to modify substantially the formalities for the correct execution of deeds.  Subsection (1) abolishes the need for a seal in the case of execution by an individual, but a seal will remain necessary for corporations.  It also abolishes the rule that authority given to another person to deliver a deed must itself be given by deed.  This has already been done in regard to powers of attorney under section 15 of the 1996 Act.</P>
        <P>Subsection (2) sets out the new requirements for deeds following the abolition of the need for sealing by individuals.  Subsection (2)(<i>a</i>) provides for identification of a document as a deed by giving it an appropriate heading or otherwise making it clear on its face that it is intended to be a deed, or by expressing it to be executed or signed as a deed.  This is one of the aspects of the new arrangements to differentiate between a deed and a letter of intent or similar.</P>
        <P>Paragraph (<i>b</i>) sets out the different methods of execution depending on the status of the person or body executing the deed.  Subparagraph (i) makes it clear that while individuals are no longer required to use a seal, it remains open to them to do so if they wish.  Subparagraphs (ii) and (iii) preserve the existing law relating to corporations.</P>
        <P>The Senators asked what is involved in a seal and whether, under these provisions, a deed that is signed and sealed by the individual must also be witnessed.  This is a good question and I do not have an immediate answer.  I will consult the expert group on this because I do not want to mislead the House.</P>
        <P>Senator Tuffy asked about the meaning of subparagraph (i)(III), which specifies that the deed can be &ldquo;acknowledged by the individual in the presence of a witness who attests the signature&rdquo;.  Is the Senator asking whether it is necessary for the witness to be present when the signature is made or whether one can witness a deed without seeing it being signed?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.  My question goes further, however, in that I wish to know whether it is even necessary for the individual to be present when the witness endorses the signature.  The definition of the word &ldquo;witness&rdquo; implies that a witness may endorse a person&rsquo;s signature without necessarily being in the presence of the signatory when the endorsement is made.  Has it always been a requirement of land law that one must be in the presence of the person whose signature one is witnessing?  That seems to be the requirement in subsections (1), (2) and (3) in that the witnesses and the person signing must both be present.  I know that is the practice and is the way the deed is set out.  If the deed simply said it must be signed by X and witnessed by Y, the witness would not necessarily need to be present at the same time as the person signing.  However, I believe that is <Col N="205"/>the requirement in this section.  Is this taking it a bit further than was the case before?  Is that a good idea?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not know.  I would say Senator Tuffy has seen the execution of many more documents than I have in my time because barristers rarely see them executed.  I always thought witnessing a signature meant being physically present when the signature was carried out rather than coming in afterwards and somehow countersigning it at a later point.  I may be wrong on that and I do not want to embarrass anybody but I do not believe one would be a witness if one did not actually witness the signature.  For instance, in the case of a will, if one did not see it being signed, I do not believe one would be a witness to it.  I could, however, be wrong on that and there could be some&mdash;&mdash; </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>I always thought the will was a lot stricter in terms of requirements.  One can challenge a will and state the witness was not present at the time and it was not executed properly.  Are we now bringing that element to deeds of conveyancing?  We are making it a lot stricter than was the case and that could lead to problems.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I may be very old fashioned but I always imagined witnessing a signature was the same for a will as for a deed and that one could not witness it if one did not see it happen.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>In corporations, the normal phraseology is &ldquo;signed and sealed in the presence of&rdquo;.  That is clear English.  I agree there is probably a practice where a person may sign the deeds, contract or whatever at home and post them back to the solicitor who will know the signature and will get somebody to sign as witness.  That is short-circuiting.  If there were a problem subsequently and somebody claimed it was not his or her signature, there would be a real issue about the fact the person did not witness it.  Any deviation from the requirement that one must be present and see the signature being made if one witnesses a signature could cause legal problems down the line.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate the seriousness of signing a conveyancing deed.  I always understood that two people had to be present to witness the making of a will and that there were strict rules surrounding an affidavit.  Senator Jim Walsh is right and let us call a spade a spade.  There is possibly a practice where a person signs deeds and the solicitor, who is not in the office at the time, witnesses it afterwards knowing it is that person&rsquo;s signature.  Obviously, it is very different from a will because there are issues of affidavits with a will.  It is quite serious if someone makes a will but a witness states he or she was not present at the time of the signing of the will and that he or she came in afterwards.  That would be a major <Col N="206"/>issue.  In practice, a conveyancing deed was seen as slightly different and I am concerned.  If this provision brings a stricter element into the situation, it is important solicitors are aware of it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not saying this to embarrass anybody but I would have thought that if one sent a deed to one&rsquo;s client at home, asked him or her to sign it, return it to one&rsquo;s office and one signed the witness part one&rsquo;s self, technically speaking, one has not witnessed the signature.  As Senator Jim Walsh said, it is a shortcut and in certain circumstances, one could end up in the soup.  I may be wrong on that but I believe the term &ldquo;witnessing a signature&rdquo; has the same meaning in conveyancing as it does in a testamentary context.  I am not conscious that I am making the law stricter but if my understanding is correct, what is in the text confirms it.  If the Senator&rsquo;s understanding is correct, it is making the law stricter but I do not believe she is correct.</P>

        <P FLI="0">This amendment is designed to make clear that a bank or building society cannot take possession without a court order merely because it induced a homeowner to sign a consent when taking out a mortgage.  The consent, to be valid, must be in contemplation of the specific taking of possession.</P>
        <P>There may be another way to amend this section to try to deal with this issue.  However, unless the mortgagor consents in writing to such a taking, if some kind of consent exists in the mortgage itself, this section as it stands could allow it to kick in.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not propose to accept the amendment because section 94(1) provides that a mortgagee shall not take possession of the mortgaged property without a court order, unless the consent of the mortgagor has been given.  The amendment now seeks to impose a condition. <Col N="210"/> Effectively, the consent would have to be given within the preceding year.  This would mean the mortgagee &mdash; the building society &mdash; would be required to update each mortgagor&rsquo;s consent every year or, failing that, to go to court in all cases that would arise.  This would create either additional administrative costs for mortgagees or additional court-related costs.  This would not be in the public interest.</P>
        <P>I can see the Senator&rsquo;s point.  She is suggesting that early in the life of a mortgage, general consent seems to recede into the background of everyone&rsquo;s memory as time passes.  However, she is really suggesting that non-court based possession would become very difficult, if not impossible in most cases.  The law should be left as it is.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>When taking possession of a property as a result of a failure on the part of the mortgagee to meet the mortgage, I cannot discern the presence of an obligation on mortgagors to maximise the value of properties.  Often, their sole interest is to recover the mortgage.  However, <Col N="211"/>there may be a residual value in excess of the mortgage that should accrue to the defaulting mortgagee in such circumstances.  I do not see such an obligation in the section although there should be one somewhere in law.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the general proposition advanced by Senator Jim Walsh that one should not have a situation in which one can simply realise one&rsquo;s interest in a property and effectively throw the property to the wolves without securing anything for others who might still have a residual interest in it.</P>
        <P>However, section 99 provides that:</P>
        <P LI="1">In the exercise of the power of sale conferred by this <i>Chapter</i> or any express power of sale, the mortgagee, or any receiver or other person acting on behalf of the mortgagee, shall, notwithstanding any stipulation to the contrary in the mortgage, ensure as far as is reasonably practicable that the mortgaged property is sold at the best price reasonably obtainable.</P>

        <P Just="Center">SECTION 119.</P>
        <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 119 be deleted.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>It is proposed to transfer section 119 to a new Part 12, as set in amendment No. 69.  As regards the substance of the section, the writ of <i>fieri facias</i> is an old common law remedy which allows the sheriff to seize the chattels of a debtor on foot of an execution order.  Courts have held that chattels in this context include chattels real.  Chattels real include leasehold property.  A leasehold property is not realty.  It is personality but it is called chattels real.  Therefore, the sheriff can, on a <i>fieri facias</i> order, seize a leasehold itself.  </P>
        <P>For a reason which I will set out shortly, the remedy is rarely used today.  I will set out the background to the inclusion of the proposed abolition of the sheriff&rsquo;s power to seize leasehold in section 119.  In 1988, the Law Reform Commission published a report entitled Reported Debt Collection: (1) The Law Relating to Sheriffs.  Chapter 8 of the report considered issues relating to sheriffs&rsquo; powers to seize leasehold land.  It argued that the advantage to creditors of infrequent use of this power was more than outweighed by the unnecessary inconvenience to purchasers of leasehold who must search in the sheriff&rsquo;s office for lodgements of an execution order.  While the commission concluded that there was much to be said for abolishing the power or leaving judgment creditors with a more appropriate remedy of a judgment mortgage, it deferred making a definitive decision until it had considered the reform of the law relating to judgment mortgages.</P>
        <P>In March 2004, a consultation paper on judgment mortgages was published.  It recommended that the seizure of leasehold land by sheriffs as a means of enforcing debts be abolished.  In October 2004, the Law Reform Commission published the consultation paper on reform and modernisation of land law and conveyancing law, which completed the first stage of the joint project between my Department and the commission to develop the legislation we are discussing today.  It also recommended the abolition of sheriffs&rsquo; powers to seize leasehold land and the implementation of reforms in respect of judgment mortgages.  During the extensive consultation process which followed the October 2004 consultation paper, no submissions were received in respect of this recommendation with the result that the proposal to abolish leasehold seizure power was included in the draft land and conveyancing Bill set out in the Law Reform Commission report which was published in July 2005.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This Bill is based on the draft Bill contained in the 2005 report.  As regards the substance of <Col N="217"/>objections to the abolition of the power of seizure, it appears that the threat of seizure may be a useful instrument for enforcing debts against land only in certain circumstances.  However, as already stated in the Law Reform Commission&rsquo;s 1988 report, any seizure would encounter the difficulties to which I referred in that report.  These difficulties include the fact that seizure does not vest legal ownership in the sheriff and the fact that in the case of unregistered land, the sheriff has no means of ascertaining the title.  Indeed, it has been stated that a sale under a <i>fieri facias </i>order is notice to buyers that the sheriff has no knowledge of the title and buyers and that buyers would consequently buy at their own peril, which would make it a virtually unmarketable title.  The sheriff is not entitled to vacant possession of the property and any purchaser would have to seek ejectment of the tenant.  Moreover, any attempt to gain possession by any other means would constitute forcible entry.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In short, the law relating to seizures of leasehold is unsatisfactory and ineffective.  The alternative method of enforcing debts is by means of a judgment mortgage.  I accept that the existing law and procedures whereby the Revenue Commissioners or any other plaintiff could seek a judgment mortgage on a debtor&rsquo;s land is cumbersome and fraught with difficulties.  This is the reason Part 10 simplifies and clarifies the law relating to judgment mortgages.  For these reasons, I suggest that Senator Cummins gives further consideration to the reforms set out in Part 10 of the Bill as a more effective method than retaining the power of seizure under the <i>fieri facias</i> order.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I thank the Minister for his reply.  Does the correspondence received by Senator Cummins from the Dublin City Sheriff on behalf of all the sheriffs in the country suggest that they would be happy with what the Minister has outlined here today?  Senator Cummins received a very lengthy piece of correspondence which was probably received by the Minister or his officials.  In it, they outlined the many reasons they wished to see section 119 of the Bill deleted. Can I take it what the Minister has outlined is in line with what the sheriffs are seeking?</P>

However, section 2 of the Statute of Frauds also deals with other matters such as contracts relating to guarantees, contracts upon a consideration of marriage and agreements not to be performed within a year.  As these matters are outside the scope of the Bill, it is necessary to restrict the scope of the repeal to this particular issue, which is contracts for the sale or disposition of estates or interests in land.</P>

Amendment No. 52 provides for the repeal of section 72(1)(<i>j</i>) of the Registration of Title Act 1964 and the effect of that repeal, which is a necessary consequence of the over-reaching provisions in section 21, is that the rights of persons in actual occupation of registered land or in receipt of the rents or profits thereof will have to be registered in the Land Registry for them to affect the land itself.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Five minutes should be long enough for the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, to catch his breath.  I thank him for coming to the House to reply to this matter.  I urge the Minister for Finance to consider providing incentives for private sector workers to leave their pension funds intact by forgoing the 25% tax-free lump <Col N="228"/>sum, thus ensuring a higher income stream in retirement.</P>
        <P>I am pleased that at last we are hearing more from the Government on the provision of adequate pensions.  At the weekend, one newspaper had a headline to the effect that the Taoiseach had promised a budget boost for pensioners.  That is welcome.  Today at a Labour Relations Commission conference in Croke Park he described the practice of some companies of reducing pension benefits as a tension point for workers.  He stated he did not believe the pension issue was affecting the viability of companies, especially in profitable sectors.  However, he did acknowledge that some firms in the manufacturing sector could be under pressure.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>I welcome the fact that at last I seem to be getting somewhere on this issue.  Perhaps the Government has begun to realise the pensions issue relates to pensioners today and those about to become pensioners.  We should not be as concerned as we have been, and as the Pensions Board is, with pensions of people in 25 or 50 years.  We should be concerned about those in difficulty today.</P>
        <P>It is illogical to compel people to pay into a pension fund throughout their working lives and then penalise them for leaving it intact.  The Government encourages people to withdraw 25% of their pensions in a tax-free lump sum.  We want to ensure pensioners will have an adequate income.  I cannot understand why we encourage people to draw down 25% of their funds which are tax free.</P>
        <P>I want people to enjoy tax free benefits as much as possible.  Why not give the same tax benefit to leave the fund intact?  Removing the lump sum reduces the pension fund by 33%.  If we want people to live comfortably during retirement, we should encourage them to leave pension funds intact.</P>
        <P>Well-documented figures show the majority of pensioners today survive on the State pension.  The private sector pension makes up an extremely small portion of retirement pensions.  Will the Minister consider using the budget to give the same tax incentive now given to people withdrawing the 25% lump sum to those who opt to leave it <i>in situ</i>?  It would do pensioners and the State a service by providing an adequate income.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The pensions industry is behind this drive as it suits it to give out a tax-free lump sum.  It makes a killing on the exchange rate it uses when exchanging the tax-free lump sum for pensions.  According to statements made by the IAPF chairman and the Pensions Ombudsman, the pensions industry makes a profit of up to 233% on people opting for a tax-free lump sum.  This enormous profit is taken by the industry when the uninformed pensioner is consigned to a grossly reduced pension.  That same pension decreases in value as the person gets older.  Many difficulties must be addressed.  If the Minister of State takes <Col N="229"/>this on board it would help increase the income stream of pensioners.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank the Senator for raising the issue.  The statutory maximum benefits which an individual is entitled to draw down from his or her pension scheme at normal retirement age is limited to two-thirds of his or her final remuneration on retirement.  Senators will be aware the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, introduced a limit of &euro;5 million this year on the maximum value of pension benefits an individual can draw down in his or her lifetime from tax-relieved pension schemes where the benefits come into payment for the first time on or after 7 December 2005.  This is known as the standard fund threshold and will be indexed from next year onwards.  Where the capital value of the benefits exceed this amount, a significant up-front tax charge arises on the excess.  I emphasise this limit is targeted at high earners and will not impact on the generality of those retiring.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In general, pension scheme rules provide for part of a member&rsquo;s accrued pension to be exchanged or commuted in return for a tax-free lump sum.  The maximum tax-free lump sum which may be achieved at normal retirement age by a scheme member is generally one and a half times final remuneration.  In certain cases where the member can avail of the approved retirement fund option, such as proprietary directors, the lump sum taken can be 25% of the value of the pension fund.  Senators will be also aware the Minister for Finance introduced a cap of &euro;1.25 million on the overall tax free lump sum which can be taken from 7 December 2005 onwards.  This was also aimed at high earners.  From 2007, the lump sum limit will be 25% of the standard fund threshold.</P>
        <P Just="Left">While private sector occupational pension schemes generally provide members with the tax-free lump sum option, it is a matter for the pension scheme member, or the holder of a personal pension plan such as a personal retirement savings account, PRSA, or a retirement annuity contract, to decide to exercise the right to a tax-free lump sum.  Instead, he or she may choose to take all of his or her entitlement as a pension or annuity which would be liable to tax at the pensioner&rsquo;s marginal income tax rate.  The option to invest in an approved retirement fund or approved minimum retirement fund, as appropriate, may be also available to the holder of a PRSA or retirement annuity contract.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I understand the tax-free lump sum option has been always viewed as a major attraction in incentivising private pension provision.  However, the suggestion appears to be that we should pay people in some way not to draw it down.  The Government wants to encourage people who have not yet made arrangements for pension provision or who wish to improve their existing <Col N="230"/>arrangements to do so, particularly older people in the workforce and those on lower incomes.  The Minister for Finance introduced measures in this year&rsquo;s budget and Finance Act to help people in these categories commence or improve their pension arrangements.</P>
        <P>The pensions incentive tax credits scheme introduced in the 2006 Finance Act provides an incentive for eligible SSIA holders on lower incomes to reinvest all or part of their net SSIA proceeds after maturity into an approved pension product, including a personal retirement savings account.  It is primarily a savings scheme and is designed for lower income people saving for retirement.  The incentive involves a tax credit of &euro;1 for every &euro;3 of SSIA proceeds reinvested, up to a maximum of &euro;2,500 credit for an investment of &euro;7,500.  An additional tax credit involves a percentage of the tax deducted from the SSIA on maturity.  Where an SSIA holder avails of the pensions incentive tax credits scheme, it is not possible to claim any other tax relief for amounts invested up to and including &euro;7,500.  Tax relief can be claimed, however, on amounts in excess of &euro;7,500 transferred from a matured SSIA to an approved pension product, subject to the standard limits.</P>
        <P>Aside from the pensions incentive tax credits scheme, generous incentives already exist for taxpayers investing in pensions.  The State encourages individuals to supplement the State pension with private pension arrangements by offering generous tax reliefs on contributions to pension schemes, subject to limits related to age.  The tax relief arrangements for private pension provision are long-standing.  They have helped a significant proportion of the workforce provide for supplementary pensions, thus reducing the pressure on the Exchequer to fund pension needs.  In this year&rsquo;s budget and Finance Bill, the Minister for Finance increased the age-based tax relief for contributions to all pension products for those aged 55 years or over.</P>
        <P>More than half of people in employment are covered by pension arrangements beyond the State pension and, while this proportion has not changed much, the absolute numbers covered have increased in recent years.  However, the Government is not complacent about the significant issues facing us in the pensions area.  This year, the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Brennan, published two major reports from the Pensions Board which focused and encouraged debate on these issues.  The issues include the adequacy of post-retirement income particularly for those on lower rates of pay, the extent of the coverage of supplementary provision across the working population and the cost, economic impact and sustainability arising from any changes which may be considered.</P>
        <P>The Government is committed to the publication of a Green Paper on pensions policy.  The Green Paper, into which the Department of Fin<Col N="231"/>ance, among others, will have an input, will outline the major policy choices and challenges facing us in the pensions area.  The Government is also committed to responding to consultations arising from the Green Paper with a framework for addressing the pensions agenda over the long term.</P>

	<P>Will the Minister of State tell the person who wrote this reply on his behalf that the last paragraph on the first page is the only one which refers to my question? It states, &ldquo;the suggestion now appears to be that we should pay people, in some way, not to draw it down.&rdquo;  The <Col N="232"/>way that paragraph is worded is extremely disingenuous.  I am asking that the same tax incentive be given to people who leave the lump sum in place as to those who draw it down.  If we give a tax incentive to a person who draws it down, why not give it to a person who decides to leave it in place?  I would like that message to go back to the Minister.</P>
        <P>The way the reply is worded is disingenuous.  However, with regard to pensions, that type of response from the Department of Finance is common.</P>
        <P>I thank the Minister of State for his reply.</P>
