	<P>I have notice from Senator Ulick Burke that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister Health and Children and the Health Service Executive to provide adequate funding to the Brothers of Charity in Ballinasloe for the delivery of a properly resourced service to persons with a disability, both adults and children, who are experiencing severe curtailment of these services at present.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Kitt of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to clarify if he has received the preliminary report, the water pricing policy report and information required on the Glenamaddy sewerage scheme, County Galway, and when approval will be given to start work on the scheme.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Morrissey of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to clarify whether the secondary school for Donabate, County Dublin, will be included in the next list of capital projects in order that the school will be in place for September 2008 to meet the growing number of students in this area of north Dublin.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Bannon of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to indicate the current status of the application by Melview national school, Longford, County Longford, for the provision of three additional classrooms, a resource room for the resource teacher for Traveller, RTT, an office and a storeroom, which are urgently required to facilitate increased enrolment in <Col N="1350"/>the school which serves this rapidly expanding area.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator McHugh of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to assist the board of management at Ray national school, County Donegal, in light of recent flood damage and to help safeguard the school against the same happening again in future.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected the matters raised by Senators Ulick Burke, Kitt and Morrissey and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senators Bannon and McHugh may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The Order of Business is No. 1, Road Traffic and Transport Bill 2006 &mdash; Order for Second Stage and Second Stage, to be taken on the conclusion of the Order of Business.  As all Stages of the Bill are to be taken this afternoon, it is proposed that Second Stage will conclude no later than 5.10 p.m., with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed ten minutes and those of other Senators not to exceed six minutes.  Senators may share time and the Minister will be called upon to reply no later than five minutes before the conclusion of Second Stage, and Committee and Remaining Stages will be taken at 5.10 p.m. and conclude no later than 5.30 p.m.; No. 2, statements on the 2005 annual report of the National Development Finance Agency will be taken at 5.30 p.m. and conclude no later than 7 p.m., with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed ten minutes and those of other Senators not to exceed six minutes.  The Minister will be called upon to reply no later than five minutes before the conclusion of the statements.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>When the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act was debated in this House, the issue of Garda reservists was prominent.  Members from all sides argued for moderation, calm and dialogue between representatives of the garda&iacute; through the Garda Representative Association, the Minister and the Commissioner.  This issue has been simmering for some time.  I fundamentally agree with the GRA position, supported by the new Garda inspectorate, that more time should be set aside for training reservists.  However, all the good points the GRA has made are set at zero by the remarks made by one of its representatives last week to the effect that the new reservists would be despised and hated in Garda stations.  That is unacceptable and we have a responsibility to say so.  We also have a responsibility to remind all members of the force of their obligation to enforce the law fully.  It is also important that if civic-minded people give up spare time at the <Col N="1351"/>weekends or during the week to act as reservists on a part-voluntary basis we should support them and do everything in our power to make the force a success.  The comments made by the representative to whom I referred are out of touch with the majority of members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and we have a responsibility to say so in this House.</P>
        <P>Will the Leader report on the progress, or lack of it, made on No. 28 on the Order Paper?  It is a Private Members&rsquo; motion in the name of Senator Norris relating to the Civil Partnership Bill 2004.  I ask because of a case taken to the High Court by two constituents of mine, Dr. Ann Louise Gilligan and Dr. Katherine Zappone.  This House has a proud record of pioneering reforming legislation.  Senators Terry and Norris, and others on all sides of the House, have said civil partnership needs to be a priority issue.  When will the Government introduce legislation in this area to give basic rights to people in same sex relationships?  If it does not do so, politicians will continue to incur the criticism of the Supreme Court, where it will ultimately arise, for not having the courage to address such issues.  This House is the place to do so.  Senator Norris has come forward with an initiative which I welcomed at the time.  We now need to move it on.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">On a day when all political attention is focused on the set piece grandstanding we expect in the other House later this afternoon, it behoves us to look again at No. 14 on the Order Paper, the Privacy Bill 2006 &mdash; Order for Second Stage.  We have learned many things in the past week or so, during which time whatever doubts we may have had about this legislation have been exacerbated and reinforced.  Will the Leader tell us if the Government intends to withdraw the Bill or to push ahead with it?  Events of the past week, which could not have happened had this legislation been in place, would have deprived politics and the people of important information.  We need to look again at what the Bill will introduce.  It is due to proceed to Second Stage but it would be better if it were withdrawn and the Government brought forward a new Bill at another time.  Does the Leader have a view on that?  We have all emphasised the need for a responsible press but we do not want to muzzle it and I fear we are moving in the wrong direction.  Has the Government changed its view since the Bill was published?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I wish to raise the increase in gas prices, which came into effect at the weekend.  They will rise by 34%, despite a drop in gas prices on the international market.  The Labour Party will support the calls of the National Consumer Agency for Bord G&aacute;is to submit to the energy regulator new proposals for gas prices.  This follows other increases with which ordinary people have had to deal in recent years, for example, electricity prices, waste charges, household bills <Col N="1352"/>and so on.  It puts pressure on people who do not have somebody to organise a whip-round when they are in financial trouble.  Members on both sides of this House deal with people who are in dire poverty and must fight for every penny they get.  This is an added burden on them and the increases in gas and electricity allowances announced recently by the Taoiseach do not go far enough to help those who qualify for those allowances, not to speak of those who do not.  I would like that issue to be debated in the House.</P>
        <P>I would like a debate on housing as well.  Today a young woman called me.  She was in tears because she has been on the housing list for eight years and is living in intolerable conditions such as one would expect to see in a Third World country, not in Ireland.  It is necessary to address the housing issue which I have raised numerous times here.  A few years ago we asked a cross-party committee to examine the issue and property prices as well.  The committee made several recommendations which have not been implemented.  House prices continue to rise unabated although houses are supposedly being delivered to meet the demand.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>Would the Leader consider holding an emergency debate on the discontinuation of Smart Telecom&rsquo;s business with the loss of 400 jobs and the disconnection of 40,000 householders and consumers?  They can receive calls but, as of last night, cannot make calls.  I support the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Noel Dempsey, who called on Eircom to extend the time within which the service would be available to consumers and to protect their rights and interests in this regard because it will take them some time to shop around and connect to another server.  Eircom took a very rigid decision last night which has caused grave concern to 40,000 consumers, many of whom run small businesses and need the telephone for their livelihood.  I reiterate the Minister&rsquo;s call to Eircom to continue the service until the liquidation of Smart Telecom can be resolved in the courts and to protect the jobs of its 400 employees.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I support everything Senator Leyden has said.  This is a classic example of the consequences of privatisation with the recent arrival of Babcock &amp; Brown from Australia.  They know that Smart Telecom is in trouble and are attempting to destroy it with a highly irresponsible action.  The regulator is trying to increase competition in the market.  Eircom should not forget that the taxpayer initially paid for the infrastructure for the service it provides.  The company has been reluctant to co-operate in unbundling the local loop to allow services in.  This is an example of a company which attempted to enter the market and might potentially be destroyed by this move.  I deplore Eircom&rsquo;s <Col N="1353"/>action.  It is doing nothing to help liberalise the market.  If anything, it will set it back.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Ms White</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I call for a debate on ageing and ageism.  Age Action Ireland has designated this week, from 29 September to 7 October, positive ageing week.  Yesterday, Senator Terry and I attended a conference organised by Age Action Ireland in Croke Park.  Immediate action is necessary to change the way older people are treated in our society.  On 1 October, the British Government unveiled new employment equality legislation which makes it illegal to force employees to retire before the age of 65 years.  It also gives employees who wish to work longer the right to meet management to discuss this possibility.  The British Department of Trade and Industry believes this legislation is necessary as a result of EU directives which also apply to Ireland.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Ms White</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Go raibh maith agat, a Chathaoirligh.  I would like a debate on this matter to be arranged as a matter of urgency.  The Minister of State with responsibility for the elderly, Deputy Se&aacute;n Power, should come to the House to address the issues of ageing and ageism in society.  We are behind the times. We need to move on and to end discrimination against older people.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>It is ironic that the House&rsquo;s consideration of the Road Traffic and Transport Bill 2006 coincides, as I understand it, with a meeting of the Joint Committee on Transport.  It is a pity that Members are disadvantaged by not being able to be part of the deliberations of that committee.  Meetings of that committee are often scheduled to coincide with the Order of Business in this House.  There should be a rebellion &mdash; Senators should make it clear that they will not attend unless this matter is examined and rectified.</P><Col N="1354"/>
        <P>I am grateful to Senator Brian Hayes for speaking about the status of No. 28, the Civil Partnership Bill 2004.  I had intended to raise the matter but it is much better that it has been raised by the leader of the principal Opposition group in the House.  People on the other side of the House agree that this matter, which has been long-fingered, needs to be addressed.  I hope the Leader of the House will be able to make time available for a full debate on the issue.  As a result of the various technicalities which arose when we had a row about the Bill, just five minutes are remaining in the Second Stage debate on it.  Perhaps some machinery will be made available to the House to allow for a full debate, particularly in light of the ongoing High Court case and the fact that I have amended the Bill to take account of the various points which have been made.  More than five minutes would be needed to address the matter adequately.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I would like Senators to be able to debate the situation in the Middle East.  After the business of the House ended for the summer, an appalling situation developed in Lebanon.  There was a massive abuse of human rights.  The international community held back from demanding an end to the assault on Lebanon.  In that context, we should review the policy of allowing CIA flights to pass through Shannon Airport, given that Mr. Bush has admitted that torture has been widely used &mdash; the CIA has been widely involved &mdash; and acknowledged the existence of secret detention and torture camps.  If the President of the United States can acknowledge that, I fail to understand why my colleagues on the Government backbenches who have a close identification with Shannon Airport are unable to face up to it.  I would also like to highlight the report from the intelligence chiefs, which indicates that torture has increased since the Americans attacked Iraq, that there has been an increase in terrorism globally and that the Anglo-American attitude and policy has actually strengthened al-Qaeda.  In a week when the US Congress, to its eternal shame, has passed a Bill that purports to legitimise torture, it is important for those of us in the West who are proud to belong to so-called old Europe to put on the record our values, as distinct from those values which are tragically becoming American under a Presidency which has sadly managed to make America the most hated nation on the globe.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I join Senators Finucane and Leyden in calling for an urgent debate in the House to discuss the problems with Smart Telecom.  Given the House is considering an emergency transport Bill today, surely it would be possible to prepare emergency legislation in respect of Smart Telecom.  It is important for consumers and customers to be protected.  It is outrageous that more than 40,000 people have been affected by the current difficulties.  I should mention, to meet conflict of interest requirements, that I am <Col N="1355"/>a customer of Smart Telecom.  It was unfair of Eircom to take the approach it took last night.  While I recognise Smart Telecom owes Eircom some money, there are easier ways to deal with the matter.  There must be an arbitration process where the regulator can take control of moneys owed to Smart Telecom, thereby protecting Eircom.  This should be thrashed out in legislation.  It is unacceptable that Smart Telecom simply issued a statement on last night&rsquo;s news to inform customers that their telephones were being disconnected.  As Senator Leyden pointed out, many small businesses and households can now only use the emergency numbers.</P>
        <P>On the comments by Senator Norris on the misuse of Shannon Airport for prisoners&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Marty&rsquo;s report was accepted in full.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept that but in supporting Senator Norris&rsquo;s call for a debate, I must point out that Shannon Airport was found not to be involved in torture or that any torture had taken place there.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>It was clearly involved in rendition flights.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>No prisoners have been taken through the airport.  The Government stated it would not allow that to happen.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I cannot allow this to develop.  We cannot have a debate on the matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>It was substantiated by the Marty report which was confirmed by the Secretary General of the Council of Europe.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>We cannot have a debate on the Order of Business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>No prisoners were taken through the airport.  It would not be allowed by the Government.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Dooley must not have been through the departures lounge recently.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>It would have been completely forgotten if it had not been for the report by Senator Marty.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I call on Senator Ulick Burke.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>During the past two weeks, I have been contacted by three people whose operations at University College Hospital, Galway were cancelled on more than one occasion.  Last year 3,334 people had their operations cancelled.  This year, it seems that number will be matched.  It is one of the worst rates of cancellations, <Col N="1356"/>second only to that at St. James&rsquo;s Hospital in Dublin.  We are informed it is due to a shortage of beds, yet more than 40 beds lie idle in the hospital.  Up to 60 beds lay idle this time last year.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Health and Children and the Health Service Executive do not want to make these beds available as they are being preserved for the elimination of problems in the hospital&rsquo;s accident and emergency department.  It is unfair that people must suffer and be denied operations to give a good look to accident and emergency statistics.  The Minister for Health and Children must debate the crisis in the health service.  It is unfair that beds lie idle and people are denied operations for which they have waited up to six months in some cases.  The Minister must be called to account and inform the House if she is in control of the service.  Will she provide the funding for the nursing staff for these beds?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMauriceHayes"><NameTxt>Dr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I hope not to infringe on Senator White&rsquo;s copyright if I too refer to the question of ageing.  The Leader is no doubt aware that employment law has been changed in the North and in Britain since Monday last and it is now an offence to discriminate on grounds of age.  Does the relevant Minister have any plans to introduce similar legislation or co-operate with a Private Members&rsquo; Bill on this matter?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I am interested in the comments of Senator White and Senator Maurice Hayes.  On the BBC website, a report stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">The UK&rsquo;s anti-ageism legislation takes effect on Sunday, 1 October, and employers will be wondering precisely what it means for them.  But they only have to look across the Irish Sea for some guidance.  In 1999 the Republic of Ireland introduced laws which outlawed age discrimination in employment.</P>
        <P FLI="0">We should take advantage when the BBC quotes Ireland as the example to follow in legislation.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>We had a good debate last week on the annual report of the Office of Tobacco Control.  I read today, however, that the proposed ban on the sale of packets of ten cigarettes will not go ahead as planned.  This is a measure that has been mooted for many months, if not years, and the necessary legislation was passed some time ago.  It seems, however, that the tobacco industry has said it cannot implement this measure because too many packets of ten have been already manufactured &mdash; &ldquo;logistics&rdquo; was the word it used.</P>
        <P>This is wrong.  We are engaged in a battle against cancer and part of this is discouraging young people from smoking.  It is they who smoke packets of ten.  There is a hard core of smokers but it comprises only 24% of the population.  The main concern is that young people and women are smoking more.  Part of the battle to prevent young people from starting to smoke involves a ban on packets of ten.  Although this measure was <Col N="1357"/>due to be introduced yesterday, the tobacco industry was not ready and it could not be implemented.  Will the Leader seek to discover whether the implementation of legislation can be hindered by means of the producer in question claiming it is not ready for it?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I entirely agree with Senator Quinn that legislation passed by the Oireachtas should be implemented and not obstructed by servants of the State who are specially charged with implementation of the law.  I look forward to lengthy, detailed and reasoned debate on the Privacy Bill.  I am sure this Bill, like many others of its kind, will be capable of being much improved in its passage through the Oireachtas.</P>
        <P>With regard to the events of last week, I take the robust view that no public interest was damaged by the non-revelation of the story for nine years, nor would it be damaged by observing the rules of the tribunal now.</P>
        <P>I welcome next week&rsquo;s meeting of Archbishop Brady and Dr. Ian Paisley, not only for its contribution to assisting the important negotiations currently under way but also for the example we hope it will set in helping to quench some of the demons of sectarianism.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Leader invite the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to this House to debate rural planning?  In Sligo three years ago, the Taoiseach promised radical changes in this area.  He has lost credibility on this issue because nothing has happened to date.  We heard the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Parlon, huffing and puffing about this issue at the national ploughing championships last week.  One would not believe this Government has been in power for nine years.  As the general election approaches, it is trying to make an issue out of something it did not deal with while in Government.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>If Senator Bannon&rsquo;s party is depending on the Green Party to enter Government, it may have to change its views on rural planning.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government has neglected the people of rural Ireland.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>Young people in several areas have been denied planning permission to build homes on their parents&rsquo; farms.  This is an issue that has arisen time and again and it must be dealt with.  The planning regulations are far too restrictive and we were promised some changes in this regard.  The Government made sure to put out the right message on this issue in the run-up to the last local elections but it has taken no action to date.  It is important that we have a com<Col N="1358"/>prehensive debate.  The matter will be dealt with by the incoming Fine Gael-Labour Government if the present Government will not do so.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>What about the Green Party?  It will be helpful in this regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrankFeighan"><NameTxt>Mr. Feighan</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like the Leader to invite the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to address this House and debate the increasing incidence of drug trafficking.  Recently a private jet was used to transport heroin into a private aerodrome in Dublin.  As well as this, the talented and brave young people of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na went to Scotland Yard for undercover training and, in one of the most successful raids in the history of the State, took nearly 30 middle-ranking drug traffickers out of existence.  However, the garda&iacute; involved must now go to court to testify and their cover will be blown.</P>
        <P>What kind of message will this send to drug lords in our country?  Will it be that we are prepared to fight them with our hands tied behind our backs?  The men and women of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na must be protected, put back on the streets and given the resources to remove drugs from those streets.</P>
        <P>Three years ago regional drugs task forces were initiated.  I was concerned that they would amount to mere talking shops and, unfortunately, this has proven to be the case.  Too much middle management is involved whereas resources should be given to the Garda.  In my county of Roscommon, where the Western Region Drugs Task Force is in operation, I have not seen a single piece of evidence that anything has been achieved in the three years since it was established.  Will the Minister of State<b> </b>at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Noel Ahern, come to this House and discuss the issue?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>Yesterday the United States banned Internet gambling involving the use of credit cards.  Will the relevant Minister come into this House to explain whether he or she intends changing such laws in this jurisdiction to amend the outdated Gaming and Lotteries Act 1956?  Card clubs offering private membership are opening throughout the country and they are really glorified casinos.  There are no regulations covering this industry so perhaps the Minister would come into the House to inform us if and when he intends to regulate this industry because it is long overdue.  It has been regulated in the US and it will be required here.  People have lost houses, farms and more by using credit cards for betting purposes.  We must debate the matter in this House.</P>

	<P>Senator Brian Hayes, Leader of the Opposition, raised the matter of the Garda reserve and the issue of time allocated for the training of reservists, which was also raised over <Col N="1359"/>the weekend by Ms Kathleen O&rsquo;Toole, the head of the Garda inspectorate.  The Garda Representative Association used terminology such as &ldquo;despise&rdquo; and &ldquo;hate&rdquo; which is like an incitement to hatred.  I was distressed by this and felt the association was out of touch with the feelings of the people on the matter.  I thought the Garda reservists looked a fine bunch as they entered Templemore.  We should be willing to give them time to return to their areas and begin their duties.  A young woman was interviewed who wanted to give something back to her community.</P>
        <P>Senator Brian Hayes asked if there had been progress on No. 28 on the Order Paper, Second Stage of the Civil Partnership Bill 2004.  Senator Norris also raised this issue following the debate last year.  I intend to speak to the T&aacute;naiste about this matter to find out at what stage of progress it is.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole referred to the Privacy Bill 2006.  I only know that it is scheduled to come before this House, although I have read that discussions are ongoing and there will not be progress on it this term.  I must find out where this Bill stands.</P>
        <P>Senator Tuffy referred to rising gas prices and the appeals of the National Consumer Agency to Bord G&aacute;is to stop the rise proceeding.  The drop in oil prices has come after the rise, so to speak.  The Green Paper on energy, released at the weekend, deserves a good airing and the rise in prices should be debated in this context.</P>
        <P>Senator Tuffy also referred to the housing issue and I fully agree with her in that regard.  Housing has become a significant live topic.  There are not enough affordable houses, nor are there enough of what we used to call ordinary council houses.  Housing is becoming a significant issue among constituents and they raise it with Members.  We could well have a debate on housing.</P>
        <P>Senator Leyden called for a debate on the discontinuation of Smart Telecom&rsquo;s business.  Even if Eircom still comprised a State monopoly, it could not bail out people who did not pay their bills.  That is the way it has come about.  Of course I am sorry for the 40,000 subscribers but I cannot understand how the company found itself in hock to such an amount.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Finucane agrees with Senator Leyden on the question of Eircom, but he should note that even if Eircom were a State monopoly, it could not afford to have huge sums of money owed to it and then do a bailing-out job.  I hope Eircom will be able to come to some agreement with Smart Telecom on staged payments of the money owed by the latter.  This would seem to be the best approach.</P>
        <P>Senator White called for a debate on ageing and asked that we copy the British legislation.  I will allude to this when dealing with Senator Quinn&rsquo;s comments.</P>
        <P>Senator Norris referred to the Civil Partnership Bill 2004 and called for a debate on the Middle <Col N="1360"/>East, the CIA and the flights from Shannon.  He referred to the admission by President Bush that the level of torture has increased.  It appears the US Administration is to reinterpret the Geneva Convention and it is amazing that it would put its own interpretation on it.</P>
        <P>Senator Dooley raised the issue of Smart Telecom and countered Senator Norris&rsquo;s views on the misuse of Shannon Airport.  He does not like the misuse of the term &ldquo;Shannon Airport&rdquo; and therefore raised the issue.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Ulick Burke referred to the cancellation of operations in University Hospital Galway.  We are endeavouring to have a debate on health and I hope we will be able to have it next week.  The Senator more or less said these beds are used as the saviour when the accident and emergency crisis arises and he called for nursing and back-up staff to allow them to be put back into use.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Maurice Hayes referred to ageing.  Senator Quinn referred to legislation enacted in this country in 1999 which outlawed any discrimination on the basis of age.  This is not interpreted very positively and Senator White is right in this regard.  Many cases arise as a result.  It is a nebulous legal area and if one goes for an interview, it is very difficult to say one was not taken on because of a certain remark, implication or thinking about one&rsquo;s age.</P>

        <P>Senator Quinn also stated the proposed ban on the sale of packets of ten cigarettes will not go ahead.  This is a shame because purchasing these packets is the preserve of young people, including young women.  The reason given for not going ahead with the ban is that the tobacco industry has stated many such packets have been already manufactured and has asked what would happen to them.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Mansergh referred to the Privacy Bill.  He does not understand what public interest was served by the production of the material last week.</P>
        <P>It is good that Archbishop Brady and Ian Paisley are to meet.  Did we ever believe this would come about?  It not only came about but it was trumpeted that it would happen.  We all expect <Col N="1361"/>the heavens to open and celestial angels to appear but I believe it is a very good omen for the upcoming talks.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Bannon referred to rural planning.  There were changes in the guidelines but I must say I agree with the Senator that it is becoming increasingly difficult for young people to obtain planning permission for one-off houses.  It would be much more difficult if the Senator&rsquo;s party were linked to the Greens.</P>

        <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank all the Members present for their interest in the Bill and the Leader of the House for agreeing to deal with it so quickly and at such short notice.</P>
<?oasys _dc14- ?>
        <P>The Bill itself is short, as it comprises only two sections, the first relating to road traffic law underpinning and promoting road safety in the area of drink driving, and the second to road transport matters.  The Bill is, in essence, mainly technical, although it proposes two important policy initiatives that improve and strengthen provisions relating to drink driving.  I shall address the road safety provisions in the first instance.</P>
<?oasys _dc0- ?>
        <P>Senators have shown particular interest in road safety issues generally, expressing a concern that I share about the high level of deaths and injuries on our roads.  Many issues raised by Deputies during debates and discussions are now reflected in legislation enacted by this House.</P>
        <P>The ongoing progression of road traffic legislation reflects a response to the changing envir<Col N="1363"/>onment in which we use our roads and an increase in the number of vehicles on them.  The scope and level of investment in our road network in the past ten years, allied to programmes for the improvement in the design, construction and performance of vehicles, has given rise to an ongoing need for an appropriate legislative response.  However, the most significant driver of the process of legislative modernisation has been the need to augment and enhance existing road safety provisions.</P>
        <P>The promotion of legislation to support road safety initiatives represents an important response by Government and the Oireachtas to the need for the ongoing advancement of improved safety performance.  This, allied to consistent and effective enforcement of the traffic laws promulgated in such legislation, the promotion of road user education and awareness, and programmes to promote the formation of drivers, provide the bedrock for the application of the measures that stem from legislative initiatives and ensure their effectiveness and relevance.</P>
        <P>In Ireland, as in many other states, the force that binds the various road safety measures and programmes into a cohesive policy framework can be found in the road safety strategies.  First adopted eight years ago, the strategies have provided the basis for the development of a range of legislative and other responses promoted over that period.  Through the adoption of road safety strategies, we have seen the identification of a series of significant and, in many instances, linked measures that have to date, and will continue in the future, to advance the safety message for all road users.  One of the great advantages of adopting strategies is that they place our plans in the public domain, thus allowing for informed debate that in turn provides a benchmark of public, media and political opinion for the delivery of the measures identified.</P>
        <P>The key determinant of road safety performance is the behaviour of road users.  Positively influencing such behaviour lies at the centre of our road safety programmes and forms the primary focus of our road safety strategies.  Behaviour is influenced by initiatives across a number of areas.  One of these is the promulgation and enforcement of laws that promote road user behaviour.  Such laws must also be underpinned and supported by the application of fines, prison sentences and driving disqualifications that collectively create an appropriate deterrent to those who endanger the lives of others by their failure to acknowledge and comply with the appropriate behavioural norms.</P>
        <P>The Road Traffic Act 2006 considerably strengthened the law in these areas.  In the area of legislation as promoted in the current strategy, we have already seen the implementation of the new system of speed limits based on metric values, the extensive roll-out of the penalty points system and the allied system of fixed charges, <Col N="1364"/>which is being outsourced to relieve the Garda of administrative functions.  We have seen the introduction of roadside mandatory alcohol testing, MAT, the establishment of both the Garda national traffic corps and the Road Safety Authority, and both of those organisations will, I am sure, have a profoundly positive effect on road safety in the future.</P>
        <P>The debate on road safety has for some time now become the centre of political media and public attention.  There is understandable and significant disquiet at the level of death and injury inflicted by road collisions.  The number of people being killed and injured on our roads is still unacceptably high.  I do not hide my concern about the trends in road deaths that have become established over the past two years &mdash; 396 people lost their lives on Irish roads in 2005 and 279 this year up to the end of September.</P>
        <P>However, there is a glimmer of hope for the future.  A small change has occurred and potentially a very significant one.  Since the introduction of roadside mandatory alcohol testing in July, which has a legislative basis in the Road Traffic Act 2006, drivers are beginning to take heed and, more importantly, they are beginning to change their behaviour and attitudes towards drinking and driving.  The number of road deaths in August 2006 was 17 &mdash; the lowest number for any month since November 1999.  This compares with 24 road deaths in August 2005 and 35 in August 2004.  This trend is also reflected in the number of deaths during September 2006 which was 22, compared with 31 in 2005 and 34 in 2004.  The downward trend follows the introduction of roadside mandatory alcohol testing by the Garda.  In parallel, the number of road collisions has fallen.  The increased levels of enforcement are having a significant deterrent effect on those who would otherwise drink and drive.  While it is important not to base trends on two months&rsquo; statistics, the reduction during August and September is a positive development and I hope with the levels of enforcement, the downward trend will continue.</P>
        <P>In general terms, the immediate focus of the Bill before the House today on the road traffic side is to support the introduction of legislation that will further strengthen drink driving provisions and improve the enforcement of drink driving legislation generally.  These provisions relate to a proposal to take away the necessity in a Garda station for a garda to form an opinion, in advance of administering an evidential test, that a person has consumed an intoxicant, and a proposal to provide that nurses can take blood or urine samples at a Garda station.  At present, the Road Traffic Act provides that only a designated doctor can take a blood or urine sample in a Garda station.  Unfortunately, a typographical error also occurred in the Road Traffic Act 2006 which could have a limited impact on the operation of mandatory alcohol testing.  This is being corrected.  The error may have come to Members&rsquo; <Col N="1365"/>notice through coverage in the national newspapers last week.  This error relates to only a small number of cases where a person refuses to give a roadside breath sample and where he or she is arrested for the purpose of providing an evidential test.  Overall, the mandatory alcohol testing system has operated effectively since the end of July and the numbers who refuse to provide samples are very low, according to the Garda.</P>
        <P>I will now refer in some detail to the main road safety provisions proposed in the Bill.  Section 13 of the Road Traffic Act 1994 provides that a person arrested under various provisions relating to drink driving, as well as the commission of other serious offences, can be required to provide a breath, blood or urine sample in a Garda station for evidential purposes.  However, the section refers to the formation of an opinion by a member of the Garda that an intoxicant has been consumed in advance of administering an evidential test.  My Department has looked at decisions in the courts and found that the presentation of the wording of the section gives rise to the potential for misinterpretation.  In recognising that this is a pivotal provision in the overall code applying to drink driving, I am taking the first available opportunity to both clarify and strengthen the provision.</P>
        <P>It is proposed, therefore, to re-state section 13 (1) to remove the requirement for a member of the Garda to form an opinion in the Garda station that an intoxicant has been consumed, where a driver is arrested under any of the drink driving provisions, including those relating to a refusal to provide a roadside sample, and in the case of the other serious road traffic offences which are not related to drink driving.  This amendment is sensible since the initial roadside encounter between a garda and a driver involves either the commission of a serious road traffic offence, the formation of an opinion that an intoxicant has been consumed, or in the case of a mandatory alcohol testing checkpoint, a refusal by a driver to provide a sample where there was no requirement to form an opinion.  With the assistance of the Attorney General, I propose to streamline the provision so that the necessity to form an opinion again, in the Garda station, no longer applies.</P>
        <P>The Road Traffic Act currently provides that only a designated doctor can take a blood or urine sample in a Garda station.  For some time, the timely availability of a doctor has given rise to problems in this area.  Given the increase in detections resulting from the introduction of mandatory alcohol testing, it is likely this problem will become more significant.  It is therefore proposed to extend the pool of resources available to the Garda to take blood and urine samples.  The proposed improvement to this provision will ensure that, once practical arrangements are in place for the identification of nurses in the vicinity of Garda stations, greater numbers <Col N="1366"/>of medical staff are available for taking samples.  There are several consequential amendments included in the Bill resulting from this provision.</P>
        <P>A typographical error, which could have a limited impact on the operation of mandatory alcohol testing, is also being corrected. Section 4 of the Road Traffic Act 2006 provides for the introduction of mandatory alcohol testing checkpoints.  It is an offence under section 4(6) to refuse to give a roadside breath sample, the penalty for which is a fine of up to &euro;5,000 on conviction and-or imprisonment for up to six months.  A person who refuses to give a roadside breath sample can be arrested under section 4(7). Section 13 of the Road Traffic Act 1994 provides that a person arrested under various provisions relating to drink driving, as well as  the commission of other serious offences, can be required to provide a breath, blood or urine sample in a Garda station for evidential purposes.  Section 4 of the Road Traffic Act 2006 amends section 13 of the Road Traffic Act 1994 to provide that a person, who is arrested for refusing to provide a roadside breath sample under the mandatory alcohol testing system, can be required to provide an evidential test in a Garda station.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The amended section 13 refers to a person arrested under section 4(6) of the 2006 Act.  This should read section 4(7).  This typographical error relates to only a small number of cases where a person refuses to give a roadside breath sample and where he or she is arrested for the purpose of providing an evidential test.  The mandatory alcohol testing system has been operating effectively since the end of July and the numbers who refuse to provide samples are very low.  It would be ultimately a matter for the courts, in any relevant case brought before them, to determine whether the typographical error did or did not negate the clear intention of the Oireachtas in enacting the relevant provisions of the 2006 Act. <b> </b>However, to remove any such uncertainty, and in light of legal advice received from the Attorney General on this matter, it is proposed to amend the section.  There is a small number of consequential technical amendments being made, which arise as a result of the changes.</P>
        <P>The road transport provisions of the Bill, dealt with in section 2, address a problem which was discovered by my officials in recent days.  It emerged that section 3 of the Road Transport Act 1986, which contains the power for the Minister for Transport to grant road haulage licences, had been inadvertently repealed by the Road Transport Act 1999 (Repeals) (Commencement) Order 2005 made on 28 October 2005.  The repeal was made as part of a wider exercise of modernising the licensing regime as provided for under the Road Transport Act 1999.  The issuing of any further licences was immediately suspended pending further investigation of the legal position.  Following this internal investigation, clarification of the legal position was sought from the Office of the Attorney General.  That office con<Col N="1367"/>firmed that a power for the Minister to grant such road haulage operator licences must be contained in primary legislation.  The necessary powers to do so do not exist under the European Communities Act 1972, even though the framework for access to the profession of road haulage operator is contained in EU law.  This means that an Act of the Oireachtas is required to restore the power of the Minister to grant a licence.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister&rsquo;s powers regarding the granting of licences to passenger operators were also reviewed by the Office of the Attorney General, as both passenger and haulage operators share a common regulatory framework under EU law.  Currently, the power for the Minister for Transport to grant passenger transport operator licences is contained in regulation 3 of the European Communities (Road Passenger Transport) Regulations 1991 (SI 59 of 1991).  This statutory instrument was made under section 3 of the European Communities Act 1972 to give effect to European directives which laid down the criteria for access to the profession of passenger transport operator.  However, after reviewing the position, the Office of the Attorney General advised that as a specific power to grant road passenger operator licences is not contained in the relevant EU directive, I as Minister did not have a power to issue those licences under the statutory instrument made in 1991.  The Office of the Attorney General advised that such a power must be provided for in primary legislation.  Section 2 of the Bill is designed to remedy this problem.  The Bill was considered and approved by the Government on Wednesday, 27 September 2006 for publication and introduction at the earliest possible time.</P>
        <P>This brings us to today. As soon as this Bill is passed, subject naturally to the consent of both Houses, it will restore the ministerial power to grant these licences.  In summary, therefore, the licence granting power for road haulage was repealed in 2005 which leaves the Minister without any power since that time to issue such licences.  Road haulage operator licences issued before 31 October 2005 are not affected.  As regards road passenger transport, the power to grant licences by means of regulations made under the European Communities Act 1972 had been considered to be satisfactory.  It has now emerged that this is not the case.  Having regard to recent Supreme Court decisions, it is not possible to make such a provision in secondary legislation if none existed in primary legislation.  No such power was available in the directive which the order was brought in to give effect to, hence the urgent need now for primary legislation.  I should point out to the House that there are no safety implications arising from this issue.  Matters relating to the roadworthiness of vehicles, public service vehicle licensing, insurance etc., are contained in different statutory provisions and are not affected.</P><Col N="1368"/>
        <P>Section 2 provides for the Minister to have the power to grant road haulage and road passenger transport operator&rsquo;s licences and other related matters.  Subsection (1) provides for the Minister to have the power to grant national and international road haulage operator&rsquo;s licences and to grant national and international road passenger transport operator licences.  Subsection (2) provides for the conditions to be met in any application for a road haulage or road passenger transport operator&rsquo;s licence, specifically that applicants must satisfy the Minister that they are of good repute, appropriate financial standing and have professional competence.  Subsection (3) provides that operator&rsquo;s licences (which include both road haulage and road passenger transport operator&rsquo;s licences) come into effect on the date specified on the licence, and expire on the date specified on the licence.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Subsection (4) amends section 1(1) of the Road Transport Act 1999 to redefine certain terms commonly used in road transport legislation.  Subsection (5) gives effect to any operator&rsquo;s licence (which includes both road haulage and road passenger transport operator&rsquo;s licences) granted, or deemed to have been granted, under the Road Transport Acts or under any statutory instrument made under the European Communities Act 1972.  Subsection (6) provides that the Minister may make regulations regarding applications for operator&rsquo;s licences, which includes both road haulage and road passenger transport operator&rsquo;s licences.</P>
        <P>Subsection (7) provides for an amendment to section 13(1)(<i>b</i>) of the Road Transport Act 1999 to modernise the text.  Subsection (8) clarifies that any reference in the Road Transport Act 1986 or in the Road Transport Act 1999, or in any other Act or regulations made under the European Communities Act 1972, to a road freight carrier&rsquo;s licence is now to be read as a reference to a road haulage operator&rsquo;s licence.  Subsection (9) provides for the definitions of some of the terms commonly used throughout this section.  Subsection (10) provides that this section and the Road Transport Act 1933 are to be read as one.  Section 3 contains standard provisions regarding the Short Title of the Act.</P>
        <P>In line with the advice of the Office of the Attorney General, my Department is urgently reviewing all relevant statutory instruments made under the Road Transport Acts to ensure that they are statutorily compliant as regards licensing.  My officials will then begin a thorough root and branch review of all legislation governing the road haulage and road passenger operator sectors in order to consolidate them into a single Bill.  I know Senators have previously raised an issue in different debates.  I am conscious of the fact that the Road Traffic Acts have also become a complex body of legislation and this must be addressed.  A programme of restatement of legislation is being commenced under the Government initiative to improve the quality and accessi<Col N="1369"/>bility of legislation.  In response to the consultation exercise carried out during the summer, my Department put forward the Road Traffic Acts as a body of legislation suitable for restatement and I understand this is currently under consideration.  The restatement of these Acts will greatly facilitate their subsequent consolidation.</P>
        <P>I thank the House for allowing this urgent debate on these important provisions.  I look forward to a positive and supportive debate on the Bill and I commend it to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. P. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I did not think we would be welcoming him back so quickly with this legislation.  </P>
        <P>It is disappointing that we are faced with having to rectify this important legislation, the Road Traffic Act 2006, so soon after its introduction.  The ink has barely dried on the Bill and we are now faced with having to correct an error.  I accept that mistakes can be made and at least this mistake has been recognised relatively quickly, which is something to be grateful for.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The drafting error in this Act means, as I understand it, any persons that have refused to give a breath sample at a checkpoint and from whom a breath, blood or urine sample is later taken at a Garda station, are unlikely to be successfully prosecuted for drink driving.  This is extremely worrying for all legislators who desperately want to see an improvement in road safety standards throughout the country.  We waited for almost ten years for the introduction of random breath testing and to have the system called into question so soon into its operation is a matter of huge concern.  There have been 282 deaths on our roads in the year to date and hundreds of horrific injuries and casualties.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s record on road safety is appalling.  At a time when most European countries are significantly improving their road safety measures and succeeding in reducing the level of death and fatalities on their roads, Ireland&rsquo;s level of road deaths is worsening.  In 2005, 399 people were killed on our roads; in 2002 this figure was 23 less at 376.  With 282 people dead on our roads already, this year&rsquo;s figure is not likely to show any decrease; at the moment it is similar to last year&rsquo;s unacceptably high figure.</P>
        <P>The picture of road safety in Ireland is an extremely poor one.  This month an EU survey placed Ireland&rsquo;s level of enforcement of road safety measures quite low down the scale of European states.  We sit in the bottom half of the table and this has been a consistent feature during the lifetime of the Government.  EU surveys have persistently highlighted our problem in dealing with drink-driving and speeding.  We desperately need to tackle these two key issues and I am worried that the most recent glitch in road safety legislation specifically threatens to undermine random breath testing and, more generally, all road safety measures.</P><Col N="1370"/>
        <P>While personal responsibility in terms of safer driving is crucial, the level of road deaths and general poor driving standards cannot be solely attributed to driver behaviour.  Two central reasons lie with the Government&rsquo;s paralysed approach to this issue and also the appalling condition of our roads.  Indeed, a survey published last week by the Insurance Industry Federation found that 90% of motorists felt that the Government needed to do more to reduce road deaths.</P>
        <P>The Government is not unaware of the fact that we have a bad road safety record.  It has had more than nine years in office when it could have taken decisive actions to reduce deaths and fatalities.  Instead, this jaded Government has produced two glossy road safety strategies and failed to implement the key recommendations contained within them.</P>
        <P>The Minister owes this House and the wider public a full explanation as to the reason it has taken so long for key lifesaving measures such as the roll-out of speed cameras, random breath testing, stiffer drink driving penalties and the ban on mobile phones to finally make their way into legislation.  The Government has been in office for almost ten years and in that time these measures could easily have been debated and enacted by the Oireachtas.  Instead, we got stalemate, inaction, U-turns and procrastination from a paralysed Government.  The result was that while the public waited for action from this Government, hundreds of people have died in the interim on our roads and thousands more have been injured.</P>
        <P>Not once but twice the Government has failed to reach the targets it set in its own road safety strategy.  First from 1998 to 2004 and now in its second strategy, which will end this year, the Government has failed to reach the target of reducing road deaths by 25%.  We are nowhere near tackling our appalling road safety record.  In France, the Government succeeded in reducing road deaths by one third in three years.  In Ireland, we have had ten years during which the situation was allowed to get increasingly worse before any decisive action was taken.  The difference between France and Ireland was that the political will existed in France to tackle the issue head on.  In Ireland, the unacceptably high level of road deaths has been pushed under the carpet by the Government.  The Government cannot be proud of its record of inaction and paralysis on this crucial issue.  Neither does its response offer any comfort to the families, friends and communities of those who have been killed or seriously injured on our roads.</P>
        <P>The problem with the flaw in the current legislation is not so much the specifics of the error itself but rather its wider damaging impact in terms of the public&rsquo;s perception of road safety laws.  There is a common perception among the motoring public that if they break road safety laws by speeding or drink driving, there is a good chance they will get off if the matter proceeds to <Col N="1371"/>the courts.  The public&rsquo;s perception of being able to get away with it is not that far off the mark, given that the road safety legislation is often aggressively challenged before the courts.  Even the case of a motorist having his conviction quashed creates a negative picture.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Regarding the drafting mistake we are dealing with today, I am not sure how many motorists could have had their convictions thrown out as a result of that.  The Minister might inform us of the number in question.  The only response is for garda&iacute; to increase their level of enforcement to get out the message that drink driving will not be tolerated and that offenders will be caught if they take the risk.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I was delighted to hear the Minister say earlier that the higher levels of enforcement in July and August have resulted in a decrease in the number of deaths in those months over previous months.  I welcome that because everybody has said it is all about enforcement.  The greater the level of enforcement, the greater reduction we would see in fatalities and serious accidents.  In that regard I welcome the figures the Minister gave the House earlier.</P>
        <P>I recognise that when random breath testing was initially introduced it had a positive impact in reducing road deaths and discouraging motorists from drinking and driving.  I urge the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Minister and the Road Safety Authority to ensure that the level of enforcement is sustained throughout the year and not just at certain times such as bank holiday weekends and at Christmas.</P>
        <P>Members of the Joint Committee on Transport travelled to Australia where the police are very much in people&rsquo;s faces, so to speak, in this regard.  They advertise the locations where they do random breath testing.  That is to highlight their presence to the public and ensure that the public can see they are taking action.  They want to make the public aware of the consequences if they are caught drink driving.  That is the way we should proceed here.  The garda&iacute; should be in people&rsquo;s faces and promoting road safety all year round, not just at Christmas or bank holiday weekends.</P>
        <P>l would also encourage the respective Ministers to prioritise the introduction of the remaining measures contained in the road safety strategy, particularly the roll-out of speed cameras nationwide and the implementation of the remaining penalty point offences.  We have waited long enough for these initiatives and it now appears unlikely that either will happen before the next election.  Of critical importance also is the need to reform the driving test and to reduce the waiting times of those waiting to sit a full driving test.  Until we do both, we will continue to have a poor standard of driving on our roads.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister has introduced private outsourcing but this will only bring about 40,000 extra driving tests.  That is insufficient to deal with the scale of the problem.  Can the Minister give us a <Col N="1372"/>set deadline as to when he expects the backlog will be reduced to a maximum of four weeks' waiting time?</P>
        <P>The Ministers and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform have much work to do if they are serious about addressing the huge problem which exists in road safety legislation enforcement and compliance.  They need to remain focused and not lose interest once the gloss has faded from the latest initiative, as happened so often in the past.  Reducing road deaths and casualties requires a sustained commitment over the long term and it cannot be achieved with quick fixes.  Our current road safety strategy will come to an end in December.  I urge the Minister to put the structures, manpower and resources in place to ensure that we are capable of meeting the targets we have failed to meet in the past.</P>
        <P>The Cathaoirleach ruled out my amendment No. 3, which concerned the consolidation of all the Acts in regard to this area.  If we had consolidation of the Acts regarding transport, this error would have been spotted and we would not be dealing with this legislation today.  As the amendment has been disallowed, I urge the Minister that a consolidation of the Acts should be considered and perhaps introduced in the not too distant future.  I support the legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House and the provision he brings before us today.  It is worth noting that the legislation that has been in place for a number of months has been very effective in dealing with the scourge of road deaths we discussed on many occasions in the House last year.  It was one of the most hotly debated issues not just in this House but in the media and among the general public.  So many people had lost their lives it was incumbent on the Government and all of us as legislators to try to do something about it.</P>
        <P>In my view and in the view of most of the people I meet on an ongoing basis, the legislation that has been brought in has provided a tremendous benefit to the country, not just in terms of the people who are alive today and whose families are not affected by the scourge of death on our roads but also to those who would have been affected through injury in accidents.  It is worth noting that when one considers the number of people killed on our roads, it is only a small percentage of the number of those who are injured through serious accidents in a way that affects them and their families for the rest of their lives and also affects the state of our health service in providing services to deal with that.  There has been a much greater benefit than the ten or 20 lives saved as a result of this legislation in terms of the number of people saved from serious injury.  In that regard it is a little disingenuous of Senator Paddy Burke, for whom I have great respect and who generally makes some very good contributions, to make the type of statement he made today on the ineffectiveness <Col N="1373"/>of the Government in dealing with road deaths and road safety.  That is a charge that might have been made earlier last year to some extent, not taking into account the work the Government had done in developing two road strategies.</P>
        <P>Senator Burke made reference to the fact that we had only produced two road strategies but that is two more than the Opposition produced when they were in Government.  He talked about the ban on the use of mobile phones.  I understand such a ban is in place and perhaps the Minister will confirm this.</P>
        <P>Senator Paddy Burke referred to random breath testing.  While mandatory breath testing might be a different name, it is effectively the same thing.  The Government and the officers of State, particularly the Garda, should be commended on their success in the past two and a half months.  The figures clearly speak for themselves and we have turned a corner.  While this may have taken longer than anyone, the Minister included, would have wished, it has been successful and must be built on.</P>
        <P>It is unfair to try to be negative about the legislation because of a minor technical difficulty or error found therein.  This reflects as much on Members for not spotting it during the legislation&rsquo;s passage as does the suggestion that someone within the Department failed to identify it or that the Minister or the Government is at fault.  All Members had access to the legislation and their role in parsing that legislation should be to identify such errors.  I am thankful the Minister has identified the issue so early.  Legislation has been brought before the House and will become law quickly to ensure no one will avoid the penalties or the rigours of the law in this regard, which would have a damaging overall effect on the legislation&rsquo;s credibility.  Given the background work undertaken by the Minister, this will not take place.</P>
        <P>Enforcement is working and it is clear people now take a realistic approach, in terms of their behaviour and attitude, to driving after consuming alcohol.  I always believed that mandatory breath testing would not be required to induce people to change their behaviour and attitude, had the requisite level of enforcement been present.  Consequently, I am uncertain whether the present level of enforcement was brought about as a result of redeployment within the Garda or the provision of additional resources.  Nevertheless, regardless of one&rsquo;s point of view, this is welcome.</P>
        <P>I wish to raise an enforcement issue that is worth noting within the context of this debate although it does not fall within the Minister&rsquo;s remit.  I refer to mandatory breath testing early in the morning.  While this issue is difficult, it should be addressed, or at least discussed.  In some cases, it has probably created a negative effect on the overall aspect of what is otherwise good legislation.  This matter pertains to the operation of enforcement and probably falls within the remit <Col N="1374"/>of the Garda Commissioner.  People who have consumed a certain amount of alcohol late at night or during the previous evening are now concerned while driving to work at 8 a.m.  While such concern may be unnecessary, it has had an effect on people&rsquo;s approach to what is otherwise good legislation and may be causing some negative sentiment towards it.</P>
        <P>This matter must be resolved through enforcement rather than through legislation.  It should have been addressed by the issue raised in respect of the Bill&rsquo;s constitutionality, when there was much talk regarding a proportional response to its implementation in respect of times, locations etc. and as to the location of such mandatory alcohol testing points.  I understood the enforcement response was obliged to be proportional to the risk, which is greatly diminished from 6 a.m., 7 a.m. or 8 a.m.  The Minister may wish to discuss his views in this respect with Members or his other colleagues.  The great majority of accidents involving the over-consumption of alcohol usually take place before 5 a.m.  While I recognise this matter cannot be prescribed in legislation in a manner that would set down definitive guidelines, it can be addressed through guidelines in respect of enforcement.  Although such guidelines will probably never be published, this should be taken into account by the enforcement authorities.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister spoke about the approach taken by the Government to road safety.  Everything he has done since taking up office in this Department has increased the capacity to deliver a safer environment for road users, including his road improvement policies.  I welcome the Department of Transport&rsquo;s recent announcement that the Ennis bypass will be opened in or around next December.  The opening and continued development of such dual carriageways will bring about a safer environment for all who go about their daily lives.  In addition to complimenting the Minister in this regard, I encourage him to push ahead with the Gort to Crusheen and Gort to Galway sections of the western road corridor.  The removal of such bottlenecks, as well as inferior sections of roads that carry heavy traffic, from the daily commute of many people will definitely reduce death, injury and accidents.</P>
        <P>As for changing behaviour and attitudes, it is critical that, as part of its overall curriculum, the Department of Education and Science should become involved in developing an approach or at least some capacity to teach young people safer methods of driving.  It should introduce them at an early stage to the kind of approach that is necessary to ensure children grow up with respect for the road, rather than a belief they have a right to its use.  Respect for the road is far more important than a belief that one has a right to be a road user.  The only way in which one will change a culture over a generation is to start at the beginning and hopefully this can be done as a matter of urgency.</P><Col N="1375"/>
        <P>In the course of several debates, Members have recognised that the majority of deaths on the road occur among those who are under 30.  In many cases this befalls young people with cars that have greater power than they are capable of handling, in addition to the alcohol issue.  However, there is a great lack of understanding as to their responsibilities regarding the use of the road.  It is the old story of trying to put an old head on young shoulders, which has never worked.  Hence, it is important to educate our youngsters before they get an opportunity to go behind the wheel in the first place.  Perhaps the school curriculum is the best place to so do.  I ask the Minister to inform Members of any discussions he may have had with the Department of Education and Science in this respect.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Road safety is under discussion and the national car test, NCT, on which a consultation report was prepared regarding a potential review, is part of this issue.  The Minister may wish to comment on its present status and whether any changes are imminent in this regard.  From time to time, one hears about some of the more pernickety elements of the NCT that should be addressed.  I am familiar with a number of incidents in which people have been failed on the basis of emissions one day and, without making any adjustments to their vehicles, have returned a number of weeks later and have passed the emissions test with flying colours.  While I do not know whether this constitutes a quirk in the system, it is an unnecessary source of annoyance to road users and vehicle operators.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House and I welcome this Bill.  While I would not normally welcome the passage of legislation in a single day, this is an exception.  The reason for this Bill is evident, namely, something that was missed the last time.   Hence, this serves as a reminder to Members.</P>
        <P>The entire question of deaths on our roads is a scandal that should never have been permitted throughout the years.  The slaughter and carnage which took place is a scandal and the Minister is now doing something about it.  While I understand Senator Paddy Burke&rsquo;s comments, I will not scold, because this was not done heretofore.  It is being done now.  I urge the Minister to take hold of all of these matters and to implement them as rapidly as possible.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>I wish to take one particular case, namely, what used to be referred to as random testing and what are now known as mandatory alcohol checkpoints, a phrase that does not roll off the tongue as easily.  After the first weekend it was introduced, <i>The Irish Times</i> sent a reporter out with garda&iacute; to cover three mandatory tests.  It reported one woman who said she had only had one glass of wine &mdash; maybe it was a very big glass &mdash; and who ended up in the back seat of the car in tears, unable to <Col N="1376"/>believe she had failed the test.  A large number of people talk to me about that story.  The garda&iacute; had parked on one occasion in Ranelagh, on another outside a hotel in Leeson Street and in one other location.  Suddenly people were alerted to the fact that they did not need to show signs of alcohol consumption to be tested.  A very large number of people appear to have begun to change their behaviour and that is exactly what we need.</P>
        <P>Technology is a good investment that delivers value for money.  We know the technology exists and how it can work.  Register identification cameras should be installed everywhere to ensure people are aware of what can happen.  With these cameras in place it is not necessary to catch somebody because they record a car passing at one point in the road and its arrival at another point, maybe 5 km or 10 km further on.  If they arrive before they should were they to obey the speed limit, it is automatically recorded.  A relative living in France informs me that an important element of the regime there is the certainty that a driver will receive penalty points or a summons as soon as he or she sees the camera flash.</P>
        <P>I emphasise the importance of speed.  I do not know how the technology works in Ireland but I believe it relies on manpower.  It takes weeks to receive penalty points or a summons.  If this could happen within hours or days, it would result in a change in the behaviour of those who speed or drink and drive.</P>
        <P>I congratulate the Minister on the appointment of Gay Byrne, who was an inspired choice.  It was a brave choice because Gay Byrne will resign if he is not happy with what the Minister does.  He took the job not because he wanted it but because he thought he could do some good, and the Minister knows his head is on the chopping block if Gay Byrne registers his disappointment with him and resigns.</P>
        <P>The Minister is making progress.  I urge him to recognise that investment in anything that reduces road deaths is good value for money.  In France, where President Chirac made reducing the number of road deaths a priority, the figures have been reduced dramatically.  I urge this Government to continue to devote effort and enthusiasm to what it has already begun because, if it does, we can hugely reduce the figures we saw in August.  I agree with the Minister that it is dangerous to read too much into those figures because when penalty points were introduced, the initial success did not last for long.  With investment in commitment and money, the Minister will achieve his objectives.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the legislation.  This Government has made a real effort to improve road safety.  Sustained results are needed, not short-term results.  I wish to dissipate the assumption underlying all contributions to this debate that the Government is solely responsible for road safety.  Each and every one of us, when on <Col N="1377"/>the road, is responsible for the safety of ourselves and everybody we pass.  Government can influence the framework but we should not lose sight of the fact that people have personal responsibility for safety.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I have some criticism of the way the courts sometimes address these issues.  On the one hand, for ten or 15 years we have witnessed judges who delight in throwing out vast numbers of cases on the basis of technicalities.  I gather they are reviewing such a practice over the water and may even have done something about it.  They are trying to prevent legislation being thrown out on the basis of a technicality by allowing attention to be drawn to the need to address the technicality.  If that can be done swiftly, the legislation can be prevented from failing.  On the other hand, I recently heard of a judge acting in a despotic manner towards a person who had committed a road traffic offence and had paid the fine.  Nonetheless the person received a summons and the judge refused to hear a plea, only asking whether the defendant had committed the offence.  The defendant ended up paying twice over and the costs of appeal were prohibitive.  That sort of behaviour should not be encouraged either.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There is space for more effective television advertising.  The recent television licence fee campaign concentrated on the shame of a court appearance, but drink driving or causing serious accidents by dangerous driving is infinitely more shameful than not paying for a television licence.  Public relations campaigns should also be launched to inform people of their options.  In particular, they should be aimed at pubs in remote areas urging people to get a lift, share a taxi or have a mineral drink.  Victims of road accidents are often pedestrians or cyclists, the latter of which do not seem to be subject to the rules of the road and are a danger to themselves.  Pedestrians should be educated as to how they can protect themselves.</P>
        <P>There ought to be a test for drugs because drug related driving is also a problem.  Often both drink and drugs are involved and scientists and researchers must focus on devising something to test specifically for drugs.</P>
        <P>Yesterday I was glad to see the opening of the Fermoy bypass and huge improvements are being made to our roads, which make a huge difference to safety.  There is further space for a review of speed limits because the right speed limits enable people to reach their destination as quickly as is safely possible and reduce accidents.  There has been a general acceptance of the 80 km/h speed limit for country roads and it has been successful.  However, I do not see an objective reason for the limit on cross-country dual carriageways, which are almost as good as motorways, of 100 km/h while in the North it is 110 km/h.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I hope the time will come when we have the confidence they have on the Continent and maybe we should experiment by allowing a limit of 130 km/h on a suitable road.  While such a <Col N="1378"/>suggestion may be counterintuitive, if people can travel quickly between two points on dual carriageways, they will be less reluctant to observe the speed limit on the part of their journey that includes a country road.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We should relate this debate to the broader issue of excessive drinking, including binge drinking.  More stringent application of the drink driving regulations may indirectly help to address that problem.  I do not deny there might be some scope for<b> </b>fine-tuning.  In my experience, the national car test, NCT, is good and efficient.  If all Government services worked as well as it does, we would be very well off.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I support those who argue for consolidation of the Road Traffic Acts.  I tried this morning to understand the amendment we are making today to correct the alleged defect in the Bill we passed earlier this year.  It is mind-boggling.  We are inserting a section 1 to amend section 13 of the 1994 Act which was in turn inserted by the earlier Act of this year and must be read in conjunction with the 1961 Act.  I learnt that off by heart.  This is mad.  It is impossible for lay people to understand this and even practitioners have difficulty understanding it.  Everybody accepts the legislation is crying out for consolidation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In doing this mental exercise I tried to pay attention to the offence of refusing to give a sample, how it could be prosecuted and the resulting penalty. As I did not have the benefit of advice from the Labour Party&rsquo;s legal adviser who loves this kind of problem, I am not sure I have reached the correct conclusion.  There appears, however, to be an anomaly in the Bill because in the Act we passed earlier this year, we provided in conjunction with mandatory alcohol testing for the offence of refusing to give a sample.  We also provided for penalties of &euro;5,000 or six months in prison.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Section 13 of the 1994 Act provides for the offence of refusing to provide a sample in the Garda station but the penalties are significantly less, at approximately &euro;1,000 and-or six months in prison.  I assume if a person were arrested under section 49, he or she would be open to the offence under the 1961 Act of failing to provide, which also allows for a disqualification.  I am not clear whether we can therefore infer that  a person who is arrested under section 7 of the Act we passed earlier this year can be convicted of failing to provide a roadside sample and then be disqualified.  I confess my reading of the Bill is rudimentary as I spent just half an hour on it this morning.  It is not clear to me whether, under the mandatory alcohol testing regime, if one fails to provide a sample, one can be convicted and disqualified.  I would appreciate clarification on that point.</P>
        <P>Speakers today have rightly commented on the reduction in the number of road traffic deaths in the past couple of months.  I am sure this is a result of the publicity that surrounded the pass<Col N="1379"/>age of the Act earlier this year.  That is good and right.  I do not support the mandatory alcohol testing regime, given the gradual amendment or erosion of the need for the Garda to form an opinion, as was the case in the previous 20 or 30 years.  I felt that was sufficient, provided it was enforced.  The real risk in the mandatory alcohol testing regime is that it could criminalise many people who do not present a serious danger to themselves or others, for example, a person who has had two and half pints and drives on an empty road.  With reasonable discretion on the part of the Garda in implementing the Act, that will not happen.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is important people understand that if they have taken a serious amount of drink, they will be caught.  The passage of the Act earlier this year created that impression and it is important that it be sustained.  This will happen only provided the Act is rigorously implemented but with a certain measured discretion which maintains the credibility of the Act. As I am sure the Minister knows what I am talking about, I will not spell it out.</P>
        <P>The provision that allows nurses to take blood samples is a sensible move.  In hospitals or in doctors&rsquo; surgeries, where there is a practice nurse, they take most samples.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sure they are in many cases and more experienced than them.  It is only right and sensible to extend the provision in this way.  I am not sure how it will work but I assume stations will have a rota of nurses to perform this duty.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Nobody has mentioned the provisions for road haulage and the road passenger operators.  Is there a lacuna?  Have these drivers been operating illegally or improperly since October 2005 as a result of the Minister granting any licences <i>ultra vires</i> in that time?  If so, has anybody been exposed to the possibility of prosecution or has anybody been prosecuted for operating without a licence during that time, when in fact he or she could not have properly held a licence, or held one that was improperly granted?</P>
        <P>I understand from what the Minister said that he is satisfied the regulations implementing or transposing the European regulations about road passenger operators were effected <i>ultra vires</i> or were not properly brought into statute law.  Will the Minister spell out the consequences of that?  He is correcting it as of today, or whenever this legislation is passed, but are there any negative consequences in the fact that we have not properly transposed the regulations on road passenger operators over the past several years?</P>
      </Speaker>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DiarmuidWilson"><NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister and his officials to the House .  Like my colleagues, I welcome this legislation.  It would have been better to get it right in the first place but we are all human and mistakes are made.  There is no doubt mandatory breath testing has saved lives this year.  A total of 17 unfortunate people lost their lives in August 2006 but that compares with 24 in 2005 and 34 in 2004.</P>
        <P>Like Senator Dooley, however, I have reservations about the mandatory checkpoints early in the morning.  I am aware some of these checkpoints operate as late as 10 a.m.  That is unfair, particularly to people in rural areas who have no access to public transport.  They may have been out socialising the previous night and made every effort to get home safely in a taxi.  Often they must wait a long time for a taxi because there are so few in country areas.  It is more lucrative for taxis to operate in urban areas.  I understood the legislation was not to be used in this way.  This should be considered.  I have no difficulty with it being enforced from 6 p.m. until 6 or 7 a.m. but it certainly should not operate after that, particularly in country areas.  Most accidents occur in the early hours of the morning or late at night, not at that time of morning.  I urge the Minister to consider that, particularly for rural areas.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister stated that, &ldquo;The key determinant of road safety performance is the behaviour of road users.&rdquo;  I firmly believe in that principle.  People in the part of the country from which I <Col N="1381"/>come are persecuted by drivers from Northern Ireland who disobey the rules of the road.  People with cars which have been registered in the South make every effort to adhere to the rules of the road and the law of the land, whereas people with cars which have been registered in the North make a mockery of those rules and put people&rsquo;s lives at risk.  I ask the Minister, Deputy Cullen, to pursue the extension of the penalty points system to all Thirty-two Counties as soon as possible.  Along with his departmental officials, he is trying to make progress in that regard, but I ask him to treat it as a matter of urgency.  People in the Border region are dying as a result of the behaviour of drivers from Northern Ireland who, unfortunately, disobey the rules of the road.  It is not possible for garda&iacute; to be deployed at every boreen because there are thousands of such roads in the Border area.</P>
        <P>Northern drivers travelling in the Border region have no regard for the laws of the land.  When I was driving earlier today &mdash; I was closer to Dublin than to the Border &mdash; a Northern registered 4x4 flew past everyone.  It was travelling at more than 100 km/h in a 40 km/h zone, which is not acceptable.</P>
        <P>The Minister needs to reflect on the fact that foreign drivers are responsible for a significant percentage of road accidents in the Border area.  I am not being racist when I make that point.  The majority of such accidents take place at weekends when the individuals to whom I refer are out of their minds on alcohol.  We must examine this aspect of the problem.  Where possible, we need to educate such people about the rules of the road in this jurisdiction, although I am not sure how that can be done.</P>
        <P>I agree with my colleague who argued that the rules of the road should be taught as a mandatory part of the secondary school curriculum.  In County Cavan, such lessons form a mandatory part of the curriculum of Youthreach training programmes for early school leavers.  Such programmes also include the driver theory test.</P>
        <P>I agree with Senator Mansergh that road safety advertising campaigns on television have been very effective.  It would be beneficial to have more advertising of that nature on the radio.  A pilot scheme conducted by Today FM over a few weeks, involving a series of blunt advertisements of this nature, was very effective.  It would seem sensible to ensure that more advertisements which are short, sharp and to the point are broadcast by radio stations.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Bill and thank the Minister for introducing it.  I welcome the withdrawal of the objections which were made to the proposed M3 development.  I am pleased that people from my part of the country will be able to travel in safety to their capital city and all the facilities there in the not too distant future.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister, Deputy Cullen, to the House.  I thank him for his continu<Col N="1382"/>ing attendance at this debate.  I understand why this legislation is needed and I fully support it.  However, a general legislative principle arises from the need to introduce this Bill.  As Senator Paddy Burke and Senator McDowell have said, difficulties can arise when sections of legislation are introduced to amend previous legislation.  It can be difficult, even for people who study the process very carefully, to follow the progress of legislative provisions through the various Acts.  Errors can occur in such circumstances.  While the error in this case was a slight one, it was also quite significant and needed to be attended to.</P>
        <P>This general issue within the drafting system will need to be addressed at some point.  If one examines British legislation going back to the 1890s, one will find that it was clear and easy to understand because it was written in plain English.  I accept that legislation needs to be couched in certain terms, but this issue must be examined.</P>
        <P>The issue of enforcement has been raised by some speakers.  Over the past week, I have driven frequently on the N7 and to Galway on a couple of occasions.  I accept that things have definitely improved.  However, as I was driving towards Newlands Cross on the N7 this morning, on three occasions I saw people driving while using mobile telephones.  I thought at one stage that this phenomenon was confined to white van man, who is a particular sub-species of road user, but I was wrong.  This morning I saw the driver of an XJ series Jaguar using a mobile telephone.  When I was travelling on the Kildare bypass some days ago, I saw the driver of a van &mdash; I noted the name of an event management company on the side of it &mdash; travelling well in excess of the motorway speed limit, which is quite high, while using a mobile telephone.  Another phenomenon I have noticed is that some drivers pull over onto the hard shoulder of the motorway to use their mobile telephones.  People seem to think it is okay to pull over onto the hard shoulder and to stop the car there to take a telephone call.  Perhaps there is a gap in the law in this regard which means that people are entitled to behave in such a manner.  I do not know the answer to that.</P>
        <P>It is obvious that speed is an issue.  Things have improved, as I have said, because the Garda traffic corps is more in evidence than it used to be.  It is quite active in ensuring that drivers slow down.  If one sees a Garda car on the N7, it has a fairly salutary effect on one, even if the car is not pulled over and the garda&iacute; are not taking numbers.  If one is travelling home late in the evening, one can sometimes set the cruise control in one&rsquo;s car to the speed limit.  The number of cars which pass one by in such circumstances is amazing.  I suppose all of us, including myself, have been guilty in the past of exceeding the speed limit from time to time.</P>
        <P>I have a certain sympathy with Senator Dooley&rsquo;s comments about people who are caught drink driving the morning after they have been <Col N="1383"/>consuming alcohol.  If one&rsquo;s blood alcohol level is above the legal limit, however, one is not fit to drive.  That applies as much at 8 a.m. as it would have applied the previous night.  I do not know how we can deal with that.  It is reasonable to state that if one is not fit to drive at 10 p.m., one is not fit to drive at 8 a.m.  One must accept that.  If that means one must get a taxi to work as opposed to getting a taxi to a function, that is what one must do.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DiarmuidWilson"><NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
	<P>One cannot get a taxi in such circumstances.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not think that problem is as bad in rural areas as it used to be.  I have been told that people who have holiday homes in the west are buying bicycles so they can cycle to pubs.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>They can keep fit as well.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>They are getting away with it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DiarmuidWilson"><NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
	<P>One would get drowned.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>It is obvious there are dangers in such behaviour.  I am not sure how it can be dealt with in practice.</P>
        <P>The level of adherence to the rules of the road is an important issue.  In my home town of Newbridge, for example, cyclists and pedestrians seem to ignore red lights.  This problem can be solved if we ensure that children are taught the rules of the road, possibly in civics lessons.  When many children leave their school for the day, they go straight through the lights irrespective of whether they are red, green or amber.</P>
        <P>I am concerned about inconsistencies in the setting of speed limits.  I am aware of a dual carriageway that used to be deemed to be a national road, but it has been redesignated as a regional road following the opening of a bypass.  The road was perfectly capable of carrying traffic at the old 60 mph speed limit, which is equivalent to the new 100 km/h limit, but it is no longer seen as suitable because it is now a regional road.  That does not seem to make sense.  If the standard of the road was good enough before the new road was opened, it is still good enough now.  It is a bit like the principle I outlined when I was talking about blood alcohol levels the morning after alcohol is consumed.</P>
        <P>I have raised previously the issue of signage.  The Minister is familiar with the junction on the M7 where one can take the M9 towards Waterford.  If one is on the road to Cork or Limerick, having passed the exit for Waterford, one will see signs for certain towns which are on the Waterford road.  That is a recipe for drivers to decide to stop and reverse towards the junction.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I have seen it happen.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1384"/>
      <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>That is something that should not happen, obviously.  An increasing number of road signs seem to be getting clipped by lorries, vans and trailers.  I do not know why that is happening.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I welcome the provisions of this Bill which relate to the national and international licensing of commercial vehicles.  It is right that the Minister for Transport has availed of this opportunity to include such sensible provisions in legislation.  I compliment the Minister on his work which has meant that things are progressing in the right direction.  He knows that things are certainly not perfect, but they are better than they were.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senators who contributed to this debate for the important and helpful points they made.  As I said earlier this year during the debate on the Road Traffic Act 2006, when many issues were teased out, I will introduce a road safety Bill later this year.  Some of the issues which have been raised today will be dealt with in the forthcoming legislation.  The Bill before the House today has been introduced to correct a specific problem quickly.  When the proposal relating to nurses was made, I thought it was sensible and I discussed it with the various party spokespersons.  We decided to include it in this legislation, even though it is a technical Bill, because it is worthwhile.  I welcome the support I have received in this House for that aspect of the legislation.</P>
        <P>I would like to make a point about the last review. While not making excuses, the last EU review was up to only the end of 2004.  In the past two years many policy and legislative changes have been made in keeping with the best international standards.  At the heart of this was mandatory alcohol testing.  I am not complacent about the matter, but we are moving in a better direction.  It comes down to strong laws, their enforcement and a collective view of personal responsibility on the road.  People have changed their attitudes to drinking and driving but there will always be that 5% who will continue to drink and drive.</P>
        <P>The &ldquo;morning after&rdquo; issue is relevant.  As Senator Dardis correctly stated, if it is illegal to drive after drinking at 10 o&rsquo;clock at night, it is equally illegal at 8 o&rsquo;clock in the morning.  People have been killed in multiple accidents in the morning where alcohol and drugs were at play.  The Garda needs public support for its efforts.  The greatest emphasis on combatting drink-driving is between 11 o&rsquo;clock at night and 4 o&rsquo;clock in the morning, the most dangerous time on the roads.  With regard to the &ldquo;morning after&rdquo; campaign, it is aimed at people out for a late party until 5 in the morning.  The message to them is not to get into a car at 8 o&rsquo;clock and drive to work after three hours of sleep.  That is more the point than someone who is out for a normal social evening.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Mandatory alcohol testing has seen a reduction in drink driving.  One glass of wine may be accept<Col N="1385"/>able but many people have changed their habits and are not having even a glass of wine.</P>
        <P>On the issue of road haulage licences, there were several cases where even though it did not necessarily arise because of a licence, it came up as an issue.  The 2005 Act will be amended retrospectively.  When EU directives were being transposed, the section covering road haulage licences was inadvertently deleted.</P>
        <P>I thank Senators for their support with this legislation.</P>

        <P Just="Center">NEW SECTIONS.</P>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. P. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 7, before section 3, to insert the following new section:</P>
        <P LI="1" Just="Left">3.&mdash;(1) The Principal Act is amended in section 53(2)&mdash;</P>
        <P LI="2">(<i>a</i>) in paragraph (<i>a</i>) by the substitution of &ldquo;fine,&rdquo; for &ldquo;fine and&rdquo;,</P>

        <P LI="3">&ldquo;(<i>c</i>) and in any case shall be liable to a mandatory disqualification from driving for a period of not less than 6 months and not more than 3 years.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P LI="1">(2) In this section, &ldquo;Principal Act&rdquo; means the Road Traffic Act 1961.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">In a dangerous driving case, it is up to the judge to give sentence.  In such cases I am proposing a mandatory sentence of between six months and three years rather than leaving it to a judge&rsquo;s discretion.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>This issue was debated at some length before.  Tying the hands of judges in all cases is not necessarily the best.  A member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who suspects an individual for dangerous driving can arrest him or her without a warrant.  A person convicted of dangerous driving causing death or serious body harm can be sentenced to penal servitude, in other words a prison term up to ten years, or at the discretion of the court, a fine of up to &euro;15,000, or both.  In any other case, a fine up to &euro;2,500 can be imposed or, at the discretion of the court, imprisonment for up to six months, or both.  In addition a person convicted of a first offence of dangerous driving may face disqualification for driving for one year.  For a second and subsequent offence it can be two years.</P>
        <P>Where death or serious injury occurs, the individual can be disqualified from two years for a first offence and four years for a second or subsequent offence.  In the case of a first offence of dangerous driving where death or serious injury did not occur, the court has the option, where it is satisfied that a special reason which has been provided by the convicted person exists, to decline a consequential disqualification order or to specify a period of disqualification in the disqualification order of less than one year.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Road Traffic Act 2006 provides for increases to fines for road traffic offences and to periods of disqualification relating to consequential disqualification orders, including those relating to drink driving.  The Act removes from the court the option to decline to make a disqualifi<Col N="1387"/>cation order in the case of a first offence of dangerous driving.  These provisions will commence presently.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The will of the Oireachtas is clear.  Not all dangerous driving cases are related to drink.  Dangerous driving can occur in, say, a car park.  Some discretion must be in place for the courts in the particular cases that come before them.  The will of the Oireachtas is clear that in cases where drink driving is involved, the convicted person should lose their licence.  The will of the Oireachtas should be observed and listened to by the courts.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. P. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the Minister that the view of the Oireachtas should be taken on board.</P>

        <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. P. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 7, before section 3, to insert the following new section:</P>
        <P LI="1" Just="Left">3.&mdash;The Minister shall, as soon as is practicable, begin the process of producing a Road Traffic Consolidation Act that will act as a consolidated statute of all road traffic legislation.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This amendment relates to by-laws.  Some events facilities, for example Croke Park, see many largely attended fixtures.  For people living in residential areas around these facilities, they are prisoners in their houses during such events.  Croke Park is being used more often for various events.  Who can make by-laws to facilitate residents in such circumstances?  As it stands, the Minister says the local authority has the power to implement by-laws.  Local authorities, on the other hand, say it is a matter for the Minister to make regulations and to put forward by-laws by regulation.  There is much ambiguity in terms of the respective roles of the Minister&rsquo;s office and the local authorities.  This amendment would clarify the position by allowing for a clear stipulation of whether, for example, the Minister would give such power to the local authority or whether the persons concerned should apply and the Minister should make the by-laws.  The ambiguity in this matter must be removed by a provision allowing for the assignation of this power to a specific person or body.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I apologise to Senator Paddy Burke; I understood this amendment was ruled out of order.  However, I understand the issue and am happy to respond to him.  A group from Croke Park, including Councillor Fitzpatrick and various Deputies and Senators, have spoken to me about it.  In the course of this engagement, I made the point that I cannot legislate for Croke Park alone.  It is an issue that arises throughout the country in regard to various types of functions, mainly sporting events, sometimes concerts and so on.</P><Col N="1388"/>
        <P>I have given all the information to the Office of the Attorney General and am awaiting advice.  On foot of this advice, I will consult all the concerned groups.  Senator Paddy Burke is correct that it is an important issue and I am trying to find the legal basis to deal with it, after which there will be a short period of public consultation.  We may be able to enact legislation that goes even further than the Senator suggests in this amendment.  I would appreciate if he would wait until I get clarity on this issue.  I have told all the groups of my plan and they seem content to be consulted on the basis of an agreed legislative framework.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. P. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased there is to be a consultation process.  The Minister said earlier that he would bring further legislation before the House in the not too distant future.  Will he give me a guarantee that this matter will be rectified in the next legislation he brings through the Houses?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator has identified my intention that this issue should be fitted into a road traffic Bill or some other Bill after the consultation I referred to has taken place.  I am glad to tease these matters out with the local groups but I do not believe there are any contentious issues in this regard.  My intention is simply to frame this measure in such a way that we can be sure we do it right.  The challenge is to ensure we frame something that can be applied nationally rather than only to one specific area.  The same principles arise on all occasions.  It is my intention to include this provision in legislation if I can get agreement to do so.</P>

        <P>The NDFA commenced operations in 2003, with the functions of advising State authorities on the optimal means of financing the cost of public investment projects to achieve value for money and on all aspects of financing, re-financing and insurance of such projects.  In broad terms, the NDFA provides advice on the best financial package for State infrastructure projects, not just PPPs, and negotiates on behalf of State authorities on the financial terms and conditions included in financial and legal agreements.  Where it is appropriate to do so, the NDFA has the power to raise funds for projects itself.  To date, this has not arisen.</P>
        <P>The report details the activities of the agency during 2005, in its role as financial adviser to State authorities on a wide variety of large capital projects &mdash; both PPP and non-PPP.  It also outlines its activities in its new role as a centre of expertise for PPP procurement following a Government decision in mid-2005.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Before outlining the specifics of its role and achievements, it may be helpful to outline the overall capital investment context. Total investment planned under the multi-annual capital envelopes for the years 2006 to 2010 amounts to nearly &euro;43.5 billion.  While the majority of projects will continue to be procured by traditional means, PPPs will play a significant role.  Within the total capital investment envelope, &euro;5.5 billion, or 13%, is provided for PPPs to be paid for by unitary payments by the Exchequer.  There is, in addition, an allocation of more than &euro;2 billion for <Col N="1390"/>PPPs funded by user charges, which will be met largely by the roads programme.  Details on specific projects are a matter for the relevant Minister.</P>
        <P>The sponsoring agency is required to seek the advice of the NDFA on all projects above &euro;20 million and for projects with a lower capital value where State authorities require financial, risk and-or insurance advice.  Where the NDFA acts as a financial adviser, the final decision on any project is, of course, one for the relevant Minister or sanctioning authority, or for the Government, as appropriate.  The relevant State authority is not obliged to take the NDFA&rsquo;s advice.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In 2005, the NDFA completed its advice on 12 projects with a combined capital value of approximately &euro;900 million.  The cumulative value of the projects on which the NDFA had completed its advice was almost &euro;2.4 billion by the end of 2005 and the NDFA expects this to reach almost &euro;4 billion by the end of this year.  Since its establishment more than 90 projects, both PPP and non-PPP, had been referred to the NDFA for its advice.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Sectors to which the NDFA provided advice on projects included social and affordable housing, roads and rail, justice, education, tourism and sport, environment, and the digital hub. Senators will see from the report the wide range of projects on which the NDFA has given advice.  Examples highlighted in the report include the pilot housing project in Fatima Mansions in Dublin, where the NDFA advised Dublin City Council, the criminal courts project for the Courts Service and the extensions to the Luas lines, where the NDFA advised the Railway Procurement Agency, RPA.</P>
        <P>The annual report also outlines the progress made by the NDFA in assuming its new role as centre of expertise in procuring and delivering PPP projects.  The Government decided last year to establish a centre of expertise for PPP procurement in the NDFA to accelerate the procurement and delivery of PPPs for key capital infrastructure projects funded by unitary payments from the Votes of Departments or agencies.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The NDFA centre of expertise is to consolidate the core skills and capacity required to support these complex procurements in departmental areas.  As is the case with the National Roads Authority, NRA, in the area of roads and the RPA in light rail and metro, it allows for public sector continuity in managing PPP procurement.  Departments remain responsible for the selection of projects and for project budgets and for addressing relevant policy issues impacting on projects up front, but then will hand over the projects to the centre of expertise for the procurement phase.</P>
        <P Just="Left">These new arrangements will not apply to the roads and rails sectors where there are existing specialised agencies or to local government where PPP deal flow is established.  The guiding principle is that a Department or agency can refer a project to the centre of expertise for procurement <Col N="1391"/>where the Department or agency does not have the expertise to undertake the procurement delivery stage of a PPP project itself.  The decision to procure a project must of course be consistent with the rolling capital envelopes and other relevant requirements.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In tandem with this, the Government also decided to focus on a programme of PPP projects in a small number of key areas &mdash; initially in the justice, education and health areas &mdash; before considering other possibilities thereafter.  The NDFA is already carrying out these new functions on a non-statutory basis, and the annual report sets out the very significant work already undertaken in their new role.  The centre of expertise has already commenced work on more than &euro;1 billion worth of projects within the education, health and justice sectors.  The report outlines the developments up to this summer on the various projects in this sector in respect of which the NDFA will be responsible for procurement.</P>
        <P>The annual report outlines usefully the key stages of the PPP process whereby the NDFA plays a role in advising State authorities.  These include, for example, the preparation of the public sector benchmark, PSB, for PPP projects.  This is a key tool to be used in the assessment of the private sector PPP bids and in the determination of value for money.</P>
        <P>The PSB is a comprehensive estimate of the cost, including the value of risks, of procuring those elements of the project that the private sector is invited to tender for in the PPP contract, based on the whole-life cost to the sponsoring agency of procuring the project using traditional procurement arrangements.  The NDFA also facilitates risk workshops and advice on risk analysis, which are key inputs to the PSB.</P>
        <P>Given that this is a new development, it may be helpful to summarise, in broad terms, how the new arrangements for the centre of expertise will work.  There is a clear distinction between the project development phase, which is the primary responsibility of the sponsoring Department or agency, with the assistance of advisers, as necessary, and the procurement delivery phase, which is the responsibility of the centre of expertise.  It is a matter for the relevant Minister to decide what projects are to be pursued as PPPs within the designated areas.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The NDFA is responsible for the procurement to delivery stage of the projects, within the parameters set by the sponsoring Department or agency.  The centre of expertise is to undertake the procurement after all policy issues are cleared by the sponsoring Department or agency, output specifications are set and the PSB is signed off, with the assistance of NDFA financial advice, as necessary.  The NDFA is then responsible for procuring the projects within these parameters to the so-called turnkey stage.  The projects will be handed back to the sponsoring agency or Department following completion of construction and <Col N="1392"/>commissioning.  The unitary payments to the private sector partner over the term of the PPP contract, which typically covers a period of 25 to 30 years, will be made from the Vote of the Department or agency, and no unitary payments will be made by the NDFA.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There have been some more recent developments in PPPs since the 2005 annual report was published.  I am pleased to report that a number of projects have been subject to further significant progress.  In particular, the first bundle of schools in the new programme, which includes second level schools in Portlaoise, Ferbane and Banagher, has moved into its procurement phase and has now been brought to market by the NDFA.</P>
        <P>In June of this year, the Government gave the go-ahead to the drafting of legislation to place the centre of expertise on a statutory footing.  Senators will be aware that it is on the Government&rsquo;s legislative programme for this session and the Minister for Finance expects to bring it to the Government for approval to publish in the coming weeks.</P>
        <P>The legislation will formally allocate the new procurement function to the NDFA by giving it the power to enter into PPPs with a view to transferring them to the relevant State authorities, or to act as agent for State authorities in regard to PPP procurement.  It will also allow for the appointment of three additional board members, two of whom have been already appointed on an interim non-statutory basis.</P>
        <P>On the resources deployed by the NDFA, the annual accounts appended to the report set out the details of the NDFA&rsquo;s own administrative costs.  These costs amounted to just over &euro;36,000 and related only to audit fees and costs associated with the board.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Under section 11 of the National Development Finance Agency Act 2002, the functions of the NDFA are performed through the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA.  The bulk of the agency&rsquo;s running costs, including salaries, is borne by the NTMA.  The expenses incurred by the NTMA on NDFA functions in 2005 amounted to more than &euro;2.75 million in the context of the NDFA&rsquo;s new procurement role.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The accounts of the NDFA are subject to audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General, whose report thereon is also included with the annual report.  The chairperson and the chief executive officer can be called to give evidence to the Committee of Public Accounts and they regularly do so when the relevant reports of the Comptroller and Auditor General on the NTMA family, so to speak, are being considered.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As with a number of other functions and roles assigned to or performed through the NTMA, the NDFA is staffed by people who are employees of the NTMA.  The annual report notes that the NTMA has 11 professional personnel dedicated exclusively to the work of the NDFA.  In addition to the full-time employees allocated to the <Col N="1393"/>NDFA, other NTMA staff and facilities are used, as required, including information technology, security and legal and financial control, bearing in mind that the agency has specialists in various aspects of the financial markets.</P>
        <P>The annual report notes that the recruitment of further professional personnel with financial expertise is ongoing.  The agency anticipates a rise in the staff level to at least 20, dedicated solely to the NDFA&rsquo;s work.  The NDFA is governed by a board which, under section 12 of the National Development Finance Agency Act 2002, is required to ensure that the functions of the agency are being performed effectively; set the strategic objectives and targets to be met by the agency; and ensure that these objectives and targets are met.  The chief executive officer of the NTMA is chairperson of the board of the NDFA.</P>
        <P>The board is being expanded by an additional three members in recognition of the additional responsibilities which the NDFA has as centre of expertise for PPP procurement and delivery.  As Senators may be aware, the new ten-year social partnership framework agreement, Towards 2016, includes a statement that the Government is disposed favourably to providing for trade union representation on the board.  I expect this will now be considered further by the Minister following the recent ratification of the agreement.</P>
        <P>I am pleased the NDFA is continuing to face the challenges set for it by the Government, both in its original role and in its new capacity as a centre of expertise.  The NDFA comprises just one element of the Government&rsquo;s broader commitment to delivering investment to promote national economic competitiveness, regional development and environmental sustainability within a sustainable economic and fiscal framework.  In that respect, a prominent feature of all Government expenditure, including capital investment, is that it must deliver value for money, and the NDFA has a central role in supporting this.  The objective, skilled and independent advice of the NDFA is and will continue to be a key complement to the broader initiatives the Minister for Finance has introduced to secure value for money.</P>
        <P>I understand that, in November 2004, there were statements in this House on PPPs.  I understand that Members expressed a positive view of PPPs if used in the right way for the right kinds of projects.  Many also made comments reflecting their concerns or queries on certain aspects or projects.  I understand that many stressed the importance of learning from experience, of being open to new ideas and of seeking and applying the right skills if we were to make the best use of PPPs.</P>
        <P>The initial establishment of the NDFA in 2003 as the financial and risk adviser to State authorities on major capital projects, including PPPs, and the further establishment within it of a centre of expertise for PPP procurement demonstrates the Government&rsquo;s commitment to learning from <Col N="1394"/>experience, being open to new ideas and putting in place the institutional structures to ensure that the right skills are applied to the process.</P>
        <P>I believe that the House will join me in welcoming the progress of the NDFA to date and congratulating the agency, its board and staff on the contribution that they have made, as well as wishing the agency well for the future.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to discuss the 2005 annual report of the National Development Finance Agency.  The agency is now almost four years old.  It has stated that one of its principal functions is to advise State authorities on the optimum financing of priority public investment projects by applying commercial standards in evaluating financial risks and costs.  Its overriding objective is to maximise value for money to the Exchequer.</P>
        <P>These are worthy aims, and no doubt the agency strives to meet them.  However, the story of the Celtic tiger has been one of incompetence in delivering capital projects.  While the private sector and the economy have roared ahead, that private success has stood in stark contrast to the public waste.  We have had some dismal experiences with public private partnerships where both the taxpayer and the user of public services have been left badly bruised.  The toll bridges in Dublin are a sore reminder, and the Comptroller and Auditor General found that PPP schools projects were 20% more expensive than expected.  The lesson is that one must be careful when choosing to use PPPs.</P>
        <P>It is worth pointing out the level of waste over which the Government has presided in capital projects.  In November 1999, the Minister for Agriculture and Food received a proposal from Punchestown seeking funding of &euro;6.9 million to build an exhibition and show centre.  The Department of Finance approved the full amount, but in June 2000 Punchestown requested an additional &euro;6.4 million, something acceded to by the Minister for Finance.  A further &euro;1.48 million was sanctioned for the project by the Minister in 2002, and the total over-run was almost &euro;15 million.</P>
        <P Just="Left">MediaLab Europe was established in May 2000 as a university level research and education centre to specialise in telecommunications, information technology and multimedia technologies.  It is worth bearing in mind that it had become a pet project of the Taoiseach after a visit to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  The State invested &euro;35.5 million in the project which collapsed in early 2005.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In 1995, the Department of Justice began the refurbishment of Cork courthouse.  The cost of &euro;6.35 million was to be borne by the Department.  However, the final cost reached &euro;26.5 million, with an additional &euro;5.2 million for rent on substitute properties also being borne by the Department.</P>
        <P>From 1999 the Office of Public Works acquired several properties to house asylum-seekers, <Col N="1395"/>spending &euro;18.9 million on five locations that were never used.  The recent Kilkenny flood relief scheme entailed a combination of river widening and deepening, flood walls and drainage works.  Originally costed at &euro;13 million, the final cost was almost &euro;50 million.  Inadequacies in the initial design plan, post-contract changes, significant under-estimation of costs and failure to negotiate a fixed price contract were causes of the large overrun.  Furthermore, the works were extended to three years owing to unforeseen archaeological work required, and there was at the time no risk management approach to flood relief schemes.</P>
        <P>Who could forget the so-called Bertie Bowl?  To facilitate the construction of the stadium, the Government moved the national laboratories to another location.  Clearing the existing site cost &euro;96.5 million and, in addition, the Government spent &euro;3 million developing the Bertie Bowl only to suspend the project.</P>
        <P>The citizens of Dublin are lucky enough finally to have their Luas.  However, even that was a financial disaster.  The original scheme was for a single continuous line from Dundrum to Tallaght through the city centre.  It was adopted as Government policy in 1996.  The project was costed in 1996 at &euro;279 million, but the final cost was &euro;750 million.  Its target completion date was 2000, but it was completed in 2004.</P>
        <P>The port tunnel runs from East Wall to Santry, connecting Dublin Port with the M1 motorway.  Originally estimated in 1999 to cost &euro;222 million, the contract awarded in 2000 was for &euro;449 million, and the final cost is expected to top &euro;1 billion.</P>
        <P>In 2005, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform purchased a site for a proposed new prison intended to replace Mountjoy Prison and the Central Mental Hospital in Dundrum.  The Minister spent &euro;30 million on a 150-acre site, a price estimated by valuers to be more than eight times the going rate for land in the area.</P>
        <P>All that is an appalling indictment of Government policy.  It is a catalogue of embarrassing incompetence and, worst of all, came against the background of sparkling private success in our economy.  Fine Gael and our partners in the Labour Party have spelt out our approach to getting capital projects built on time and within budget.  Key to that approach is giving the Taoiseach and T&aacute;naiste a central role in setting a limited number of strategic priorities for the Government.  Furthermore, the Taoiseach and T&aacute;naiste will assess ministerial performance against key high level targets.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach and T&aacute;naiste will have a direct role in setting priorities for the Estimates process.  They will be assisted by an Estimates strategy group tasked with ensuring that the Estimates reflect strategic priorities.  We will enhance the role of the Department of Finance, both as promoter of economic and social development and as monitor of public spending outcomes.  The <Col N="1396"/>Estimates process will be reformed to provide for a strategic reserve fund.  Thus up to 2% of Government spending will be held back each year and allocated to achieve a strategic shift in policy and where demonstrable value for money can be obtained from additional spending.  That will also enable the Government to foster reforming measures that enhance value for money.</P>
        <P>We will establish a critical infrastructure commission to analyse key infrastructural priorities and monitor progress on major infrastructural programmes for economic, social and regional progress.  We will reform and enhance project management by introducing a gateway system for major capital projects to enhance accountability and pin down responsibilities and by introducing a traffic light reporting system for projects to highlight emerging problems.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Those policies are spelt out in the joint Fine Gael and Labour policy document, The Buck Stops Here.  Given recent events in the Government, it is a policy clearly not followed by Fianna F&aacute;il or the Progressive Democrats.  I note that in July 2005, the role and functions of the National Development Finance Agency were expanded to include a specialised procurement delivery function.  The centre of expertise within the agency is for the specialist procurement of public private partnership projects, initially a programme of projects from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Department of Education and Science, and the Department of Health and Children.</P>
        <P>At the time, Fine Gael deputy leader and finance spokesman, Deputy Bruton, rightly questioned whether the decision to transfer responsibility for capital projects away from Departments would be a success.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, obviously wanted to be seen to be doing something.  Expanding the role of a quango is an easy option, especially when it removes responsibility from the shoulders of the Minister and his colleagues.</P>
        <P>Using private finance is a more expensive way of raising money than traditional Government borrowing.  However, savings should arise through superior management of risk by firms used to delivering a better performance in the private sector.  The question now arises of whether the higher cost of using private finance will be offset by possible savings in the private sector.  The work of the National Development Finance Agency is far from transparent.  It will be difficult for the public ever to know whether the projects represent a win for the taxpayer.  Like the National Roads Authority, the NDFA is not subject to close scrutiny by the Oireachtas.  We are being asked to take a leap of faith.</P>
        <P>There are also concerns about conflicts of interests that need to be explored.  The NDFA has become the sole gatekeeper for approving PPPs in key sectors.  However, it also has the role of organising investments in such projects.  It has been given authority to borrow up to &euro;5 billion <Col N="1397"/>to do so.  It would not be in the public interest for the agency to be involved as both gatekeeper and agent for PPP projects.  We made the point and continue to believe that the transfer of responsibility for capital projects away from Departments deserves, at best, one cheer.  It remains to be seen whether that change will bring better performances or any benefit at all.</P>
        <P>The report that we are discussing includes some good news.  Given the appalling state of our social housing waiting lists, Fine Gael welcomes the involvement of the agency in housing projects in Infirmary Road, O&rsquo;Devaney Gardens, St. Michael&rsquo;s in Inchicore, Jamestown Road, Dominick Street and Bridgefoot Street.  To give credit where it is due, the M4 Kilcock-Kinnegad motorway opened in December 2005, ten months ahead of schedule, while the National Maritime College was built under a PPP in 18 months and came in on time and within budget.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P Just="Left">However, those are not typical of capital project delivery in this country, and nobody should trumpet those small successes too loudly, if only because they are in stark contrast to so many badly handled projects.  The key challenges that face the country in the future are the establishment of a suitable infrastructure for a First World economy.  Despite all our wealth, we still have no metro, no joined-up Luas, not a single rail line to any airport and no real renewable energy infrastructure.  Governments need to show real political leadership to get these things done.  By leadership I do not mean anything like the glossy, flimsy and aspirational Transport 21.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>I very much welcome this report.  I wish to comment briefly on the history of the National Development Finance Agency.  It was born out of the National Treasury Management Agency which is one of the most successful initiatives that has been undertaken in the past 20 years.  I was privileged to have witnessed its inception.  It was part of the policy platform for the February 1987 election, adopted by the late Taoiseach, Charles J. Haughey, who had the vision to engage in initiatives which have helped to save this country millions.  Mr. Dermot Desmond, of course, was one of the inspirations for this initiative.</P>
        <P>While the Department of Finance did a very professional job, when it was responsible, it became clear,  given that the debt had grown to about &pound;25 billion, as then measured, in March 1987, that a professional full-time agency was needed which could recruit staff directly, rather than civil servants who would move on to other functions.  This agency has presided over a reduction of roughly 120% in GDP, depending on the measure one uses, down to well under 30% or indeed under 20% if the National Pension Reserve Fund is taken into account.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I spoke in the debate in 2004.  One of the reservations one has about PPPs concerns the State as <Col N="1398"/>a sovereign borrower.  A State in such good standing as Ireland is at present could obviously borrow at very keen competitive terms, which might be more difficult for any private sector enterprise, however good its standing.  The excellent feature of this is that it effectively brings together &mdash; albeit under two hats &mdash; the people who manage our debt and who therefore are responsible for borrowing on behalf of the State, at the keenest rates.  They are charged with getting the national debt down to as low a level as possible and for vetting the PPP projects so that we do not end up with projects that are very costly.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Our neighbours in Britain have had relatively bad experiences with what they call the private finance initiative, with large over-runs and heavy costs.  They have been involved in something we do not have to do, namely, massaging the budget figures to keep borrowing in or around the 3% level.  Fortunately, we do not have that problem and can examine the issues strictly on merit in terms of trying to get better value for money.  That is excellent, instead of having different Departments and agencies &mdash; particularly those with not much experience in this field &mdash; trying painfully to invent the wheel.  Instead there is an agency with experience across the board which is able to supply all the professional advice.  It can give civil servants and, indeed, Ministers the confidence to proceed with valuable projects, whether housing, education, roads, rail or whatever so that they do not have to face heavy criticism, for example, from the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>
        <P>It is essential in the financial and other fields that the Civil Service equips itself with a proper specialised agency to provide professional advice and expertise so that civil servants are able to advise Ministers and can have the courage to take decisions in the national interest which are necessary.  By all accounts, this is proceeding very well.  Different Members of the House will have experiences of different projects.  The M4 project, for example, which now stretches out to Kinnegad, is an excellent improvement which I assume is substantially, though possibly not wholly, self-funding.  We can go back to 1990, to the West Link toll bridge, which has been discussed a good deal in this House.  With the benefit of hindsight that does not appear to be a very good PPP deal.  However, we have to be realistic as regards many new projects of this type, in particular, where there is bound to be a certain amount of trial and error.  It takes time before the mechanisms are refined so that there are not over-runs, waste and so on.</P>
        <P>I was more than a little surprised by Senator Finucane&rsquo;s contribution.  I do not know how his stereotype of private sector efficiency and public sector waste appeal to his putative partners in the Labour Party, but I believe he is being simplistic in the extreme.  We have an example, only today, of the private sector falling down on the job, as regards Smart Telecom.  That type of ideological <Col N="1399"/>approach is certainly not followed by Fianna F&aacute;il &mdash; and neither, I believe, is it followed by the Labour Party.  When he mentions something such as Punchestown &mdash; excuse the pun &mdash; one can only say that this is flogging a dead horse.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>I recall having a conversation with a former Fine Gael Taoiseach.  We were discussing  the various economic development initiatives in 1987, and one of them had not come through.  With the best will in the world one has to be prepared to take risks and some will not work out.</P>
        <P>Take the assertion that Luas is a financial disaster.  Luas is an enormous public and financial success.  The budget line for the current Luas subsidy is zero this year.  Financial disaster my foot.  Frankly, I have no faith whatsoever in the document amounting to tinkering and cosmetic proposals by which Fine Gael is attempting to suggest that somehow or other it will get better value for money by setting up various bureaucratic committees and procedures.  I do not believe this adds up.  It is talking about holding back 2% of the budget to concentrate on strategic priorities.  Does that mean money will be taken off certain things that are being funded at the moment and held for strategic priorities?  Perhaps it would be interesting for the electorate to know where the 2% budget cuts will fall.</P>
        <P>In general I regret that with a fine agency such as this we have been subjected to a rather poor script from the Fine Gael research office.  It is trying to make a political issue out of the agency instead of discussing seriously its worthwhile work.  I have much confidence in this agency.  Senior people have been at the job for nearly 20 years.  Their results have been very good and they have made their contribution to the Celtic tiger economy as it existed up until the first quarter of 2001, as well as to the still very dynamic economy that we have today.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The simple fact is that most people do not know what the National Development Finance Agency is.  Without wishing to cast aspersions on colleagues, it is a reasonable bet to say that most Members of this House do not know what the NDFA does.  In that context, it is difficult to remember that it was the bright new idea for the last general election, announced with much enthusiasm and panache by the then Minister for Finance on the first day of Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s election campaign in 2002.  It was announced with such enthusiasm because the then Minister saw it as a means of financing projects off balance sheet.  That year was the weakest in the last 15 years in economic performance and the possibility existed for the first time that we could end up over the 3% deficit limit allowed under the Stability and <Col N="1400"/>Growth Pact.  The former Minister for Finance came up with this idea to allow investment in infrastructural improvement continue by taking it all off balance sheet and doing it through the NDFA.</P>
        <P>As luck would have it, economic performance improved and we did not have to go that route.  In any event, the European Commission informed the Government that such a ruse was not on.  It was not necessary for the NDFA to raise finance independently, but it did not do much of that anyway.  It was not necessary either for the NDFA to set up the special purpose companies which were envisaged.  Most of its role became redundant other than the still important role of providing advice on major infrastructural projects costing over &euro;20 million.  Therefore, it is worth remembering the history of how the agency came about.</P>
        <P>It has now been given a significant new role in the procurement of public private partnership projects.  Given the mess which was the procurement process for PPPs, that is no bad thing.  I spoke for the first time on the issue of PPPs about ten years ago and I am sure Senator Mansergh has been doing the same thing for the same period of time.  I have given the process a cautious welcome and approval which I will outline in a few moments.</P>
        <P>However, we must look coldly at our experience and I will not go through the list that Senator Finucane read out.  We have had individual bad experiences with projects, but that is not what I mean.  I mean that our experience of the process has been pretty poor.  I am not sure where the glitch arose, but there has been a distinct lack of enthusiasm for this method of financing within the Government.  I am not sure whether this arose in the Department of Finance or within line Departments, but there is no doubt that the business community and those involved in financing PPPs were under the impression that the Government is not committed to this method of financing.  I have no doubt that setting up the centre of expertise was intended to counteract those problems and perhaps it will succeed.  However, there is no doubt but that the private sector simply did not believe that the Government was in any way serious about doing what it wanted to do, or perhaps that the Government was not competent in doing what it wanted to do.</P>
        <P>There were other obvious problems and I am not sure that we have resolved them yet.  This is a small country and we are inviting companies to bid for relatively small projects by international standards.  The costs of bidding have been relatively very large.  We invite companies to engage in a lengthy negotiating process, usually going on over a period of months, which costs those companies a lot of money.  They may ultimately fail and if that happens, they must walk away with lighter pockets.  That has been a serious problem in discouraging large companies and medium-sized Irish companies from engaging in serious <Col N="1401"/>negotiations and putting in bids.  I am not sure we have dealt with that yet.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I read the report this morning.  I thought that much of its detail had already been done by the Department of Finance, such as setting up the public service benchmark for PPP projects or allocating risk between the various parties.  I remember listening to the former Minister for Finance, Mr. McCreevy, telling us four or five years ago that all of this was already in place.  It comes as a surprise to read that this is being touted as something innovative.  If it has been in place for the last few years and has not been working, then perhaps we are not getting the full facts.</P>
        <P>I do not have a problem with PPPs, but we have been guilty of expecting too much from them.  When we came up with this idea in the early 1990s, it looked like a brilliant way of spreading risk and of bringing in private sector finance and expertise.  We expected too much.  We did not learn as much as we might have done from the experience abroad and we must now learn from our own experience.  It is best used whenever there is a possibility of implementing user charges to part-finance investment which could not have otherwise been made.  The most obvious example of that is by using tolls.  I do not endorse tolls in every circumstance, but there are circumstances where it is a good thing.</P>
        <P>Senator Mansergh mentioned the pleasant problem for us, which is that we could finance projects far more easily out of current revenues.  We have not usually been in a position where we can best finance capital projects out of current revenues, but at the moment we do not even have to borrow to finance many of these projects.  We must look at things in a cold light and ask if we are better off paying for Thornton Hall over a couple of years out of current revenues, or if we are better off setting up a complex means of financing it over 30 years, which will ultimately cost far more.  On the face of it, we are far better off financing it quickly out of current revenues, unless there are other risks or expertise which we can bring in.  I am not entirely convinced that there are.</P>
        <P>In a sense, PPPs were better in harder days.  They were better when we needed to spread the financial risk and the financial cost over a period of time.  At the moment, we do not need to do that.  In almost all cases, spreading it over a longer period of time will cost us substantially more.  Even if the Government borrowed from the international markets as it would have done 15 years ago, it would almost certainly cost a good deal less than using some sort of PPP mechanism to borrow the money or to finance it over a period of 20 or 30 years.</P>
        <P>The other arguments &mdash; spreading risk and buying expertise &mdash; are more persuasive, but we must look at it on a case by case basis.  The PPP process for schools has been done on a maintenance and operation basis or part-maintenance <Col N="1402"/>and part-operation basis.  Many of those who currently maintain and operate our schools would need to be persuaded that there is expertise out there in the private sector that is better than what is currently available to us.  It may be convenient for the Department of Education and Science, or for VECs, to divest themselves of that responsibility.  However, by giving it to a private company which may well bring in immigrant labour with no expertise, it is hard to see the gain.  The other advantage is that we spread the risk and this advantage is more clearly seen.  We have seen this in some of the road projects that have been built by PPPs.  The private sector has an expertise in this area which we lacked in this country as we had no experience of such large-scale building projects.</P>
        <P>I wish the NDFA well.  Only now is it starting to do serious work.  I hope that it chooses its projects well.  I read the report and there is a variety of projects in it, some of which would not be obvious cases for a public private partnership, but I do not have any particular expertise in this area.  We need to keep a careful eye on these projects, because there are other ways of doing it and we can afford those other ways at present.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister of State to the House and I welcome the opportunity to have this debate.  It is the right time for it.</P>
        <P>On the Independent Newspapers website there is currently a straw poll that asks the question: &ldquo;Is the Government incompetent when it comes to spending public money?&rdquo;  I am sure the Minister of State would have no doubt as to how he would answer that.  As of a few minutes ago, the public response to that question was quite clear.  No fewer than 86.4% of those who have already responded consider that the Government is indeed incompetent.  I am sorry to reveal that to the Minister of State as, particularly on a night like this, it would not put a smile on anybody&rsquo;s face.</P>
        <P>Without wanting to read too much into an informal survey of this kind, the question it asks is nevertheless pertinent to this debate.  I suggest that, as legislators, it is the most important question we have to ask and it is one we should be asking constantly.  In response to this question there is good news and bad news.  I recently heard someone who had given his son the loan of his car tell a story about hearing good and bad news.  His son telephoned him and told him he had good and bad news, asking which he wanted to hear first.  His father replied that he wanted to hear the good news first.  The good news, he was told, was that the airbag works.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The good news is in the report before us, namely, the annual report of the National Development Finance Agency.  The bad news is in another publication that has just seen the light of day, the annual report of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  First, the good news.  I commend the work of the National Development Fin<Col N="1403"/>ance Agency and I commend the Government on its decision last year to extend its remit so that it now takes care of all State procurement under public private partnerships.  The setting up of the agency in the first place and the extension of its remit are an acknowledgement &mdash; a belated acknowledgement but a welcome one nonetheless &mdash; that the raising of development finance is a matter for experts, and not one for amateurs.  This is a field ploughed by some of the cleverest minds &mdash; certainly some of the highest-paid minds &mdash; in the financial world.  To set that brainpower up on one side, and to attempt to compete with it on equal terms with a team of non-experts with no particular training in this highly specialised field was to guarantee a losing result for the State from the start.  Now, at least, we have a level playing field with a balance of expertise on both sides.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The evidence from the first few years of the NDFA&rsquo;s existence is that it has brought about a huge increase in the value for money the State gets as a result of its activities in raising development finance.  On the basis of that record, I have no doubt that it will make the same improvements in the area of public private partnerships, which perhaps have a lot to offer us in terms of delivering necessary infrastructural projects somewhat faster and more efficiently than we have been used to on the basis of direct State involvement.  I say &ldquo;perhaps&rdquo; because I think the jury is still out on the issue of public private partnerships.  It remains to be seen whether they can be worth the extra that they certainly cost.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I see the off-loading of this responsibility to the NDFA as a continuation of the trend that created the National Treasury Management Agency more than ten years ago and the steady expansion of its remit ever since.  The NTMA is a monument to a principle that I should like to see extended to all public spending in this country.  This principle is that the spending of public money is a serious matter, and one to which we must bring the very highest standards of professional management.  In one way I am amazed that I should have to state this principle at all because it is surely self-evident.  Self-evident or not, it is not a principle that we have acted on in the past across the broad spectrum of public spending.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We now look after the national debt in a highly professional way, and thanks to the NDFA, we are now taking the same approach with the raising of development capital.  However, despite the large amounts of money we are now raising for development capital, it is a fairly small amount of overall Government spending.  The truth is that for the majority of Government spending across all Departments our attitude as to how we spend money is, to put it charitably, lackadaisical.  One does not have to rely on my opinion to come to that conclusion.  Instead, all one has to do is read the annual report of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  There, in black and white, one will be able to read all the chapter and verse that one <Col N="1404"/>could ever want.  This is the bad news to which I referred earlier.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I will not waste the time of the House by reciting any of the latest glaring instances of misspending and bad value for money, not least because it is the subject of the Private Members&rsquo; debate in the other House this week.  What I want to do is call attention to the pointlessness of the annual charade we go through in vetting State expenditure after the event.  The first stage in that charade is the excellent work of the Comptroller and Auditor General and his staff which results in the publication of his annual report.  The second stage is the chorus of &ldquo;oohs&rdquo; and &ldquo;aahs&rdquo; thrown up by the media at the latest manifestation of gross misspending.  The third and longest stage of the charade is the weekly grind of the Committee of Public Accounts, which diligently works its way through the voluminous Comptroller and Auditor General report questioning all the responsible Accounting Officers on their stewardship.</P>
        <P>What happens at the end of this long charade which takes up the best part of a year?  What is changed as a result of it all?  Nothing at all changes is the short, shocking answer.  When the charade is over, there is a deafening silence and a total lack of remedial action.  By then it is almost time to start the cycle all over again for the following year.</P>
        <P>I may be considered unkind in calling all this work by so many hard-working people a charade, but if we take no action as a result of it that is exactly what it is.  As legislators we are the audience for this performance, and it has no effect whatever on what we do.  The only purpose of unveiling all these instances of misspending is to do something about it.  The whole thing is pointless if we do not take action.  That is the purpose of what we do&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>Please allow Senator Quinn to continue without interruption.</P>

	<P>I take the Senator&rsquo;s point that it does learn.  However, it seems to go on year after year and I do not know that we actually take action.  I am a great believer in that everything we do should be aimed at taking action.</P>
        <P>I have been a Member of this House for 13 years and I have watched this charade repeat itself over and over.  I have now come to the conclusion that we need a radical shake-up in how we approach the spending of public money.  We need the same kind of creativity that came up with the National Treasury Management Agency to devise a totally new approach to how we do our spending.  This would look at how we approve it in the first place, and then, above all, how we monitor the spending to make sure it is well spent <Col N="1405"/>and achieves the purpose for which it was approved.</P>
        <P>The first step in bringing about this change is to admit that we currently have a dysfunctional system.  Those 86.4% of respondents in the Independent Newspapers survey were right in that the Government is indeed incompetent when it comes to spending public money.  It is high time we put our minds to setting this right.  We have the objectives, ambition and the wish.  What we now need is the determination to get down and do something about it.</P>

	<P>Clearly, I did not have the benefit of hearing all that Senators have said about the report.  However, I commend those that have taken the trouble of reading the report and going through what they would see as the positives.  I was in my office to hear some of the negative responses.</P>
        <P>Member of both Houses, perhaps because they are inundated with paperwork of one kind or another, sometimes miss out on the opportunity to examine the kind of work that is done by the National Development Finance Agency, and the plethora of other agencies that benefit from public funds.  In some instances those agencies believe they would benefit from significantly more public funds being made available to them.</P>
        <P>The nature of the projects undertaken is diverse.  There is an enormous number of possibilities and a level of challenge which could be addressed by the agency in a favourable condition.  The Minister of State, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, in his opening remarks spoke in particular about the PPP issues and the challenges involved.  As the Minister for Finance has said in the House, the Government is committed to the use of public private partnerships in delivering public investment projects where they are appropriate.</P>
        <P>We must be aware of difficulties which have arisen in other jurisdictions regarding PPPs, particularly in the context of partnerships which involve relatively long-term support of the initial building project.  There have been instances in the United Kingdom and elsewhere of financial difficulties besetting the company subsequently which undermined somewhat the efficacy, particularly in fiscal terms, of the particular project.</P>
        <P>The use of PPPs can have benefits when used for projects of the right scale, risk and operational profile.  I am not sure we have always managed to get all those factors right.  It is recognised that the PPP process places new demands on both the public and the private sectors.  It requires more effort up-front in scoping, procuring and negotiating projects because PPP is a form of procurement that integrates a number of components and not just construction.  The contracts are typically long-term ones and sometimes the long-term and <Col N="1406"/>the support elements are of enormous importance.</P>
        <P>PPPs also face the same challenges as other large projects.  Given that there are so few of them in western Europe in particular, people tend to direct a huge level of attention on negative experiences such as those that have occurred, particularly in the United Kingdom.  The Government must demonstrate a willingness and the capacity to innovate, apply lessons learned from innovation with PPPs currently and, perhaps more importantly, benefit from the experiences in other jurisdictions.</P>
        <P Just="Left">PPPs are not the major part of the capital investment programme.  It is important to highlight the extensive work the National Development Finance Agency is doing in advising State authorities on major capital projects which are not privately financed PPPs.  There are significant public transport investments by the Rail Procurement Agency, RPA, and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann among others.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There are clear fundamental issues regarding, for example, value for money.  There are issues regarding the quality of the construction in the provision of projects of this nature and it is important that we would not lose sight of issues of that magnitude.  Some Members raised concerns they had in that regard.  It is vital that there be rigorous appraisal and best practice management in regard to projects of this nature.  It is fair to say that has been the experience heretofore in respect of Ireland.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Finance has already identified enhanced value for money measures to be applied such as the revised capital and appraisal guidelines, public procurement reforms, measures in regard to ICT and major consultancies, and value for money in policy reviews.  In the PPP area these are backed up by specific guidelines and PPPs based on the general capital appraisal guidelines.  Within that broader context the specific expertise of the NDFA is an invaluable support and, in the context of developing public procurement and public investment projects, will continue to be a hugely important component.  It is fair to acknowledge that in the relatively short period since 2003 good quality advice has been given.</P>
        <P>It is also clear from the current annual report that the NDFA is meeting its responsibility regarding its role in advising State authorities on public investment projects generally and its new role in procuring PPP projects.  That is not to ignore the primary role of Departments and other State authorities in selecting, appraising and scoping projects.  The Government has embarked on an ambitious programme of capital investment and has put in place rigorous procedures and institutional support to deliver value for money in public expenditure.</P><Col N="1407"/>
        <P>We want to deliver the first class economic and social infrastructure Ireland needs.  I compliment the NDFA on its performance to date and I am confident that the agency will continue to play its part in the delivery of the Government investment programme.</P>

      <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, to the House.  This matter concerns the need for the Minster for Health and Children and the Health Service Executive, HSE, to provide adequate funding to the service providers, the Brothers of Charity, in Ballinasloe for the delivery of a properly resourced service to persons with disabilities, both adults and children, who are experiencing severe curtailment of their services.</P>
        <P>The Brothers of Charity and the Galway County Association have been the service providers for both children and adults with disabilities in County Galway for many years.  The &euro;60 million provided is broken down on a 40-20 basis between them but most of the public representatives in the east Galway area were called to a crisis meeting in Ballinasloe recently where the Ballinasloe Advocates, a voluntary organisation made up mainly of parents and siblings of people with disabilities of one kind or another, outlined the crisis facing them in the Ballinasloe area.  The provision of services is now at crisis point.  The reserves that are held to deal with a crisis, as inevitably happens at some time in the year to some family, will be exhausted within the near future.  Of the new moneys that are supposed to be provided &mdash; &euro;10 million nationally &mdash; Galway would be entitled to about &euro;1 million of that on the basis of population and the increasing numbers of people identified with special needs in this area.  That money has not been released by the HSE.  I ask the Minister of State to ensure that either he or the Minister, Deputy Harney, would instruct the HSE to provide as a matter of urgency the additional funding due to the people in Galway to allow them continue to provide reasonable standards for the people with disabilities in the Ballinasloe area.</P>
        <P>Everybody realises the value for money being provided by the service providers in the area.  In fact, they are providing services to many more people than those for whom they are funded through the voluntary contributions made by <Col N="1408"/>people in the county and through fund-raising and otherwise.  One must realise that the 2006 new moneys provide only 13.75 residential places for 131 unmet needs; only 28.6 day places for 46 unmet needs; and only 4.4 residential support places for 161 unmet needs.  The majority of those are spread throughout the county and a great proportion of them are within the Ballinasloe service providers area.  That demands an urgent response from the Minister of State and the Minister, Deputy Harney, with regard to the delivery of services.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Another matter that must be examined clearly is that under the old health board system, the resources delivered in the former Western Health Board area were provided at a ratio of 3:2:1 to counties Galway, Mayo and Roscommon, respectively.  Given the high population in County Galway and Galway city relative to the other two counties, this breakdown was totally unsuitable and was obviously unbalanced.  Thus, County Roscommon&rsquo;s absolute needs are met, whereas that is not the case in County Galway.  Moreover, the Government&rsquo;s disbursement figures are based on the 2002 census.  However, four years have passed and the population has increased considerably, particularly in County Galway and Galway city.  In addition, there is greater recognition of the needs of younger and elderly people who may not have been identified at an early stage heretofore.  It is known that early intervention is of the utmost importance for many people with special educational needs.  The Brothers of Charity should be able to provide such services to such people.</P>
        <P>At present in County Galway, a total of 1,173 people &mdash; many of whom are in Ballinasloe &mdash; are on waiting lists for therapies of one kind or other.  Several children have passed through the services provided by the Brothers of Charity and the Galway County Association and have returned to mainstream education, only to find that speech therapy is unavailable in many rural schools.  No speech therapists are available to travel to such areas and the same is true for other service providers.</P>
        <P>Hence, such pupils now lack these services.  They are in mainstream education and last May, many of them were told they would not have an assessment until next September.  How can this be reconciled with the statement of the former Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Martin, on 5 November 1998, which is on the minds of all who have children with special needs?  He asserted that the special needs sector would not want, geographical location would not be a problem and such children would have a right to their needs.  In other words, they would have the right to their particular need and it would not be subject to resources.  When the Minister of the day was questioned regarding resources, he made assurances they would be pro<Col N="1409"/>vided and that there would be no shortage of money in this area.  However, not only is there a shortage of money to keep such services in place at present, there is also a shortage of staff.</P>

      <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I will finish on this important point and beg the Leas-Chathaoirleach&rsquo;s indulgence.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A lady of 74 years, who is mother of a child named Patrick with special needs wrote that while she cared for him full-time, she had been staying in Portiuncula Hospital since last June and did not know how much longer she would be there. She depends on her daughters to look after him, one of whom lives in Kerry and the other in Birr.  However, for personal reasons, her daughters would be unable to care for him in the following week.  As her son has Prader-Willi syndrome, he needs full-time residential care with supervision and she concluded with the hope that I would give the matter my immediate attention.</P>
        <P>Her daughter also wrote in connection with her brother Patrick. She noted that her mother was in full-time care in hospital and might be there for some time. While she and her sister had taken care of Patrick, they have families of their own and have been obliged to spend much time away from their homes. They are unable to give Patrick the full care he deserves. She noted that while he attends Creagh day care centre, she and her sister live in Birr and Kerry, respectively, and it was not always possible to reach him at the centre. They find themselves in an impossible situation and need all the help they can get.
		</P>
		<P>This is from a hospitalised lady of 74 years, with an adult son in need of full-time care, which is unavailable. However, it was available before. Therefore, I reiterate my request that immediate action be taken to release the resources necessary to the Brothers of Charity and the other centres in Ballinasloe to provide the services for the young and adult people who are in need.</P>

        <P>I wish to deal with the matter raised by Senator Ulick Burke on the Adjournment. I wish to outline the position regarding the additional funding provided for services for children and adults with a disability in 2006, as well as funding specifically provided to the Brothers of Charity in respect of services in Galway.</P><Col N="1410"/>
        <P>The matter of contracting and funding services provided by organisations such as the Brothers of Charity is a matter for the Health Service Executive in accordance with its functions under the Health Act 2004.  The executive has advised the Minister that it is unaware of any existing or proposed curtailment of services provided by the Brothers of Charity in Ballinasloe.  The executive has confirmed that in its 2006 service plan, a sum of &euro;40 million was assigned to the Brothers of Charity services in Galway, of which &euro;3.2 million was allocated to the services provided by the organisation at Ballinasloe.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In addition, more than &euro;1 million in new service development money for 2006 was allocated by the executive to the Brothers of Charity services in Galway, which will increase to &euro;1.2 million in a full year.  This funding comes from the multi-annual investment programme for 2006 to 2009, which is part of the national disability strategy being implemented by the Government.</P>
        <P>Additional funding amounting to &euro;51.5 million has been provided by the Government in 2006 to develop services for persons with intellectual disability and those with autism.  This has enabled the provision of 255 new residential places, 85 new respite places, 535 new day places, 250,000 extra hours of home support and personal assistance services and the continuation of the transfer of persons with intellectual disability or autism from psychiatric hospitals and other inappropriate placements.</P>
        <P>Further substantial funding of &euro;22.5 million has been provided in 2006 to enhance the multidisciplinary support services for children and adults with physical, sensory and intellectual disabilities, as well as those with autism.  The funding will also address core underfunding and staffing issues in services for people with disabilities provided by the voluntary sector.</P>
        <P>Capital funding amounting to &euro;45 million has also been provided in 2006 to develop the buildings and facilities for the new services.  I believe that the extent of this extra funding &mdash; a total of &euro;119 million this year alone &mdash; clearly illustrates the Government&rsquo;s commitment to improving our disability services, including those provided by the Brothers of Charity.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>An officer of the Health Service Executive, who attended the same group meeting as we had held earlier, stated that he was quite shocked by the shortfall in the services which he had seen.  He stated that there were shortfalls at all times due to the lack of proper funding for the services in the past.  He was also concerned at the manner in which moneys were distributed in the west using a ratio of 3:2:1.  These sentiments were expressed last week and therefore I cannot understand how the Health Service Executive has reported to the Minister of State in the manner <Col N="1411"/>stated in his reply, which describes a different situation.  This must be taken in hand.</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Brian Lenihan, for taking this Adjournment matter in respect of an issue concerning the Portrane-Donabate peninsula in north County Dublin, an area which has grown tremendously in recent years.  As with the Minister of State&rsquo;s own constituency of Dublin West, it has huge educational requirements, both at primary and secondary level.  Currently between 400 and 500 children attend secondary schools as far away as Balbriggan, Skerries, Malahide, Portmarnock and Swords.  I am told children from the Donabate and Portrane areas attend some 13 secondary schools.  Only two weeks ago I was amazed at the number of children on the platform at the railway station in Donabate waiting for trains either to Balbriggan or town.</P>
        <P>There is no doubt that a secondary school will come to Donabate.  However, to end the uncertainty for parents an announcement must be made that a school will be in place by September 2008.  By that date it is estimated some 700 pupils will otherwise need to leave the area.  The area is the subject of a local area action plan which will result in many thousands more homes.</P>
        <P>I know it is a something with which the Minister of State has had to deal in his own constituency of Dublin West.  I ask that every effort be made to ensure that Donabate is included in the next announcement so that the anxiety currently being experienced by parents and children will be allayed and children can be assured of a place in September 2008.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I thank the Senator for raising this matter on the Adjournment.  The Senator has considerable experience of developing school projects in Fingal and is, indeed, a former member of the local authority.  He is well aware of the urgent needs of the community in Fingal <Col N="1412"/>for further educational provision.  I am pleased to provide the up-to-date position on post-primary infrastructure for the Donabate area.</P>
        <P>As the Senator is aware and has outlined, the Government is providing a new, 1,000 pupil post-primary school to cater for the needs of Portrane and Donabate.  The school will be a community college under the aegis of the vocational education committee.  I am acutely aware of the needs of the Donabate-Portrane area and the Minister is determined to progress this project as quickly as possible.</P>
        <P>The site for the new school has been made available to the Department by Fingal County Council under the terms of a cross-Government agreement finalised in July of this year.  This arrangement, which will provide school infrastructure in tandem with shared community facilities, will have a broader application throughout the functional area of Fingal County Council where it is expected up to 20 new schools will be required over the coming years.</P>
        <P>A lot of work has been done by officials of the Department of Education and Science and Fingal County Council in recent months to agree the terms of an overall framework agreement which will now enable the site in Donabate to transfer to the Department and to make arrangements for the sharing of significant extra facilities, including sports facilities and a library, between the school and the local community.  The innovative arrangements being put in place will ensure enhanced facilities for the school and maximum benefit for the community.</P>
        <P>Arrangements are now in train for the transfer of the designated site from Fingal County Council to the Department, which is key to moving the project forward.  Once the legal process for the transfer of the site has been concluded, the project can move to the next stage.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The project is of the highest priority for the Department, as evidenced by the assignment to it of a priority band 1 rating under the published prioritisation criteria for large-scale building projects.  I assure the Seanad that the Minister shares the anxieties that the new school be built as soon as possible.</P>
