    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I have received notice from Senator Jim Walsh that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources to outline the efforts being made to provide a natural gas connection to County Wexford as a matter of priority.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator O&rsquo;Toole of the following matter:</P>
      <P LI="1">The urgent need for the Minister for Education and Science to stop immediately the election of members to the body established under the Education Act 1998 relating to teaching through Irish as there is every possibility that the process is unsound and even illegal as there is not available or published any set of rules or guidelines governing the election, candidates have no access to a list of registered voters or of those entitled to vote and the electorate has no access to details of the background of the candidates; and to ensure that the elections will not proceed until she is satisfied that her Department has approved the election rules and guidelines.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Browne of the following matter:</P>
      <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Health and Children to outline the progress being made for cystic fibrosis patients in Ireland.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Mooney of the following matter:</P>
      <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Social and Family Affairs to outline the progress he has made in extending free travel to recipients of Irish pensions resident in the UK.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Bannon of the following matter:</P><Col N="1426"/>
      <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs to give an update regarding essential funding for Legan neighbourhood watch and community alert, County Longford, under the programme of grants for locally-based community and voluntary organisations, as this group provides an invaluable service to the local community and is urgently in need of such funding.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator MacSharry of the following matter:</P>
      <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to immediately establish a jobs task force for the north-west region to urgently seek to attract new service and manufacturing industry to the area given the significant job losses in Sligo and Donegal caused by the closure of a number of high profile employers, such as Saehan Media in Sligo and Magees in Donegal, in the last week and several others in recent times in both counties.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment. I have selected the matters raised by Senators Jim Walsh, O&rsquo;Toole and Browne and they will be taken at the conclusion of business. Senators Mooney, Bannon and MacSharry may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

    <Title>Order of Business.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Order of Business is Nos. 1, 2 and 26. No. 1 is a referral motion whereby the subject matter of No. 17 on today&rsquo;s Order Paper is being referred to the Joint Committee on Agriculture and Food for consideration. The Act amends and extends the Diseases of Animals Acts 1966 to 2001 and its provisions enhance the Minister&rsquo;s ability to deal with all animal disease situations and also with criminal activity in regard to animal health. It is proposed to take this item without debate. No. 2 is statements on funding for third level education and the Fottrell report, resumed, to be taken on the conclusion of the Order of Business and to conclude not later than 5 p.m. The contributions of Senators are not to exceed ten minutes each and Senators may share time, and the Minister will be called on to reply not later than five minutes before the conclusion of the statements. No. 26, Private Members&rsquo; motion No. 26, will be taken from 5 p.m. to 7 p.m.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>Last month I raised with the Deputy Leader the issue of allowing non-national recruits to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to be granted citizenship when appointed to the force. Has he considered the matter further? It is positive that many non-nationals are to join the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. It is good for the Garda and good for society at large. Those people, when they are to be appointed as fully serving officers of the force, <Col N="1427"/>should also have the opportunity to become Irish citizens.</P>
      <P>Next week I will produce a Private Members&rsquo; Bill allowing for this development in the context of an amendment to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Bill. I have received legal opinion to the effect that it may not require legislation but merely a simple resolution of both Houses of the Oireachtas to allow that situation to come to pass.</P>
      <P>I know the Government is generally positive towards this proposal. In the next week or two, will the Government set aside some of its own time or give the Opposition time to put this resolution to the House? The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform would be eager to consider the matter although, clearly, he would need to raise it with his colleagues in Government. There is general cross-party support for this proposal. It is a good idea, it is worth doing and it should be initiated in this House. I ask for time to debate the matter, if the Deputy Leader will allow.</P>
      <P>Will the Deputy Leader provide time next week to allow the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to come to the House to make a statement and to hear contributions from Members on the question of the Garda reserve? I am supportive of the proposal, which is a good idea. I welcome that the Minister has published guidelines for the new recruits to this service. Much of the comment in this regard is scaremongering from people who should know better. I ask that the Government provide time next week for the Minister to make a full statement and hear comment from all sides. Of course there should be consultation and all of the associations and bodies which represent the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na should be part and parcel of this process. However, there is an absolute responsibility on the members of the force to enforce the law. The law is clear on this issue &mdash; under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Bill a reserve is to be established and that law must be enforced.</P>
      <P>Will the Deputy Leader, my colleagues on the other side of the House and the Government in particular not use their blocking majority to vote down Private Members&rsquo; motion No. 25 on the Order Paper, which concerns the establishment of a select committee of this House to consider what is happening at Shannon Airport?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>There is cross-party support for a genuine select committee to examine all aspects of this matter, including the question of extraordinary rendition and the use of Irish airspace and airports for this practice. Other parliaments have done this &mdash; the European Parliament has led the way. Why can we not have, in this House in particular, a similar committee working on a <Col N="1428"/>cross-party basis? Even at this late stage, I ask the Government not to use its blocking majority. It should put Private Members&rsquo; motion No. 25 before the House and then let us see the report of the select committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I could not agree more with Senator Brian Hayes. My colleague, Senator Norris, last week highlighted the importance of this issue. The House has previously agreed to a debate. I ask that the point put forward by Senator Norris, and the motion that has now gone forward in his name, be accepted by the House. It should be accepted not just with a free vote but without a vote at all. Senator Norris will expand on this point when he speaks.</P>
      <P>I previously supported the proposal from Senator Hayes that garda&iacute; from non-national communities be allowed citizenship. It is a good idea. It may be useful to have a general debate on that proposal and the Garda reserve force. The Deputy Leader might also confirm that the Government, in supporting the idea of giving non-nationals citizenship, has dismissed the recent daft notion from Aire na Gaeltachta that foreign national applicants to the Garda would be required to spend three months in the Gaeltacht and pass an Irish examination before their appointment. We should expose this type of compulsion and nonsense, which is choking the Irish language, and address it properly.</P>
      <P>It would be good to provide for garda&iacute; in the force &mdash; be they national or non-national &mdash; the idea of a support for them to go to the Gaeltacht, learn about ways there and the language, not as a condition or a matter of compulsion, but as an action that would expand their involvement with Ireland. All of us would support such an idea.</P>
      <P>I would like a debate on what we mean by the notion of free speech in a democracy. This was raised here in a recent debate, which related to cartoons. We knew where we stood on that issue, although there were some doubts about the cartoons themselves. The recent imprisonment of a fascist Nazi in Austria raises concern. If somebody raises issues of incitement to hatred or takes similar action, it is clear how the law should act. If people are simply speaking stupidly, they should be sent to a place other than a prison. Such people should be dealt with in that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Nonsense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>If information is being used in a way to incite anti-Semitism or something similar, I agree that people doing so should be put behind bars. We do not have a clear understanding of where we stand in a theoretical basis, and what are the principles governing free speech in matters such as these.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a prominent Turkish writer currently facing charges because he has <Col N="1429"/>attempted to ask his country to confront its own history. I fully agree with Senator O&rsquo;Toole in stating that nobody should go to prison because they challenge accepted history.</P>
      <P>The issue of road safety is almost at the point of monotony at this stage. I am not sure I even wish to indicate a wish for a debate on it. The political system in the State must nonetheless confront the issue. The public is at the stage where it believes that neither Government nor Oireachtas nor any other body is really concerned about what is occurring on our roads.</P>
      <P>The public knows, for example, that the vast majority of truck drivers are blatantly breaking speed limits. It was happening again this morning. The Irish Road Hauliers Association simply denies this and nobody investigates the matter. We all know that trucks are not supposed to be going above 80 km/h, but they travel at 100 km/h or 120 km/h, as anybody travelling on motorways will testify.</P>
      <P>It is time that a concerted plan of action be put in place. We all believe in lectures to the public about the need for greater responsibility, and I am not interested in digging up ancient history about what anybody stated 20 years ago. Lecturing the public is not now sufficient. The real deterrent to bad driving is the likelihood of being caught. It is not a potential penalty or another factor. Why will it take 12 months to introduce legislation to deal with random breath testing? Why are there no speed cameras? Why has it taken years to get mutual recognition of penalty points between this State and Northern Ireland? The list of questions goes on. The public has come to the conclusion that nobody in the Houses of the Oireachtas cares about the issue.</P>
      <P>I am reluctant to suggest a debate but I ask that a Minister come to the House soon, for it is not overburdened with legislation, with a series of legislative proposals to deal with the issue. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform should give a commitment that garda&iacute; will be present and visible where they are needed, not sitting on a flyover shooting fish in a barrel and collecting large numbers of speeding fines, but on the roads, where this horrible slaughter happens weekend after weekend. I am not interested in making a party political issue out of it.</P>
      <P>I was not in the House last week and most extraordinary things happened in my absence. I choose not to believe it was a coincidence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I was tempted to say something but I will refrain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask for a debate on human rights because there seem to be great sensitivities about the matter. I am reputedly anti-American. However, I recently read a report which stated:</P>
      <P LI="1">In several communities there were allegations of incidents of violence against racial <Col N="1430"/>minorities and immigrants. Societal discrimination against immigrants and ethnic minorities continues to be a growing problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Ryan has already been given some latitude.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I will finish soon but I want to make the point. The report goes on to state &ldquo;A distinct ethnic group faces societal discrimination&rdquo;. Who am I talking about?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Americans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is from the US State Department&rsquo;s report on human rights in Ireland. If our friends in the US are entitled to write that about us, and they are, where did the notion arise that we cannot scrutinise them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Brian Hayes because this is an extraordinary position. I appeal to the Members on the Government side to rethink. I do not know who got at them or what motivated them to change their minds. I spent much of my time trying to ensure that the proposed committee had a Government majority, so that we could not be accused of hijacking it. I suggested that to the Leader because I did not want it to become a political issue. However, it has been turned into a political issue by people who either lack the spine or the compunction to make up their own minds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for deeming my matter on the Adjournment to be in order and I will raise it on another day.</P>
      <P Just="Left">On another more serious issue, I ask the Deputy Leader for a debate as soon as possible on competitiveness, particularly in the north-west region, the counties of Sligo, Donegal and Leitrim. Traditional manufacturing industry in that part of the country is in freefall. I would like such a debate to call on the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin, or indeed the Taoiseach if he is available, to establish a cross-departmental team to devise an immediate strategy to attract new foreign direct investment into the region and to establish an environment which will allow further indigenous industry, backed by Enterprise Ireland, to flourish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>Another task force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask that the statements on planning be resumed at the earliest opportunity. My colleague, Senator Scanlon, also wanted to raise this today. Yesterday An Bord Plean&aacute;la vetoed a hotel development in Enniscrone, County Sligo, which would have created 200 jobs. <Col N="1431"/>It is disgraceful that an area that most needs jobs misses out because of our planning system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeMcHugh"><NameTxt>Mr. McHugh</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">A report was published today by the National Youth Council of Ireland, in conjunction with the Equality Authority, on inequalities relating to the stereotyping of young people. Among the issues which emerged was that young people believe their stereotyping by adults is as unequal as it ever was. There were concerns that the media stereotypes young people into categories related to crime, deviance, delinquency, drug and alcohol problems, sexual promiscuity and general disorderliness. The research also indicated that politicians are dismissive of young people and add fuel to the fire of media stereotyping. A vacuum exists which we, as elected politicians, need to fill. Vibrant, independent and strong-minded young characters feel they are not being represented, for which we are all to blame.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Senator have a question?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeMcHugh"><NameTxt>Mr. McHugh</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I want an early debate on how we can proactively involve and engage young people in the democratic process. We need to do so sooner rather than later because, if we do not, issues concerning young people, such as the road carnage referred to by Senator Ryan, will not be addressed. If young people are disenfranchised from the process or do not live up to their responsibilities, we have to find out what is going on in their minds. We must represent rather than stereotype them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MargaretCox"><NameTxt>Ms Cox</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator MacSharry&rsquo;s call for discussions on competitiveness in the north west and ask that such a debate be extended to the entire western region. The current manufacturing situation throughout the country is affecting our exports and is a reflection of the difficulties which Irish manufacturing companies face when operating in a global economy.</P>
      <P>I ask the Deputy Leader to arrange a debate on the issue of special needs education. Over the past few years, when legislation on disabilities and education passed through both Houses, discussions were held on the issue of children who, on turning 18 are no longer the responsibility of the Department of Education and Science. I would like the Minister to report to this House on events subsequent to the enactment of that legislation and to indicate the improvements made to provisions for 18 year olds with special needs. While I believe that will make for short reading, I would like the opportunity to debate the matter.</P>
      <P>I twice raised the issue of Great Southern Hotels and, if the matter is not discussed this week, I will take action next week on the Order of Business. When we asked for a debate, the <Col N="1432"/>Leader suggested that she would arrange one when the Minister returned from America this week. Unfortunately, it does not appear possible to get a Minister to address the issue this week, so I ask that the debate be held next week. If that is not possible, we will have to amend the Order of Business to facilitate it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I propose that we amend the Order of Business by taking No. 26, motion No. 25, concerning the establishment of terms of reference for a committee of inquiry into Shannon Airport. This was subverted last week as a result of intervention by various people, including some who are influenced heavily by councillors. I would have thought that, in light of the behaviour of a number of councillors, parliamentarians would be careful before doing the bidding or becoming the lackeys of people who have not been elected to this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>That is an outrage and should be withdrawn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a perfect argument for an examination of the undemocratic method by which people such as you, Senator Dooley, are elected to this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a slight on councillors from Clare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid=""><NameTxt>An Cathaoireach</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask Senator Norris to address his contribution on the Order of Business through the Chair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not acceptable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I am speaking on this issue and giving my reasons, which I am entitled to do. Members may have noticed unfavourable comments in last weekend&rsquo;s newspapers. I recommend in particular that we all read the article by Diarmuid Doyle in <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> about the forelock tugging that went on.</P>

	<P>When did journalists start running the country?</P>

	<P>Who elected him?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>The person interrupting me now mentioned the Seanad&rsquo;s 50 years of history and he is right. For 800 years we were ruled by Britain. Is that an argument for going back?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>Is that what Senator Norris wants us to go back to?</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="1433"/>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Perhaps it is. The Government side of the House could be as craven to the British as it is to George Bush.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>This is an outrage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I wrote to the Garda Commissioner and he appointed two detective chief superintendents to meet me. I also brought with me Deputy Michael D. Higgins from the other House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a private matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">It is directly relevant. They told me that under the way in which the UN convention on torture is incorporated in Irish law, they did not have the power to enter the aeroplanes. The Government has sent a report to Switzerland stating the complete opposite.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a matter for the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>That is why this committee of inquiry is important. One of them is not telling the truth and we are entitled to know which.</P>
      <P>The Government has also said there are no aeroplanes involved in rendition through Shannon Airport. That is a lie and the Government knows it. We have the flight patterns and we know one was refuelled on the way back.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I am calling Senator Leyden. Senator Norris should resume his seat.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Will the Deputy Leader arrange for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to come into the House as soon as possible to discuss the proposals for the Garda reserve force? Measures to establish such a force are contained in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act but should be debated further. This House should discuss the legislation and its implementation. Without the co-operation of the GRA and the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors, it will not come about. There is time for negotiation to ensure full co-operation from the GRA.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Deputy Leader to request the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to come before the House and outline the proposals for the establishment of the Garda reserve force and how he can overcome the opposition from the force to his proposals. In the Minister&rsquo;s statement at the time, he said the decision was subject to a decision by the Government to establish such a force and that it would be beneficial to discuss it. It is an important issue and we should debate it.</P>
      <P>Senator Norris was not concerned when the Cubans were going through Shannon Airport at one time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Ryan&rsquo;s comments on recent accidents. I raised the issue last week and made the point that the rules of the road should be available in different languages. I was pleased to hear the Garda assistant commissioner agree with me on &ldquo;Five Seven Live&rdquo; that it should happen. The Government should take action in this area. I was also pleased to read that the Government is taking action on drivers from the North of Ireland and Britain who snub our penalty point system and get away with it.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>Will the Government also listen to the other remarks the assistant commissioner made during the radio interview in question? He made valid proposals for dealing with cars from eastern Europe and problems related to the NCT, insurance and so forth. Tackling this issue will require a multifaceted approach. I support Senator Ryan in this regard because, as the events of every weekend demonstrate, drastic measures are required to end the carnage on the roads.</P>

	<P>While the House does not have a Green Party Senator, I express my abhorrence at the fire-bombing of the home of a public representative for expressing opposition to dumping and legitimate views about anti-social and anti-environmental behaviour. Public representatives represent many citizens and are entitled to be inviolate and protected.</P>
      <P>I am sure members of the Garda, on further reflection, will appreciate their role and responsibility in upholding the rule of law in a democracy and fulfilling the will of this Parliament, following further consultation as necessary.</P>
      <P>I do not share Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s view on the subject of the historian who was imprisoned in Austria. If Ireland had the experience Austria and Germany had during the period of the Nazi <Col N="1435"/>regime, we would take a serious and dim view of somebody who claimed that none of the events in question took place.</P>

	<P>I add my support to Senator Norris&rsquo;s amendment which has already been seconded. I was in the House when the issue of establishing a select committee was first raised and no indication was given at any level that there was resistance to the Seanad inquiring into the relevant matter. The House has a right to discuss issues in the manner Senators choose. It is clear the stance of Senators from the other side is being dictated from outside the House. I appeal to them to honour the standing and status of the House by supporting the amendment and proceeding to establish the sub-committee.</P>

	<P>Arising from the news which emerged from County Meath yesterday, I ask for a debate on industrial development, job creation and competitiveness. In recent years, large areas of the country have experienced many job losses as industries left without replacement. The people of these regions, which include significant areas of the midlands extending into County Tipperary, are being told by IDA Ireland, at least unofficially, that there is no hope of ever securing industrial development. This is not acceptable. I would welcome an opportunity to discuss strategies on job creation, industrial development and competitiveness.</P>

Westmeath County Council has a junior county council &mdash; perhaps other councils could follow suit. We are the first in many things, of which this is another example.</P>
      <P>I ask the Deputy Leader to request the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children to come to the House for a debate on diabetes.

      <P><?oasys _ic14- ?>It has been proposed to hold a debate on competitiveness. The loss of 350 jobs at the NEC plant in Ballivor is a sign of what is happening and is likely to continue to happen. Our future is unlikely to be in manufacturing, which is much more likely to take place in Asia and elsewhere. Our future lies in high added value and internationally-traded services. Unless we take note of this and make decisions to put ourselves into a competitive league to a greater extent than at present, we will not succeed. Therefore, I support the call for an urgent debate on competitiveness.<?oasys _ic0- ?></P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased that Senator Quinn raised the issue of competitiveness, as I was rising to support my colleague Senator MacSharry in asking for a debate. As a result of structural and cultural reasons, the north west and the west in general have been lagging behind the rest of the country. These reasons might not be quite in keeping with what Senator Quinn is suggesting, which is a more global view of competitiveness to which I would subscribe in the national macro-economic area. However, certain issues underlie the reasons for such a high level of youth unemployment in the north west and especially in Donegal, mainly related to the focus on one or two industries. With regard to the Saehan Media disaster of last week, when it started trading in Sligo it was seen as a flagship project that employed over 350 people at a time when there were very few industrial jobs. That is an indication of how circumstances have changed. I am sure we would all agree that the loss of jobs in Ballivor is a disaster.</P>

	<P>I am aware of that.</P>
      <P>Will the Deputy Leader consider inviting the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Conor Lenihan, to the House to discuss the overseas aid programme, with particular reference to Ethiopia? This issue has generated a great deal of controversy and my colleagues in the foreign affairs committee will be aware that it has been debated over the past number of weeks. The issues being raised by the NGOs, John O&rsquo;Shea, the Minister and others are worthy of a wider debate and this House would be the ideal vehicle for that.</P>
      <P>I agree with my colleague, Senator Mansergh, and I am glad he raised the issue, that the attack <Col N="1438"/>on the home of Councillor Mary White is unacceptable in a democracy. She is an elected representative and if the people who attempted to blow her and her husband to smithereens feel so strongly about the particular issue, why do they not stand for election?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the last point made by Senator Mooney. The attack on the home of Councillor Mary White was appalling. For any public representative to be subject to such an attack is unacceptable, and I agree with the comments of previous speakers in that regard.</P>
      <P>I join with other Senators in calling for a debate on competitiveness, which should be broadened out to the entire country. Previous speakers mentioned different regions in the west but as far as I am concerned there are only two regions in this country &mdash; Dublin and the rest. I am a representative of the south-east region and we have the lowest <i>per capita</i> income, the highest levels of unemployment of any region in the country and the lowest levels of third level entrants. Such a debate would be useful but it should cover the whole country.</P>

We were circulated today with documentation the Government has provided to the Council of Europe. It is comprehensive and sets out in great detail, as requested under Article 52, information I believe is relevant to those investigations.

I have raised in the House previously the possibility, in conjunction with what has been done by the Houses of the Oireachtas, that the insurance companies, which have increased their profits significantly with the PIAB and the MIAB, respond by asking young drivers to install speed restricters so that they cannot drive above a certain speed. If they were to accept those speed restricters they would get significantly reduced insurance costs.</P>
      <P>A Member on the Opposition side of the House has vociferously called for the establishment of a select committee of the House. However, Senator Norris said in the House last week that the American state was a criminal regime. That is a very serious and inaccurate statement.</P>

I am concerned that an anti-immigrant consensus is gaining momentum in the United States. This Government should do everything possible to ensure that the 50,000 undocumented Irish working in the United States get a chance to come back.

    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>I apologise to the Cathaoirleach. Senator Brian Hayes, the Leader of the Opposition, and Senator O&rsquo;Toole raised the matter of allowing non-national recruits to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to be granted citizenship when appointed to the force. I agreed with Senator Brian Hayes when he first raised this issue and I have made the views expressed known to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. I cannot say what the outcome of talks on this proposal would be, but there is general recognition that it is a good idea. There have been requests for the Minister to come to the House to address this and other matters and perhaps we could invite him to respond. I am not sure about using a resolution to allow non-national recruits to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to be granted citizenship but if it could be agreed, it would be a good way to approach the matter. The Minister has always shown himself to be amenable to coming to the House to debate this and other matters in great detail.</P>
      <P>Guidelines have been prepared on the Garda reserve force, which was raised by Senators Brian Hayes, Leyden, Mansergh, Glynn, Feeney and Cummins. I am sure the Minister will be amenable to coming to the House to speak about it and listen to what Senators have to say. I agree with Senator Brian Hayes that the Garda is responsible for upholding the law and the will of the Oireachtas. I am confident it will do so, as it has always done. Senator Cummins referred to the Minister&rsquo;s commitment to return to the House to outline his proposals on this matter. If he made that commitment, I am sure he will honour it.</P>
      <P>Having listened to the debate on the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na legislation, I noted Members of all parties were certainly in favour of the reserve force, although there were one or two exceptions. There were questions on training and how the force would be arranged.</P>
      <P>Senators Brian Hayes, O&rsquo;Toole and Norris raised the issue of rendition. Senator Norris pro<Col N="1443"/>posed an amendment to the Order of Business to the effect that we should take No. 26, motion 25 today. Senators O&rsquo;Meara, Ormonde, Quinn, Dooley and Hanafin also spoke about this matter.</P>

      <P>Senators Ryan, Finucane, Ormonde, Hanafin and others referred to road safety. I know that Senator Ryan has repeatedly raised some issues relating to trucks. Anyone who travels on dual carriageways in rainy weather is quite frightened by the speed of large trucks. There was a serious accident on the Naas dual carriageway yesterday morning. While I accept Senator Ryan&rsquo;s point about utterances on personal responsibility, that is a relevant matter. The issues of law enforcement, road standards and vehicle conditions also need to be considered. I heard this morning that if one wishes to get a driving licence in Australia, one has to get third party insurance. That seems to be a good way of ensuring that people are insured when they go on the roads. We should return to this matter, which we have debated in the past.</P>
      <P>Senators MacSharry, Cox, O&rsquo;Meara, Quinn, Mooney, John Paul Phelan and Bannon spoke about competitiveness. We should thank God that people are now able to get good wages.</P>

	<P>We should be pleased that they are paid well for working in good conditions. There are difficulties in manufacturing and agriculture, but they are the only two sectors in which the numbers of employees have decreased. There were record levels of job creation in 2005. Senator Quinn mentioned high added value, which is central to this debate. We have to change. There will be more job losses if we try to stay where we are. It is something we should discuss.</P>
      <P>Senators MacSharry and Coonan raised the issue of planning. Such matters can be considered during the debate on the Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Bill 2006.</P>
      <P>Senators McHugh and Glynn highlighted the National Youth Council of Ireland&rsquo;s report on the stereotyping of young people. It was ever thus. Older people over the generations, for as long as we can remember, have had a view on younger people and younger people have had a view on older people. I note that the report contains some concrete proposals to deal with the issue. It is something that the House could usefully examine.</P>
      <P>Senator Cox called for a debate on special needs education. We will see if that can be arranged. She also spoke about Great Southern Hotels. I understand that the Leader is endeav<Col N="1445"/>ouring to organise a debate on that matter in the House at the earliest possible opportunity.</P>
      <P>The issues of rendition and flights can be dealt with by organising a debate on the floor of the House after the reports have been examined and we have seen the Council of Europe&rsquo;s response. We can have a debate then.</P>

	<P>I strongly support what Senators Mansergh, Mooney and John Paul Phelan have said about the manner in which a very committed and active Green Party councillor was targeted. It is regrettable that something like this happened. The House is supporting her efforts to resist the type of people who conduct themselves in this manner.</P>
      <P>Senator Ulick Burke referred to rent increases. This evening Private Members&rsquo; debate on local government will give Senators an opportunity to debate such matters.</P>
      <P>Senator Glynn called for a debate on diabetes. I will see whether the T&aacute;naiste can come to the House to participate in a debate on that subject.</P>
      <P>Senator John Paul Phelan raised the issue of avian flu. I understand that a committee chaired by Professor Michael Monaghan, who is an expert in this area, is meeting today to discuss the <Col N="1446"/>matter. If the manner in which it managed the foot and mouth disease crisis of 2001 is anything to go by, I am confident that the Department of Agriculture and Food will be able to deal with this matter. I will make contact with the Department on behalf of the Senator with regard to that issue.</P>
      <P>Senator Feighan raised the issue of the undocumented Irish. Senators, among them Senator Mooney, have already expressed their support for measures to deal with this matter. I was very taken by a man&rsquo;s testimony this morning on the radio. He was coming home but his mother died shortly before he arrived in Ireland. I hope we show the same tolerance to people who come to live in this country as we hope the Americans will show to our people.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Fottrell report, an analysis of medical education in Ireland. This is the first time an inclusive review of this nature has been undertaken and it has been a worthwhile exercise. It provides a platform from which we can take stock and from which we can provide for differently structured access to a professional education that equips young professionals and disposes them towards continuous professional development when they enter employment.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Given the needs of society and ever-changing patterns evident in other professions, it is clear that a fresh approach to medical education is needed. Similar change is required in medical research and an extending knowledge base will call for ongoing reform in syllabi and curricula. It will call for other things too. It will call for a more diverse range of skills and understanding and it will call for a different sense of mission.</P>
      <P>Health issues are complex. The health service is struggling; costs are spiralling. However, we should not lose sight of the care of individual patients &mdash; something that should be at the centre of our thinking on health services. Good medical education and quality health care are inextricably <Col N="1448"/>linked and perhaps we have not always recognised this in the past. We must change the structure of medical education. The concurrent model for undergraduates has served a purpose and may do so in the future, though in a more limited way. A consecutive graduate/postgraduate model must be introduced immediately to multiply access routes to the profession. Multiple access routes will widen the perspectives and approach of medical practitioners. Different perspectives shared will deepen professional conviction and foster diversity.</P>
      <P>Alternative access to the medical profession is, ironically, a health issue because it is not healthy for 16 year olds to be deciding on careers in medicine while pressure to score maximum CAO points to secure a place in medicine is deeply unhealthy for even the most well adjusted school leavers. In addition, the single route for entry to medicine is not a healthy prospect for the patients who the emerging doctors will ultimately treat.</P>
      <P>Difficulty of access to and, indeed, exit from the medical profession does not make for a healthy professional community. It is time to set aside all orthodoxies and think more creatively about medical education. Medical education should not be the preserve of universities or the establishment. The professionalisation of nursing is a case in point. Nurse education departments have been established at both universities and institutes of technology around the country. In my constituency of Waterford, the nurse education programme at Waterford Institute of Technology attracts students of outstanding quality and commitment from across Ireland and overseas. The facilities provided in the learning environment there are particularly advanced and impressive.</P>
      <P>On the wider issue of funding in higher education, there are two strands, namely, how much we spend as a country and how we spend it. Recent attempts to play catch-up in terms of the amounts we spend are welcome but what is often forgotten is that investment in higher education is investment in the future and a vote of confidence in our young people. Inadequate funding is a problem but so too are inadequate distribution mechanisms. State funding for organisations should not be a given. It must be competed for by higher education institutions, especially those seeking financial support beyond minimum and core requirements.</P>
      <P>Greater coherence with regard to objectives and measuring outcomes and purpose is also needed. We must differentiate the scales of funding for various initiatives so they better match strategic goals at regional and national level. I would like to see an extension of the specialised funding programmes already in place. Advancing national objectives and goals and building a better society should be key bases on which we judge funding bids from the institutions. We must <Col N="1449"/>ensure that medical education and, more widely, the entire higher education community is steering a true course in specific directions while not neglecting other imperatives.</P>
      <P>Reference was made by Senator Ormonde during the debate to the question of a university for the south east. I lend my support to that quest. There are fewer graduates in the south east than in any other region of the country. A comprehensive submission has been made by Waterford Institute of Technology for its upgrading to university status. I fully support that submission, as do all politicians and the electorate in the south east, which is the only region without a university.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanKenneally"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, to the House. I am glad to have the opportunity to speak in the debate. The Minister of State will be getting the point in stereo, so to speak, as I intend to reiterate the points made by my colleague from Waterford, Senator Cummins. In contributing, I will concentrate on the issue of funding, particularly with regard to how Waterford has been discriminated against. However, at the outset I will refer to the Fottrell report.</P>
      <P>I agree with the thrust of the Fottrell report with regard to increasing the number of medical students, particularly Irish students. The system contains a high proportion of non-EU medical students. These students are very welcome and no-one has a problem with them. We are delighted to see them come to Ireland and hope they will continue to do so. However, we need more Irish students in the system because medical professionals, particularly those who go on to become consultants, tend to travel the world to gain experience before eventually settling down. It is more likely they will settle down in their country of origin than anywhere else. For that reason, it is important that we have more Irish medical students, who will hopefully enter our medical system, which would be a major help to our hospitals. More and more funding is being pumped into the health services but, unfortunately, difficulties remain. This is one step which will help to resolve the problems.</P>
      <P>I agree with the new methods of medical training. The necessity to achieve 600 points in the leaving certificate in order to study medicine leads to a rat race. It is now proposed that there should be different means of entry. We all know people who would not be able to achieve such high leaving certificate results but would probably make great doctors. I welcome the new methods and hope they will be put in place at an early date.</P>
      <P>I recently considered the statistics with regard to third level funding in the various cities. Of the five cities, I will exclude Dublin because it is so much bigger than Cork, Galway, Limerick and Waterford that it should not be included in any <Col N="1450"/>comparison. In 2005 recurrent expenditure was &euro;154.6 million in Cork, &euro;114.9 million in Galway, &euro;86.2 million in Limerick and &euro;33.5 million in Waterford. That funding goes into the local economies and it is easy to see that Waterford city lags behind in this regard as, of the four gateway cities, just 8.6% of expenditure goes to it.</P>
      <P Just="Left">In the same year, capital expenditure was &euro;34 million in Cork, &euro;13.8 million in Galway, &euro;11.4 million in Limerick and &euro;1.7 million in Waterford. Therefore, just 2.8% of capital expenditure went to Waterford, which is not good enough. I realise that capital expenditure can vary from year to year because projects may be at their peak one year and taper the next. However, if one examines the figures for any past year, the other three cities were always ahead of Waterford in terms of expenditure.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The most important figure is recurrent expenditure because it relates to the amount going into the economy of those cities every year. Waterford lags badly behind because it does not have a university of the south east and, as a result, the city and the region suffer.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Most people believe the south east to be a prosperous region. That is not the case. The latest data from the Central Statistics Office suggest that the <i>per capita</i> income in the south east is 88% of the national average. The only region with a lower percentage is the Border region.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Waterford Chamber of Commerce recently commissioned a study by Goodbody Economic Consultants which tried to establish the current economic performance of the south east and identify where action is needed, set out the role of third level institutions in enhancing national and regional economic performance, review the international literature to illustrate the direct and indirect impact of universities on the regions, estimate the current and future impact of a university on the region given a number of scenarios and illustrate the direct and indirect impact that a university could have on the region. Considering the starting point and the economic data, the performance is poor. For example, the number of admissions to university from Waterford people is 25% fewer than from the west. Some 22% of Waterford people continue with higher education compared with a national average of 30%.</P>
      <P>Such statistics must tell somebody something. We need a university and we will not attract private funding until such time as we have one. The Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Hanafin, has in the past trotted out the argument &ldquo;What&rsquo;s in a name?&rdquo;, and pointed to the position of the London School of Economics and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. That is a totally different scenario. Those institutes are able to attract huge research grants from the public sector and more particularly the private sector. As we do not have a university, we are not able to do that. People from the south east make <Col N="1451"/>up 11% of the country&rsquo;s population. We attract 0.69% of higher education grants. It is no wonder we tend to fall behind other cities.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>Another measure of what is available in an area relates to the types of jobs there. Managers and professionals in the workforce account for 40% of the total in Dublin, while in Waterford they account for 28%. Only 5% of all graduates find employment in the south east. Some of the conclusions from the report I have been referring to include that the south-east region has underperformed, as I have proved, relative to other regions through the 1990s. This is particularly so with regard to the west, yet we always hear the cry from the west about how it is suffering, and it is still an Objective One region.</P>
      <P>Significant additional investment is required if the south east is to participate fully in national economic growth. Underinvestment is reflected in comparatively low income levels, low levels of employment in the high tech sector and in business services. It is also reflected in relatively low educational qualifications among the region&rsquo;s population.</P>
      <P Just="Left">One of the key remaining areas of weakness is the low level of investment in higher education within the region. This weakness is particularly significant in the context of the knowledge economy that Ireland is striving to become. The attainment of a knowledge economy is now a key policy goal at EU, national and regional levels. The development of a university within the south east is a key policy objective for the region. The role and resources that a university would bring to the region would lead to the creation of over 700 jobs over the next five years. They would generate an additional &euro;32 million within the local and regional economy. The region would have a substantial new driver of economic development.</P>
      <P>Many countries throughout the world have initiated substantial regional development as a result of creating a university. Examples include Denmark, Sweden, Austria, Poland and Finland. Higher education participation, attainment and accessibility would increase with the provision of a university, and this would translate into the south east being a more attractive region for inward investment. The resourcing of research and development would attract substantial funding from national and international sources and provide a flow of new technologies and innovation into the region. Commercialisation of these activities would result in new knowledge industries emerging in the south east.</P>
      <P>A university would instil a sense of pride in the region and provide a renewed source of cultural identity and development. The downward trend in economic and social performance would be redressed, and by increasing the attractiveness of the region for inward investment, the area could contribute more substantially to the national economy. The university would have greater <Col N="1452"/>flexibility in dealing with the needs of the region. It would attract new partnerships and a new range of investments, and it would create a potential for private funding and a critical mass impact. The university could rely more on private funding and reduce the dependency on the Exchequer, thus contributing at national level while creating a more autonomous learning region. What is good for the south east will be good for the State.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, to the House. One of the reasons I wish to speak today is to apologise to the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Hanafin, for a mistake I made in a debate on primary education last week. I misread the amendment to a motion and did not realise the amount of funding that the Department was giving to the particular tasks I was discussing. This was related to English language teaching for immigrants. After I had spoken, I realised that a large amount had been allocated to it. I was incorrect and I apologise. I ask Deputy Brian Lenihan to pass my apologies to the Minister.</P>
      <P>I wish to discuss one particular topic, namely, the funding of third level education. Senator Norris will discuss the Fottrell report. I appreciate and welcome the new funding which has been allocated to third level education. This is a change to what has been done in the past. I do not wish to be accused of looking a gift horse in the mouth, but there are a number of caveats to the issue.</P>
      <P>The funding is at the level where it should have been to begin with, but the new approach should be sustained. Education is not an area where a tap can be turned on from year to year and turned off at other times, according to the circumstances of the economy. A stop-go scenario is all wrong. The reason I mention this is because we have had a recent example of stop-go in action. I hope it is a lesson from which we can learn.</P>
      <P>In the retrenchment made by the Government after the 2002 election, third level funding suffered severe cuts. The vitally important programme for research in third level institutions, a long-term project, was starved of funds for more than a year. That pause in research funding had a devastating impact on our reputation in the wider academic world. Having attracted worldwide attention by our decision to generously fund research, we then squandered the advantage by pulling in our horns almost before the projects had got off the ground.</P>
      <P>A second caveat is that this new level of funding is still not all which is required. It is only large in comparison with what has gone before. With regard to the size of the challenge facing us, it is not nearly enough. I hope the same courage <Col N="1453"/>which led the Government to make the recent decision will carry it forward to when it emerges that a world-class third level system will require funding in excess of what is envisaged at this stage.</P>
      <P>A third caveat is that funding should not be restricted to the necessary science-based disciplines. I yield to nobody in my enthusiasm for investing in science-based research. However, I would like to go back to the old thinking in what is the traditional concept of a university, back to the ideas of Cardinal Newman relating to an ollscoil. In this place, by definition, everything is taught and knowledge is pursued not just for the economic benefits that it can bring, but for its own sake. That concept is necessary to produce future generations of rounded people. This is the type of education written about by Newman 150 years ago in Ireland. This would produce roundly educated people, not just technicians who know of nothing outside their own specialisation.</P>
      <P>Above all we should remember that our third level institutions are and must remain more than just glorified technical schools. While we make sure we are strong in the technical disciplines that will determine our economic future, we must not forget there is a wider picture, which defines us as a civilised society.</P>
      <P>I have one last point as I know Senator Norris wishes to speak. At the debate on primary education last week, two figures caught my attention. One was the pupil-teacher ratio, which is now 17:1. I thought this was wonderful. However, it was later revealed that class sizes had been reduced to 25. I did not understand the discrepancy until I realised that approximately a third of a teacher&rsquo;s time at primary level, and probably elsewhere, is not directed at teaching alone. We should be aware that in third level education, research is required into science and into issues that will enable universities to produce rounded citizens. I welcome the funding that has been allocated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank my colleague, Senator Quinn, for giving me a few minutes of his time. I agree with his statements, which related principally to the general question of third level funding. He invoked the name of the late Cardinal Newman and his idea of a university. I will consider a more specific point, namely, the impact of the Fottrell report.</P>
      <P>I am glad the Minister has seen fit to implement most of the proposals contained in the Fottrell report. I heard Professor Fottrell on the radio not long ago welcoming this himself. My colleague Senator Henry and I, on advice from constituents in the University of Dublin, have raised a serious question. It is absurd that we are training in our schools more medical students from abroad than Irish medical students. In fact we were allowing foreign students to enter medical schools with lower points, which meant that Irish students who ought to have qualified for <Col N="1454"/>places were disadvantaged at a time when there was an insufficient supply of doctors to service the needs of the community. That was an absurd situation and I am glad the Minister has started to address it.</P>
      <P>The intake of students is to more than double from 305 to 725, which is welcome. The increase received a strong welcome from distinguished medical correspondents, including Dr. Muiris Houston of <i>The Irish Times</i>, who had previously asked how the &euro;200 million would be spent to address the medical manpower needs in our society. The Fottrell report estimated that we needed between 700 and 740 students. The Minister has set a target in the middle of that range so she is doing exactly what was suggested.</P>
      <P>The starkness of the situation is illustrated by the chairman of the Irish College of General Practitioners, to whom I always listen because the public generally encounters the medical profession at GP level, which is the bedrock of the medical service. He estimates that we need to produce at least one GP every fortnight, which is a large number. He also points out that approximately one third of current GPs will retire in the next 15 years so we will need to produce at least 150 family doctors each year. It was an urgent situation but has been largely addressed and I look forward to seeing the implementation of this report.</P>
      <P>Before I proceed to the significant question of postgraduate work in medicine, I will deal with the proposal to introduce aptitude tests within the next two years. I would like more information but I am attracted to the idea because the personality of a doctor is very important. It is not quite as important for a surgeon because patients have usually been knocked out by the time they get to that stage but if a person is sick, depressed, distressed or abashed, a good manner is very important.</P>
      <P>This has been addressed in various ways. In the old days being a doctor was almost a family profession, passed on from one generation to the next, and there were good arguments for that because a child will pick up the bones of a trade from parents. The Minister of State is nodding and smiling and he should know what I mean because his family has made a fine contribution to politics and continues to do so.</P>
      <P>Universities usually noted family connections and maybe required an interview. We are such a small society and given to gombeenery, if I may use a word that caused such distress in the House earlier, which means that there is often a problem if people are perceived as gaining an advantage from their family connections but that is wrong. To create a rigid, arithmetical meritocracy would also be wrong. In principle, I am attracted to the idea of an aptitude test but such tests can be risky. I have undertaken two intelligence tests. In the first I &ldquo;out-Einsteined&rdquo; Einstein but in the second I should have been closeted in a padded cell.</P>

	<P>Graduate students are an important element of university life but they need funding because many who wish to proceed to postgraduate research in medicine after their first degree leave Ireland for more exciting research prospects and better funding overseas. To retain their talent we need to focus on funding.</P>
      <P>I will also raise the Buttimer report, which is important because it deals with consultants. It states that we need to shift from a consultant-led system to a consultant-providing system and I agree with that point. That must be considered but it would need to feed into the system at least 1,000 extra consultants and that will take money. Thank God we have the money to adequately fund this important area of our life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State. I am immediately reminded of the important contribution his father made when Minister for Education in the late 1960s, not merely in implementing free second level education as announced by Donogh O&rsquo;Malley but also in setting up the institutes of technology and the NIHEs. A very important factor in our economic success has been the expansion of both second and third level education, particularly since the late 1980s, which was initiated by another relative of the Minister of State when she was Minister for Education. The large-scale expansion served economic as well as social purposes.</P>
      <P>As the heads of universities are apt to remind us at regular intervals there are considerable financial constraints, despite the fact that third level institutions benefited from an enormous amount of capital investment, particularly over the past ten years. I am glad to say that investment continues, some of it from private sources and some from public. There is clearly deep dissatisfaction with the decision of the rainbow coalition to abolish fees. It was not a very bright decision but it is a political reality and is not reversible, no matter what arguments are put forward. It is like the arguments made in the 1980s that all objective reasoning demanded the reintroduction of domestic rates. The abstract arguments may have been very cogent but it was and remains utterly impossible to do so politically.</P>
      <P>In the competition for resources it is not always obvious that third level education has a higher priority than, for example, first level, even though the <i>per capita</i> spending at third level is already much more than at first level. Financial constraints cause incredible insecurity among those interested in pursuing a university or lecturing career and I have sympathy with such people, some of whom are members of my wider family.</P>
      <P>Relatively speaking, the income and status of university staff have fallen, possibly as a result of <Col N="1456"/>expansion. It is not surprising that a situation has developed throughout western Europe over the past 30 or 40 years, whereby the best academics at a certain stage in their careers cannot resist the better funding opportunities on the other side of the Atlantic. Not only Ireland but the entirety of Europe is at a disadvantage in this matter, although various countries have tried to address the problem in different ways. For example, across the water, problems are arising with third level unions over the issue of top-up fees.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Research councils for sciences and humanities, which are our means of addressing this issue, have undoubtedly brought about improvements to the situation through requiring people to compete for projects and funding. We also have a reasonably healthy situation in that a substantial amount of private research funding is available to colleges and universities. Many institutions are well geared towards applying for EU grants and to foundations such as the Wellcome Trust for scientific research moneys.</P>
      <P>However, the problem remains that, because their employees can easily move to other countries or earn more in the private sector, Irish universities have to compete. Science, in particular, is a universal field. A lot of thought is required on how we can become more competitive and the Minister for Education and Science is concerned that only one lrish university appears in the <i>Financial Times&rsquo;</i> top 100 list of third level institutions. People who have done well out of this economy &mdash; the commercial barons of the 20th and 21st centuries &mdash; should be encouraged, like medieval barons, to fund substantial facilities that will bear their names in perpetuity. However, the right to bear a name should not be sold too cheaply by colleges because only a limited number of such opportunities arise. This practice is ingrained in the United States, where companies and rich benefactors fund facilities all the time.</P>
      <P>Medical education here has been more focussed on earning money for colleges than on training doctors to work and serve in Ireland. Hence, a large percentage of students in some of the royal colleges come from outside the country and will probably not remain here. It is a question of balance.</P>
      <P>High points are not necessarily related to an aptitude for becoming a doctor. The system of selection has been very crude to date, so I welcome the proposals for change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeMcHugh"><NameTxt>Mr. McHugh</NameTxt>
	<P><?oasys _ic14- ?>Any attempt to address the anomalies in the supply of professionally trained doctors or the restrictions at entry level, including the Fottrell report, has to be welcomed. In my first year of teaching at secondary level, I encountered a student who excelled in her first year with A grades in every subject. Already ahead of her peers at that stage, she continued to perform well throughout second and third years and received top grades in the junior certificate. From first year, the student&rsquo;s goal was <Col N="1457"/>to study medicine, an ambition she fulfilled after getting maximum points in the leaving certificate. However, after studying medicine in Trinity for a year, she realised it was not the course she wanted to do.<?oasys _ic0- ?></P>
      <P>My story is an example of the carrot and stick faced by many people. Is the expectation of points a sufficient reason to apply for dentistry, veterinary or general medicine? Are we using the correct motivational tools for people entering particular disciplines? Students often choose these subjects, or are pushed to do so by their parents, simply because know they will get the requisite points. That is not a good enough tool in terms of getting people into appropriate specialties.</P>
      <P>It is important, not only at university level but also at secondary level, that a greater emphasis be placed on progression. Career guidance teachers have a restrictive mandate and there may only be two of them in a school of 500 pupils, which is insufficient to give one-on-one supervision to students&rsquo; progression in terms of finding out where their talents lie, what they want to do and where they want to go. More tools should be available at secondary level to help students decide their futures.</P>
      <P>The number of undergraduate places for medical students will increase by 250 over the next four years and by 40 in this year alone. Will there be associated costs for these courses and, if so, will those costs be prohibitive for some students? Senator Mansergh hit the nail on the head with regard to the financial insecurities experienced by people who wish, for example, to pursue six year courses in medicine or dentistry. In terms of the announcement of &euro;200 million, where is the costing for this figure? The figure of &euro;200 million has been thrown out for these extra courses. Is there any breakdown of the proposed expenditure or a timeframe for it? The Government is good at making announcements and I recognise the ability of Fianna F&aacute;il and the PDs to come up with fantastic spin. The Transport 21 plan was not costed and had no timeframe and this &euro;200 million is the same. We do not know how the figure was calculated or how it will be spent. This Government will have a legacy of spin. We are not managing the money generated by the hard working taxpayer properly.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The cap on Irish students was addressed in the Fottrell report. We put 750 students through medical training every year but there is a cap of 300 on the number of Irish students. We facilitate 450 students of non-EU origin. I am not arguing against that, we should facilitate it because it generates income for universities. We should, however, raise the cap for Irish students and facilitate secondary students by reducing the number of points necessary for entry. That would allow good Irish students who are capable of being good doctors to come through. Universities face problems in funding, they are at a disadvantage and they get extra revenue from non-EU <Col N="1458"/>students so it is important they continue to be able to take such students in but the cap on the numbers of Irish students should be raised.</P>
      <P Just="Left"><?oasys _ic14- ?>We do not need another task force on rolling this out, another aspirational plan from consultants. There are templates to facilitate this process, such as the computer package at the University of Limerick. We should not waste extra resources on consultants, reviews and task forces.<?oasys _ic0- ?></P>
      <P>The document contains the target of 2,500 extra consultants in the next ten years. It would be great to see it but is it achievable? I hope the figure has not just been plucked from the sky.</P>
      <P>I welcome this report. Elements of it are vague but that can be addressed. My colleague in the D&aacute;il will table a series of parliamentary questions in the next few weeks to elicit more information. It is important that we review the holistic aspect of why students want to enter medicine, how they go about it and the processes involved. At present, entry is not based on merit. There are constraints for families who cannot afford the substantial expense involved in going to medical school.</P>
      <P>These are the challenges. We must look at the entire process, not just at the student who has just completed his or her leaving certificate, but at the child leaving national school. We should look at the help offered to students who want to be doctors. Students who do not get grade A results in first and second year in the junior certificate have already decided they are not capable of being a doctor. It should not be a race because it will turn into a race to the bottom if we do not look for the most capable people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and the opportunity to make a few points on third level education rather than the Fottrell report.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator McHugh about the points system. When I was doing my leaving certificate, points were very high for medicine. At that time, contemporaries of mine who achieved maximum points automatically entered medical school. It was not because they had a gift or were particularly suited to the profession, but because peer or family pressure and the points system dictated they do medicine. The net result was that those more suited to life in a library were studying to be surgeons while those working in a library should have been studying surgery.</P>
      <P>There is an ongoing review of the senior cycle and the syllabi at leaving certificate level. That is necessary because it should place a greater focus on a child&rsquo;s strengths and work with the child to ensure he or she plays to them. It should not be about getting 100% in an exam.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Tip O&rsquo;Neill said all politics is local and I will use this opportunity to speak about the institute of technology in Sligo and the ITs in general. It is some time since we have heard about the Bill to amend the Regional Technical Colleges <Col N="1459"/>(Amendment) Act that will place institutes of technology under the auspices of the Higher Education Authority. Why has the legislation not progressed? It would give the institutes of technology in Sligo and Letterkenny the greater autonomy they require if they are to perform to their potential, facilitate the development of institutions similar to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and allow the institutes of technology to respond to the many changing needs of business. I ask that the Bill&rsquo;s progress through the House be accelerated.</P>
      <P>On funding for science and technology, Sligo is grateful for the investment it has been allocated to refurbish existing facilities. However, despite having bucked the national trend by increasing the number of science students, both school leavers and adults, the Sligo Institute of Technology has not received additional funding to accommodate the extra numbers. I appeal for further funding for this purpose.</P>
      <P>On the Order of Business I called on the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin, to develop a strategy for the north west. Traditional manufacturing in the region is in freefall, with a number of high profile closures in recent months and many more in recent years. While I do not wish to distract from the bad news in Ballivor, my focus is on the north west which has experienced many more job losses <i>per capita</i> in recent times than other areas.</P>
      <P>Significant additional investment must be made through the core budgets of the institutes of technology in applied research and technology transfer. The Minister of State may be surprised to learn that the Sligo Institute of Technology received only 2% of Science Foundation Ireland funding this year and just 6% of funding allocated under the programme for research and third level investment, PRTLI. If we are serious about tackling problems in the traditional manufacturing sector, we will need to invest substantially more in applied research and technology transfer in the institutes of technology. With proper investment the Sligo and Letterkenny institutes of technology could be developed into centres of excellence in this field.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and I am pleased to have an opportunity to speak on the Fottrell report. I discussed undergraduate medical education with Professor Fottrell, who has produced an excellent report, many years ago when he was president of University College Galway. We are all aware of the difficulties arising from the high points required to gain entry to medicine and the large number of foreign students studying medicine here. I am also aware of the economic implications of the latter.</P>
      <P>For some time, the Government and universities have examined alternative approaches to undergraduate medical training. For example, <Col N="1460"/>graduate entry, which has been available in veterinary medicine for some years, was recently introduced for medicine. This is a worthwhile approach in that it also includes an aptitude test and interview.</P>
      <P>Senators raised the shortage of medical practitioners, an issue also highlighted by the Irish Medical Organisation. The problem is particularly acute in rural areas and is likely to worsen as more general practitioners retire. A GP who chooses to live in a rural community makes an advance commitment to the community and, as such, should be provided with assistance, including additional resources to develop a practice.</P>
      <P>Since the introduction of out-of-hours GP services, it has become clear that some of the catchment areas are too large. The reasons for this are a shortage of GPs and a lack of resources. The Westdoc region, as it is known, has a good structure in place, with drivers in vans and jeeps available to drive general practitioners to patient visits. Sometimes, however, doctors are required to travel excessive distances. People living in Galway, for example, should not have to depend on a service operating out of counties Mayo or Roscommon or <i>vice versa</i>. Will the Department consider introducing new centres to reduce the distances between patients and doctors? The co-operative system works well but catchment areas are too large and doctors must travel too far. Ten years ago, doctors worked on rota every third or fourth weekend. This has changed and they are now driven to patients. In the western region one can at least notify the Health Service Executive of problems with the out-of-hours GP service, whereas the service is privatised in some areas, which is the wrong approach.</P>
      <P>Hospital doctors work hard and would have a more structured life if they worked regular working hours. General practitioners who participate in the out-of-hours service must work long hours and be prepared to get out of bed in the middle of the night to care for patients.</P>
      <P>We all agree that the points required to enter medical school are high but, as Senator Norris noted, the current system provides an objective assessment. It is possible other forms of assessment would be inferior. Nevertheless, the high number of points required demonstrates that the numbers of entrants to medicine and doctors in our hospitals are too low. I support the Fottrell report&rsquo;s recommendations in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share time with Senator Brian Hayes, Maurice Hayes and Daly. The points made by Senator MacSharry concerning his region and the job losses in County Meath are closely related to the point made in the most recent budget about developing co-operation between third level institutions. It is crucial for future competitiveness that this sector is able to develop research and development at doctoral level. The Fottrell report&rsquo;s proposals on third level education must be implemented. I ask the <Col N="1461"/>Minister of State to note this and ensure the institutes of technology are given a central role in this regard. I will develop my argument on this issue on another occasion.</P>
      <P>On the medical issue, what is the position with regard to a solid proposal made by the University of Limerick to increase intake to the colleges next year? I hope university or third level politics are not the reason it appears to have been pooh-poohed.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The Ministers for Education and Science and Health and Children gave a commitment, when launching the Fottrell report, to make improvements in the area of oversight of medical education, intake and co-ordination. Ensuring improved governance and accountability by the joint delivery of medical education across both the education and health settings requires that an oversight body be established immediately. When deciding on the intake into medical schools we must recognise that a significant number of women doctors, in particular, practise for fewer than seven years. We should therefore allow a higher level of entry to compensate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator O&rsquo;Toole for allowing me to share some of his time. I wish to make two points about the funding of third level education. The introduction of top-up fees in the UK will have a detrimental effect on the difference between Southern and Northern universities. It will not apply in Scotland owing to a decision of its local devolved Government. I understand that top-up fees will be reintroduced in Northern Ireland, which will give a significant financial windfall to colleges in the North in terms of research and educational opportunities. I flag the issue for the Government as one we will need to address at some stage. A comparative disadvantage in funding will exist between Northern and Southern institutes and colleges.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I now come to an old chestnut of mine. The total economic transfer that the Government gives to every 18 to 23 year old in full-time education is approximately &euro;120,000, which is a significant sum. Someone going straight to work and bypassing the college route never gets a penny from anyone. I have always argued for an education credit that would be available to be drawn down at any time in a person&rsquo;s life. It is impossible for someone of 25 or 26 to go back to college because of the financial cost and the difficulty in getting time off work, which needs to be factored into our educational planning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrMauriceHayes"><NameTxt>Dr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I am grateful to colleagues for allowing me to contribute. I also believe that at some stage we will need to revisit the issue of fees and funding. However, I wish to deal with the medical proposals. It is a pity that the very sensible proposal in the Fottrell report that people who have completed a primary degree should move on to medicine is immediately <Col N="1462"/>negated by regarding them as postgraduate degrees for which they must pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrMauriceHayes"><NameTxt>Dr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>This problem could be overcome by giving them a bursary if they undertook to work as GPs or elsewhere in the public sector.</P>
      <P>I too am concerned about the concentration on a high number of points. I welcome that the Minister has said that we will have some system for people with more than 450 points. We may as well have a lottery as any other system. No system can predict who will be a good doctor as there is such a range in the profession. I would favour establishing another medical school, perhaps in Limerick, which would concentrate on public health and preventive health among GPs and others in primary care. The other medical schools are all built on the curative model.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister of State to consider the issue of clinical placements for these people, which will be quite difficult. Private hospitals that ride on the back of the public sector in so many places should bear their cost of training through providing teaching places. I ask the Minister of State to consider medical students who get clinical practice across the Border &mdash; in both directions. Hospitals in Derry and Newry and others of which I am aware are very glad to take students, particularly from Galway, and it would be a pity if any changes we made were to inhibit that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly"><NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>The report we are discussing sets out the foundations for medical training and research for the foreseeable future, which I welcome. In response to the point made by Senator Brian Hayes, the working party visited the United Kingdom and had discussions with the personnel involved in the area. It is important to be aware of what is happening in other areas. A delegation from Sweden also attended. The report is very detailed and informative and requires action. In her opening speech on the debate, the Minister indicated the Government was considering a new research plan to be established as soon as possible.</P>
      <P Just="Left">During the debate on the Disability Bill we highlighted the problems of getting speech therapists, occupational therapists and a range of personnel needed to help out with children&rsquo;s special needs. While this is late in the debate, during that debate a few months ago, indications were given about the situation in Limerick, as Senator O&rsquo;Toole has stated. I support the Senator in this regard. We need to expedite the intake into Limerick University of speech therapists and language therapists. While it is possible to introduce plans, without the personnel it is impossible to implement them. I encourage the Minister of State to press ahead with that development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank <Col N="1463"/>Senators for their very interesting contributions on the Fottrell report, which I will draw to the attention of the Minister. In response to a specific question by Senator McHugh, implementation of the Fottrell report up to 2013 is estimated to cost &euro;200 million. Clearly the State is making a very substantial investment in this area and it is important for us to get a good return. I agree with the Senators who made many other suggestions as to how the quality and character of our medical education could be improved.</P>
      <P>The investments and changes in medical education and training outlined by the Minister should result in an enhanced student opportunity, a more streamlined quality medical education and stronger oversight ultimately leading to improvements in patient care. However, whatever decisions we make in this area must reflect the changing face of general practitioner services. The introduction of the strategic innovation fund, seeking to address third level educational reform, should ensure that Ireland continues to develop as a knowledge economy in a very competitive global environment. The fund enables the higher educational system to achieve a new level of performance that will create a platform for effective return on the wider investments to be made until 2013, including investment under the ambitious forthcoming national research plan.</P>
      <P>I was very interested in the contributions of Senators Brian Hayes and Maurice Hayes. In the important ongoing discussions between the rainbow parties, I hope that Senator Brian Hayes will raise his views about the famine of funds for third level education. Our third level institutions are unable to attract funds from abroad because of the fundamentally foolish decision taken by the rainbow Government to abolish third level fees.</P>

	<P>The Government could do something about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is widely known and perhaps in this House these matters can be adverted to. However, I must confirm in the next breath that the Government has no proposals to change this position. Senator Maurice Hayes also raised the issue. It is of course widely accepted in third level education circles that this is the reality. It is very serious for the future of our higher education <Col N="1464"/>institutions. In the international league they are falling behind institutions that are in a position to attract private funding. No institution is in a position to attract private funding when investors are told that it is a free service for everyone. While we may face up to the issue in a decade&rsquo;s time, there is no immediate commitment to address it.</P>
      <P>The infrastructure planned under the &euro;900 million capital envelope forms another part of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to this sector, under which campus facilities will be improved. The Minister is anxious to make progress in higher education participation. Since the introduction of free second level education the average national participation at third level education among second level school-leavers has grown from 11% to approximately 54%. The gap between those who do not progress to higher education and those who do is diminishing with each generation. Recent surveys indicate significant improvements in participation rates from those in lower socio-economic groups. This progress has not occurred by chance and has been due to a number of key targeted programmes and interventions. Funding of access measures, including the student support schemes, has increased from &euro;98 million in 1998 to &euro;242 million in 2006. That was always the way to go in this area. Additional funding has been made available under various targeted initiatives by the Higher Education Authority. The rates of grant have increased in that period, with the highest maintenance rate increasing, with the introduction of a special rate of maintenance, from &euro;2,098 in 1998 to &euro;5,355 in 2005.</P>
      <P>The institutes of technology were established some decades ago to respond to an economy link need that was not addressed at the time. They have done a first class job in that regard. Since becoming autonomous third level institutions in 1993, the institutes have undergone a number of dramatic changes in terms of the range of courses offered, the increase in staffing of up to 68%, the increase in full-time student numbers which are up 51% and part-time students which are up 45%.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Following on that period of growth, the institutes are now facing new challenges. As part of the approach to modernisation and reform of the sector, the Government has approved the drafting of legislation to transfer responsibility for the day-to-day management of the institutes of technology from the Department of Education and Science to the Higher Education Authority. It has long been an ambition of the institutes to be under the Higher Education Authority rather than the reputedly heavy hand of the Minister and her officials. Legislation is now being prepared to give effect to that and it is intended that that new legislation will facilitate the development of a strategic approach to higher education within a unified policy and budgetary framework. It will also enable a greater devolution to the <Col N="1465"/>institutes to take place in regard to academic and management autonomy.</P>
      <P>I thank Senators for their contributions to what was a very useful debate. I am sure the Minister will have regard to the contributions of Senators.</P>

      <P el="5" FLI="0">I welcome the Minister, Deputy Roche, to the House and thank him for taking the opportunity to discuss local government issues. It is a topic that is close to my heart and one that has been central to the policies of the Progressive Democrats over the past 20 years.</P>
      <P>Our 2004 document restates clearly our commitment to, and ideas for, better local government for our society. As well as our policy implementation and initiatives in Government on national and international issues, the Progressive Democrats are working in local communities in a way that keeps us both accountable to and in touch with the electorate. We have 67 local area representatives and 29 able and committed councillors maintaining that link, which is an important one.</P>
      <P>Ireland has enjoyed unprecedented economic development in recent years. The Progressive Democrats in Government have pursued policies aimed at maintaining full employment, strengthening the competitive position of the economy, keeping taxes on labour low and focusing on the low paid, the elderly and the vulnerable.</P><Col N="1466"/>
      <P>Twenty years ago, when the Progressive Democrats were formed, unemployment was at 17%. We had both mass unemployment and mass emigration. In the same way these problems damaged local communities, our recent economic prosperity has transformed positively those local communities. The population has grown in every county, employment is up and standards of living have improved. That poses new and different challenges for Government, and local government in particular. There will always be challenges for people who want to see constant improvement for their country. There are challenges to deliver improved infrastructure and services.</P>
      <P>Our economic success encourages us to be even more ambitious. The Progressive Democrats believe we can address these challenges by taking small measures at local level as well as big ones at national level. Our ideas, hard work and dedication have shown that we can implement change at national level. The Government has shown itself to be committed to delivering progress in our local communities also, and that is to be welcomed.</P>
      <P>In that context, we call on the House in our motion to acknowledge the achievements of the Government in supporting the work and development of local authorities. We must voice our support for the 34,000 or so employees in local authorities who work in our communities to provide housing, planning, roads, water supply and sewage treatment. They develop incentives and controls to protect our rivers, lakes and air and limit noise. They provide recreation facilities and amenities and work locally in agriculture, education, health and welfare.</P>
      <P>The Progressive Democrats, with our Fianna F&aacute;il partners in Government, have provided &euro;2.94 billion in revenue for local authority services and initiatives in 2005. Income available to local authorities through the local government fund rose from &euro;797 million in 1999 to &euro;1.29 billion in 2005, an increase of more than 60% in six years. We in the Progressive Democrats work to promote the modernisation of local authorities to deliver a system that puts local government at the heart of our community. That will boost the overall economic, social and cultural development within our local communities.</P>
      <P Just="Left">This development is dependent on what is called &ldquo;better local government&rdquo;. The Better Local Government programme for change was published in December 1996 and set out a programme for the future development of local authority services. We must have optimum usage of resources, better customer service and increased efficiency in the use of those resources. We support improved financial management in local authorities and new systems to support the achievement of better value for money.</P>
      <P>Local authorities have a responsibility to ensure efficiency and value for money in their activities. I understand the Minister and his <Col N="1467"/>Department are actively involved on a range of fronts to ensure that objective is achieved and monitored. In particular, I welcome the first report on service indicators in local authorities, published in July last year, which details the performance of local authorities in 2004 in respect of 42 indicators of service.</P>
      <P>The Progressive Democrats in Government have also worked in co-operation with local authorities to see full implementation in 2004 of new financial management systems based on accrual accounting principles. These developments, in conjunction with the work of the value for money unit in the Department, the Department of Finance&rsquo;s guidelines in the public sector, and the public procurement procedures, are important and welcome.</P>
      <P>As I stated, local authorities are at the heart of service delivery in communities across the country. Local government has a major role in the provision and development of the country&rsquo;s physical infrastructure. A key element of that is water supply and wastewater and sewerage services. That is in the context of the economic development I set out earlier. The demand for water and sewerage services has increased significantly over the past 15 years. That surge in demand is a result of unprecedented growth in the economy.</P>
      <P>It is right that the House expresses its support for the Government and the Minister in pressing local authorities to get to construction as quickly as possible the schemes approved in the Water Services Investment Programme 2005-2007. Last month, the Minister, Deputy Roche, confirmed, first, that the amount of red tape involved in getting water and sewerage schemes through from design to construction has been reduced. Once councils receive preliminary sanction for a water or sewerage scheme costing up to &euro;5 million, they can now proceed to construction without any further clearance from his Department. Second, he called on local authorities to respond quickly by moving ahead urgently with the hundreds of projects for which funding has been allocated.</P>
      <P>The key element of the Minister&rsquo;s statement, from the Progressive Democrats&rsquo; point of view, was his recognition that local communities are anxiously awaiting those works. Much will be said about resources, value for money, planning, sustainable development etc. These are important factors but at the end of the day, people are waiting for this infrastructure. Local authorities must respond to that need and to the Minister&rsquo;s call.</P>
      <P>In December, the Water Services Investment Programme 2005-2007 set out a comprehensive schedule of new schemes to start over the next two years. The programme is made up of 899 projects with an overall capital value of &euro;5.1 billion.</P>
      <P>It makes provision for 59 ongoing major schemes, 193 new schemes to commence construction in 2006, 191 schemes to commence construction in 2007, and 196 schemes to advance <Col N="1468"/>through planning with a view to construction as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>In addition, grants to local authorities for water mains replacement and rehabilitation have increased from 75% to 90%. The Minister&rsquo;s intention is to encourage increased take-up of the funding available from the Department for such works in order to ensure the continuing quality and reliability of our public water supplies.</P>
      <P>The Minister can only announce the schemes and provide increased funds, but it is local authorities, controlled by all parties across this House, which must implement those plans. Consider the situation in my own constituency of Limerick West. Limerick County Council has been dragging its heels on the issue of new sewerage schemes in Adare, Patrickswell and Mungret. The people in these areas have a right to know the reason for the delay in commencing these schemes. Funding of &euro;9 million for those schemes was approved by the Minister in 2004, almost two years ago. Sanction to draw up contract documents was granted in February 2005.</P>
      <P>Given that the amount of red tape involved in getting schemes through from design to construction has been reduced, why then are we still being told the council is drawing up contract documents? Why is the local authority no nearer putting the schemes out to tender? All these questions remain while there is, for example, an obsolete scheme in Adare, where virtually raw sewage goes into the river and where development is at a standstill. Meanwhile the local authority tinkers with the idea of upgrading the current treatment plant, rather than pressing full steam ahead with the new scheme, which has been approved. Rather than tinkering with or upgrading treatment plants, such as the one in Adare, new schemes must proceed.</P>
      <P>County development plans are in place to set out the overall strategy for the proper planning and sustainable development in local authority areas. The legal basis for development plans is set out in the Planning and Development Act 2000. In the making and amendment of plans, local authorities are required to carry out widespread public consultation, adhere to strict timeframes and ensure consistency with other plans. This is as it should be. However, in the case of Adare, for example, any upgrade of the current scheme would be totally contrary to the council&rsquo;s county development plan and would breach the council&rsquo;s rules regarding distance from houses. If we are to have confidence as a society that future development will be both properly planned and sustainable, we must at least expect local authorities to adhere to those plans.</P>
      <P>In Limerick city, its environs, and across the county it is great to see co-operation by local authorities &mdash; working together to provide necessary infrastructure. I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s approval of more than &euro;54 million for Limerick schemes to start in 2006 and more than &euro;34 million for schemes to start 2007. This is an example <Col N="1469"/>of the significant funding being made available and should be acknowledged across the House.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding the correct criteria set out in development plans, local authorities must sensibly consider the provision of services and infrastructure on a regional basis, not just in their own area. For example, the National Roads Authority has 11 regional offices, concerned with infrastructure provision at a regional level. Local authorities may need to consider how two or three of them collectively serve the needs for the larger geographic area in terms of waste management for example. I would ask the Minister to consider this aspect in the future.</P>
      <P>Returning to water scheme development, other problems arise. In the absence of new sewerage schemes, certain developments cannot go ahead while others, tied into private treatment plants, are progressing. This is not satisfactory. Communities need the full capacity of new water schemes to cater for existing residents and the developments being proposed and planned. All applicants must be treated equally. In my own case, I have spoken at length with the council, but remain unconvinced that the drive and commitment is there to deliver the infrastructure needed in Adare, Patrickswell and Mungret and for the schemes to start this year. It is vitally important that local authorities progress schemes due to start in 2006 and 2007, and that national programmes are commenced and completed without delay. I ask the Minister to ensure this happens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the motion. I thank the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, for coming in to take this debate. Given that he is a busy man it would have been easy to have sent in his Minister of State. I endorse what has been said by my colleague, Senator Brennan, and put it in context.</P>
      <P Just="Left">As a country we have enjoyed unparalleled growth in recent years. Some 20 years ago when the Progressive Democrats were founded the unemployment rate was 17%, whereas now it is only a fraction of that and we are not faced with the prospect of people having to take the boat. We are in the happy position of looking to other countries to provide us with labour we cannot provide from within our community. While those people are welcome they have put demands and pressures on local authorities just as the growth has done, particularly in areas around Dublin. I would be more familiar with what has happened in Kildare where there has been exponential growth in recent years in terms of people coming to live in the county and the pressures on the infrastructure and the attendant pressures that brings to local authorities.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Companies such as Intel, Wyeth and Hewlett Packard have come to Kildare. The disposable household income in the county is greater than &euro;17,000 per annum and is above the disposable household income for the nation as a whole. The population has increased to 164,000 with the <Col N="1470"/>attendant increase in two seats in the county. As the Minister is aware from his own experience in Wicklow where he was a member of a local authority, this has put huge pressures on infrastructure and services, schools and so on.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I can recall vividly that 12 to 15 years ago when one tried to argue the case for a school extension one was told about demographics, that the population was declining and that there was no need for the extra facilities. Those of us in the counties near Dublin said that did not apply to us. Even then the population was increasing. There are pressures on waste disposal but there has been a huge improvement in that area as money is being put into these services. It was the case that local authorities were major polluters. I had an experience in my area where the local angling clubs successfully sued the local authority for pollution from the sewerage system. Frequently inadequacies in waste water treatment were given as reasons for not granting planning permission. That is much rarer than several years ago.</P>
      <P>I will not go into the area of nitrates and I am sure the Minister would prefer we left that issue to one side. Local authorities were more significant polluters than agriculture and were exempt under much of the legislation. That was not correct.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Recently Oireachtas Members had a meeting with the county manager in Kildare. There have been 27,000 separate planning applications in Kildare during the past ten years. That is obviously far more in terms of houses. There were 3,368 applications in 2005, of which 550 were domestic; 250 commercial; 1,000 were one-off and 136 were major residential developments. There is, as the Minister is aware, huge pressure on the planning departments. As there has been a major improvement compared with when I was a member of the local authority the appeal is that it would be provided with sufficient staff and sufficient expertise to deal effectively with these applications.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The increase in housing supply has been a key response to the range of housing needs. At the most recent meeting in Kildare, figures were presented to us by the county management people indicating that 312 houses are on site in the housing capital programme, pre-planning is to start in 2006 for 236 units and pre-planning of 170 is to start in 2007.</P>
      <P>There has been progress but I was disappointed to see the figures on social and affordable housing. In this regard, I would have expected Part V of the Act to have kicked in more significantly by this stage. Under the social housing heading there have been only 12 allocations, and under the affordable housing heading there have been only two allocations. These figures are much lower than anybody expected and, consequently, there seems to be something wrong.</P>
      <P>The other issue of significance concerns the considerable growth in housing development and the attendant road infrastructure problems. <Col N="1471"/>Increasingly, small county roads are being used as access roads to housing estates. Beautiful estates are being built and marvellous roads are constructed to their edges but at the end of these roads one hits what are like craters on the moon because of the building work.</P>
      <P>Consider the degree to which local authorities are vigilant about muck on the roads and dust on the roads in summer. If a farmer left mud on the roads after cutting silage or lifting beet, he would soon be told to clean up his act, and rightly so, yet it seems that some builders can do what they like. A ring road was being constructed around Newbridge recently and the local authority was very attentive to its responsibility to keep it in reasonable condition, but the same degree of attention is not evident where there are private builders involved.</P>
      <P>This leads on to the issue of enforcement. The worst offenders, who offend repeatedly, seem to get away with their actions, thereby undermining the whole system. Those who are compliant ask why they should comply when Micky Joe or builder X got away without doing so. I was made aware of the really surprising statistic that there were 800 complaints to Kildare County Council for alleged unauthorised development last year. This is a very significant number and, therefore, there needs to be a meaningful way to stop those who do not comply with the guidelines. In a recent case, in which a person erected an unauthorised extra storey on top of a development, the objectors had to go through the whole process with their case. By the time one does this, however, the developers have the blasted building built anyway. They seem to be able to get away with it.</P>
      <P>There is an insatiable appetite for water, which is understandable because householders need it, but an ever-increasing volume is being taken from the River Liffey. It has reached the point where it is unsustainable and the river is suffering badly. Many years ago I suggested to the county engineer of Kildare County Council that we could get our water from the Shannon on the basis that we have a way-leave all the way to that river in the form of the canal. I was told at the time that this was not technically possible, but, lo and behold, G&eacute;n&eacute;ral des Eaux produced a report on the Dublin water supply and mentioned my proposal as an option.</P>
      <P>Something meaningful will have to be done to find an alternative to the supply from Ballymore Eustace. Measures have been taken to stop the very significant leakages from the antiquated public system. Approximately one third of the water was being lost therefrom. Regardless of the measures being taken, the taking of water from the River Liffey is unsustainable and would not be tolerated in any environmentally aware society.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Local government should and could be the regarded as the bedrock of democracy, but instead it is the Cinderella of our demo<Col N="1473"/>cratic system. It is left short-changed and downtrodden by central government and with very little input into its present or future activities.</P>

	<P>Senator Bannon, without interruption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>The danger for local government is the perceived and, I fear, very real erosion of its independence and the persistence of the &ldquo;Dublin knows best&rdquo; mentality. Senator Dardis shares this mentality although he claims he is from a rural area.</P>
      <P>In a democracy, power should be devolved to representatives close to the people, who would address their issues, and those who have power and make decisions should be answerable and accountable to the people. Ireland is the only democracy in the developed world where most local authority powers and functions are delegated to non-elected officials by national Parliament.</P>
      <P>The democratic process, as it operates in our system, is remarkably different from that of cities in the US and across Europe, where local decision-making, including plebiscites, is the norm. Despite the aspirations of the Local Government Bill 2000 to improve local democracy by promoting the role of local representatives, what is happening in practice is further eroding their powers. The main aims of the Bill were as follows: to enhance the role of the elected member; support community involvement with local authorities in a more participative local democracy; modernise local government legislation and provide the framework for new financial management systems; and underpin generally the programme of local government renewal. Three years later, those aspirations proved to be mere aspirations, and the Local Government Bill 2003 proposed nothing new to make these aims a reality. The following areas were ignored and sidelined and have been ever since &mdash; future funding of local authorities; giving local authorities new powers to lead their communities; giving the authorities new technology to improve services, deliver budgets for the term of the council, calculated on the basis of needs; and improving the internal efficiencies of local authorities to deliver services. None was delivered.</P>
      <P>The 1971 Government White Paper on the reform of local government highlights the generally accepted Irish belief in the value of local government as a democratic institution. It states a system of local self-government is one of the essential elements of democracy. Under such a system, local affairs can be settled by local citizens or their representatives, namely, county councillors or town councillors, local services can be locally controlled and local communities can participate in the process of government and <Col N="1474"/>exercise the responsibilities of government. Local government exists, therefore, for democratic as well as practical reasons. One should try telling this to the current Government.</P>
      <P>I call on the Minister, Deputy Roche, to give adequate power to elected representatives on local authorities, who are closest to the citizens, to take decisions on day-to-day matters. I call on him to fulfil his commitment to provide adequate funding to local authorities, which have been totally underfunded since the abolition of rates. A major challenge that faces local government is to revitalise people&rsquo;s interest and involvement in local democracy. The independence of local authorities would enhance and extend their role within their communities. This should be a Government-driven process, but it is not such at present.</P>
      <P>Local authority funding must be equitable, transparent and practical. It is essential that the user-pays principle be implemented fairly in both the business and domestic sectors. In 1997, the Government abolished water charges for domestic users. While charges for the business sector have risen dramatically, the City and County Managers Association says an insatiable public demand exists for more and better services.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Central government contributed 63% of local authorities&rsquo; current expenditure in 1983, and this fell to 44% by 2004. The figures speak for themselves. Central control of funding is neither adequate nor efficient. The employers&rsquo; lobby group, IBEC, has called for local charges and rates on business, such as those imposed for waste disposal, to be capped at the rate of inflation and for reforms to be put in place to make local government more efficient.</P>
      <P>The inequity of local authority financing is a key issue that needs to be addressed if Ireland is to remain competitive. Hard-pressed local authorities have been forced to impose one stealth tax after another to make up for shortfalls in Government funding. Local authorities throughout the country have had to raise the rent on local authority housing for old age pensioners by up to &euro;14. Senator Ulick Burke highlighted this issue on the Order of Business this morning. The much-maligned taxpayer is suffering as a result of direct taxes which are imposed by the Government and stealth taxes which are driven by the Government. It is grossly unfair that people have had to tolerate at least 30 tax increases at the same time as savage cutbacks in areas like health, education, housing, social welfare, agriculture, F&Aacute;S schemes and youth schemes and severe increases in development charges.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFeighan"><NameTxt>Mr. Feighan</NameTxt>
	<P>When we speak about local authority funding, we need to consider the increases <Col N="1476"/>in the rates paid by many small businesses. As someone who comes from a small business background, I am aware that the small business sector is not what it used to be. We welcome the increase in competition in the sector. I appeal to local authorities not to see the sector as a easy target by continuing to increase rates. There has been an increase of 6% in rates in my local area. I am worried about insurance, water rates and many other hidden charges. I accept that rates have to be paid, but small businesses will not be able to survive if they continue to increase. Small businesses have been unfairly targeted over the years. I hope there will be a fair reform of the charges structure.</P>
      <P>I have a difficulty with the development charges which local authorities are allowed to impose. A charge of over &euro;6,000 is imposed in County Roscommon and charges of up to &euro;12,000 or &euro;14,000 are imposed in some other counties. It seems to me that the moneys which accrue from the charge are used as a slush fund by many local authorities, rather than being spent wisely.</P>
      <P>We are not getting value for money from the development charges. The local authority in my home county is trying to ring-fence the moneys from the charge to ensure that the funding which comes from a certain area is returned to that area. It is far too often the case that such funds are spent on new swimming pools or arts centres in county towns, rather than spent more democratically in the areas from which they accrue. Although a development charge of &euro;6,000 was imposed in respect of each of the 500 houses which were built in my home town, the town did not benefit from the funds being spent in the locality. While attempts are being made to bring about change in this regard, more should have been done when development charges were originally introduced to avoid such unfairness.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Much more could be done to bundle some of the many sewerage schemes which are being developed throughout the country. I do not suggest that such an approach would make the process more transparent, but it would make it much quicker. I accept that there is increased demand for sewerage schemes in certain areas because of the construction work taking place there, but I do not think such schemes are being completed fast enough. There seems to be too much red tape and rigmarole, of which we are all guilty. For example, the local Government Deputy or Senator might have to discuss the matter with various interest groups. The process should be much more transparent. If Fine Gael was in power, its representatives would do the same. The nod and wink approach to local sewerage schemes should be brought to an end because it is not right or proper.</P>
      <P>I would like to speak about the taking over by local authorities of housing schemes. I was contacted by a developer who built a housing estate some years ago that he might not have finished. I ask the Minister for the Environment, Heritage <Col N="1477"/>and Local Government to clarify whether he recently announced that local authorities will take over housing schemes which have not been finished after 12 or 14 years. The developer approached me because people living in the housing scheme in question are upset that many walls and sewerage facilities, etc., have not been finished. While the idea I have mentioned is good because it will help to overcome a great deal of hassle, I would like to know whether additional funding will be provided to local authorities. When I approached a local authority in Roscommon to discuss a small housing development, I was told the necessary finance was not available and it was not sure what was happening. If somebody takes action against one in a court of law, one says that one does not know much about it. I ask the Minister to give some further clarification in this regard so that I can sort out an issue in my local area.</P>
      <P>Senator Dardis spoke about affordable housing. I am aware that steps are being taken to ensure that more affordable housing is made available, but it does not appear to be very popular in my locality. People are availing of affordable sites and affordable houses are being bought by the local authority under Part V, but there is nothing better for young people than being able to buy affordable housing. They want to own and have pride in something that can be seen as an asset.</P>
      <P>We could do much more in respect of affordable housing. People are afraid to get involved in affordable housing schemes. I do not know what we can do to get people more interested because affordable housing is an excellent idea. It seems that people are happier to go directly to developers, even if that involves paying an additional &euro;50,000 or &euro;60,000 for an identical house. I am not sure whether local authorities or the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government are responsible for the low level of take-up of affordable housing schemes.</P>
      <P>Senator Dardis rightly stated that the quality and availability of water will be a problem in years to come. Successive Governments have threatened to drain the River Shannon, but to do so to increase the supply of drinking water to the east coast is a novel suggestion. Perhaps Senator Dardis will agree that we could kill two birds with a single stone in this manner.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFeighan"><NameTxt>Mr. Feighan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I would like to conclude by speaking about planning. We pride ourselves on our ability to hire planners and directors of planning services. The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is too often seen to interfere in the autonomy of local councils. We have to ask who watches the watchers. We work closely with planners and directors of planning, who take great pride in their expertise, by partici<Col N="1478"/>pating in pre-planning meetings, etc. The Department is employing people to overrule planners and thereby ignore local knowledge. I accept that we do not always get it right. I ask the Minister to look at this issue. It is not transparent when people in the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government overrule the knowledge and the professional decisions of planners and the planning departments of various councils.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the motion proposed by my colleagues. I commend Senator Feighan on his very constructive contribution. Senator Bannon was so negative that I thought he wanted to abolish local authorities. I am glad the motion mentions &mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>This Government has let down local government after all its years in power. Shame on it.</P>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;the &euro;2.94 billion in funding that was provided last year. The local government fund allocation for 2006 was &euro;874.5 million. There was also an increase in the road grant for 2006, with a &euro;24 million increase in County Galway alone and a 7% increase for Ballinasloe Town Council. Today, the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs announced an extra &euro;6 million for non-national roads in the CL&Aacute;R programme areas, with almost &euro;500,000 for Galway. Spending has been increased in the past few years and I am glad to see that.</P>
      <P>Local government has a very important effect on local communities. There are substantial resources given to local authorities to improve local communities. We are all familiar with the traditional role of the local authority, which was to build roads and houses, to keep the streets clean and to provide public lighting. However, the authorities are involved in many other areas now, especially in local government reform and in programmes of local government renewal. The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has been very pro-active in promoting that within each local authority.</P>
      <P>We often take local authority services for granted. It is only when the street lights are not working or when the water runs dry that we know there are problems. In Galway, we are trying to get water supplies from good local authority sources, as well as providing water for group water schemes. The quality of service is improving.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Senator Dardis pointed out that county managers are now meeting with Oireachtas Members, which is a very positive initiative. When meeting with a county manager, my experience has been to look at issues that are causing problems. Planning is still a problem. Some local authorities <Col N="1479"/>have prior notice of preplanning meetings and some are better than others. I have always thought that prior notice was a good way for Members to get information, although others have different views.</P>
      <P>Affordable housing should be promoted to a much greater extent. In County Galway, there is a designated team to help those who apply for affordable housing. Another initiative that deserves more recognition is the improvement in lieu of housing scheme, which allows mainly younger people to have repairs carried out to their house. Most of the schemes are for the elderly or for those with disability and are delivered either through the health board or through the local authority.</P>
      <P>There is a problem with housing estates not being finished and we have stressed this with our manager. Another related issue is when amenity areas are not provided. Estates are being built and there is increased funding for schools, child care units and shopping areas, but the amenity areas are often forgotten. Senator Feighan spoke about levies and some of the funds from these levies should be provided towards the community sports field. We need to have such facilities provided close to where we are living. For example, I have been working closely with a soccer club for the last few months, trying to get a particular sports field for them. The people who ran the club finally decided to use their own field, but they will not get planning permission to develop a stand or lighting because it is a bit too far from the town. Developers have a role to play in the development of such amenities and I would like to see local authorities being more pro-active as well.</P>
      <P>I support the second part of the motion regarding the provision of water services investment programmes. A total of &euro;68 million has been provided to County Galway for schemes to start in 2006, while &euro;256 million will be provided next year. The Minister should look at the issue surrounding small sewerage schemes. Senator Feighan made a point on bundling and it is a good idea to have schemes bundled together. The Minister has undertaken a new initiative, where schemes under &euro;5 million can be started without reference to the Department.</P>
      <P>However, if the schemes are bundled together, they can go over that amount. Those involved in water schemes have been asking me if they could get out of the bundle and go back to stand-alone schemes that would cost less than &euro;5 million. Some of the bundled schemes have gone so far that it will be difficult to go back and start again as a stand-alone scheme. Can the Minister address that problem? While I welcome what he did for schemes that cost less than &euro;5 million, this initiative has caused a particular problem.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>The question is whether Senator Bannon agrees with the motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>The objectives of the design build operate schemes may not be fully understood by every local authority. Many small schemes could now start under the Minister&rsquo;s initiative. However, I see problems if these schemes are part of a bundle and cost more than &euro;5 million. We can surely proceed with either the treatment section or the collection system without having to wait for the other to proceed. There are schemes in Galway from Dunmore and Kilkerrin in north Galway out to Carna and Carraroe in west Galway. There are difficulties in trying to have a DBO scheme in that bundle.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government will leave those schemes in the bundle.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>The relationship between the Seanad and local authorities has changed since the abolition of the dual mandate. Many of us were elected to this House as county councillors, although that changed a few years ago. However, we had a unique link with local government and most of us are still elected by county councillors. I welcome the decision by the Progressive Democrats to table this motion on Private Members&rsquo; business, as it is an issue that is not raised enough in the House. The Seanad needs to look at some kind of structured way of raising issues about local government.</P>
      <P>Some time ago the Leader of the House organised a series of sittings dealing with European issues and these were addressed by Members of the European Parliament. I am not saying we should do that but we should keep up the link we have with local government and show that it is important to us as parliamentarians. Most Members started in politics as local county councillors. Perhaps the Minister might have some proposals in that regard.</P>
      <P>Some councils have not kept up good communications with Members of the Oireachtas. My local council is not too bad. It held a meeting for us after I had contacted it a few times but it took a year to hold that meeting. There were follow up meetings last year and this year at which we were briefed by the council, so communication is relatively good. The council has a good website and we can access the meeting agendas and so forth. However, some local authorities are not as good. The Minister should pursue this and find out how local authorities are communicating with Members of the Oireachtas, if it is working and <Col N="1481"/>whether there is consistency throughout the country, as there should be.</P>
      <P>I opposed waste charges but now that they are in place, some comments should be made. There should be a cap on increases in bin charges. This could be imposed in line with a mechanism such as the inflation rate or the consumer price index. Sometimes there are huge increases in charges. My local council has not increased the waste charges in the last couple of years but other councils have. There is huge inconsistency in the level of waste charges from county to county. Some councils have waivers while some do not. Some councils have privatised the services, others have not.</P>
      <P>Some councils operate a pay-per-lift policy while others operate a pay-per-lift as well as a fixed charge. The fixed charge can be in the region of &euro;200. I do not agree with this charge. There should be consistency in waste charges, caps on increases and a national waiver system. However, the fixed charge contradicts the approach we are supposed to apply, that is, the polluter pays principle. A spokesperson for the EU Commissioner for the environment spoke to the Forum on Europe a couple of years ago and he said a fixed charge is the worst type of charge from an environmental point of view. However, many councils operate fixed charges along with the pay-per-lift charge. The Minister should try to phase out these fixed charges while ensuring the pay-per-lift charges are fair.</P>
      <P>There is also a need for the Government to provide a national recycling infrastructure. South Dublin County Council exports most of the waste collected in the green bins. There is no way to monitor what happens to that waste after export. I understand much of it is exported to Asian countries but I do not know what happens to it. Does the Minister know? Does he monitor where this waste goes? This is a costly way of dealing with the waste. It should be used in this country. If it is sustainable to recycle waste, we should be able to do it. We should have a recycling industry, re-introduce the recycling of glass and establish other industries involved in recycling waste. The Government must make the capital investment in that type of infrastructure.</P>
      <P>The Government has provided funding for play facilities to be drawn down by local authorities. It is part of the national play policy and the funding comes through the National Children&rsquo;s Office. I welcome that Government initiative. The councils are drawing down the funding but my local council would not wish to spend any money on play facilities if it could get away with it. Before that money was available, the council was not doing anything. It is doing something now but what it does is minimalist. It does not wish to establish new facilities because it would have to maintain them.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The councils are drawing down that money but they are not implementing the plans as they should. Under the national play policy they are <Col N="1482"/>supposed to draw up a county play plan and a county play policy, and the money is to be spent in a structured way within that. However, they are not doing that. My local council does not have a county play officer, as it should have. The money should be provided as it is important to provide more play facilities but the Minister should ensure that local authorities embrace the policy enthusiastically and spend the money in a structured and well-planned way. In this way the authorities will realise that they are obliged to provide facilities for children and that it is an important part of their work.</P>
      <P>It is important, too, that the local authorities realise their role in preventing crime. I attended a meeting on crime in my constituency this week. The main issues were anti-social behaviour and the lack of garda&iacute; on the beat. However, people also said that the councils must do their job in terms of maintaining areas as this is intrinsically linked to crime prevention. This fits in with modern thinking on this issue.</P>
      <P>I am a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights. This year the committee produced a report on community policing, which embraced what may be termed the &ldquo;broken window&rdquo; theory of policing. My local council had a policy of not fixing tenants&rsquo; broken windows but if a broken window in a building is not dealt with by a local authority, as is often the case, that can lead to other anti-social behaviour in the area. It starts a downward spiral because other things happen as a result. Youths start hanging around the area and graffiti is painted on the building, which would not happen where the window was unbroken and the area was tidy. Then drug pushers start to hang around the area. If a council does not do its job in terms of fixing windows in its premises and tidying wasteland, the theory is that it is contributing to crime. It is a credible theory and has been taken on board by, for example, the Patton commission in the North. The local authorities have a role in that regard and the Minister should take it up with them.</P>
      <P>The Minister should also ask councils to put more emphasis on providing housing for the elderly. This is linked to the issue of long-term care for the elderly. If there was more sheltered housing for the elderly, there would be less need for nursing homes. It is also a better way of dealing with long-term provision for the elderly. This is done in other countries, for example, the UK has far greater provision of housing and different housing options for the elderly. More must also be done for single men on housing waiting lists because they are greatly discriminated against, particularly separated men.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CyprianBrady"><NameTxt>Mr. Brady</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Progressive Democrats&rsquo; motion, with which I fully agree. My local authority experience is with Dublin City Council, formerly Dublin Corporation. The investment that has taken place in <Col N="1483"/>recent years has made a great improvement in the council. The changes have been dramatic. I have seen at first hand the good interaction between the employees and the communities throughout the city. This is due to rationalisation of the service and investment in staff, technology and equipment.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Dublin city now has a community-based service. The key to that change was the introduction of regional offices and officers. The current city manager, John Fitzgerald, should be congratulated for initiating that process. It has proved a great success. Previously, there was an impression that Dublin Corporation resided in its ivory tower in the civic offices. Councillors will remember queuing for hours in the housing section. It was almost impossible to get an official to come to the phone, let alone get to meet one.</P>
      <P>That has all changed. Every day one can see officials out in the community interacting with residents, not necessarily local authority residents but residents in general. They become involved in local committees, attend residents&rsquo; meetings and get to know local residents, children, teachers, garda&iacute; and schools. They have a first-hand knowledge of what is happening on the ground, which is a major change. For a long time, it was almost impossible to get access to officials or to get them to attend an on-site meeting. That has changed, partly as a result of investment.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>It is my experience that most local authorities have a pool of experienced, highly-skilled professional staff, particularly in the area of strategic planning. Over time they have built up a knowledge of strategic planning, particularly with regard to housing. The difference now is that there is consultation with local people, professionals and other agencies. Throughout the north inner city, the council has delivered first-class modern developments. Two that spring to mind are Smithfield, where the civic space is one of the best in Europe, and O&rsquo;Connell Street, which is now halfway through the second phase of development, which will stretch as far as the Ambassador cinema. It is a huge investment. The first phase of the O&rsquo;Connell Street project cost &euro;3.26 million, with a further &euro;390,000 for lighting. Nobody can argue it has not improved O&rsquo;Connell Street. It is an example of the investment that has taken place.</P>
      <?oasys _cl11.5- ?>
      <P>There are plans for further investment. Public-private partnership arrangements are in place with regard to some of the most deprived areas. For example, O&rsquo;Devaney Gardens will see a major &euro;200 million public-private partnership investment to replace decrepit 1960s flat complexes with own-door, modern housing, with all necessary facilities, including community facilities. This highlights the strategic planning undertaken by local authorities throughout the country.</P>
      <P>Another prime example is Fatima Mansions. For many years, Fatima Mansions was a no-go area but it is changing rapidly due to co-operation <Col N="1484"/>between the local authority, private developers and the community. This is being achieved through a process of consultation with the people as to their needs and wants.</P>
      <P>Throughout the city, award-winning modern housing developments with top-class facilities where people can live in comfort and security are being built. I particularly commend Dublin City Council on the high quality of its new senior citizens complexes, which were developed through a combination of investment and planning. These complexes replace the bedsit units that existed for many years, which had one room for sleeping, eating and everything else. That is changing. For example, Rowan Hamilton Court in Cabra and Clareville Court in Glasnevin have state-of-the-art facilities, including on-site health services and CCTV. This is a sign of the investment made and residents are taking advantage of the benefits.</P>
      <P>Improvements are taking place not only in housing but also with regard to state-of-the-art sports complexes, playgrounds and arts projects. Playgrounds are a great example of joined-up government. The Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs is making investments under the RAPID programme and Dublin City Council is working hand-in-hand with the Department in designing, providing sites for and maintaining playgrounds. Mountjoy Square playground is a prime example. It is a major improvement to what was a no-go area for many people.</P>
      <P>The increased resources have resulted in significant improvements but further improvements are required. For example, traffic management is probably the biggest issue in Dublin city at present. Ten to 12 years ago when the Dublin transportation initiative began, which resulted in the establishment of the Dublin Transportation Office, policy decisions were made which led to the exclusion of as much traffic as possible from the city centre. That policy has not worked. We should concentrate on achieving the fastest possible throughput of city traffic. City traffic is blocked as a result of sheer volume and is spreading further and further into the suburbs. No attempt is made to facilitate the passage of cars through the city as quickly as possible, with the result that cars are idling in traffic for long periods, with all the consequences for emissions, safety, stress on drivers and the economy. This issue must be examined.</P>
      <P>As the motion states, the investment at local authority level has been significant &mdash; there is a 7% increase in investment for this year compared with last year. Particularly in the inner city of Dublin, the investment has made a very significant difference which is visible for all to see.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I recognise the important role played by local authorities in our democracy and the fine work that is sometimes done. However, I have always had an ambiguous relationship with county councils. Perhaps 15 years ago I was invited to address the General Council of County Councils in Killarney. I gave the members a bit of a jolt with regard to section 4 planning permissions, which were in operation at the time. I was howled down by most of the attendance. I was asked &ldquo;What part of England do you come from, sonny?&rdquo; and that kind of stuff.</P>

	<P>Perhaps Greystones.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I got a good hearing from a minority of the attendance who were prepared to take controversy on the chin. We had a good time and an interesting exchange. At that time, I thought the only problem was section 4 planning permissions. I would count as a negative the absurd deference paid to county councils in this House in particular, though not so much in the D&aacute;il.</P>
      <P>I do not want to tread too far into the subject of the tribunals but it would be wrong of me not to refer to them. There has been a series of scandals in which members of local authorities and county councils were involved, including Members of the Oireachtas. This is shameful. It has brought the question of local government into focus and into a kind of contempt in the minds of the general population because the impression is given that people are abroad who, in the words of James Joyce, not only were prepared to sell their country for thruppence but would get down on their knees and thank the almighty Christ they had a country to sell. That is a pity.</P>
      <P>I am not making any individual accusations or claims but a general atmosphere has been exposed, largely by the operations of the former Minister, Mr. Michael Smith, and his colleague, who offered money for information, which led to the establishment of the tribunals. That must be recognised. I do not for a minute believe this problem exists only in Dublin, although it may be on a smaller scale elsewhere. I hope it is rooted out, which should be the first aim. We should have respect for the work that it has done, but we should make sure it has done it properly, appropriately and honestly, without any suggestion of malpractice, which is certainly in people&rsquo;s minds. It is an important part of our democracy, as it touches people&rsquo;s lives in areas such as planning, housing and the provision of basic services. We are entitled to a higher standard than we have had. I say this while honouring the contribution made by many persons of integrity at local level. They have been let down, however.</P>
      <P>I support the work and development of local authorities in its appropriate place, which is not <Col N="1486"/>interfering in the work of the Oireachtas. Members of local authorities can talk to Members and brief them, but in recent weeks such authorities have been used as an excuse or figleaf for the subversion of the work of this House with regard to the cancellation of the proposed committee to inquire into Shannon Airport. This is utterly wrong. Perhaps this was the real reason, but it may well have been the Government using local authorities as a cat&rsquo;s paw and an excuse.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The necessity for the Government to complete the work started when it decoupled part of the relationship between the Oireachtas and local authorities, by stopping double jobbing, has been highlighted. This was the nauseous practice of people being both Members of the Oireachtas and members of local authorities. This was the reason, we were told, we could never meet on a Monday. The Oireachtas could not meet on certain days of the week, not because of a matter of national importance, but because local councils were meeting. This was inappropriate and wrong.</P>
      <P>We tend to get laughable lectures regarding democracy and it is assumed and often stated that the university seats in the Seanad are undemocratic. They are the only democratic element in this House. These seats at least have real constituencies. As originally designed it was intended that all Seanad seats should be voted upon, and there were nominating bodies. These nominating bodies were eventually neutered, by having the power of voting removed from their ordinary membership. The overwhelming bulk of my colleagues, most of whom are excellent politicians, are still spancelled by an unhealthy, unrealistic, nonsensical and undemocratic method of election involving constituencies of fewer than 1,000 members. An overwhelming number of these are local councillors.</P>
      <P>This is wrong and vitiates the entire process. I call on the Minister to look again at this. My colleagues and friends in this Chamber would not have the slightest difficulty getting elected on a proper, wider mandate. It would free them from the absurd deference which is paid to local authorities.</P>
      <P Just="Left">We hear much waffle about carnage on the roads and how we should have respect for speed limits. Why should anybody have respect for a system that is totally chaotic and inconsistent? Everybody knows this. There is a chaotic system of speed limits on the country&rsquo;s roads because the determination of these limits is left exclusively in the hands of local authorities. It should be a national issue. Road deaths are a national scandal and should not be left in the hands of local authorities.</P>
      <P>The same should be true with regard to speed bumps. Why are these not nationally regulated? Some, in posh areas, are nice undulations, which would hardly cause a hair to rise on that back of one&rsquo;s head. Others are like the Cliffs of Moher, <Col N="1487"/>and these are structurally dangerous to a car driven at 10 km/h. If the Minister wants respect from road users, there should be consistency on issues such as speed limits and speed bumps. It should be logical to suggest that any ordinary decent citizen should be able to drive their car up to the permitted maximum speed. That takes into account a car being driven over a speed bump.</P>
      <P>I mentioned this issue to a person, stating that these bumps are meant to deter joyriders. The person laughed, saying that in her area the bumps only encourage joyriders as they get a better bang from hitting them. They destroy the cars and jump out of them. We should have some really consistent and high standards in our local authorities. They are an important part of our Government.

	<P Just="Left">I have been in this House and listened with great respect to its Members. I have never heard such nonsense as in the last hour, in particular from Senator Bannon. He wrung his hands about the demise of local government. I have a small point of history. The first time local government was seriously culled in this country was in 1924. It was a long time ago and there has been a long history of Senator Bannon&rsquo;s party and its predecessors culling local government. Senator Bannon also discussed rates, and the problems incurred when the domestic rate was abolished. Senator Bannon should check the facts. The inter-party Government of 1976 made the decision to abolish domestic rates, which all political parties followed. Every now and again it is a good thing to introduce facts into the debate.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The Senator also showed a degree of confusion when he said the Government should do something about local charges. Local authorities are democratically-elected bodies. The level of their charges, particularly development contributions and rates, are struck every year by their elected representatives, as he and everybody else in this House knows. Senator Bannon also knows the results of the 2004 elections and that his own party and its coalition partners have a substantial majority in a number of local authorities. That is an unfortunate fact Senator Bannon chose to overlook when he decided to trot out the IBEC line about increases in rates.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>Maybe the Senators opposite want to engage in pantomime. Senator Bannon also talked about the money that is allocated to local authorities. I will remind the House of a couple of things. In 1997 the local government fund contributed &euro;339 million to local authorities through rate support grant and the equalisation fund. This year the figure was &euro;875 million, which even by Senator Bannon&rsquo;s warped view of economics is a significant increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">In 1987, central government contributed 64%. Now the figure is less than 30%.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Bannon had his chance to speak.</P>

	<P>The Minister without interruption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">In 1997 the equalisation and rate support grant from Senator Bannon&rsquo;s party in Government was &euro;339 million. This year the outset allocation was &euro;875 million. Other statistics bear out what I am saying. In 1997 the rural water scheme received &euro;25 million compared with an outset figure this year of &euro;119 million. Even allowing for Senator Bannon&rsquo;s rather peculiar approach to economics that is a significant increase.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I will give the Senator and the House a final figure. In 1994 the total contribution from central government to non-national roads, which are important for interconnectivity across the country, was &euro;139 million, and in 1997 had gone up to &euro;226 million. Senator Bannon would be the first to agree that the &euro;558 million allocated this year is significantly better than either of those contributions. They are facts and if he wants to deal with other facts I will do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>That was unevenly distributed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a welcome debate because it allows us to deal with the reality of local government as opposed to mythology. Local government plays an important part in the life of the nation and is an integral part of the democratic process. Accordingly, I fundamentally disagree with some of the comments made by my friend and colleague, Senator Norris. His view of local government is somewhat distorted. It has a representational and operational role so statements that it has to introduce charges are pure political nonsense. It is time we grew up as politicians and accepted that services have to be paid <Col N="1492"/>for. For good or evil all parties made a decision in the late 1970s to abolish domestic rates. If Senator Bannon checks his facts he will find that the first decision in that regard was made in September 1976. We can all wring our hands but we must be truthful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister should be truthful about 1977.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>Nobody trusts the Minister. He should go and see what people endured during the summer when the water was off.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>The truth hurts and Senator Bannon should deal with facts rather than mythology. Since the early 1990s successive Administrations have taken steps to modernise our local government system. We are beginning to see a local government system which shows signs of the kind of administrative system we need. The modernisation agenda of the past few years has given constitutional recognition to local government for the first time, which we should welcome.</P>
      <P>We have introduced the single electoral mandate for local government which underlines the unique representational role of the elected member at local level. Some Members of this and the other House had different views on that measure but it has been introduced. We have also provided significantly more resources than at any time in the history of the State. The combined spend, current and capital, will be some &euro;9 billion.</P>
      <P>Management structures have also been strengthened. The range of matters over which councillors have direct influence is being extended to include river basin management plans and joint policing committees. As I have already indicated on Second Stage of the water services Bill 2003, I propose to bring forward a Government amendment to designate water services a policy issue for councils to decide. Elected members have a new role outlined in the strategic infrastructure Bill 2006, which I published last week, if Members opposite care to read it.</P>
      <P>Local government&rsquo;s sphere of influence has also been widened through the county and city development boards. These boards have been established under the leadership of local government, bringing together all the relevant economic, social and community agencies. The policy-making role of local authorities has been enhanced with sectoral interests and community representatives supporting councillor input through the strategic policy committees. A value for money and efficiency agenda has been rolled out in local authorities and is the most advanced in public administration in Ireland. The activities of local authorities are increasingly being guided by a customer focus and the process will be widened and deepened. Local government must have <Col N="1493"/>a strong customer or client focus. A range of financial, training and other practical supports has been provided for local authorities to facilitate their effective participation in the modern local government process. To address the specific concerns of Senator Norris, a comprehensive ethics framework has applied since the beginning of 2003, placing a duty on every member and employee to maintain proper standards.</P>
      <P>Linked to the phenomenal growth in economic activity over the last decade, there have been significant improvements by local authorities. For example, they determined some 76,000 planning decisions in 2005, reflecting a phenomenal increase in local government throughput in the past decade. Total housing completions in 2005 were at the record level of just over 81,000, significantly higher than when Senator Bannon&rsquo;s party was in power. The present output is 20 per 1,000 population, which is four times the EU average. Without a good and efficient local government system that would not be possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">How many are on the housing list today?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>On the environment front, local authorities are also making considerable progress. For example, in the period 2000-04, they achieved increased waste water capacity over seven times greater than in the whole of the previous national development plan period. The number of bring bank facilities increased from 850 in 1998 to 1,929 last year, and there were significant improvements in output across a whole range of activities.</P>
      <P>In 2006 the total local government expenditure, current and capital, will for the first time touch the &euro;9 billion mark. Senator Bannon failed to mention how little his party gave to local authorities while it was in power. I remind the Senator that the decision on domestic rates, which we can either regret or celebrate, was not made by one party. It was made by his party in Government in 1976 and was repeated by my party in 1977.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister should get it right. His party abolished it totally.</P>

However, I am not prepared to be heckled by Senator Bannon and will deal in due course with the series of untrue statements he made.</P>
      <P>Local authority programmes have benefited substantially from transfers of capital funds from the Exchequer and the establishment of the local government fund under the Local Government Act 1998 provided for a buoyant source of finance. The fund, into which the proceeds of motor tax and an increasing Exchequer contribution are paid, now accounts for some 30% of current expenditure by local authorities and enables me to channel significant funding annually to local authorities by way of general purpose grants. General purpose grant allocations from the fund increased from &euro;236 million in 1994 to &euro;339 million in 1997 and to &euro;875 million in 2006.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I remind the Senator that 1997 is not that far in the past. The figure for 2006 is far in excess of the rate of inflation and the Government&rsquo;s year-on-year increase in funds allocated to local authorities has been far ahead of the Opposition&rsquo;s when it controlled the public purse.</P>
      <P><?oasys _ic14- ?>In my meeting today with the Chambers of Commerce of Ireland, I pointed out that commercial rates increased by an average of 4.5% in 2006. This compares favourably with the 12% average increase which businesses in Northern Ireland are facing this year. In addition to general purpose grants, my Department and others give grants to local authorities for specific purposes, including the improvement and maintenance of non-national roads. Such specific grants provide some 23% of local authorities&rsquo; current funding needs. It is a fact that the proportion of local government budget which is funded directly from the Exchequer has increased in excess of rates. However, Senator Bannon does not like to deal in facts but prefers mythology, bullying and shouting. The reality is that logic, which is alien to the Senator, will show there has been an increase.<?oasys _ic0- ?></P>

	<P>The overall contribution made by my Department in supporting the local government system should be acknowledged.

A reform which illustrates the way in which local authorities are rising to the challenge is the implementation of local government financial management systems and there are further significant improvements in other areas.</P>
      <P>The essence of local government is its capacity to address local needs and circumstances. A well functioning local government system should be expected to reflect the diverse interests of local communities. This has been achieved through, for example, local social partnership structures and <Col N="1496"/>strategic policy committees, SPCs, which have introduced a modernisation programme for local government. Traditionally, local policy was brought forward by management and submitted to the council for endorsement but SPCs are seen as a way of enhancing local policy formulation whereby elected members and representatives of sectoral interests can bring forward initiatives. It is important that SPCs deliver on their full potential and, against this background, the IPA reviewed its operations in 2003 at my predecessor&rsquo;s request. The findings of that review, which centred on the key roles of the chairs and directors of service, are currently being implemented. Again, this demonstrates that local government can change to meet the demands of a dynamic society.</P>
      <P>County and city development boards, CDBs, led by local government, have also been established in each county and city. These further co-ordinate delivery of all public services at local level by bringing together all the local players including public sector agencies, social partners, local government and local development bodies. Therefore, when we discuss local government, we should celebrate its success for democracy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister would not say that if he had been in Longford over the summer, when the water was turned off in every house because the funding was inadequate. Let the town install a proper water supply system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I will address the matter of water presently. The blueprint for this co-operation, the CDB strategy for the economic, social and cultural development of each county and city, represents a major improvement and has operated with success on the ground.</P>
      <P>The issue of social inclusion is related to community development. Practical measures have been taken to ensure that community consultation is not a token exercise. A community and voluntary forum was established in each city and county to facilitate a structured input into the business of local authorities, the success of which indicates the flexibility of the Irish model of local government.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The motion before us makes specific reference to the Water Services Investment Programme for 2005 to 2007. The Government has invested significant resources into the water services sector in recent times and this is set to continue. Record levels of funding have been provided for new and upgraded water and waste water infrastructure under the current national development plan. The programme, which I published last December, contains 899 individual schemes with a total value of &euro;5.1 billion. The schedule of scheme starts for this year and for 2007 is the most ambitious ever.</P><Col N="1497"/>
      <P>The additional capacity produced by successive water services investment programmes has made a direct and substantial contribution to strengthening economic performance by facilitating industrial and residential development. Among the benefits arising from this investment is a compliance rate of over 90% with the stringent standards of the EU urban waste water treatment directive and all remaining schemes needed to achieve full compliance with the requirements of the directive are included in the programme. There has been a reduction of some 45,000 tonnes per annum in the pollutant load to our rivers, lakes and sea waters from municipal treatment systems and the additional waste water treatment capacity generated is sufficient to service a population of more than 3 million. These figures demonstrate the amount of benefit brought by local authorities with the funds provided by the Government.</P>
      <P>Given the programme&rsquo;s pivotal role in supporting economic and social development, it is essential that the most efficient procedures are in place to ensure that water services infrastructure provision can continue to anticipate and respond effectively to demand for new or improved services. Against that background, I recently introduced new administrative procedures to streamline the advancement of individual water and sewerage schemes.</P>
      <P>I acknowledge the comments made by Members of both Houses on the need for less bureaucracy and have introduced new procedures drawn up in consultation with local authorities under which individual schemes with a value of less than &euro;5 million may, following preliminary approval by my Department, proceed to construction without further reference to the Department.</P>
      <P>This reduces from four to two the number of stages in project design and development and should speed up delivery, particularly in smaller schemes.</P>
      <P>Senator Kitt mentioned the bundling of some schemes. Bundling is determined in the schemes as they come up and I have told local authorities that if it is efficient to de-bundle or re-bundle schemes, they should do that. I want to see these schemes delivered on time and in the most cost effective way. I am confident that devolving greater responsibilities to the local authorities and streamlining the administrative process will, as well as strengthening the local government system and providing the resources, lead to remarkable delivery on the water services investment programme.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Shared service provision is another area being dealt with by IBEC and other commercial interest groups and it has been promoted in discussions I have had with the chambers of commerce. The Government acknowledges that sharing services locally or on a regional basis can <Col N="1498"/>produce economies of scale and offer better quality service. A significant level of co-operation exists between local authorities at town, county and regional levels and this approach should be enhanced and rolled out. Local authorities work closely together on the production of intercounty planning strategies and a range of other issues. A key objective of the local government reform programme has been the delivery of co-ordinated and integrated services for local authorities. There is no doubt that bringing together regional services leads to greater efficiency.</P>
      <P>While local authorities have implemented great changes in recent years, much remains to be done. Local authorities have not neglected value for money in the past but there have been changes in the local government accounting system that will lead to greater value for money in the future. I intend to build on the progress made and to ensure that the value for money agenda continues to be at centre stage in all local authority activities and business. For example, the Department has begun work on the development of a common costing system for the sector to provide improved management information on the cost of delivering individual services. By doing this, the taxpayer, the business community, the householder and the local authority member will have a better basis for making comparisons and knowing if an individual local authority is good, bad or indifferent. An initiative that will be of particular interest to Seanad Members will be rolled out over the next few weeks to make more information available to councillors and to the public about the financial status of local authorities. When I spoke to council members late last year, many of them did not know how much money had been collected in development contributions. Those figures will be made available.</P>
      <P>I will shortly publish the independent report on local government financing, commissioned by the Department during 2004, and will be pursuing with local authorities the implementation of appropriate recommendations to achieve further efficiencies in the sector, including greater sharing of services.</P>
      <P>Serving the customer better is a key theme on which local government is delivering. I have mentioned only one area, namely, on-line motor tax. There has been a huge uptake of this immensely efficient and cost effective measure. It delivers savings to local authorities and means people do not have to queue for hours to re-tax their cars. That model can be rolled out elsewhere.</P>
      <P>Local government&rsquo;s continuing commitment to customer service was further illustrated by the publication last year by the Local Government Management Services Board of the first report on local authority service indicators. These are being worked on now for the year ahead &mdash; we will publish them later in the year and I will welcome a debate in this House on them. Last year they <Col N="1499"/>were published for the first time, they were novel, but they gave an objective basis for making comparisons between the performances of local authorities. It is important for the credibility of the local government system that the service indicator initiative is subject to appropriate quality assurance.</P>
      <P>It is important to record the Government&rsquo;s appreciation of the significant contribution which local government has made to the economic and social development of Ireland over the past decade. This has been facilitated by the substantial resources which the Government has devoted to local government and the change programme which continues to be rolled out in partnership with it. I am satisfied that the structures, finances, policies and programmes are in place to ensure that local government continues to successfully meet the challenges it faces and to deliver the customer-oriented local service we all want to see.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>On planning, the Taoiseach said in Sligo that guidelines would be more amenable for people building in rural areas. This was followed by statements from the previous Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, and by the Minister himself. The situation on the ground has become more difficult since those statements were made. All public representatives are regularly contacted by people pointing out difficulties caused by planners and inconsistencies in planning. The area should be debated in this House because it is becoming more difficult.</P>
      <P>I want to nail the lie that the Taoiseach, the previous Minister and the Minister did something for rural Ireland in this area. The situation has become worse and that is a fact. I can bring 28 councillors from Limerick County Council to the Oireachtas who will verify the situation. The Government claims 1997 as the magical year in which everything started but the Celtic tiger has existed since 1996.</P>
      <P>There is concern in many communities about sewerage schemes, the most vital component in rural locations. They decide how many people can live in the area and have an impact on schools and other facilities. County Limerick has had two small rural schemes in the last eight years &mdash; Fethermore and Croagh. The Minister said recently he was relaxing the protocol necessary for permission to build a sewerage scheme but he mentioned that it had to cost less than &euro;5 million. That is contradicted, however, by the changed status of most of the sewerage schemes in the county because they have been bundled together and, by doing so on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis, consultants were needed to verify extra information. It goes on forever.</P><Col N="1500"/>
      <P>I have raised this issue repeatedly, particularly with the Minister of State at the Department, Deputy Noel Ahern, pointing out where various sewerage schemes had become stuck in a logjam. On the Adjournment on Thursday of last week, I raised the issue of Dromcollogher. I made further inquiries of the council and the Department and found it is bundled with Bruff, Hospital and Pallasgreen in the other extreme of the county and it will not take place for many years.</P>
      <P Just="Left">In many cases the impediment is that it is not possible for private builders to develop a scheme of this nature under public-private partnership because of the finances involved. There are many other impediments &mdash; a logjam has developed &mdash; and while the Minister may point to a success story, this case is an indictment of him. While funding may be in train for the future, the timeframe is too long and many local communities are disappointed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand the reason for the Minister&rsquo;s outbursts given that his colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, has decided he will not allow an incinerator to be built in Ringsend in his Dublin constituency.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>

	<P>The Government has made many statements on the need for water quality. I do not understand the reason the Minister will not take responsibility for the unacceptable failure to provide a sewerage system in Kinvara, County Galway, where 70,000 gallons of raw sewage are pumped into the bay each day. The Government has not responded to the problem. If the Minister is responding to his colleagues on <Col N="1501"/>the other side of the House, I would like to hear his response.</P>

We were told the increases were necessary because rents have not increased for years. That is not the fault of tenants. Increases of this kind are excessive and cannot be tolerated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Having said that, I wish to raise a number of issues which Opposition Senators should not confuse with support for the amendment. On the issue of local government funding, before selective amnesia affects us all the abolition of domestic rates featured in every manifesto preceding the general election in question. One wonders whether this was a good idea at the time and one can speculate about the potential size of the local authority budget for Sligo Corporation if it operated under the same conditions as its counterpart in Newry. We are certainly entitled to dream the council would be able to build inner relief roads from its own funds. Nevertheless, let us not kid ourselves that anyone will propose the reintroduction of domestic rates without receiving a direction to that effect from Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>We have domestic rates by the back door.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>We need to take a more innovative approach to commercial rates. I am particularly concerned about small rather than big businesses. I am not taking the IBEC line on this issue as I have experience of the matter but all businesses should pay their share and those which can pay should pay. That a large proportion of the commercial rates bill is paid by a small percentage of businesses needs to be examined. The north west and other areas have experienced a number of company closures in the traditional sector in recent times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator should conclude.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to make one final point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>In that case, the Senator will deny his colleague speaking time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>I will not do so for fear I might drop a preference and will hand over to Senator Leyden gracefully.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister, with his distinguished local government career, is acquitting himself extremely well in office. The former Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Noel Dempsey, recognised the contribution of local councillors by providing &mdash; correctly &mdash; that they receive a reasonable level of remuneration. His successor, the current Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen, removed the dual mandate, a measure I opposed at the time, although I have since become a convert. Today, for example, two local council meetings which I would not have been able to attend will be held <Col N="1503"/>in County Roscommon. Able councillors in the county will deal with the matters which arise.</P>
      <P>The formation of the regional health forums is a welcome development. I attended the inaugural meeting of the Western Health Forum yesterday at which the Fianna F&aacute;il Party candidate, Aidan Colleary, was elected chairperson with the support of the Labour Party, while Labour Party councillor, Kieran Walsh, was elected vice-chairperson with the support of the Progressive Democrats Party. We, in the west, have formed a new coalition of the Fianna F&aacute;il, Labour and Progressive Democrats parties under what is known as the &ldquo;Merlin Park accord&rdquo;.

	<P>I would like the new policing committees being established by the Minister and his colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, in 15 pilot schemes at a cost of &euro;100,000 to be extended nationwide as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>The establishment yesterday of the first regional health forum attended by 40 members marks a new beginning. Four other forums will follow. Senator Ulick Burke and I are former members of the Western Health Board. I was privileged to attend yesterday&rsquo;s meeting to observe democracy in action and the beginning of <Col N="1504"/>a new relationship between the different parties.

	<P>I thank all Members who have contributed to the debate, which acknowledges the contribution of local government to the country in the past 100 years. I thank the Minister for his very comprehensive address which shows the commitment of the Government to the delivery of services for the further development of local authorities. Development charges were mentioned. When the results of the audit become available to the Minister, I am sure they will show a surplus for charges collected by most local authorities in 2005. Together with local government the Minister should consider how the funds can be spent on local development plans. Now that the contribution to certain schemes has finished, an opportunity exists for funds to be matched at national level and services implemented at local level. I am delighted to see the importance of the water services programme and the commitment and support of the Minister in implementing the scheme. Much has been said about bundling schemes. The local authorities will seek to make the schemes smaller and spend the &euro;5.1 billion on those schemes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. F. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Tim O&rsquo;Malley, to the House. I wish to raise the serious topic of cystic fibrosis and the care meted out to such patients. I acknowledge the Government&rsquo;s recent allocation of &euro;4.78 million which is a welcome step. No. 26, motion 7, on the Order Paper calls on the Government to take steps to immediately rectify the position. The motion notes that:</P>
      <P LI="1">Ireland has one of the highest incidences of cystic fibrosis in the world;</P>
      <P LI="1" FLI="0">cystic fibrosis is Ireland&rsquo;s most common life threatening genetically inherited disease with one in every 20 people carrying the recessive cystic fibrosis gene;</P>
      <P LI="1" FLI="0">people with cystic fibrosis rely heavily on a health system that is inadequately staffed and resourced;</P>
      <P LI="1" FLI="0">the survival statistics relating to cystic fibrosis is directly proportional to the quality of the health care system, and Ireland sadly falls well below internationally accepted norms;</P>
      <P LI="1" FLI="0">with the correct health care, a large proportion of people with cystic fibrosis will be able to live a normal productive life; and</P>
      <P LI="1">Seanad &Eacute;ireann calls on the Government to take immediate steps to provide adequate increased funding and resources to help sufferers of this condition.</P>
      <P FLI="0" Just="Left">I decided to raise the matter on the Adjournment to allow the Minister to update the House on what progress has been made in this area. The statistics are startling in that there is a difference of nine years in life expectancy for sufferers of cystic fibrosis in the Republic as opposed to Northern Ireland. Literally a two-hour journey from here a cystic fibrosis sufferer can have a different lifespan. That is not satisfactory for anyone concerned.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The major problem for cystic fibrosis sufferers is that there are not enough beds in isolation units. Such sufferers are put in wards with patients suffering from other illnesses, including the common flu. What struck me when I heard a <Col N="1506"/>presentation by the Cystic Fibrosis Association of Ireland in Buswells Hotel a few months ago was that their biggest fear was what they would contract while in the hospital. It was not necessarily going into hospital because they accept that as part of the norm.</P>
      <P>I have heard of people in Carlow whose child spent three days on a chair in a public hospital in Dublin; the parents were so exasperated they took their daughter out of the hospital. In other cases cystic fibrosis sufferers have had to be admitted through the accident and emergency unit. While the Government has allocated &euro;4.78 million towards the care of cystic fibrosis sufferers, will the Minister of State specify exactly where that money will be spent?</P>
      <P Just="Left">According to the Cystic Fibrosis Association of Ireland the staffing levels for people with cystic fibrosis are more than 400% below the minimum accepted standards and the lack of segregation and isolation facilities puts patients&rsquo; lives at risk on a daily basis. At the national adult referral centre there is just one consultant to treat 60% of the adult cystic fibrosis population in the State. Many patients have to be admitted via the accident and emergency unit because there are no beds available in the ward. Some who have to wait 24 hours to be admitted are often exposed to serious risk of infection. There is a need for proper facilities &mdash; single rooms en-suite &mdash; in all 13 cystic fibrosis centres as well as a 30-bed unit and centre at St. Vincent&rsquo;s Hospital.</P>
      <P>There was great news in January when a double lung transplant operation took place in the Mater Hospital. It is still early days but hopefully it can be replicated in the future. It is hoped to do ten or more lung transplant operations in the coming year. Obviously that has a huge bearing on cystic fibrosis suffers. It is worth pointing out that the double lung transplant was not for a cystic fibrosis sufferer but it is obviously connected.</P>
      <P>Ireland is unique in having an excellent organ donor rate of approximately 22 per 1 million of population, the fourth highest in the EU and twice the rate of the UK. We should build on that number when working towards helping patients with cystic fibrosis. I was amazed to learn there is no legislation covering the issue of organ donation. I had always assumed that if one had an organ donor card on one&rsquo;s person &mdash; God forbid a serious accident happened &mdash; that automatically one&rsquo;s organs were donated. It emerged recently that there is no law covering this area and that one&rsquo;s next-of-kin can decide whether one&rsquo;s organs are donated. That is an area that should be looked at again because it has implications for sufferers of cystic fibrosis.</P>
      <P>The average age at death of a cystic fibrosis sufferer is 21.5 years but in Northern Ireland it is 30 years of age. That is not satisfactory for anybody involved. I hope the Minister of State will <Col N="1507"/>inform us of a new unit for St. Vincent&rsquo;s Hospital for which they are crying out. I hope the &euro;4.78 million allocated for sufferers of cystic fibrosis is only a start. This area has been underfunded for many years. Given the high rate of cystic fibrosis it is vital that the Minister of State outlines what progress has been made. I hope services can be put in place in order that Irish patients do not automatically have to travel to England for transplants in some cases. I hope we can tie in with the success of the double lung transplant operation in the Mater Hospital in January.</P>

	<P>I am taking the Adjournment on behalf of my colleague, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The Cystic Fibrosis Association of Ireland commissioned Dr. Ronnie Pollock to review the existing hospital services for people with cystic fibrosis in the context of accepted international standards. The report, which was published in 2005, provided an assessment of need for current and future cystic fibrosis patients and made a number of recommendations with regard to the numbers and categories of staff that are appropriate for a modern, multidisciplinary cystic fibrosis service. The report concluded that cystic fibrosis care should be provided in fewer units of a more significant size so that viable staffing levels can be maintained and to ensure that staff have a sufficient workload to enable them maintain their skills level.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Following publication of the report, the Health Service Executive established a working group to examine cystic fibrosis services. The group is multidisciplinary in its composition. The terms of reference of the working group were to review the current configuration and delivery of services to persons with cystic fibrosis in Ireland and to make recommendations for the reconfiguration, improvement and development of those services.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The Department is advised that the working group is due to report shortly and will be making specific recommendations in regard to a range of service improvements required for persons with cystic fibrosis, in particular the need to increase the level of clinical, nursing and allied health professionals staffing in cystic fibrosis units around the country. In advance of the report, and as an acknowledgement of the need to enhance services for persons with cystic fibrosis, additional revenue funding of &euro;4.8 million has been allocated specifically for the development of services in 2006. It is expected that a significant number of additional medical, nursing and allied health professional posts will be created, and these will greatly improve the delivery of specialist care to cystic fibrosis patients throughout the country.</P><Col N="1508"/>
      <P>The Minister wishes to see significant improvement this year in the level of services available to persons with cystic fibrosis arising from this investment. As part of the implementation process, she has asked the HSE to address in particular the identified deficits at the national adult referral centre at St. Vincent&rsquo;s University Hospital in Dublin.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. F. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I am disappointed with the reply, which I believed would be more detailed. It did not place much emphasis on the need for new isolation units. Although the Minister of State acknowledged the need for extra staff, he should reconsider this issue. Perhaps he could communicate directly with me. We have ignored the problem in the past and should now shed light on it. Isolation units and the opening of a new 30-bed unit at St. Vincent&rsquo;s University Hospital are vital.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Browne, who will have as much, if not more, interest in this matter than me. The economic argument in favour of providing natural gas to County Wexford is fairly compelling. As the Minister of State will be aware, economic indicators suggest County Wexford needs to increase its industrial base. On most economic scales, Wexford, as with most other counties in the south east, is lagging behind other parts of the country.</P>
      <P>The natural gas pipeline has been brought to counties Waterford, Kilkenny, Carlow and Wicklow, which all share a border with County Wexford. For some reason, Wexford has not been successful to date and I therefore ask the Minister of State to use his good offices to remedy this. New hospitals and hotels have been built in Wexford and tourism is strong, but the county&rsquo;s industries are at a serious competitive disadvantage because natural gas is not available to them. I understand savings of some 33% can be made on energy costs if one has access to natural gas.</P>
      <P>It surprised me that the natural gas pipelines to Waterford and Arklow in Wicklow have reached maximum capacity. Therefore, if Wexford is to receive natural gas, a new spur will probably have to be brought from the Dublin-Cork line. This leads one to question the projections made in making investment decisions. It is not so long since the gas pipeline was laid to Arklow and that it is insufficient to serve Wexford is evidence of <Col N="1509"/>a certain lack of foresight. The Commission for Energy Regulation produced a report in 2001 and it focused very much on the viability of the pipeline. However, this must be balanced by considering the economic benefits of the locations the pipeline serves.</P>
      <P>The provision of a pipeline should be considered in terms of the provision of infrastructure to the county. Nobody would suggest we should build roads to particular locations on the basis of their economic viability. Infrastructure must be made available across the regions, particularly to peripheral areas. The Government has a policy of decentralisation and, if it is to be effective economically, infrastructure must be provided across the regions.</P>
      <P>The only county in the south east and along the east coast that does not have natural gas is Wexford. I hope the review Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann will be undertaking in the near future will consider more than the economic viability of a pipeline to Wexford, and that the interests of the county, including those of its industries and public services, will be factored into any decision made. The Minister of State will obviously be keeping this foremost in his mind when any decision is made. I wish him well in his position generally and particularly in respect of this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. J. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Jim Walsh for his kind words and for raising this matter on which I welcome the opportunity to speak to Members.</P>
      <P>Bearing in mind today&rsquo;s debate and my response to the debate on energy issues in this House last Thursday, it is reassuring that Senators have demonstrated a robust interest in energy matters generally. The Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Noel Dempsey, and I look forward, therefore, to the support of Senators in discussing and agreeing the energy (miscellaneous provisions) Bill 2006, which is scheduled for publication shortly.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources has no direct responsibility regarding natural gas connection policy. Under the Gas (Interim) (Regulation) Act 2002, this responsibility has been given to the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, a statutorily independent body established under the Electricity Regulation Act 1999. Among the CER&rsquo;s functions are the granting of licences and consents for the construction or operation of the natural gas network. An associated function involves responsibility for establishing the detailed criteria for evaluating natural gas network extensions, which are set down in its connection policy.</P>
      <P>In carrying out its functions, the CER must have regard to the protection of the interests of natural gas consumers. There is therefore an onus <Col N="1510"/>on the CER to ensure that a proposal to extend the natural gas network is economically viable before issuing consent. We must also take into account the fact that the natural gas network is paid for by natural gas consumers. The Act of 2002 states a public service obligation cannot be imposed for the purpose of extending the natural gas system to new areas of supply on a non-commercial basis. It is evident, therefore, that any uneconomic network extension would involve, as a direct consequence, the increase of natural gas tariffs for all consumers. The CER&rsquo;s objective in setting its connection policy is therefore clear &mdash; it is to achieve a balance between the expansion of the natural gas network and keeping down the cost of natural gas to consumers.</P>
      <P>Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann, BGE, which owns and operates the natural gas network, is mandated under the gas Acts to execute only economically viable projects that will earn a reasonable return on investment. Consequently, any proposed extensions to the network must first meet with BGE&rsquo;s strict economic criteria. While it is open to other companies to seek a consent or licence to construct or operate a natural gas pipeline, it is evident that economic return on investment would be even more of a prime motivating factor for them.</P>
      <P Just="Left">On the matter of bringing gas to Wexford, BGE engaged DKM Economic Consultants in 2001 to conduct a review of potential future gas transmission markets in Ireland. One of the potential markets considered in the consultants&rsquo; study was a connection off the Cork-Dublin pipeline servicing Wexford via New Ross and Enniscorthy. This route, rather than the existing connection to Waterford, was explored as the Waterford connection did not have sufficient capacity to supply Wexford. The study found that the construction of a 62 km high-pressure transmission pipeline would be necessary to bring gas to Wexford. It was estimated that such a pipeline extension would require grant aid, a subsidy greater than 90%, or a grant in excess of &euro;20 million in 2000 prices, if it were to be allowed to proceed. Such a proposal fell into the category of being economically unviable. However, with the concurrence of the Minister as a shareholder, Bord G&aacute;is recently proposed changes to the CER&rsquo;s current connection policy. If adopted, the proposed changes will improve the prospects of towns and other areas hoping to connect to the natural gas network. The CER is engaged in a public consultation process on the proposed changes. I expect it will make a decision shortly on whether it will adopt the Bord G&aacute;is proposals. Bord G&aacute;is has advised me that it plans to update its 2001 study on future gas markets after the CER has made its decision known. The revised study will incorporate updated information on projected demand, costs and any revision of the CER&rsquo;s connection policy. As part of the task of <Col N="1511"/>updating the 2001 study, Bord G&aacute;is will consult local development agencies and authorities in the potential market regions, including County Wexford. Work is scheduled to begin on the updated study with a view to commencement following the outcome of the CER consultation on connection policy, with a scheduled completion date of early 2007.</P>
      <P>I would like to conclude by speaking briefly on the Department&rsquo;s role in the development of gas infrastructure. While the CER must, of necessity, focus on the economic viability of future gas projects, the Department must take a broader policy perspective that reflects Government policy objectives, including balanced regional development. The Department is engaged in an assessment of the role, if any, of natural gas infrastructure in facilitating regional development, having regard to the national spatial strategy. This assessment has commenced with a feasibility study and cost-benefit analysis of bringing gas to the north west. The initiative of Bord G&aacute;is in bringing forward its proposals to the CER for a change in the connection policy is to be welcomed. In that context, I welcome the commitment of Bord G&aacute;is to update its study on future gas markets across the regions.</P>
      <P>I accept the point made by Senator Jim Walsh, who is from County Wexford, about the availability of natural gas in the surrounding counties of Waterford, Carlow, Kilkenny and Wicklow. I hope Bord G&aacute;is will look favourably on any application to extend the network into County Wexford. I assure Senator Walsh that the Wexford county manager, Mr. Eddie Breen, is proposing a project that will deal with the issues he has raised by ensuring that Bord G&aacute;is will have a proper investigative role in deciding whether gas should come to County Wexford. I thank the Senator for raising this issue.</P>

      <P>We should proceed in the manner I have outlined. An election is planned to elect people to the Comhairle um Oideachas Gaeltachta agus Gaelscola&iacute;ochta, which will give advice on teaching and learning through the Irish language in gaelscoileanna and in Gaeltacht areas. As politicians, we understand the election process better than most. The names of the candidates have been submitted. Some people thought they would have an opportunity to withdraw their names from the list of candidates after they had seen the full list. They might have liked to step aside in favour of another candidate who shares their view of the world, as normally happens in any election process. It is amazing that the people going forward for election have not been given a list of the people who are voting. Can Senators imagine that being allowed to happen in any kind of election, regardless of its importance? This is a light touch regulation &mdash; there is no need for a constitutional position but fair play is necessary. Those who are voting have not been given an opportunity to get to know the people seeking election and those seeking election have not been given an opportunity to make their views known to the people who are voting. Nobody can win.</P>
      <P>I will repeat what I said in Irish. I have raised this matter in a very honest way. I am not trying to take a cheap political shot at anybody. This important group of people has not yet been allowed to do its job, but that is a separate issue that I will talk about on another occasion. It is important that they be given every support. I want them to start off with full, proper procedures so that nobody can question whether they are above suspicion.</P>
      <P>I know the Minister is a sensible woman and I would be amazed if she did not share my views on this. We do not need to carry a big stick on this issue. The easy way to do this is to put the election on hold, set up rules and regulation and then look at it again.</P>

	<P>I thank the Senator for raising this issue and will respond on behalf of the Minister for Education and Science, who is in China signing an agreement on the mutual recognition of qualifications between Ireland and China.</P>
      <P>Comhairle was first established in March 2002 and is composed of a chairperson and 22 representative members. Membership of the council was agreed in 2001 following consultations with relevant interests. The board is composed of <Col N="1514"/>nominees of Eagra&iacute;ocht na Scoileanna Gaeltachta, gaelscoileanna, teachers, parents, school management, teacher unions, Foras na Gaeilge, and Comhdh&aacute;il N&aacute;isi&uacute;nta na Gaeilge. The composition of the council also provides for two nominees of the Minister and two members co-opted by Comhairle, who are to have a particular knowledge of and expertise in the study and research of the Irish language. The first members of Comhairle were appointed on 12 March 2002 for a four-year term. The nominations in respect of teachers, parents and school management were provided by gaelscoileanna and Eagra&iacute;ocht na Scoileanna Gaeltachta when the body was first established. The first four year term of office of Comhairle will end on 11 March 2006.</P>
      <P>It was agreed at the autumn 2005 meeting of Comhairle, at the request of two organisations, that the nominations for future elections of the parent, teacher and management representatives of Gaeltacht schools and gaelscoileanna would be organised directly by Comhairle. A document outlining a five stage process was approved at the board meeting of 24 November 2005. The first stage was for a letter to issue to the chairperson of all boards of management of Gaeltacht and all-Irish schools seeking details of the representatives of parents, management and teacher interests on the boards so that elections could be organised. A copy would also be sent to the school principal. The second stage was for a letter to issue to the chairperson of all boards of management of Gaeltacht and all-Irish schools enclosing individual letters to each named representative of teachers, management and parents, seeking nominations of candidates seeking election. This would seek details such as the signed agreement of the person seeking election together with his or her proposer and seconder.</P>
      <P>The third stage was for preparation of separate ballot papers listing the candidates proposed for election to the management, teacher and parent seats on Comhairle in respect of Gaeltacht and all-Irish schools. These were to issue in registered post to the chairpersons of the school boards of management addressed to the individuals named from stage one, with a copy also sent to the school principal. An advertisement was also to be placed in <i>L&aacute;</i>and <i>Foinse</i>. Stage four was that on the prescribed date, the votes would be counted in the presence of a scrutineer and any other voters who wish to be present. The final stage was for the results to be posted on Comhairle&rsquo;s website and successful candidates notified. These rules were prepared by a sub-committee and later approved by the board of Comhairle, but as the election progressed, it emerged that they were not sufficiently detailed to deal with a number of issues which subsequently arose.</P>
      <P>Given that there has not been sufficient time for these specific issues to be discussed and agreed in advance of the election, the Minister <Col N="1515"/>for Education and Science has agreed to extend the term of office of the current board for a further period as an exceptional matter. This will allow time for Comhairle to engage in detailed discussions with the relevant interests to allow for the election procedures to be specified in greater detail and agreed with the parties concerned. I thank the Senator again for raising this issue.</P>
