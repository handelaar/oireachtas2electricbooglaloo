	<P Just="Left">I have notice from Senator Tuffy that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to ensure our regime for dealing with sex offenders is comparable with those in Northern Ireland and the United Kingdom and that there are no gaps that allow those registered as sex offenders in those other jurisdictions to move here for the purposes of avoiding stricter controls.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Morrissey of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources to outline the legality of razor clam fishing in or near special areas of conservation, specifically off Portmarnock beach.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Bannon of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1" Just="Left">The need for the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs to provide an update on the current status of the application made by Mac Eoin Park Residents&rsquo; Association, Longford, for funding under the programme of grants for locally based community and voluntary organisations.</P>
        <P>I have also received notice from Senator Ulick Burke of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Health and Children to reassess the Comhairle na nOspid&eacute;al report which opposed the establishment of a neurosurgical facility at University College Hospital Galway, to re-examine the need for such a unit and to provide the necessary funding.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected the matters raised by Senators <Col N="494"/>Tuffy, Morrissey and Bannon and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.   Senator Ulick Burke may give notice on another day of the matter he wishes to raise.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Cathaoirleach to forgive me for being parochial this morning if I raise a matter of great concern to people in south and west Dublin.  A hole in the road yesterday evening caused the entire south and west of the city to be caught in a traffic gridlock for about four or five hours.  While I acknowledge that emergency works must be carried out, the idea that one hole in a road in south Dublin can cause such chaos to commuters and their families is a matter of public concern.  It also highlights the fragility of our transport system in this city.  There is no public transport system worth talking about and motorists have to use the road. Will the Government bring forward promised legislation on the Dublin transport authority and, more importantly, ensure motorists are given adequate warning of these emergency issues as they arise, in particular with reference to motorways?</P>
        <P>My understanding is that works on the upgrade are not taking place on a 24-seven basis.  It is crazy that in the case of such a major piece of infrastructure, no work takes place on Saturdays and Sundays or in the evenings, when there is less traffic. If we are serious in our attitude to public infrastructure, a system must be devised to ensure road projects such as this are built on a 24-seven basis until the work is completed.  This is an important issue upon which we should reflect.</P>
        <P>I ask the Leader to ask the Minister for Transport for information on a very serious case which arose yesterday in Dungarvan District Court.  A number of fines were struck out on the basis that the garda&iacute; did not have the original copy of the offence notice to produce in court.  Will amending legislation be introduced to deal with this matter?  Will the Government appeal this decision to a higher court?  What is the current position?  The penalty points system forms the basis for trying <Col N="495"/>to improve driver behaviour and performance.  This is an example of botched legislation by the Minister for Transport who once again has been shown to be unable to bring effective legislation through both Houses to introduce the types of penalties that would change driver behaviour.  The Minister has put amending legislation through this House twice already.  Perhaps it is a case of third time unlucky.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>It is appalling that work on the M50 is not carried out at weekends. However, I passed by one night recently at 3 a.m. and people were working on the motorway but they were not there four hours earlier.  I came to the conclusion they must start work after the pubs close.  Generally speaking, they are not working there at weekends.</P>
        <P>This House has discussed on a number of occasions the problems arising from children coping with autism.  Those difficulties arose from the Department of Education and Science failing to deal with the educational rights and needs of those children.  What happened when the Oireachtas or the Department did not deal with those rights and needs?  They finished up in the courts.  Court judgments then determined how the State would operate in this area.  A court judgment in Cork led to the appointment of special needs assistants and a range of other support structures in schools.  These came in an unplanned manner as a reaction to the judgment.</P>
        <P>Two days ago, a judge found against the Department of Education and Science when it provided a different certificate to students with dyslexia who had completed the leaving certificate.  It had a conditional element to it which stated that while the certificate was issued, it should be noted that the student was not tested in spelling, grammar or syntax.  I do not know where this will bring us.  The Department of Education and Science is going to appeal this to a higher court.  This should not or cannot be the way things are done.  It is an appallingly bad way of dealing with this issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Children with dyslexia and their families have enough to cope with without wondering how their leaving certificate will be perceived.  They do not want to be worrying about going to court to defend their rights.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This House had a major debate on education.  Senators from all sides of the House argued that the education system should be rights-based.  We all fought for it, but the Government did not concede it.  However, the Government made a good case and said it would deal with it in a proper manner and a supportive fashion.  This is the first real test.  The Department says it is going to the courts to get clarity.  That is not the way to find clarity.  The Department needs to determine how <Col N="496"/>it is going to deal with this issue.  There is a problem, but it needs to find a solution.  The parents of children with dyslexia should not need to drag the State through the courts so that they may get educational equality.  Members spoke in debates on the issue about inclusion, integration and support structures for people with special needs.  The current approach by the State is not the way to proceed.  I ask the Department to reconsider.  I would like the Minister to explain to the House what the Department is doing and what the other options are.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not think Senator Brian Hayes was being in the least bit parochial when he mentioned yesterday&rsquo;s traffic problems.  Fortunately, I did not have to use a car yesterday.  The issue is not what happened in Dublin; rather, it is the perception senior public administrators have about their responsibilities to the public.  They do not have to think through the consequences of their decisions.  When they need to dig a hole in a road, they go through the necessary formulae and do nothing further.  What happened yesterday was an example of their indifference to the public and its need to know.</P>
        <P>When I returned to Dublin after my short absence from this House in 1997, I could see that traffic was a problem in the city.  The planners and organisers in Dublin seem to think that a road can be closed without enormous consequences for the public.  The disruption we witnessed yesterday is what happens when a city is full.  I do not want to talk about Dublin traffic.  I want to talk about the decision making and communications systems of senior public officials which seem to be sadly deficient.</P>
        <P>I am seeking a debate on ethics in our society.  Two different issues which relate to this have emerged recently.  The council on science and innovation has released a report on medical research.  While much in the report is good, it also contains a most unfortunate recommendation.  It states that Ireland needs to become a location of choice for medical trials and that the country is losing such trials to other locations where securing ethical approval is less cumbersome.</P>
        <P>I know why we have cumbersome approval mechanisms.  The son of a friend of mine died in a medical trial 25 years ago.  He was homeless and down on his luck at the time and certain inducements were offered to people to take part in medical trials.  It was out of his death that we put together good regulations for clinical trials.  When scientists, including me, are let loose on issues like this without ethical constraints, that is the daft kind of recommendation they come up with.  I do not think Ireland should become an easy place to conduct medical trials.  That is the direct opposite of what we want.  I would like to debate that report.  I know there are Members on all sides of the House who would be wary about making it easier for drugs to be trialled on people.  When such trials are held, it is always the most <Col N="497"/>vulnerable and least able to defend themselves who are on the receiving end of them.  No matter what fine words might be said, if we do not have vigorous ethical regulation, there will be misuse, abuse and victimisation.</P>
        <P>Related to this is the fact that our National Pensions Reserve Fund, which is now perhaps the biggest single investor in the country, has no ethical limitations on what it does with our money.  Its counterpart in Norway, which uses both income tax and other tax revenues to build up a similar fund, has ethical constraints and manages to do very well.  Our pensions reserve fund can be invested in the arms industry, about which we are so concerned because of the proliferation of arms in this country.  It can be invested in embryonic stem cell research about which many citizens are very concerned.  Indeed it may have to be invested there because it is required to invest in areas where the returns are greatest.  If returns are greatest in some of these dubious areas of investment, it must invest there.  I appeal to the Government to introduce ethical guidelines for the National Pensions Reserve Fund.  It is a way of doing good in the world, and it is also a way of ensuring our consciences are not affronted by what our pensions reserve fund is used for.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>That is one recipe for ensuring that we will not have a pension fund for the future.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>That is rubbish.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is absolute nonsense.  It is more a reflection on the Senator&rsquo;s ethics than it is on the issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Leyden should not be trying to initiate a debate.  The Senator should not smile either.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator should save the smiles and the blushes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I will find the Cathaoirleach&rsquo;s ruling difficult to adhere to.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Whether the Senator finds it difficult or not, he will have to adhere to it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept that.  However, it is in order to respond to&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>No.  It is definitely not in order to respond.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>That is the Leader&rsquo;s job.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>It is for the Leader, not Senators, to respond.  I hope Senator Leyden bears that in mind.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="498"/>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I offer my apologies.  Can the Leader arrange a debate next week on the Estimates for adult and further education?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>We are having such a debate this morning.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I am seeking a debate specifically on education and not on the Estimates as a whole.  This is the 40th anniversary of the introduction of free education by Donogh O&rsquo;Malley under Se&aacute;n Lemass.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Of what party were they members?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I also want to recognise that Niamh Bhreathnach, as Minister for Education and Science under Albert Reynolds and a Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government, introduced free fees at third level.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to raise a point of order.  The Senator is deliberately misleading the House.  That occurred under a Fine Gael-Labour-Democratic Left Government.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not correct.  It occurred under Niamh Bhreathnach and a Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Senator have a question on the Order of Business?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>No, the Senator is wrong.  It occurred under the following Government.  The Senator should sit down.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not wrong.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>Some time ago Members were invited to Buswells Hotel by the Irish Postmasters Union.  Its members were concerned about the closure of post offices throughout the country.  They were also concerned about the loss of income.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The House will be aware that recently the European Court of Justice notified the Minister for Social and Family Affairs that next year, the &euro;50 million social welfare contract will go to open tender.  It is anticipated An Post is likely to lose the contract because the Department wants to move to the electronic transfer-type system.  In that context, we must be concerned that next year we will see an acceleration in the closure of post offices around the country.  The post office is the heart of many local rural communities.  In many cases elderly people visit the post office once a week to collect their social welfare payments.  Approximately 70% of such payments are processed by post offices.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am very concerned about the future of rural Ireland if we see the demise of those post offices.  In addition, the link between the post office and elderly people has been very valuable and I worry about the future in that regard.  I ask the Minister <Col N="499"/>to come to the House to explain what is likely to happen.  I would also like to hear his view on the European Court of Justice decision.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator O&rsquo;Toole in regard to the issue he raised on which we should have a further discussion.  I ask the Leader to try to arrange a debate with the Minister for Education and Science on her Department&rsquo;s assessment procedures and how it carries out assessments, particularly in State examinations where the problem lies.  Another discussion on how we assess special needs students at junior and senior levels is overdue.  Rather than going back to the courts, this is a way forward.  I have no doubt the Minister would agree with our thinking in that regard and I would like her to come to the House to clarify the situation.</P>
        <P>Perhaps we should have a further discussion on adult education and the direction in which we are going because there are many pitfalls in this area as well as duplication of courses which should be streamlined.  A full discussion with the Minister on all these issues would be very worthwhile.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I ask the Leader to find a way to move forward the Civil Partnership Bill.  It is very important it is moved forward if we are to be taken seriously as legislators.  The Government has procrastinated on this in an extraordinary fashion.  The matter has been referred to various committees, including the Oireachtas All-Party Committee on the Constitution reviewing the family.  It reported along lines very similar to the Bill before this House.  There is also the Colley advisory committee.  Reports in today&rsquo;s newspapers indicate it is very much on track with the Bill.  The courts continually reprove the Oireachtas for leaving these important legislative decisions for judicial decisions.  Having become the laggard of Europe in this regard, it is important we move forward.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I call for a debate on the Middle East for a particular reason.  I had reason to speak to the Israeli ambassador in recent days and to bring to his attention illegal demolitions taking place in the area around south Hebron, including in the village of At-Tuwani.  He attempted to be helpful but pleaded difficulties of various kinds.  Yesterday I received copies of military notices indicating demolition orders.  These are against the most vulnerable people, that is, Palestinian subsistence farmers living in caves.  Rudimentary attempts to provide them with the most basic sanitary and water arrangements have been demolished by the Israeli army while parallel illegal Israeli settlements are accommodated and provided with water and sewerage treatment facilities.  This ties in with a report in the newspapers today that 39% of these settlements not only break international law but break Israeli law as determined by the Israeli high court as far back as 1979, that is, that these settlements must not be built on land <Col N="500"/>owned by Palestinians.  It is important this House continues to monitor the situation.</P>
        <P>I have come from a meeting, to which I must return, at which a presentation is being made by Mr. David Kilgour, a Member of the Canadian Parliament and a highly respected figure, on organ harvesting in China.  The meeting was facilitated by Senator O&rsquo;Toole and myself.  It is important we take up this matter because it is appalling to think there have been 60,000 organ transplants in a situation where only a couple of thousand prisoners have been executed.  Nobody in China is officially prepared to say from where these organs come.  It is clear prisoners are held and their organs are harvested.  Even the words used are appalling.  One can order organs from people who are still alive and people will be killed to order to provide organs.  This issue is important because some of the newspapers here, including the<i> Irish Independent, </i>have a policy of thrashing this type of material.  Last week there was a disgraceful article by some little pimple in that newspaper whose name I cannot even remember who derided the Dali Lama.  This House should look at what was said.</P>
        <P>I completely agree with Senator Ryan on the need to introduce ethical constraints.  It is only fair, for example, to those who govern the National Pensions Reserve Fund.  If they are charged with making as much money as possible, then they could be held accountable if they do not invest in dubious enterprises.  I have been in contact with the Sudan divestment group and I had a very useful meeting on this issue last week with the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Conor Lenihan.  He indicated the issue is being looked at and that there is a United Nations protocol advising on it, although it is not mandatory.  The Green Party has legislation before the other House in that regard.  I am co-operating in the introduction of a protocol seeking ethical considerations in terms investments, as I am sure will Senator Ryan and other Members.  I believe there will be all-party agreement on this issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>I, too, wish to take up the question of ethical issues.  There was a time when people who focused on such issues were depicted as old-fashioned, irrelevant, not politically correct, out of step with the economic culture and so on.  This created a vacuum which was often filled by vested interests who wanted to promote an issue contrary to beliefs of people in this country.  Recently I have noticed creeping into newspaper articles and such like the idea that we should in some way accept nuclear power as an option even though we know the majority of people do not agree with it.  The same can be said of neutrality.  There has been a chipping away at the stand the country has taken down through the years.  There are also ethical issues in respect of Iraq and the Third World.  It is important we continue to debate these issues.</P><Col N="501"/>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P Just="Left">Senator Ryan mentioned medical experiments.  There was not only the case he mentioned but there have been several cases where people, who were obviously not in a position to look after themselves financially, were induced to take part in medical experiments with disastrous results.  There is, however, a change of attitude in this country and that old order is gone.  People expect legislators, in particular, to come to the fore and to debate these issues.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>The court decision two days ago in regard to students with dyslexia is welcome because it highlights once again this Government&rsquo;s lack of concern about people with special needs.  Traditionally, people with special needs were given an advantage at examinations.  They were given special attention to help them through examinations on medical or educational grounds.  The fact the Department has said it will challenge this decision to a higher court is difficult for people to accept, particularly the parents and children who have achieved much by proceeding in the educational system and sitting the leaving certificate.  Having a supplementary addendum to their leaving certificates highlighting the assistance to bring it to the attention of those who may seek their results is disgraceful.  This is a new departure.  The fact that it has happened without intervention by the Minister is a further disgrace.</P>
           </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I hope the Minister will reconsider going to a further court to reverse that decision and provide support for people with special needs rather than highlighting it again in the courts.  Let us consider this Government&rsquo;s history on special needs.  The first Disability Bill was withdrawn.  On the second Bill the Government fought tooth and nail to deny the rights of those people in all areas, especially their entitlement to equal status.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator has made a good case for a debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Cathaoirleach.  I ask that the Minister come to this House and explain why she supports such an idea.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly"><NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to follow on the issue raised by Senator Finucane of post offices in small communities and rural areas.  I would like to ascertain whether it will be possible to get the Minister to discuss with us how the situation will be dealt with.  In Carrigaholt, west Clare, the post office closed some time ago.  The salary for a new person to take up the job is so small that it is tantamount to closing the office.  As Senator Finucane said, the life blood of many smaller communities depends on the post office, the Garda station and schools.  In Carrigaholt there is a belief that An Post, by offering such a meagre salary for this <Col N="502"/>position, intends to close the office, which would be devastating for the village.  We could usefully debate this issue with the Minister.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>I have raised the issue of domestic violence on a number of occasions in the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>It will be debated next week.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I heard that from Mr. Eamonn McCormack and I thank the Leader, who is also interested in that area.  I was prompted to raise it again when Senator Quinn yesterday expressed his concern and sorrow at the death of that lovely, young Latvian woman, Ms Baiba Saulite, in north Dublin.  He said after it had been mentioned once in the House, it would be forgotten.  That was incorrect, and I am sure Senator Quinn was not castigating us for that.  Her death will not be forgotten.  It will continue to upset me that she and 124 other women were murdered in the past ten years.  Last September we all received a booklet from Women&rsquo;s Aid informing us about the campaign that will take place over the next two weeks to highlight domestic abuse.  According to the booklet, 123 women have been murdered in the past ten years.  That number is now 125.  Two more were murdered since September, that Latvian woman being the most recent.  These women suffer the final blow and die.  Many thousands of women suffer silently and some of them will eventually be murdered.  We are not coming to grips with it.  We could link that with the level of serious crime, where life means nothing, where somebody can walk up with his face uncovered and shoot a woman in her home.  What has this country come to?</P>

      <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>We must get to grips with it.  We will not forget that lovely Latvian woman, her two young children and all the other women.  What will we do about it?  I welcome the opportunity to debate this fully next week.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Mr. Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Leader for a debate on the economy.  <i>The Economist</i> publication for 2007 has been issued and Ireland is again shining with a gross domestic product, GDP, per person far in excess of our European neighbours, which shows we have done things right.  GDP is not the only measure of success.  Another measure is the sharing of that wealth and that is why I would welcome a debate on the economy in which to look forward and say where we got it right, for example by investing in education in the 1960s or neutrality.  It is difficult to look after the less well-off while spending 3% or 4% of one&rsquo;s GDP on defence.</P>

	<P>Over decades we have ensured that money has been expended for all the people <Col N="503"/>of this country.  I would like a debate to focus on the economy, education and the need for continued spending in that area.  Now that we have become a wealthy nation, we must examine research and innovation.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Finucane&rsquo;s comments on the Government&rsquo;s support of An Post&rsquo;s closure of small, rural post offices.  This is having a devastating effect on rural communities, especially on elderly people living in remote rural areas.  Last Monday An Post used a heavy hand to take services from Moyne post office in north County Longford.  This was a shameful attack on a family that has given three generations of postal service to the community.  It is wrong and should not happen.  The Deputies in the midlands cried crocodile tears on the issue and pretended to set up meetings with the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Noel Dempsey.  However we know the Minister is fully behind An Post&rsquo;s closure of the small, rural post offices in this country.  He will regret that day because people in rural areas are waiting in the long grass to attack the Government on this issue.</P>

	<P>Does Senator Bannon have a question?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to raise another matter, which I have raised on several occasions.  Will the Leader explain why we never debated the Barr report on the circumstances surrounding the death of Mr. John Carthy in Abbeylara on Holy Thursday 2000?  Tonight a book on this topic written by a journalist will be launched by a former Taoiseach in Longford.  We set up tribunals at huge expense to the State.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid=""><NameTxt>Senators</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>This tribunal cost &euro;18 million, sat for approximately 208 days and interviewed 169 witnesses.  What is the Government afraid of?  Why have we not debated the Barr tribunal in either House?  It is shameful and flies in the face of democracy when journalists write books on the topic while we have not debated it in the House.  The report is embarrassing to the Government because of the lack of resources given to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for investment in legal advice.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator has made a good case for a debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I am entitled to call for a debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>While I do not deny the Senator, he has made his case adequately and astutely.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelCoonan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coonan</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the calls for a debate on the delivery of services.  The post office has been mentioned.  Will the Leader arrange a debate with the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government on the delivery of services at local government level and the funding of local government?  At a recent meeting of North Tipperary County Council, the county manager stated that he could not deliver the service to which councillors and the people of North Tipperary were entitled because of lack of funding.  The councillors were dealing with the planning process, the bane of the lives of all public representatives.  The county manager was prevented from hiring additional staff to provide a proper planning service because of the Government embargo on recruitment.  Is that a satisfactory state of affairs during an unprecedented economic boom?</P>
        <P>Without stealth taxes and local charges imposed on those in rural areas we would have a crisis in local government.  At the 11th hour, planners must seek additional information or issue a refusal because they do not have enough time to deal with all planning matters.  This is disgraceful and the public deserves better.  I call for a debate and for the Minister to debate the delivery, quality and funding of local government services.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>During the autumn we have been preoccupied with the issues of road deaths, road safety, speeding and drink driving.  It is very frustrating when cases are thrown out on technicalities.  Justice is supposed to be an even scales but it seems that the feather of a technicality weighs evenly with or even more than the substance of an offence.  We ought to review the administration of the law to ensure this does not happen as frequently as it does.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Senator Coonan&rsquo;s comments on the funding of local authorities.  What is the status of the Government&rsquo;s commitment, given prior to the last election, to reduce numbers in the public service?  Last year there was an increase of 14,000 in the number of people employed yet crucial services, such as local authorities, are suffering.  Senator Coonan referred to planning offices that cannot employ additional staff.</P>
        <P>I agree with Senator Terry&rsquo;s call for a debate on serious crime.  Two serious incidents occurred in the past few days and another occurred in the Dublin mountains.  This morning we heard of a shooting incident in Drogheda.  It would be opportune if the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform explained to the House the action he will take.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Brian Hayes need not fear that the issue he raised was parochial.  It became a national issue, as reported by RTE.  We <Col N="505"/>all know someone caught in the gridlock for four hours because of a hole in the road.  Senator Hayes asked about legislation for the Dublin transport authority.  I will make inquiries.  The Senator also asked why work cannot be done on roads 24 hours a day.  We see work carried out on many roads at night.  The spokesperson on the radio this morning said it was often unsafe to work at night despite using searchlights and other apparatus.  It should certainly be done at weekends but I do not know if it is feasible to work through the night.  Sometimes the weather is so foul it cannot be done.</P>
        <P>Senator Hayes also asked about Dungarvan District Court and whether amending legislation is needed.  It seems it is necessary but I will check.  The charge was dismissed when the original copy of the offence notice could not be produced.  This sounds so futile a reason that I find it difficult to understand.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole referred to autism and how it was dealt with by the appointment of SNAs.  The dyslexia matter seemed a contrary issue but the idea of another court case, which may rule in favour of the Department, seems crass.  I hope the appeal does not go ahead.  There is an ingrained approach in the Civil Service that when one loses a court case it is automatically appealed to a higher level.  Expensive barristers and solicitors are hired.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not the money of the Civil Service.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>As Minister for Education I intervened a number of times, pointing out that the Department would not win.  It requires such intervention.</P>
        <P>Senator Ryan referred to senior public administrators.  I was struck by the man to whom he referred, who sounded like a nice person.  He was caught out badly because they had not told radio stations or alerted the Automobile Association of Ireland.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>They had, according to Mr. Conor Faughnan, but there was insufficient publicity.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>People drove home without knowing what was ahead of them.  The senior administrators do not take into account the fact that ordinary people will be discommoded.  Senator Ryan stated that an update of the communications system was needed.</P>
        <P>The Senator also seeks a debate on ethics because we are losing out on funding due to the ethical regulation of our medical trials.  Long may they remain in place.  Firms must run trials on drugs but it is correct that they are governed by ethics.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Ryan raised a valid point in respect of the National Pensions Reserve Fund.  It has no ethical guidelines in respect of where it invests <Col N="506"/>our money.  The idea that it must invest where it will potentially receive the greatest return is a constraint.  We object to the arms race and we have debates on the Middle East.  However, our money may be funding the arms trade and embryonic stem cell research.  I do not know what Department we could invite for the debate.</P>

	<P>The National Pensions Reserve Fund is under the aegis of the Department of Finance.</P>
        <P>With regard to Senator Leyden, I do not wish to smile either.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Leader should reply to what was legitimately raised.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator sought a debate on adult education, which we will endeavour to have.  Next week is the last week the Minister of State at the Department of Education, Deputy de Valera, will be in the Houses and it would be good to have someone of her calibre here.</P>
        <P>Senator Finucane referred to the closure of post offices.  The European diktat insists that the service must be put to tender.  Warnings have been issued for the past ten years and Ireland keeps passing them on to the post offices.  If the postal service cannot win the tender in an open market, post offices will close.  The Government does not seek this, despite what other contributors have said. This &euro;50 million contract keeps post offices going in many rural areas.  Certain people always talk about how we must save our post offices, a point with which I agree.  However, do we always use them?  Do people who live in rural areas with small post offices within their catchment areas carry out their business in them?  Senator Finucane said post offices are the heartbeat of a community in rural Ireland, which is a very good phrase.  Post offices are the heartbeat of rural communities but they will grind to a halt if people do not use them, if the &euro;50 million contract is lost or if the European dictum in respect of social welfare is implemented.</P>
        <P>The Department of Social and Family Affairs wishes everyone to receive their payments electronically.  This is fine in theory but many people in rural areas, particularly elderly people, do not wish to avail of this option.  Rather than go to a bank they want to go to a place where they know the man or woman behind the counter who will give them their pensions and engage in social interaction.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a social occasion.  </P>
      </Speaker><Col N="507"/>
      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>It is very positive.  I hope the European knife does not fall this year because it will have an awful effect on post offices.  </P>
        <P>Senator Ormonde argued that we could look at how State examinations are assessed and possibly take away the likelihood of the damning indictment relating to dyslexia.  So many very worthwhile people in the public arena have dyslexia and have made a great success of their lives.  I remember meeting the actress, Susan Hampshire, who told me she was dyslexic.  She spoke about the great struggles she endured to be accepted and how she overcame them.  Senator Ormonde echoed Senator Leyden&rsquo;s call for a debate on adult education in this House.</P>
        <P>Senator Norris called for progress in respect of civil partnerships.  Next week, the Government will consider a report commissioned by it on this issue.  We will see what happens after that.  Senator Norris also called for a debate on the Middle East and the demolition orders issued by Israel which are affecting vulnerable people.  He also raised the issue of organ harvesting in China, which is chilling in the extreme.</P>
        <P>Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; spoke about the need for a debate on ethical issues and nuclear power.  We constantly encounter sentences in articles which are part of a softening up process in respect of nuclear power as an option, neutrality and other issues which we are made to feel are old-fashioned or no longer relevant.</P>
        <P>Senator Ulick Burke mentioned the court decision in respect of the two students with dyslexia and I agree with him that it should not be appealed.  I will inform the Minister&rsquo;s office about what was said here today about this issue.  Senator Daly spoke about the demise of post offices, particularly the post office in Carrigaholt.</P>
        <P>Senator Terry spoke about domestic violence, a debate for which she has continually asked.  That 125 women have been murdered in ten years and that so many more have nearly been murdered is so quickly forgotten.  It is difficult to read the article in the <i>Irish Independent</i> today which states that the husband of the murdered Latvian woman is a suspect.  He has a cast-iron alibi but was obviously able to direct operations.</P>
        <P>Senator Hanafin called for a debate on the economy.  We are about to hold one on the Estimates now and we held an excellent debate last night during Private Members&rsquo; business.  The Senator is looking at a particular angle, namely, research and innovation, but the Minister for Finance has been very strong in respect of the fourth level of education.  I have read all the fine words he has said about it.  I am sure Senator Hanafin will speak during this morning&rsquo;s debate on the Estimates.</P>
        <P>Senator Coonan spoke about the funding of local government and county managers.  Planners take the easy way out.  They do not get their files and send out registered letters stating the need for further information on the day before the due date.  It is only a ploy and has nothing to do with <Col N="508"/>the funding of local government.  Planners are quite careless in how they deal with planning.  I can never understand how planners do not see how a small planning application for a house for a man, woman or couple is a matter of life or death at that time.  It is a terrible situation.</P>
        <P>Senator Bannon spoke about small rural post offices and pointed out the position of Moyne post office, which as Senators know, is very dear to me.  He also asked about the Barr report.  We have tried to raise this matter every week.  The Minister wishes to come to the House but therein lies the difficulty because he is very busy.  He will come to the House again this afternoon in respect of the Prisons Bill 2006 and will return to the House next week where, depending on how long it takes, he wishes to oversee Committee Stage.  It is not that we do not want to discuss the report.  We wish to discuss it but the Minister wishes to be here when we do so.  I am also invited to the launch of &ldquo;Death on a Holy Thursday&rdquo; but sadly cannot attend.  I am sure it will be a rip-roaring success.</P>

	<P>Stop that.  </P>
        <P>Senator Mansergh spoke about road deaths, road safety, justice and the evenness of the scales of justice.  It seems that in the case to which he referred the technicality weighs more heavily than the offence.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In respect of one of the issues raised by Senator John Paul Phelan, I am informed that for people such as those who are disabled or ill who wish to vote by post, the date has been pushed back in concurrence with the other date set.  The Senator also called for a debate on serious crime.</P>

    <Title>Estimates for Public Services 2007: Statements. </Title>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome this opportunity to address Seanad &Eacute;ireann on the Government&rsquo;s pre-budget Estimates for 2007.  The 2007 gross pre-budget Estimates provide for expenditure of just over &euro;54 billion, comprising &euro;46.7 billion on the current side and &euro;7.6 billion on the capital side.  This represents an increase of just over &euro;4 billion, or 8.1% over the 2006 forecast outturn.  The Estimates represent the correct balance between making necessary provision for our public services and ensuring the maintenance of a prudent and sustainable budgetary position.  They build on the significant increases in public expenditure of recent years which have, as I will refer to shortly, led to a real improvement in public services in many areas.  On budget day, I will set out some additional expenditure measures in the areas of health and social welfare.</P>
        <P>The 2007 Estimates must be viewed against the background of the remarkable economic and <Col N="509"/>social progress of the past decade.  The economy has been transformed over the past ten years.  It has grown at an annual average rate of over 7% in gross domestic product, GDP, terms since we returned to office.  Our debt-GDP ratio will be approximately 25.5% of GDP in 2006.  This debt-to-GDP ratio puts us at the second lowest in the euro area.  Our unemployment rate, at around 4.25%, is one of the lowest in the European Union where the average unemployment rate, at 8%, is nearly double our rate.  The level of employment this year exceeded 2 million for the first time in the history of the State.</P>
        <P>We now spend &euro;6,700 more on public services for every person in the country than we did in 1997.  That extra expenditure has led to real improvements in our public services.  On the capital side, as a result of this increased spending, great advances have been made in the provision of new roads, radically improved public transport, new and improved schools and hospitals, more social housing and other infrastructure, which have improved prosperity and enhanced the quality of life.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The following are only some examples of what has been achieved.  We have made major progress on new motorways from Dublin to the south, the west and the north, resulting in significant savings in journey times.  Major investment has been also made in roads in urban areas and in non-national roads in rural areas.  Under the rail safety programme, 760 km of track were re-laid nationally by the end of last year, the quality of the rolling stock is being greatly upgraded and there has been significant enhancement of suburban rail capacity.  The Luas has been built and in 2005 carried more than 22 million passengers or 60,000 per day.  Sine 1997 some 100,000 households or approximately 250,000 people have benefited from various social and affordable housing programmes.  In the period 2000 to 2005, 76 new schools were built at primary and post-primary level with construction under way at a further 23 new schools.  Some 380 large-scale refurbishment or extension school projects were completed with the construction of a further 54 projects under way.  More than 6,000 small-scale projects, involving upgrade works and small extensions were delivered.  These are some of the major improvements made and other major improvements have been made in areas such as water and waste water services, child care and the provision of health facilities.</P>
        <P>The reality is also of major improvements arising from our increased investment on current expenditure in the past decade. The total patient throughput in hospitals is up by more than 300,000 to more than 1 million per year.  The waiting times for common surgical procedures have been dramatically reduced from years to two to five months.  More than 3,000 home-care packages have been provided for older people where none existed in 1997.  Approximately 1,500 additional acute hospital beds are in use.</P><Col N="510"/>
        <P Just="Left">Under this Government, the pupil-teacher ratio at primary level has fallen from 22:1 to 17:1 and at post-primary level it has been reduced from 16:1 to 13:1.  There are now 7,000 primary teachers working solely with children with special needs.  Alongside them, almost 8,000 special needs assistants provide an additional support to children with special needs compared with fewer than 300 when we took office.  At third level there are now 45,000 more places, wider representation from all socio-economic groups and increasing numbers are graduating, especially in the key areas at postgraduate and PhD level.  These and other positive changes for the better have improved the quality of our lives, enhanced social inclusion, improved access to opportunity and they will support our economic development in the years ahead.  These examples refute any assertion that there is little to show from the investment put in place by the Government.</P>
        <P>Turning to the 2007 Estimates, for the third year in a row expenditure is forecast to be within profile, reflecting the Government&rsquo;s sound management of the public finances.  In the 2006 Revised Estimates Volume the gross current spending provision was &euro;43.8 billion.  Latest indications are that the outturn on current spending for this year will be &euro;43.5 billion or broadly on target.</P>
        <P>With regard to the capital spending outturn, when<b> </b>account is taken of &euro;182 million which Departments currently indicate they will carry forward for spending in 2007, the capital cash spend will be &euro;6.8 billion this year.  That is an increase of 16% over the cash spend last year.<b> </b>Of the planned increase of just more than &euro;4 billion for next year, &euro;3 billion is for current spending on day to day services and just less &euro;1 billion is for capital spending.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Exchequer capital allocation to address key infrastructural priorities for next year is &euro;7.6 billion, which represents an increase of 12.7% over the forecast outturn for 2006.  On a cash basis when account is taken of the forecast carryover spend into next year, the year on year increase will be some 13.6%.  This capital provision will fund the following service improvements.  A provision of &euro;1.5 billion for roads will build on the substantial investment made to date by Government and will fund and continue to upgrade many of the major inter-urban routes to motorway or high quality dual carriageway standard.  These routes are on schedule for completion by 2010.  Overall eight road projects involving more than 84 kms in length are scheduled for completion next year and six projects amounting to 212 kms in length will commence.</P>
        <P>A large increase of 58% in investment or approximately &euro;780 million demonstrates our commitment to investment in public transport.  It will fund key projects including the further development and expansion of the Luas, the commencement of phase one of the western rail corridor and Cork commuter services next year and <Col N="511"/>the provision of 160 new buses for Bus &Eacute;ireann in addition to the provision of 100 new buses for Dublin Bus recently agreed.</P>
        <P>The capital provision of &euro;1.3 billion for housing will fund the Government commitments under the Towards 2016 partnership agreement regarding planned increases in social housing output with a target of 27,000 social housing starts over the next three years and 17,000 affordable housing starts over the same period.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The huge progress made in recent years in the provision of environmental services has facilitated record levels of housing construction output and commercial development.  A total of &euro;427 million will be provided next year to ensure further progress in this area will help remaining schemes achieve full compliance, for example, under the EU urban waste water treatment directive.</P>
        <P>Education will see a capital spend next year of more than &euro;707 million, which is an increase of 11%.  It will enable approximately 80 new school building projects to be progressed during the year, together with approximately 160 large-scale refurbishment or extension projects, and more than 1,000 smaller-scale projects, which represents unprecedented investment at that level.</P>
        <P>The capital provision for health will be more than &euro;657 million, which will fund a range of important capital services, primarily the building and equipping of hospitals and health facilities generally.</P>
        <P>With regard to our commitments under social partnership in the area of agriculture, provision is made for a large increase of 49% in the capital provision for agriculture next year to more than &euro;275 million.  A particular focus is to assist the farming sector to restructure, modernise and comply with environmental requirements.  Key features include more than &euro;81 million for the farm waste management scheme which will help farmers meet the requirements of nitrates directive and a 55% increase in installation aid rates, bringing the maximum payment rate to &euro;15,000 to advance farm restructuring and modernisation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On the current spending side, the estimate for next year is &euro;47 billion or a 7.4% increase on the 2006 forecast outturn.  That compares with a 12.6% on the capital side which strikes the right balance.  More than &euro;2.4 billion or some 75% of the additional &euro;3.2 billion is being allocated to the three priority areas of health, education and social welfare.</P>
        <P>The current spending allocation for health next year is almost &euro;14 billion, which is an increase of &euro;1.4 billion or 11.3% on the outturn of &euro;12.5 billion last year.  The pre-budget provision for health will fund service improvements, including &euro;75 million to commission and open in 2007 eight new units in acute hospitals, a further &euro;40 million is being provided on top of the substantial increase last year to meet a commitment to <Col N="512"/>expand services for the elderly, and an expansion of primary care teams and of education and training for health professionals.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A further &euro;130 million is being allocated for the Office of the Minister for Children to cover four early child care payments next year as compared with the three paid in 2006.  An extra &euro;120 million is being allocated to deal with additional costs in the drugs payments scheme.  A total of &euro;360 million is being provided for the long-stay charges repayment scheme next year.</P>
        <P>With regard to social and family affairs, the pre-budget allocation for social welfare is almost &euro;14 billion.  Social welfare is central to our policies on social inclusion and makes a major difference to the lives of many people in our society.  Almost 970,000 people receive a welfare payment of one type or another each week.  Under the Government, allowing for the cost of living, pensions and lowest social welfare rates have increased by 45% to 55% in real terms since we took office.</P>
        <P>Almost &euro;8 billion is being allocated for day to day spending on education next year to make major provision for the education of more than 940,000 young people.  This is an increase of &euro;563 million over the forecast outturn for this year or an increase of 7.7%.  Some &euro;2.64 billion will be provided in 2007 for current spending on primary school level, &euro;2.74 billion for post-primary level and &euro;1.8 billion for third level.  This will meet the cost of service improvements in a number of key areas, including 800 additional teachers next year.  It will bring to approximately 1,900 the number of new teachers provided since 2005 to reduce class sizes and help tackle problems of disability and disadvantage.  More than 1,400 extra special needs assistants, who significantly improve the experience of education for people with special needs, will be provided.  A 13% increase in capitation grants for schools has been widely welcomed.  An extra &euro;20 million will be provided for school buses to bring the total allocation for school transport to &euro;165 million.  At third level, I will increase the strategic innovation fund announced in last year&rsquo;s budget by &euro;45 million, bringing it to a total of &euro;60 million next year.</P>
        <P>The justice group of Votes received an increase of 9%, bringing the total 2007 provision to &euro;2.4 billion.  The main element is &euro;971 million in respect of Garda pay and providing funding for the increase in Garda numbers to meet the programme for Government commitment of a force of 14,000.  Approximately &euro;150 million of the justice provision is for capital, including a provision to modernise further the information technology and communications equipment available to garda&iacute;, which is fundamental and critical to their efforts to deal with crime.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The provision of &euro;1.4 billion in current expenditure for agriculture and food is the first year&rsquo;s funding for the seven-year package of rural development measures recently negotiated by the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy <Col N="513"/>Coughlan, as part of Towards 2016.  Again, the strategic focus is modernisation and environmental requirements.  Enhancements and increases will be made in grant rates, including a 17% increase in rates for the rural environment protection scheme with a 2007 provision of &euro;328 million, an 8% increase in compensatory allowances in disadvantaged areas payments with a 2007 provision of &euro;257 million, and an enhanced early retirement scheme with an increased maximum payment rate of &euro;15,000, which amounts to a 10% increase.</P>
        <P>Looking to other areas of Estimates which may be of note for Senators, the commitment for overseas development aid of &euro;814 million in 2007 meets our interim target of reaching 0.5% of gross national product, GNP, by 2007.  This represents an increase of &euro;139 million or 21% on this year&rsquo;s allocation of &euro;675 million.  Ireland&rsquo;s contribution rate of 0.5% compares favourably with current average figures of 0.3% in OECD countries and 0.43% in the EU for 2006.</P>
        <P>Raising our performance level in science, technology and innovation is essential to our future competitiveness and continued prosperity.  It will be central to our economic development agenda in coming years under the national development plan.  Therefore, the Government will allocate more than &euro;750 million in capital and current expenditure for implementation next year of the strategy for science, technology and innovation.  This is an additional &euro;66.4 million or 15% over this year&rsquo;s allocation.</P>
        <P>We announced a number of child care measures in last year&rsquo;s budget, including a new five-year national child care investment programme designed to create an extra 50,000 child care places by 2010.  At least 5,000 of these places will be for schoolgoing children before and after school hours and 10,000 will be pre-school education places aimed at three to four year olds.  The child care provision for next year is &euro;142 million, an increase of &euro;48 million or more than 50% on this year to allow further significant progress to be made towards the achievement of these targets.</P>
        <P>In my first budget I announced a multi-annual investment programme for specific high priority disability support services designed to improve the quality of life for disabled persons, especially in the key areas of health, education and training and access.  To provide for further delivery on this commitment, next year&rsquo;s Estimates include provision for expenditure of &euro;3.6 billion on disability specific services compared with an estimated &euro;3.3 billion this year.  This is an increase of 10%.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The gross provision for 2007 to fund public service pay and pensions is approximately &euro;18 billion of the &euro;47 billion total, an increase of &euro;1.2 billion or 7%.  This represents 38% of the total gross public expenditure provision for next year.  The pay terms of the Towards 2016 social partnership agreement account for approximately &euro;750 million of this.</P><Col N="514"/>
        <P>The 2007 pay and pensions bill of &euro;18 billion is a significant commitment of resources.  Of this amount, approximately &euro;14.9 billion or 83% is in respect of the frontline services of health, education and security.  The Government has permitted increases in the number of staff in these areas in recent years and I make no apology for this.  The fact is these are labour intensive services and if we wish to get maximum benefit from enhanced capital expenditure in the areas of health and education, we must staff the resultant new or enhanced facilities adequately.  The Civil Service, local authorities the non-commercial State sponsored bodies provide us with a balance in overall numbers.  We keep a close ceiling on those areas to compensate for staff entering the priority areas of health and education.</P>
        <P>The taxpayer is entitled to full value for money in respect of this significant outlay.  Accordingly, payment of the pay increases under Towards 2016 will be dependent in the case of each sector, organisation and grade on independent verification of co-operation with flexibility and ongoing change, including co-operation with satisfactory implementation of the agenda for modernisation set out in the agreement.  To date, the verification process has brought about real efficiencies and improvements in public services.  An example is the introduction of systems such as the online motor tax system which enables people to pay their car tax on-line.  In June 2006, the Revenue on-line service reported processing 3.5 million returns and 7.8 million customer information requests.</P>
        <P>In response to public demand, health facilities have longer opening hours with earlier starts and later finishes from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. or 8 p.m. in a range of outpatient facilities such as dedicated outpatient diabetes, physiotherapy and cancer clinics, radiography departments, weekly late night dental clinics and antenatal classes in a growing number of locations.  Having attended a Cabinet sub-committee on health yesterday, I am glad to report that D DOC for north Dublin will see a much improved primary care provision out of hours and at weekends.  Revised work processes in the Department of Social and Family Affairs have reduced, among others, the average processing time for disability benefit from approximately eight days in November 2003 to five days in January 2006.</P>
        <P>More generally, I accorded particular priority to the issue of value for money since becoming Minister for Finance and have introduced a number of initiatives designed to ensure more effective and efficient allocation and management of resources by Government, Ministers, Departments and agencies, better value for money for the taxpayer and greater accountability to the Oireachtas and the public.  We now have in place a value for money framework which includes the rolling multi-annual capital envelopes for public capital investment, revised guidelines for the appraisal and management of capital expendi<Col N="515"/>ture, public private partnerships to procure suitable projects and reforms to public procurement, including moving to more fixed-price contracts.</P>
        <P>In October 2005 I announced additional value for money measures on procurement, ICT projects and consultancies which include individual accountability for major projects, peer review of ICT projects and reporting of project outcomes against budgets and timeframes.  Approximately 90 value for money reviews with an indicative coverage of between 10% and 15% of Department and office budgets will be carried out in the period 2006 to 2008 under new arrangements for value for money policy reviews which are in place of the expenditure review initiative.  A central expenditure evaluation unit in my Department promotes best practice on appraisal and evaluation generally and compliance by Departments and agencies with the enhanced value for money requirements.  Reform of the Estimates and budgetary process was announced in the 2006 budget.  Under the Government&rsquo;s Estimates reforms, from 2007 Ministers will submit to the D&aacute;il an annual output statement in tandem with their Estimates which will enable the relevant committees, in considering the Estimates, to have a better picture of what outputs are achieved at programme level for the funding for which approval is being sought.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s 2007 Estimates are fiscally sustainable, economically appropriate and politically responsible.  Maintaining stability has been the cornerstone of our economic success.  Stable sensible policies have enabled us to generate the resources necessary to tackle poverty and social inequalities and improve public services.  On budget day I will provide for a social welfare package and some additional expenditure on health.  The Government will publish the National Development Plan 2007-2013 in January which I co-ordinate on behalf of the Government.  It will set out our seven-year investment programme for sustainable social and economic development over the medium term.  I commend the Government&rsquo;s pre-budget 2007 Estimates to the Seanad.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, to the House to discuss the Estimates.  It is fair to say they contain good news and the Minister outlined a number of areas which will see significant increases in expenditure.  Much of what was announced in the Estimates is welcome.  However, question marks hang over other key areas and I intend to raise as many of them as I can.  At the end of his remarks the Minister referred to reform and value for money, and improvements have taken place in a number of areas.  Nonetheless, while the new system of multi-annual capital envelopes, introduced by the Minister, is a step in the right direction, the Government is paying only lip service to reform.  When a crisis arises an announcement is made, such as that last year on <Col N="516"/>consultancies.  The Minister referred to this matter in his speech.  It arose from a specific problem with which the Government was faced and it was forced into action.  The Government is still lagging behind in the area of genuine reform and value for taxpayers&rsquo; money.  </P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister outlined increases in expenditure for the Department of Health and Children.  It is the usual mantra of Government to outline significant funding increases that have taken place for that Department in the past ten years, yet the services provided are not improving by a commensurate amount.  In many areas they are not improving at all.  In his speech, the Minister said waiting lists for many operations are now down from years to months.  In my area, however, there are waiting lists to get on the waiting lists for many routine procedures.  These waiting lists can last for anything up to 12 months before a patient can get a consultation.  The figures have been massaged.  The huge increases we have seen in funding for the Department of Health and Children have not been reflected in the level of service people get from hospital facilities throughout the country.</P>
        <P>Despite increases in the numbers employed in public services &mdash; which, by and large, is not something I would like to see &mdash; key positions still need to be increased.  The Government has not kept up to speed in increasing the numbers of front-line medical staff, including doctors and public health nurses.  The growth in such staff positions has not been commensurate with increased expenditure, while administrative posts seem to have absorbed much of the funding increases in recent years.</P>
        <P>The Estimates include an increase of more than &euro;1 billion in funding for the Department of Health and Children, most of which is taken up by salary increases arising from the benchmarking process, which has been discussed at length in this House.  Nevertheless, we have not seen a significant improvement in hospital services.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister also outlined increases in funding for transport, including a number of road projects.  He referred to significant savings in journey times, which was rather amusing.  There would be little use in pointing out that to people who, yesterday evening, were caught in four or five hour tailbacks in this city owing to a roadworks problem.  I welcome the investment in road projects but it will come to nothing if roadworks are carried out only during the daytime, which is the case with the M50, rather than having a 24-hour work programme.</P>
        <P>The Minister also outlined the Government&rsquo;s record on housing and the increase in funding for housing next year.  The Government&rsquo;s record on social and affordable housing is abysmal.  Housing is the biggest single disaster area for which the Government has been responsible in the past ten years.  The average worker in Dublin cannot afford to buy an average house because prices <Col N="517"/>have risen astronomically in the past decade.  The paltry increase announced in the Estimates for social and affordable housing does not convince me of any renewed effort by the Government to ensure those on lower incomes will be better able to afford a house in future.</P>
        <P>The Minister also outlined the Government&rsquo;s increase in funding for environmental issues.  As far as I can see from the Estimates, however, the increase is a minor one, particularly for local authority sewerage facilities.  Last year, the increase was of the order of 6% or 7% while this year it is lower than that, according to the Book of Estimates.  That is certainly a step in the wrong direction if the Government is serious about environmental protection and the nitrates directive, in particular.  Local authorities are among the biggest polluters in the country because many towns and villages often do not have any sewage treatment facilities.  Sadly, the paltry increase announced in the Book of Estimates will not address that significant problem in the future.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister referred to an increase in funding for education, with particular emphasis on special needs.  There has been a significant rise in the numbers of special needs assistants in schools, for whom resource hours have been provided.  However, the increased funding for the National Educational Psychological Service is paltry.  Last year it was 2% while this year the figure is similar, although I am not sure of the exact figure.  Large swathes of the country have very little coverage from that service.  For a relatively small expenditure significant improvements could be made in the future development of children with special educational needs.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Approximately 250 children in the primary education sector suffer from Down's syndrome.  Up to five or six years ago, those children were automatically entitled to resource hours.  Under a change introduced by this Government, however, that automatic entitlement was removed.  Resource hours must now come from the total allocation to schools attended by such children, which is a disgrace.  We are talking about a small pool of children who could benefit from a significant investment to ensure adequate support at a crucial stage in their early development.  That would have positive effects into the future, ensuring that when they grow up they will be able to live fully independent lives.  When the Minister announces his budget in two weeks&rsquo; time, I ask him to emphasise that area.</P>
        <P>In his earlier remarks, the Minister referred to the guidelines for numbers employed in the public service.  I fully agree with him that for key service areas, such as health and education, there is a need to increase frontline staff, including doctors, nurses, teachers and special needs assistants.  The Minister also said this was being rebalanced by employment in local authorities.  This matter was discussed on today&rsquo;s Order of Business.  Many local authorities are suffering as <Col N="518"/>a result of this embargo, particularly in the areas of planning and road development.  The Minister should ensure the embargo is not applied in those areas in the future.</P>
        <P>Local authority funding has received an airing in the past week or so.  Last year, the Minister was rightly criticised in this House and elsewhere for the 4% increase proposed in the Book of Estimates for the local government fund.  This year the increase, at 2%, is only half that.  Whatever the final inflation figure is for 2006 it will be significantly more than 2%.  In real terms, therefore, the Minister is announcing a decrease in the local government fund for next year.  I hope all citizens of the State are aware local authorities will experience serious cutbacks in the services they provide, unless they increase revenues from their own sources, because the Government is cutting the local government fund.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>There have been many discussions in this House on development charges, which are a real and verifiable form of stealth tax introduced by the Government.  Unless there is a larger increase in the local government fund on budget day, local authorities will be forced to increase these charges which are the most unfair form of taxation in the country.  Development charges may make some sense in urban areas where services such as connection to a sewer or water main are provided, but in rural areas, where one is lucky to have a pothole filled outside one&rsquo;s house and one may be compelled to pay &euro;8,000 to &euro;9,000 as a development charge, they are beyond the bounds of belief and unacceptable.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister referred to pupil-teacher ratios.  This is an area in which the Government made a strong commitment in the programme for Government, particularly regarding a reduction in the number of pupils relative to the number of teachers at primary level.  However, no significant improvement has been made.  Additional funding has been announced in the Estimates to deal with this issue and it remains to be seen what effect it will have.  More than 70,000 primary school pupils in the country are still in classes of more than 30 students and this flies in the face of the commitment given by the Government in advance of the last election.  I do not think the Minister&rsquo;s announcement in the Book of Estimates will see a major decrease in this number, although it may see a minor one.</P>
        <P>I have often raised the issue of domestic violence and it has been discussed on numerous occasions by Senators from all sides.  Last year I criticised the Government on its announcement of a 3% increase in funding for agencies dealing with domestic violence.  This year the increase is 2% and I put it to the Minister that this is a pathetic figure, particularly given that violent crime against women, an example of which was seen at the weekend, is increasing dramatically.</P>
        <P>I have questions concerning a number of other agencies and seek answers from the Minister.  An <Col N="519"/>11% decrease in funding for the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions consists mainly of administrative cuts, but there are cuts in other services also and perhaps whoever is responding could address this issue.  Likewise, the Office of the Ombudsman sees a 5% decrease in funding.  Again, the bulk is to come from administrative cuts, but other services will also be affected by such a significant measure.</P>
        <P>The Minister mentioned a 10% increase in funding for the Department of Education and Science and an 11% increase in funding for the school building programme.  There have been significant advances in this area over the past few years but, in real terms, inflation in the construction industry is running at 10% so the Minister&rsquo;s announcement on school building represents a 1% increase.  I am trying to point out the real impact that these increases will have on schools being built and refurbished in the next year.</P>
        <P>Under the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, the CL&Aacute;R programme sees a 12% to 15% decrease in funding.  This programme was originally only available in the west but has been extended to parts of my own constituency in Kilkenny in the past 12 months and I am sure it is available in the Minister&rsquo;s constituency.  Why has funding been cut so soon after the programme was extended?</P>
        <P>With regard to the Department of Agriculture and Food, the area of forestry has seen significant cutbacks in the past couple of budgets and, once again, the Book of Estimates sees a 3% decrease in this sector.  Given the Government&rsquo;s pledges on greener energy sources and its commitment to alternative income sources for farmers, this makes no sense.  It should increase funding in the area of forestry.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Continuing on matters agricultural, a 5% decrease in the farm assist programme is to be made available via the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  The Government has been quite successful in driving off the land farmers who might have been able to avail of that fund, but I know a number of people in my own region who have benefitted from it.  Perhaps an explanation for this decrease could be given later.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There have been some significant increases in funding under the heading of the Health Service Executive.  The Minister referred to consultancy fees and ICT projects in his comments, but the &euro;70 million increase in funding for information systems and related services may not sit well in this regard.  Could this be the personnel, payroll and related systems, PPARS, fiasco all over again or is this a new version of it?  Are we still throwing good money after bad as we did regarding PPARS over the past few years?</P>
        <P>I have already mentioned the area of funding for local government and this is one of the areas where the Book of Estimates fails.  A dramatic cut of 70% is to be made in funding for the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland and <Col N="520"/>there may be a reason for this.  I hope whoever responds can provide an explanation.</P>
        <P>The increase of 3% to 4% in the capital programme for the provision of sewage and water schemes throughout the country is a negative step in real terms, given inflation in that sector.  I ask that this issue be considered on budget day.</P>
        <P>There are welcome announcements regarding increases in funding for several Departments in the Book of Estimates and it would be churlish of me if I failed to acknowledge this.  However, when one considers the greater scheme of things, specifically the corrosive effect of inflation, particularly in the construction industry, the announcements and increases are not all they may seem to be.  In this regard I am yet to be convinced of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to significant systems reform in the public service.  The Department of Health and Children receives the largest allocation every year and I see no obvious signs that the Government is serious about reforming systems there.  Unless this is done there will be huge increases in funding into the future without a commensurate improvement in services provided.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House, thank him for the time he has given us at a pressing time of year and congratulate him on the Book of Estimates.  How many Finance Ministers in Europe are in a position to continue to reduce the national debt, provide substantial relief in taxation and fund substantial increases in public services without any undue strain?  I suggest very few of them are in this position, which is no doubt the reason the <i>Financial Times</i> decided the Minister was the most effective Minister for Finance in the eurozone.  </P>
        <P>The Estimates are only the first instalment in the budgetary process, which will be filled out later by the budget and Revised Book of Estimates.  There are little quirks in the budgetary process, for instance, the outturn for this year will be somewhat less than what was provided for.  For this reason, the figures people cite for the increase in expenditure this year over last year are probably at least one percentage point lower than the true figure.  One must remember<?oasys _jy ?>that these calculations are made on a moving scale.</P>
        <P>Older Senators can only look back in wonder at the development of the country and public finances over the past 20 years.  The particular contribution made by my party has been to establish and then provide a sound financial basis for the growth, investment and increase in employment that have taken place.  We have not looked back since 1988 when Charles Haughey and Ray MacSharry reduced the Exchequer borrowing requirement, with the help of the tax amnesty, to 3% of GNP.</P>
        <P>Senator Ryan implied yesterday that the rainbow Government had left the budget in surplus while subsequent Governments had failed to do <Col N="521"/>so.  Figures from the Department of Finance show there was never an Exchequer borrowing requirement surplus between 1995 and 1997.  It is true, however, that retrospective calculation of the general government deficit produced a small surplus in 1997, that is, in one year out of three.  In the past ten years there was a small deficit on the general government deficit in only one year, 2003, and two small deficits on the EBR.  We have been managing comfortably with a large margin of safety and in a way that in most years has not significantly constrained capacity to do what needs to be done.</P>
        <P>On some specific points, one would get the impression from the public debate that the Estimates provide for increased expenditure across the board.  I note the Minister set a good example in his own Department, no doubt for good, technical reasons.  I am not suggesting the allocation for the Department amounts to a cutback but the current budget is 8% below last year.  In some areas, the allocations have not been significantly increased.  Critics in the other House said it was scandalous that various allocated moneys had not been spent, yet the Government is constantly lectured about the importance of achieving value for money.  One should not spend unspent money at the end of the year unless there are pressing needs and priorities for doing so.  The critique in this regard shows inconsistency.</P>
        <P>The Estimates provide welcome increases, by and large across the board.  I welcome, for example, the increase in the allocation for child care, which is badly needed.  Child care facilities are being developed all over the country.  I also welcome the increased budget for primary schools.  Even small schools one visits have resource, special needs and ancillary needs teachers and experience difficulty finding space to accommodate them.  Enlarging many primary schools to accommodate these staff is an important priority.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s investment in road and public transport is making a considerable difference, specifically in my county.  I am sure new motorway links across County Tipperary have contributed to four positive job announcements in the past four months.  These links make the county more accessible and have made a palpable improvement.  My constituency of Tipperary South, as with the Minister&rsquo;s constituency, is in a central position.</P>
        <P>Public transport was discussed in the House yesterday.  Previous Governments, not only the rainbow Government, did not generally invest Exchequer money in capital improvements in public transport.  The Book of Estimates for 1997, produced by the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, featured a zero Exchequer input into public transport investment.  Moreover, public transport was not mentioned in the 20 point election plan at that time.  It is a bit much, therefore, to be criticised about alleged deficiencies.</P><Col N="522"/>
        <P>A sum of &euro;777 million will be invested in public transport next year.  We can see the effects of badly needed improvements in the system.  If one adds current expenditure to capital expenditure, the final figure of approximately &euro;1 billion amounts to two thirds of the investment in roads in the national budget.  The Luas, which I often use when in Dublin, no longer features in the Book of Estimates because this successful project became self-financing much earlier than anticipated.</P>
        <P>Senator John Paul Phelan alleged that housing policy had been a disaster.  If that is the case, it is a wonder so many houses are being built in practically every village.  Somebody, somewhere must be buying, acquiring and living in the majority of these properties.  A cooling off in house prices is needed and some of the measures in the pipeline will help to achieve this.  As regards some of the suggestions on inflation made in the debate, if one wished to stimulate rip-roaring house price inflation, one would abolish stamp duty.</P>

	<P>I welcome the allocation to the Office of Public Works for flood relief, which has increased from &euro;20 million to &euro;32 million.  This will be particularly helpful in Clonmel which has been prone to flooding.  The OPW has shifted from the acquisition of sites to building, a sign of the progress being made with decentralisation.</P>
        <P>This Government&rsquo;s support for sport has been outstanding.  Of particular relevance to my county is the extension of the sports company scheme.  Groups and communities involved in the arts have also welcomed the exceptional funding granted.  At local level and in some of the national institutions, such as the National Concert Hall, there is a need for new or extended premises.</P>
        <P>I draw the attention of Fine Gael to an article by its former leader, Dr. Garrett FitzGerald, in which he highlighted the enormous improvement in life expectancy that has taken place since 1997. <Col N="523"/> That surely is the bottom line indicator of improvement in the health service.</P>
        <P>It is not always publicised but it is implicit in the figures that the Minister, having previously served as Minister for Foreign Affairs, has lived up to and helped his colleague to live up to the commitment on development aid.  It is important we stress that to his credit.  There was not always the same commitment in the Department of Finance in the past to this area.</P>
        <P>There have been major increases in agriculture to fund agreements under social partnership on REPS, the suckler cow premium and other grants.  I noticed some disagreement in the Labour Party on defence.  Senator Ryan and the Peace and Neutrality Alliance consider it a good thing that we are not spending too much on defence but Deputy Costello criticised the size of the increase for the equipment budget.  Perhaps the party needs further internal debate on the matter.</P>

        <P>The Government has been criticised for not reducing numbers in the public service, as was temporarily decided in 2002 and 2003.  If one wants the services, however, one needs the numbers.  During yesterday&rsquo;s debate on inflation, I quoted the National Competitiveness Council which stated that in terms of productivity we were well served by the public service.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The projections made by the Department of Finance in October suggest that we will enjoy economic growth of between 4% and 5% of GNP and GDP for each of the next three years.  On the face of it, that is a rosy scenario that we all welcome.  There are, however, worrying trends and fault lines in the economy we must be aware of and, as far as we can, address.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The most striking feature is our extraordinary dependence on construction.  The sector now employs about 15% of the total workforce and a good deal more if we include people involved in services directly or indirectly linked to construction.  This sector, however, is notoriously volatile.  In 2001 and 2002 we experienced a rapid slowdown in the sector as a result of certain fiscal measures taken by the then Minister for Finance, <Col N="524"/>Charlie McCreevy.  It is clear that developers and builders have the capacity to slow production quickly and I am cynical about their willingness to do so to put pressure on the Government to introduce measures they want and not introduce other measures they do not want.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Things can change quickly in this sector, which leaves us exposed.  The T&aacute;naiste said a few months ago that the Government scarcely needs the revenues it gets from stamp duty.  If we had anything like the slowdown in the sector we experienced in 2001, the Minister for Finance would quickly find we need that money very badly.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I intended to contribute to the debate on inflation last night but unfortunately I was at a committee meeting.  In reflecting on the matter, however, it occurred to me that the most striking factor in the whole debate is that the inflation rate should be far higher than it is given the amount of money in circulation, credit borrowing, low interest rates and the SSIAs maturing.  Our rate of inflation should be many percentage points higher and we must look carefully at the reasons it is not.  There are factors at play that are worrying.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The most obvious factor in terms of goods is that our manufacturing sector is virtually dead.  We simply do not produce the goods so most of the extra money we have is spent on imported goods and that is why it is not feeding through in terms of inflation.  We no longer even attempt to compete with low-cost economies elsewhere to produce manufactured goods.  We relied heavily on manufactured goods 30 years ago compared with the current economic profile. There has been a revolutionary economic change that will not be reversed.  An entire sector that used to sustain us is dying, as reflected in the ongoing job losses in that sector.  It is also increasingly being reflected in our trade deficit for manufactured goods.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The rate of inflation for services is much higher, almost 8% this year, although we could expect it to be even higher.  It is not higher for one striking reason: the availability of relatively cheap foreign labour.  The services sector has become highly dependent on such labour.  If the girl washing hair in the hairdresser&rsquo;s were not from eastern Europe or China, the chances are the hair cut would cost a lot more.  Having that pool of cheap labour available has kept inflation in the services sector at a tolerable level.</P>
        <P>I make this point because it presents obvious social challenges.  We have an obligation to ensure immigrants are not exploited and that minimum wage and related labour legislation is enforced adequately.  I am not convinced this is so.  We also have a responsibility to our own people with regard to securing future employment, particularly for those people with low skill sets.  Our primary responsibility to those people is to ensure they upgrade their skills and are retained in training.</P><Col N="525"/>
        <P>The Estimates published last week provide for an 8.1% increase in spending next year, a figure with which I have no great quibble.  The figure could have been higher and I suspect it will be so by budget day.  Nominal growth next year is likely to be approximately 8%, so we are speaking about marking time or roughly standing still in terms of percentage national output being spent on services.</P>
        <P>We should stand back from the issue and ask what we want the budgetary process to do.  For me, it is about supporting people who depend on the State, specifically through the social welfare and otherwise, improving infrastructure, and improving services.  None of these can be done without spending money, and improved services will not be attained, by and large, without spending more.</P>
        <P>I am not one who thinks an increase of 8% is terrible, but I would rather wonder if we could afford or sustain a 10% increase into the future.  Any objective consideration of this year&rsquo;s figures suggests we could sustain increases of 10% or 11%, and I suspect we will end up with those.  There is no need to make apologies for that, and we need to use these valuable years of economic growth to improve services and infrastructure.</P>
        <P>I wish to speak about capital spending.  We have not been ambitious enough with our spending on infrastructure in the past ten years.  Since 1994 we have had 12 years or so of sustained growth, which has not happened in one country in the post-war period aside from the 1960s period in Germany or Japan.  If we were to wake up tomorrow to find the boom over, what would we have achieved?  To take transport as an example, it is remarkable that during those 12 years we managed to build only approximately 155 kilometres of motorway.  The system on the five or six motorway routes chosen is still only half-built in that time.</P>
        <P>Senator Mansergh may be correct in stating there was little provision made in the 1990s for public transport.  We are still using, more or less, the same rolling stock in our railways.  Although we have spent money on making the network safe, we have hardly improved it.  The number of buses on the streets of Dublin is approximately the same, and although we have threatened to do so, we have not extended routes to Navan<?oasys _jy ?>etc.</P>
        <P>After 12 years of an economic growth of an unprecedented kind, we still have not achieved very much in many areas, and progress has been too slow.  Part of that has been a deliberate decision of Government, which has decided to restrict capital spending to approximately 5% of GNP year on year.  I have always felt that figure to be too low.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This is connected to the argument by members of the ESRI that if we spend more we get less value for money, and that may be correct.  However, it ignores the political and social imperative to get work done that we have not <Col N="526"/>been able to do before now.  From an economist&rsquo;s perspective it may be reasonable to say we should delay social progress and infrastructural construction for another three, four or five years, but what would happen if we woke up some bright day in 2010 to find we no longer had the resources?</P>
        <P>We should spend our resources on work we should have done ten years ago and get as much as we can.  We can put in place systems to ensure we get value for money and so on.  If we can get the work done at 5% more of a cost than if we had delayed it, we should carry on and do it now anyway.</P>
        <P>During the course of his contribution the Minister mentioned value for money.  Yesterday I again read his speech to the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Ireland, as well as his contribution on budget day last year, when he set out the improvements in process he intended to make.  As with Senator John Paul Phelan, I am still deeply sceptical as to whether there is a real commitment to do this, and the publication of the three-year review in October did not add much beyond what we would have got in the economic review and outlook normally published in August.</P>
        <P>Time will tell on the output statements.  It is a pity they are coming two or three months before the general election, as we will not have enough time for assessment.  It is certainly a good idea, but time will tell if it is effective.  The bottom line is that processes used by this House and, more importantly, the other House, to evaluate the expenditure of public money are wholly inadequate.  The only effective system is <i>post facto</i>, facilitated by the Comptroller and Auditor General and which the Committee of Public Accounts subsequently uses.  The daily review of value for money, performed by the Houses and committees, does not work, and I see no great commitment from this Government to improve that.</P>
        <P>In 2002, the Government came back to power with relatively few firm commitments, but I remember some.  It committed to 200,000 additional medical cards, 14,000 garda&iacute; before the next election and reducing class sizes in order that no child would be in a class of more than 29 by the next election.  As of now it has failed miserably on all of them.  Interestingly, we are getting a last blast of sudden public expenditure in one or two of those areas, with money suddenly being spent on the Garda and reducing class size.</P>
        <P>There is no possibility, of course, of meeting the commitments come election day, but it will no doubt be argued the Government is on the way.  After five years and given the relatively paltry number of commitments made, it is not good enough to say a last-minute effort is being made to make a dent in the commitments.  The commitment on the medical card issue seems to have been entirely abandoned.</P><Col N="527"/>
        <P Just="Left">Many of the provisions of the 2001 health strategy have been similarly abandoned.  The most striking of these was a commitment to provide 3,000 additional acute hospital beds, and the number provided is still languishing at about 500 or 600, five years on.  There appears to be no mention or commitment to increasing the number of acute hospital beds.</P>
        <P>It is an essential part of any health strategy to increase the number of beds.  There appears to be a reluctance from Government to commit to do it in particular areas because of local political considerations, but the nettle should have been grasped some time ago, and it certainly should be grasped now.</P>
        <P>I am glad we are back on track with overseas development aid, which others have mentioned, but I am somewhat worried about the way we spend it.  The overall increase is 16%, which is very welcome, and &euro;811 million is a significant commitment.  We are spending an increasing percentage of this simply by writing cheques to international organisations, be they UNESCO, the Red Cross etc.  We seem incapable of increasing our amount of bilateral aid, and a certain amount of this goes in direct budgetary assistance to specific governments. I would prefer, as would others in this House, bilateral assistance to manage and finance projects on the ground rather than to simply write cheques for Irish taxpayers&rsquo; money to others.  I would be interested in any comments the Minister might make in that regard.</P>
        <P>Overall, I have no great quibble with 8% or 10% of an increase in spending, and if anything it is less ambitious than it perhaps should be.  This relatively generous set of Estimates would not be enough to meet the relatively small number of key commitments made by this Government five years ago.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnMinihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Minihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  The Progressive Democrats believe economic policies can be an instrument of social justice, and I have stated as much before.  Contrary to suggestions from some quarters, we do not decouple the economy and society.  Our central political economic philosophy is the belief a strong and dynamic economy can deliver for all society, particularly those who are vulnerable.</P>
        <P>Our parties policies have helped deliver the economic growth and increased tax revenues, which has led to more resources for social provision.  That has allowed substantial real increases in social welfare payments, health and education.  The 2007 gross pre-budget Estimates are further evidence of the correctness and the application of the Progressive Democrats ethos.</P>
        <P>The Minister and the Government are to be complimented for striking the appropriate balance between making necessary provision for our public services and ensuring maintenance of a prudent and sustainable budgetary position.  Delivering economic growth is just one side of <Col N="528"/>the coin.  We must utilise the added revenue generated to improve public services for our people.  We have delivered the growth, which is demonstrated by an annual average growth rate of more than 7% in GDP terms between 1997 and 2005.  The debt to GDP ratio will be approximately 25.5% of GDP in 2006, the second lowest in the euro area.  The unemployment rate of approximately 4.25% is one of the lowest in the European Union, where the average unemployment rate of 8% is nearly double the rate in Ireland.  The level of employment this year exceeded 2 million for the first time in the history of the State.</P>
        <P>We continue to deliver the resources for public services.  The Estimates provide for expenditure of just over &euro;54 billion; &euro;46.7 billion on current spending and &euro;7.6 billion on capital spending.  This is an increase of just over &euro;4 billion, or 8.1% on 2006.  It amounts to an additional &euro;6,700 to be expended on public services for every man, woman and child in the country than in 1997.</P>
        <P>Senator Mansergh referred to stamp duty.  The Progressive Democrats started the debate and I have made my contribution in this area.  Regardless of the differing views that people may have, we can all agree that there is now cross-party political support and public support for reform in this area.  When all the submissions are made I am confident the Government will make its decision in this regard as to what is in the best interests of the economy.</P>
        <P>The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, and the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, continue to demonstrate dedication and prudence in their departmental Estimates.  The total public spending on health provided in the Abridged Estimates Volume published today amounts to &euro;14 billion gross current plus &euro;657 million gross capital.  In real terms this means that eight new hospital units are to open in 2007; priority will be given to older people in the Estimates and in the budget; the spread of BreastCheck is on target for 2007 while the Government is again providing for a substantial annual increase in public spending on health of over &euro;1.1 billion.  This amounts to more than &euro;3,300 per person.  It represents a quarter of Government current spending and more than the entire income tax take from 1.4 million income tax payers.</P>
        <P>The spending increases in health since 1997 have always been well above the rate of inflation, in fact, double or treble the rate of inflation and well above the increases provided in the 1990s.  Each year, health has always received high priority from the Government and that is the case again this year.  These increases and the total we have reached are made possible only by the strength of the economy and the sound economic policies of the Government.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is worth focusing on service improvements achieved since 1997 with the overall level of fund<Col N="529"/>ing.  The total patient admissions to hospitals are up by more than 300,000 to over 1 million.  Waiting times for operations have been dramatically reduced from years to months.  No longer do 75% of children and adults wait for more than a year for heart operations.  There are nearly 40,000 more cancer patient hospital admissions.  More people are being treated and surviving cancer.  Infant mortality has fallen by one third.  BreastCheck is in place and will provide a service for all women in the country in the spring of next year.  There was no breast cancer screening programme in 1997.  Preparations are under way for cervical screening.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There are more than 3,000 home care packages for older people, where there were none in 1997.  There are approximately 1,500 additional acute hospital beds in use.  We are providing 1,700 more residential places and nearly 3,000 more day places for care, as one part of the first ever multi-annual programme for services for people with disabilities.  Recognition has to be given to people at the front line who are delivering these service improvements.  Their contribution and the reforms being introduced are all helping to bring about a first-class health service delivered to the people where most needed.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In the area of justice, the Government has again shown its commitment.  We welcome the fact that the allocation for the justice and equality sector, current and capital, has risen by 9%.  The gross allocation for justice is up by &euro;181million to &euro;2.4 billion.  Allocation for the Garda Vote is up by &euro;135.3 million to &euro;1.445 billion, an increase of 10%.  The Justice Vote has risen dramatically.  Youth justice is to receive &euro;16.3 million and there will be an extra &euro;17.6 million for the Courts Service.  Capital allocation for the Vote Group is up by &euro;26 million.  The resources are being given to the areas targeted.  This means successful anti-crime strategies and operations such as Operation Anvil will be continued and intensified on a nationwide basis.  The year 2007 will see more than 275 fully trained garda&iacute; graduating from Templemore every quarter and 1,100 in total over the year.  This will allow the Garda Commissioner to focus on providing a highly visible policing presence throughout the country.</P>
        <P>Despite what the Opposition says, the Government&rsquo;s commitment with regard to Garda numbers has been met.  The T&aacute;naiste has asked the Commissioner to devote significant resources to policing RAPID programme areas where residents experience persistent vandalism, intimidation and other forms of anti-social behaviour.  Funding for the IT infrastructure, which is a key support for successful policing and crime fighting, is up by &euro;3 million to &euro;38.4 million.  The national digital radio will be rolled out to significant areas of the State next year.  Expenditure this year on Garda vehicles will be more than double that of last year and will result in the purchase this year of 1,200 vehicles, more than half of the entire Garda fleet.  This progress will be continued in <Col N="530"/>2007.  The Garda traffic corps strength will reach over 1,000 next year, a doubling of its strength since 2005 and progressing towards the target of 1,200 by 2008.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Government continues to provide record resources for anti-crime strategies.  The publication of today&rsquo;s Estimates, which show an increase of 10% on this year&rsquo;s budget, serve to underline the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s commitment in this respect.  The additional overtime allocation will yield almost 3 million extra man hours of policing by uniformed and special units throughout the State.  This significant increase in funding and the continuing increase in the strength of the force, will enhance the capacity of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to combat crime, focusing on the policing priorities for 2007.</P>
        <P>As the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen has stated, the 2007 Estimates are fiscally sustainable, economically appropriate and politically responsible.  The maintenance of stability has been the cornerstone of our economic success.  Stable and sensible policies have enabled us to generate the resources necessary to tackle poverty and social inequalities and to improve public services.  The budget will provide for a social welfare package and some additional expenditure on health.</P>
        <P>The Government will publish the National Development Plan 2007-2013, in January.  This will set out the seven-year investment programme and financial framework for sustainable social and economic development over the medium term.  The Progressive Democrats are pleased to have played an integral part in the Estimates, budget and NDP processes.  I commend the Minister and the Government on their continuing determination and prudence in this area.</P>

    <Title>Estimates for Public Services 2007: Statements (Resumed). </Title>
      <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  While all politics is local, all funding and decision making certainly are not.  When it comes to local government, the perceived, and <Col N="531"/>I fear very real, erosion of local independence and the continuance of the &ldquo;Dublin knows best&rdquo; mentality is constraining and restricting county and city councils&rsquo; development.  There are slim pickings for local government in the 2007 Estimates.  Despite the fact that, according to the Government&rsquo;s own report, there will be a &euro;1.5 billion shortfall in local government funding by 2010, it will receive a miserly 2% increase in budgetary funding this year.  The Minister should get real.  Control on one hand and a closed purse on the other is not realistic.</P>
        <P Just="Left">What does the Minister for State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, suggest?  He says local authorities must get better value for the miserable funding allocation for this year.  Is he advocating the cut-price, low-cost store approach to local services?  He has the nerve to suggest this while the Government is pushing the sale of local authority land banks to private developers.  At the same time, as has often been said in this House, the homeless cannot even get a roof over their heads or young people cannot get a foot on the property ladder.  I cannot emphasise often enough that we can see people sleeping rough in alleyways not 100 metres from this House.</P>
        <P>Local government provides a wide range of services, including housing, water, sewerage, roads, planning, fire services, environmental protection and the provision of recreational facilities.  The major challenges facing local councils are restrained by their regrettable over-dependence on central government.  The aims of local government, which are being frustrated by the Minister, are to improve the quality of the environment and to provide for diverse development.  Local government is an essential element in a democratic state and it is the machinery by which important services are provided.</P>
        <P>Once again the shortfall will fall to the taxpayer as stealth taxes are forced on hard-pressed councils.  Householders and businesses will be forced to make up the massive shortfalls which the 2007 budget will not even come close to addressing.  The tax burden on working families has increased under the Fianna F&aacute;il-Progressive Democrats Government.  The figures in the Estimates show that this, allied with a greater lack of delivery, is bound to continue.  As always, these charges will hit the most vulnerable and disadvantaged in our society but it is manifestly obvious that the Government simply does not care.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The chief executive of Chambers Ireland has said that the 2% increase in the Exchequer contribution to the local government fund will not even cover the increase in wages, let alone services.  As local authorities look to meet the shortfall through increasing commercial rates and other business charges, this will inevitably feed into higher costs and drive people out of business.  I am thinking particularly of small stores through<Col N="532"/>out the country that must pay exorbitant rates.  I am also thinking of rural publicans who are crippled with heavy rates and very little business.  The Exchequer&rsquo;s annual contribution to local government should increase at the same rate as expenditure in other public sector areas.  That is a rate of 8% for 2007.  These Estimates highlight the hallmark of this Government to tax more and spend more but deliver little, except on one money wasting fiasco after another such as electronic voting and the PPARS system.  I could spend the next half hour highlighting the Government&rsquo;s waste over the past nine and a half years in office.</P>
        <P>The record of a lack of delivery from the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, continues.  The increase for local authority housing programmes will not even come close to meeting the demand for housing from the 50,000 households on the waiting lists.  The fiasco of decentralisation, doomed to failure since its initial announcement with a triumphant fanfare in the 2003 budget, has proven to be an empty promise for most areas.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The most recent review of local government was undertaken in 1996 for the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  That is now ten years ago.  The report noted that Ireland has a highly centralised system of financing local government and highlighted the limited discretion for local authorities, insufficient revenue buoyancy and an inequitable funding system.  Countrywide delays in sewerage schemes are a huge problem.  The lack of investment in such schemes is a major threat to development, health and tourism in many areas.  There are at least a half dozen outstanding sewerage schemes in County Longford.  One of these is in Ballinamuck, a town made famous by a battle there in 1798.  It was promised in the run-up to the general election in 1977.  Albert Reynolds said he would never set foot in Ballinamuck again if he did not deliver a sewerage scheme during the term of that Government.  So much for pre-election spin.</P>
        <P>Aside from improved local government funding in the forthcoming budget, I want to see a realistic increase in old age pensions to a more equitable minimum level of &euro;250 per week and a decrease in the age limit to 65 for all.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a costly affair.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>The cost of decreasing the age of the non-contributory state pension from 66 to 65 would have been approximately &euro;28 million to &euro;30 million in 2006.  This allows for the amount which would have been paid in the 2006 budget and the cost would not have been much higher this year.  The main reason to raise the old age <Col N="533"/>pension is to lift older people out of the poverty trap and make them as financially comfortable as possible in their retirement.  After all, we are all heading in that direction some day.  According to the latest Central Statistics Office figures released in 2005, without social transfers, the largest being State pensions, 88.1% of over 65s would be in relative poverty.  Relative poverty is defined as 60% of average disposable income.  To decrease the rate of pensioners at risk of poverty, a considerable increase in the old age pension is necessary.  In 2005, over 65s made up 11.2% of the population but 12.1% of those were at risk of poverty.</P>
        <P>In an era of ever-increasing costs, we are seeing an imminent increase in the prices of electricity and gas.  In August, the regulator approved massive increases in gas and electricity prices based on the level of oil prices which have fallen considerably since the go-ahead was given.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>He has since announced that he is to review those decisions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>This is factual.  The Government allowed a 30% increase in electricity and gas prices.  Circumstances have shown these price increases were based on a false assumption of worldwide oil prices.  Oil prices have fallen dramatically since August but the regulator, with the backing of the Government, is refusing to reconsider such unrealistic increases.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>

	<P>The losers will be our elderly, who are facing a harsh winter and are unable to meet the projected cost of heating their homes from their limited resources.  In a time of plenty, what Government would allow the elderly to bear the burden of the senseless increases I have outlined?  In the next few months and immediately after the budget, we will see an increase in stealth taxes.  The people who will bear most of this burden are the elderly, sick and disabled.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>With our lamentable record on Kyoto, what will the Government do to develop a sustainable energy sector?  The Estimates show a 3% cut in funding for research and development and forestry which, when inflation is taken into account, is a significant cut in available funding.  These are key areas for the future development of agriculture, especially for the food and bio-fuel industries.  Their neglect indicates that the Government has no grand plan for agriculture and a lack of commitment to the future of farming.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>My colleague opposite has been on a rather confused and complicated odyssey of some kind to the land of nowhere.  In welcoming the Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan, I wish to comment on his spending plans for the coming year.  He has responsibility for overseas development aid and in the short time he has been in office, he has made spectacular progress in securing a substantial increase in funding for overseas development aid.</P>
        <P>I am pleased to welcome the &euro;813 million the Minister of State has secured.  He has reached the target of 0.5% of gross domestic product, GDP, to which he committed himself.  At the beginning of his Ministry, he made it quite clear where he <Col N="535"/>stood and I acknowledge that.  He has a target of 0.6% of GDP by 2010, which he is determined to achieve, and a target of 0.7% of GDP by 2012.  One of the most spectacular achievements for the coming year is the increase of 50% in emergency aid for famine, drought and other unanticipated difficulties which occur worldwide.  I have no doubt the Minister of State is ensuring Ireland is living up to its international obligations in terms of humanitarian aid.  I am very impressed with his performance and am glad he is in the House to hear me say that.</P>
        <P>I commend the Minister for Finance on his overall approach to the Estimates for the coming year.  There is widespread acknowledgement, although perhaps there might not have been three or four weeks ago, that the Minister&rsquo;s spending plans are appropriate, responsible and sustainable, to use his words.  The yardstick by which we should analyse and judge his plans are their appropriateness, responsibility in regard to spending for next year and future years and their sustainability in terms of a successful economy.</P>
        <P>The economy is working very well and is the envy of the developed world.  It is second or third from the top of the league table in performance terms and our people are at work.  A nation that is at work is, by and large, a happy one.  Last year alone 80,000 additional jobs were created.  When one looks at the extent to which we must use migrants from abroad, both EU nationals and, to a lesser extent, non-EU nationals, we have full employment.  Our job creation rate is three times the EU average and the real challenge is to ensure we do not do anything which puts this achievement and momentum at risk.  The manner in which the Minister for Finance presented recent budgets and these Estimates ensures that momentum continues.  After all, jobs mean wages and salaries and they are an obvious solution to poverty.  We can come up with many commendable schemes to deal with poverty but at the end of the day, jobs are the best way to address poverty because by giving people wages and salaries, one restores their dignity.  Jobs reduce the number dependent on social welfare and create revenue to fund public services through income tax.</P>
        <P>Gurus in certain places have been prophesying profligacy, recklessness and auction politics by the Minister for Finance but they have been proved very wrong.  There is a considerable amount of money because of the very successful way the Government has overseen the operation of the economy.  I also accept partnership is at the core of that.  The phenomenal performance has manifested itself in a significant surplus of money.  Instead of profligacy, there has been prudence and instead of recklessness, at which some people in the media and elsewhere were hinting, there has been responsibility.  Now those same gurus are trying to anticipate the Minister for Finance&rsquo;s next moves.  Some of them are still hinting that <Col N="536"/>recklessness will break out in the budget but they will be proved very wrong in that regard.</P>
        <P>Nowadays when we look at the Estimates, we see many different figures.  We no longer count in hundreds of millions but in billions.  The figures are mind boggling.  No matter how large the amount of money, it is important it is targeted in a way which creates a better quality of life for all.  No matter how well an economy performs and irrespective of the surplus of money, if we do not improve the quality of life for people, we are not successful.</P>
        <P>The clear principles which should underline any spending plans and programmes are family and community &mdash; our children and older people &mdash; and the quality of service we provide for everybody.  As we know, the services are delivered through education, health and the environment.  Senator Bannon had some negative things to say with which I disagree.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator was named as a waster by a businessman in this city.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not wish to engage in an argument with the Senator.</P>
        <P>I refer to one service as a type of yardstick for the manner in which part of the considerable bundle of money available to the public is targeted, that is, the welfare of our children and the opportunities they get through education.  There is no doubt from the substantial increase in money being given to, and the emphasis on, education that we are giving priority to our children and the opportunities they should get.  We have seen the largest ever increase in capitation funding for our schools.  It has increased by &euro;18 per pupil, the largest increase in the history of the State.  It means heating, lighting and insurance costs, which seem trivial but which are very important to schools and can impose a burden on principals and staff, are adequately covered.  The considerable increases the Minister has secured this year to fund those items will lessen the burden on principals and staff and enable them to concentrate on their educational and pedagogic duties.  This year primary schools will receive more than &euro;163 for every pupil attending while secondary schools will receive approximately &euro;316 per student.  As I said, this is the largest capitation increase in the history of the State.</P>
        <P>One of the major issues in public debate recently has been class size.  Pupil-teacher ratio is no longer the criterion because it has been greatly reduced in recent years by the phenomenal number of additional staff brought into schools, more than 11,000 in the last eight or nine years.  However no Member of either House would disagree that class size has rightly become an issue.  I am glad to see an extra 800 teachers are being assigned to reduce class sizes further this year and to support children whose first language is not English.  This brings the number of new teachers in schools since 2005 to 1,900.  I have always said <Col N="537"/>education must be about making the world better for all children and not just those who can afford an elite education.  This issue arose in the House last week.  Our education system should give that assurance for future generations.</P>
        <P>The most vulnerable who need most help are children with special educational needs, the disadvantaged and those who missed out on first chance education through no fault of their own.  I welcome the decision to increase funding on special education to more than &euro;820 million, including covering the cost of almost 8,000 special needs assistants who the Government are rightly targeting as a priority for those most in need.  The special needs assistants give essential back-up and support to special needs children.  Their rights have been enshrined in law, extra money has been directed at special education and over recent years there has been a phenomenal aggregate increase in the way special education is funded.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator may dream on.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">There will be a meaningful beginning to the provisions of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act in the coming year.  A few years ago the entire special education sector received only crumbs.  Special education teachers worked hard to bring about a service to meet the needs of these children.  There was no framework and despite the best endeavours of teachers, it was hit and miss.  We now have a framework, their rights are enshrined in law and substantial additional resources are being targeted to ensure a quality of service is delivered to them.</P>
        <P>I am heartened by the fact that, consistent with the Minister&rsquo;s approach to give priority unashamedly to those in greatest need, the increase in the capitation grant for special schools is greater than that of other schools.  The rate for children with physical disabilities has almost doubled.  The increase in the money for special education is to the extent of about &euro;180 million, almost 30%, and this is significant.  At the same time the Minister accepts that much work remains to be done to ensure we bring services to the optimum level for these children.</P>
        <P>Tackling disadvantage is another area that has posed a challenge to the education system through the years.  Many schemes were devised to try to address this and provide greater equality of opportunity for children who were economically, socially or educationally disadvantaged, or all three, and the links between the three are obvious.  It goes without fear of contradiction to say this Government has recognised the important influence parents have on their children&rsquo;s education.  Recently the Minister announced an expansion in the number of home-school-community liaison teachers.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="538"/>
      <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>They are being withdrawn everywhere.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>This link between home and school is being more closely developed and school principals tell me these programmes have a significant impact on the communities where they are targeted.  There is a huge follow-on advantage in reducing loitering, truancy and anti-social behaviour.  The school completion programme is familiar to me in my constituency.  I have frequently spoken to those who operate it and to school principals and staff.  The outcomes are spectacular.  I am glad the Minister has decided to extend the pilot programme.</P>
        <P>I would like to say more and I will have the opportunity to do so at next week&rsquo;s debate on education.  I would like to single out the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science, Deputy de Valera.  In the few years she has been in charge of youth work, adult and further education, literacy and other supports for second-chance people she has made a significant impact.  I will quote from the National Youth Council of Ireland, NYCI, president, Mr. James O&rsquo;Leary.  When he became aware of the Estimates last week he stated that, &ldquo;NYCI and the member organisations it represents owe a debt of gratitude to Minister de Valera, who has proven herself to be a powerful advocate for the youth work sector.&rdquo;  That is a glowing, strong and unequivocal tribute.  He went on to say she, &ldquo;has delivered once again for young people in the form of a 14%, &euro;6.2 million, increase for the youth sector in 2007&rdquo;.  He added that NYCI regrets that this is her last budget for her Department but wants to put on public record how much it values the commitment, sincerity and time she has selflessly given.</P>
        <P>The priorities set out by the Minister in the Estimates are correct.  They are socially progressive and people most in need are getting funding for real improvements in their quality of life, as I have tried to demonstrate through the example of education.  The quality of our education service is improving at every level by strongly favouring the most vulnerable and needy.  I commend the Estimates.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan, to the House in the absence of the Minister for Finance.  To say the Estimates as presented are of any significant importance is overkill in so far as most people say this is a book exercise delivering figures and their meaning.  If this is the sum total of the Government&rsquo;s intentions for the coming year, it is a retrograde step.  The Minister has the opportunity to target areas where need is greatest.  I see no evidence that the Minister has used this opportunity to target the weakest areas in society.  I would welcome correction on this.</P>
        <P>I want to highlight two areas in particular.  In the Estimates the Minister makes a contribution <Col N="539"/>to IDA Ireland, industrial development and where we are going.  If it is policy that we are to have a fair, level field for development and job creation throughout the country, we have serious problems, especially in the west.  It has been highlighted time and again that IDA Ireland concentrates on a few large urban centres, namely, Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Galway.  When one crosses the Shannon at Athlone there is no worthwhile contribution to job creation by the IDA, the body charged with creating jobs.  The only time we see the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment on television is when good news is announced.  We will never again see the major job creation by American companies as has happened, except in elitist positions for graduates.  This is welcome as part of research and development.</P>
        <P>Enterprise Ireland is doing a reasonably good job in job creation.  Its work is targeted at local level but it supports only the endeavours of local entrepreneurs to create jobs and employment.  The IDA has abandoned job creation outside the centres to which I referred.  It is doing so because it claims it cannot attract people.</P>
        <P>The former T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Harney, and the current Minister, Deputy Martin, have established task forces.  One example is the case of Ballinasloe, a town that lost three flagship industries in recent years.  The response was to establish a task force of local agencies, the local authority, councillors, the IDA and Enterprise Ireland.  The task force is only a talking shop, an excuse to soften the blow and announce the delegation of training, for example, to F&Aacute;S.  Deputy Harney&rsquo;s response to the closure of the last major industry in Ballinasloe was to suggest workers travel to Athlone and Galway by train for jobs.  If that is the response of the Minister who had responsibility for industrial development, is it any wonder the west has been abandoned by the IDA?</P>
        <P>AT Cross, Square D and Dubarry were major industries in Ballinasloe.  The first was a high tech company, Square D was an industrial engineering process facility and Dubarry was a traditional shoe manufacturing company.  All three are no longer on the scene.  An important tax incentive designation for the upper Shannon has been a major success.  This was introduced by a former Minister as a pilot project.  If the Government is serious about regenerating an industrial black spot, such as Ballinasloe, the Minister should focus some incentives on the middle Shannon region, south of Athlone, around Ballinasloe, Portumna and Killaloe.  Those in the Shannon area, as distinct from the IDA, have been positive in supporting the development of local industry from the Shannon industrial authority area as far as Birr, on the other side of the Shannon.  On the western side of the Shannon there are serious difficulties with development.  At a time of plenty the Minister should target this area for an extension of the pilot scheme.  Anyone who visits the <Col N="540"/>region can see the improvements made to the upper Shannon area.  It can be extended to the middle Shannon area, where industrial jobs have been lost, agricultural output has declined and people are exasperated by the flight from the land.  I hope the Minister for Finance, a neighbour of the area, can recognise the need for such a pilot scheme in this area.</P>
        <P>We have another example of the callous disregard for those who are most vulnerable in society, namely, the decision to appeal the tribunal ruling in favour of the Equality Authority on behalf of two people challenging the supplementary addendum to leaving certificate results.  This may have been done by Department officials or the curriculum examination section, acting unilaterally without the knowledge of the Minister.  If the Minister sanctioned it, it indicates and verifies her failure to recognise those who are vulnerable in society.  The addendum highlighted the inadequacies of the people who received the leaving certificate.  It was unbelievable and unprecedented that any Department would highlight the special needs of those candidates and that they were inadequate in areas of spelling and grammar.  Traditionally, the Department of Education and Science made special provision for those types of students to receive assistance in the examination, which may be a traumatic event in view of the students&rsquo; special needs.  Instead of challenging this ruling once more and bringing further trauma, I ask the Minister for Education and Science to examine this matter and withdraw the appeal.  It will have the most serious consequences ever known in an educational process.</P>
        <P>The Department of Agriculture and Food, which had been traditionally associated with challenges, goes through court processes every year to challenge minor routine matters that it has failed to discuss with various parties involved.  I do not know why this is the case.  Perhaps officials in a Department believe they can make a name for themselves and use the court decision as a benchmark of success.  They fail to acknowledge this costs the taxpayer money.  What does it achieve?  A further putdown to those disadvantaged in our society.  I urge the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Lenihan, to ask the Minister for Education and Science to withdraw the appeal.</P>
        <P>Regarding the Estimates, over the years the Department has proposed public private partnerships for building schools, school management and the provision of services and maintenance afterwards.  In three examples, Cork, Sligo and Monaghan, the project was completed at a cost 13% higher than the estimate of the Department.  The Department of Education and Science has withdrawn the idea that it would go through that same process in Donabate where there is an urgent need for a second level school.  Nonetheless, when I examine the Estimates, I see the provision under the heading of public private partnerships is increasing by 58%.  Is this a failure to <Col N="541"/>recognise that the use of public private partnerships in the provision of schools has not worked given that we are now withdrawing from the process because three of the schools provided under it cost 13% more than the sum for which the Department could have provided them, never mind the sum for which the local communities could have provided them had they been given the chance?  There was a move towards allowing local communities provide for and build their own schools.  They could have done it much more cheaply than in other instances.  Can the Minister of State tell me why, on the one hand, we seem to be abandoning the process of public private partnership in education and, on the other, there is a 58% increase in the funding for this specific element according to the Estimates?</P>
        <P>With the Chair&rsquo;s permission, I will discuss one further aspect.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator&rsquo;s time is almost up.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate the Chair&rsquo;s indulgence and will be very brief.  Throughout the country, especially in County Galway, we are told there are many projects for improvement in water and sewerage infrastructure.  At the same time, IDA Ireland says it cannot provide jobs in a particular area because it lacks the infrastructure.  Although, we are told by Government public representatives that there is an abundance of funds for various water schemes and sewerage projects, there has still been no progress on any of them over the past three or four years.  No new projects have come on stream.  The two things are not reconcilable.  The situation involves nothing but spin.  There is money available but these projects cannot be progressed.  It is not possible to meet the Minister to finalise matters exactly and get a definitive answer when they will take place.  As a result, the local authorities are blamed.  I hope we will get the opportunity to expand on these issues later.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CyprianBrady"><NameTxt>Mr. Brady</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Parlon, to the House and congratulate the Minister for Finance on what is another step along a very successful path he has followed during his time in the Department of Finance.  Probably the most obvious and quantifiable sign of the success of the policies that have been followed to date is employment and the changes we have seen in this area.  According to the Minister, we now have a country at work and an economy that is working.  Anybody who went through the Estimates in detail over recent days will have seen where our priorities lie.  They will also have seen that the priorities we have chosen are based on talking to and listening to people and taking their views on board.  This is very evident from the way the Estimates have been framed and in the policies that have been followed up to now.</P><Col N="542"/>
        <P>We are not where we are today by chance, but rather by taking measures at times when it was difficult to take them, when we put up with much criticism and when the Government, in particular, was criticised for spending too much and, shortly afterwards, criticised for not spending enough.  One must take account of circumstances over recent years which were outside our control, such as the events of 11 September 2001, fuel and oil prices and problems with the economies of other countries.  By sound government and the hard work of the people of this country, we are where we are today.</P>
        <P>For us to be able to have sustained and continued an average yearly growth of 7% over the past ten years is a phenomenal achievement when one considers that we had increases in population and significant immigration.  We have continued to pursue foreign direct investment probably more successfully than any other country in the world.  The fact that a country of this size is in a position to say that, at one stage, it was the leading producer of software, not just in Europe but in the world, and was competing with the likes of the US, India and China must be taken into account.  Some credit must be given for the prudent and sound way the Government has managed our economy over recent years.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I worked in employment exchanges in the early 1980s when the queues were out the door and when people had the choice of signing on at the employment exchange or emigrating.  It was as simple as that.  When I left school, the only choices we had were to go into the Civil Service or the bank or to emigrate.  They were the three choices we had.  Very few people were lucky enough to get into the Civil Service and even fewer were lucky to get employment in the banks.  For many people, there was no question at that stage of going on to third level education.  Very few people at that stage could do so.  That has changed considerably.</P>
        <P>A relatively short time ago, we had unemployment rates of up to 20%, which were higher in what were called &ldquo;blackspots&rdquo; at the time.  There were nightly news reports of unemployment blackspots and the jobless figures for these areas spiralled upwards.  It took us a long time to tackle and stop that spiralling figure.  One can look at the changes today and see an unemployment rate of 4.5% and a long-term unemployment rate of 1.4%, which is one of the lowest such rates in Europe.  Long-term unemployment was a significant issue when I worked in employment exchanges.  The long-term unemployment figures we sent in every week from the Department of Social Welfare were enormous and the rate kept increasing.</P>
        <P>I see the benefits of today&rsquo;s changes every day.  Recently in the North Wall an old lady told me that the recent situation reminded her of the 1940s and 1950s when the port of Dublin and its docklands were at their height and streams of people went to work very early in the morning. <Col N="543"/> She told me how after generations of unemployment in a devastated area where there was no hope and which contained drugs and low-quality social housing, young people and both parents of families were now working again.  There was a chance for their children to get a job, finish their schooling and possibly enter third level education.  The people had come out of the problems that faced the area.</P>
        <P>If a person had been told by someone else five years ago that there would now be a third level college within 300 metres of Sheriff Street, he or she would have laughed at them.  Today, the National College of Ireland, one of the leading colleges in the country, is located there.  Again, young people from this locality have the opportunity to attend this college.  These are the changes we have seen.</P>
        <P>The management of our economy is not just for today; it is also looking to the future.  We should not apologise for this.  The National Pensions Reserve Fund of &euro;17.6 billion, which we have put in place over recent years, is for our future and that of our children.  We should not have any qualms about telling people that this is what we are doing.</P>
        <P>Next year, we will spend &euro;149 million every day in this country.  Again, we should not apologise for this.  We have listened to the doom and gloom merchants for many years.  Like everything else, if one says something and repeats it long enough, it is bound to happen at some stage.  Economies, including the world economy, are cyclical.  There have been troughs and peaks in this economy but we have managed our way through the crises.  This did not happen by accident; it required firm decision making and leadership.</P>
        <P>I recall that during the currency crisis in the 1980s there was a sense that there was no hope for our economy.  The rate of inflation was massive and interest rates were touching 18%.  There is much talk of people not being able to afford to buy a house now but at that stage people had no hope of being able to buy not because they could not afford the mortgage repayments but because houses were not being built.  There have been major changes since then, for which we should not make an apology.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I wish to concentrate on two areas in regard to the Estimates, the first being education.  There is a record increase in the Estimates again this year in terms of expenditure on education.  Some &euro;8.4 billion will be spent on education next year.  That level of expenditure represents a massive increase and a trebling of the level of expenditure in the past ten years.</P>
        <P>Members on the Government side of the House have always believed in the power of education and in everybody having an opportunity to fulfil his or her potential.  Generations of members of Fianna F&aacute;il and other parties have worked on that basis for many years and we have proven the benefit of that belief.  The current <Col N="544"/>Minister for Education and Science stated her position and priorities from an early stage, as did her predecessor, and the Minister has adhered to those priorities.  She has continued to support investing in the future of our children for the benefit of the country, to which priority is rightly given.  As the Minister said, she will continue to invest from first level to fourth level.  She has prioritised investment in innovation, technology and the sciences with the future in mind.  As a former teacher, the Minister realises what needs to be done in these areas.</P>

        <P>The Minister pointed out when she took office that to reverse the trend of the policies in place and to target the areas where there had been a lack investment, she had to start somewhere.  One cannot argue with the progress made in recent years.  We are not only investing in education from an economic perspective but from a social perspective.  The Senator opposite was correct in pointing out that a society is judged by how well it treats its most vulnerable people.  Major resources have been invested in the areas of disadvantage and disability which has resulted in massive changes.</P>
        <P>I see those changes every day in the north inner city area of my constituency.  Children are more confident.  They know they will have opportunities in education in the future.  There is hope for them that did not exist for many young people ten years ago.  Children in that area did not have the hope of aspiring even to complete their leaving certificate.  A major issue in the north inner city is to encourage young people to go on to third level.  Access programmes are in place.  Many of the universities and colleges are recruiting in that area.  The International Financial Services Centre is eager to recruit young people to work in banks and other financial institutions.  This is where the changes are evident.</P>
        <P>Great strides have been made in addressing needs in the area of special education.  There is a 30% increase in provision in the Estimates for this area.  It will provide for the allocation of additional special needs assistants, streamline the assessment process by facilitating the carrying out of assessments in a shorter period and provide <Col N="545"/>more accessibility for parents.  A greater exchange of information is possible between teachers and parents which was not the position previously because teachers were too busy.  They did not have support services and they had to deal with children with a range of different abilities in one class and they could not cope, but now they have the necessary support and assistance.  Special needs organisers throughout the country consult parents and teachers, listen to their needs and report that information to the Department which then provides for those needs.  That provision would not be possible without the prudent management of the economy.  We were not in a position to pay for such provision ten years ago.</P>

	<P>More must be done but we had to start somewhere and great progress has been made.  The Minister will continue to increase capitation funding for special schools and more special needs assistants will be allocated.  The home-school-community liaison scheme, which has been a great success&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>Those officers have been withdrawn.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CyprianBrady"><NameTxt>Mr. Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>Many parents may not have been in a position to complete their schooling, as a result of which many of them have a difficulty with reading and writing.   Those parents cannot help their children in sixth year in secondary school with their homework, but the home-school-community liaison scheme is in place, which is greatly supported.  That scheme is available to those students and it has made a major difference.  The involvement of parents in the education of their children is crucial.  Such involvement should be encouraged and, in that respect, small changes make a significant difference.  The participation of teachers in parent-teacher meetings after school hours is a major change.  It means both parents can attend if they wish and single parents can attend after work.  Such a small change makes a significant difference.</P>
        <P>The Estimates provision will result in the allocation of an additional 1,900 teachers over the next two years, which will reduce class sizes.  In most schools principals have time to walk around the school and check the position, which was not the case previously.</P>
        <P>Particular attention is paid in the Estimates to provision for the areas of disability and disadvantage.  The focus is on educational inclusion.  The exclusion of people from education is detrimental to their future potential.  That was recognised on the Government side of the House at an early stage.  The more we can do to continue to pour resources into that area, the better.  The figures for education speak for themselves.  Any teacher <Col N="546"/>throughout the country will confirm that teaching is a difficult job.  It  has always been so but it has been made a little less difficult now owing to the changes that have taken place, especially in the area of special needs education and disadvantaged areas.</P>
        <P>The benefits achieved are not only for those areas but for the country as a whole.  We have a young, vibrant, well educated workforce, the members of which are much sought after throughout the world.  As has been said here many times, we are the envy of most of Europe and elsewhere in the world.  That achievement did not happen by chance or without strong governance.  We can be accused of many things, but not of a lack of success in that area.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>We are bottom of the league.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CyprianBrady"><NameTxt>Mr. Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish also to raise the matter of the security of communities.  We have had many debates on people&rsquo;s sense of insecurity, an issue that is raised regularly in advice centres and when talking to people.  With the changes that have occurred in society and having regard to the vulnerable members of our communities such as older people, it is welcome that a 10% increase in Garda resources alone this year will increase spending in this area to &euro;1.4 billion.  Despite all the naysayers and doom and gloom merchants, we will have a Garda strength of 14,000 on our streets.  We see the benefits of the increased Garda presence in our communities.  A person mentioned to me that they saw three reservists and a Garda on the beat in Raheny yesterday.  People want to see such a Garda presence.  People demand the presence of garda&iacute; on the beat and that is where they will be.  The resources invested in increasing security in communities will pay benefits.  Many Opposition Members and some members of the media lose out because all they see is the negative side.  They only see the negative and continue to portray everything as being a burden and not in people&rsquo;s interest when it is not the case.</P>
        <P>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will be better equipped and supported by the Garda reserve.  The PULSE system is up and running.  This extra investment will result in better Garda stations, better communications equipment and 1,200 new vehicles being put on the road.  We listen to people and take their views on board.  As a Government that is what we must do.  We must also take action, specifically where people need to see action being taken.</P>
        <P>We will produce 275 garda&iacute; every three months next year and I know from speaking with garda&iacute; this is welcomed within the force.  Changes have taken place in training and facilities in Templemore.  Everybody knows incidence of certain types of crimes have increased and crime is a major issue in some areas.  In other areas, it is under control.  The fact we continue to invest money and resources into these areas can only <Col N="547"/>be of benefit in the long run.  Particular targeted operations, such as Operation Anvil, are major successes.  I am delighted to see it will continue to be supported.</P>
        <P>I welcome the link between the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the RAPID areas which have suffered and been neglected under successive Governments.  As a result, they are completely disadvantaged.  Many have been ravaged by drugs and suffer major social problems.  I am pleased they will be provided with what are termed &ldquo;community protection measures&rdquo;.  While they may seem simple and insignificant, they will make a huge difference to local communities.  We will spend &euro;7.5 million on CCTV and &euro;3 million on graffiti removal.  This can make a huge difference to a person&rsquo;s quality of life.  A total of &euro;16 million will be spent on a new service for youth justice.  We must concentrate resources and continue to improve the service, particularly regarding the introduction of anti-social behaviour orders.</P>
        <P>I congratulate the Department and the Minister.  To quote the Minister, these Estimates are &ldquo;fiscally sustainable, economically appropriate and politically responsible&rdquo;.  This is crucial because we take responsibility for the decisions we make.  We listen to people&rsquo;s concerns and we act on them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly"><NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad to have an opportunity to acknowledge the volume of work, the time taken and careful consideration given by the Minister for Finance, the Minister of State and staff at the Department in the preparation of the Estimates and gathering the facts and figures.  It enables the country to continue to develop in the rapid way it has during recent years.  Any assessment of the Estimates must acknowledge the huge amount of work done.  It indicates the economic prosperity we have seen during recent years will continue and accelerate.</P>
        <P>I wish to comment constructively on issues which arise and require further consideration.  The points of view I will put across will be recognised as being held by many public representatives on issues we believe should be accelerated.  I am conscious of the large volume of work which went into preparing the Health Estimate.  The figures in the Estimate and the additional funding we hope will be in the budget indicate the Government&rsquo;s commitment to the provision of health services.</P>
        <P>We must put in place an implementation body which will ensure the plans for next year laid down in the Estimates are implemented.  I am aware money provided for certain matters and initiatives included in the Estimates last year has not worked its way down through the system.  Sometimes it is necessary to ensure decisions made to undertake worthwhile projects are implemented and accelerated and not held up by red tape and bureaucracy.</P><Col N="548"/>
        <P Just="Left">This has happened with Ennis Hospital, where an outline development plan has been in place and funding allocated for a number of years.  However, the expenditure has not been undertaken because of a necessity to rigorously re-evaluate a project which has already been re-evaluated on a number of occasions during the past five or six years.  The longer re-evaluations continue the more likely it is that costs will increase.  The total of &euro;20 million set aside for Ennis Hospital a number of years ago has become &euro;30 million.  If this type of delay continues, it will increase to &euro;40 million or &euro;50 million.  An implementation team should be established at the Department of Finance to ensure that when decisions are made on issues such as hospitals or other matters the projects are implemented.</P>
        <P>Many voluntary organisations consider further funding is required to deal with issues such as Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease, depression and dementia.  A recent conference held in Dublin indicated the problems which will arise in this country during the coming years.  I am aware of people who work on a voluntary basis to provide facilities for people suffering from Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease.  In particular, I mention the community in Clarecastle who provide a day-care centre for Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease and dementia sufferers from a large surrounding area.  People are bussed in and return to their families at night.</P>
        <P>Most of the funding is done on a voluntary basis with little, if any, funding from the Health Service Executive.  The community has campaigned for a number of years and has done a great deal of work through voluntary effort.  However, people cannot continue to work on a voluntary basis on such projects.  The State must intervene and work in partnership with local communities.  I am sure many other such communities exist throughout the country.  In Clarecastle, approximately &euro;500,000 is required to finish planning and building an extension.  The community has done Trojan work but it requires support from the Health Service Executive.</P>
        <P>I strongly urge the Minister for Finance to identify in the budget a fixed amount to plan for shortcomings in dealing with dementia and Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease.  Perhaps he will set down a separate allocation for it in the additional funding for health to be provided in the budget and which he identified in his speech.</P>
    <HtmlBk SectId="4" />
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">2 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P Just="Left">I also draw to the attention of the Minister the funding for national secondary and regional roads in the west.  Substantial funding has gone into the national roads network and I particularly welcome the Limerick bypass and other new national road developments to the west coast.  The national secondary roads network requires more funding as it is deteriorating at a fast pace.  Perhaps the Minister can examine this matter.  Many accidents are occurring owing to the poor quality of such roads. Therefore, extra funding is required.</P><Col N="549"/>
        <P Just="Left">There has been a dramatic change in investment in county roads in recent years, on which I compliment the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, his Department and the county councils.  There are shortcomings in the national secondary road network, however, which need to be addressed fairly soon.  We should not lose sight of this issue, which requires additional funding from the budget.  It may be a matter for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government rather than the Minister for Finance but ultimately the latter Minister picks up all the bills.</P>
        <P>The essential repairs grant scheme has been run by county councils and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, with some funding from the Health Service Executive to repair houses for disabled people.  A sizeable number of single parents with young children are living in inadequate conditions.  Shortcomings have been identified in showers, toilets and other facilities.  It should be possible within the existing mechanism to extend the essential repairs grant to cover single parents who are struggling to raise young children.  Such parents do not have the necessary finances to modernise their plumbing facilities, so the work should be covered by the essential repairs grant scheme.</P>
        <P>For a number of years, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, and the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, who is present in the Chamber,  have provided funding for heritage projects.  I have seen the work undertaken by the Commissioners of Public Works in dealing with heritage issues.  An amount of important work has been done which provides examples of good craftsmanship.  I wish to place on the record the work that has been achieved by the dedicated people of the OPW.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Some buildings of national importance are in the care of the OPW.  Others in private ownership are threatened, however, owing to a lack of investment in conservation and maintenance work.  I am referring to places such as Leamanagh Castle, which is at the gateway to the Burren in north Clare.  It was the home of M&aacute;ire Ruadh Mac Mahon, a famous woman who made a big impact on life in Clare at a particular period in history.  The castle is a good example of how the skills and expertise of the Commissioners of Public Works could be put to good use to restore and protect the building.  In recent years, much work has been done on a number of ecclesiastical buildings by parishes and local conservationists.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I pay tribute to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, for the funding he provided to protect Ennis Cathedral, including its spire and other unique architectural aspects.  Last year, the Minister provided &euro;150,000 for restoration work there.  The cost of restoring such ecclesiastical buildings is very expensive so much depends on voluntary collections.  I am referring in particular <Col N="550"/>to the expensive work being carried out on St. Senan&rsquo;s Church in Kilrush.  The church edifice, including its spire, was in danger of being seriously damaged unless some remedial work was undertaken.  The restoration and conservation work on the church will be an expensive operation.  I ask the Minister to set aside a budgetary allocation to enhance work on such heritage projects.  Attention must be paid to buildings of architectural and historical significance around the country which are in need of conservation and restoration.  In some cases it may not be possible for voluntary community organisations in small parishes to undertake such work alone.</P>
        <P>I thank the Minister and Minister of State for the work they are doing.  I look forward to the budget which will provide a further boost to the work that has already been undertaken by the Government.  It will ensure that much valuable work can be done over the next year by taking advantage of economic opportunities, enhancing the environment and generally making life better for all of us in future.</P>
    </Speaker><!--Fix-->
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>Like other speakers, I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, to the House.  Earlier, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, outlined the Estimates programme to the House.  We are fortunate to be living in such times.  Those who were involved in politics back in the 1970s and 1980s have witnessed Ireland&rsquo;s changing fortunes in more recent times.  Twenty or 30 years ago, the Estimates presented a different story of severe economic and social problems, including unemployment and emigration.  Our country has now turned the corner thanks to difficult decisions taken by politicians, ably assisted by those in the public service.  Those decisions ensured that we can enjoy better times today.  </P>
        <P>Many of the increased resources have been targeted at areas in need of investment.  The fruits of that investment are evident to many who in the past would have felt themselves to be economically disadvantaged and unable to access quality public services.  The situation is changing but more needs to be done.  The most topical issue of all is the health service.</P>
        <P>The Estimates show that within less than a decade we have quadrupled investment in health.  It is fair to say, however, that the quality of the health service has not kept pace with that increased investment.  There is a real challenge to provide effective management training and input so that the leadership providing such services matches current investment.  Significant improvements have been made in the health sector but difficulties remain.  These are based more on personnel management issues than on the problem of financial resources.</P>
        <P>The same goes for education where much needed improvements have taken place.  The quality for many schools, particularly at primary level, left much to be desired due to a dearth of <Col N="551"/>investment in such resources over decades and probably even since the foundation of the State.  In former years we did not have the necessary resources so it is good to see improvements coming about in the education sector.</P>
        <P>The same argument applies to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na where we have witnessed an improvement in numbers.  Resources constitute an important issue in this regard.  The safety and security experienced in society is attributable to the calibre of the Garda.  In this regard, it is important sufficient funds are set aside in the Estimates to ensure the best possible training to international standards.  Often in the private sector high quality training is sought for people in important executive positions and I have not seen the same concentration of priority on this matter in the public sector.  We tend to depend on the Institute of Public Administration, IPA, to a large extent and we should look to other suppliers of training to ensure those occupying senior positions in the State sector operate to the highest standards.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Many of us have experience in the area of local government and it is enjoying far more resources today than in the past.  My colleague, Senator Daly, alluded to secondary roads and so on but I remember when the resurfacing cycle was heading for 30 years, which had a huge impact, owing to scarce resources.  I spent a long time as a councillor at both county and town level and there is a wide variance in the standard of senior executive at that level.  We must concentrate on different levels of management within the local government system, including county manager level.  The same applies to the private sector, where I have worked a great deal.  Those who come from a business background will concede that, where companies generate significant income and are profitable, cost controls can slide and the status of value for money as a priority can fall due to the generation of high income.</P>
        <P>This system does not exist in the public sector and the discipline that derives from competition is not there.  We must constantly examine areas for improvement and cost effectiveness without diminishing the quality of public service.  There is now a heavy concentration on the development of infrastructure where there was a deficit for many decades and it is great to see investment in road and rail.  This is something our modern economy requires and, as a country on the periphery of Europe, it is essential if we are to remain competitive with other European states.  We need a transport system that will allow us to trade effectively and competitively.</P>
        <P>I have seen recent road improvements, going through greenfield sites, that disregard improvements made within the past decade and this typifies a lack of proper long-term planning.  I do not understand how planning can look 15 to 20 years into the future when the infrastructure in question may have a lifespan of 100 to 120 years or <Col N="552"/>longer if properly planned.  Motorways built today with two lanes may require a third or fourth lane in 20, 30 or 40 years, however no provision is being made for such a possibility.  Development is taking place beside such motorways which leads me to believe new motorways will be required in 30, 40 or 50 years to accommodate traffic flow.  This represents appalling planning and it is an area we should examine to ensure taxpayers receive value for money and know that infrastructural developments are sustainable in the long term.</P>
        <P>A seven hour delay on the N11 yesterday, alluded to on the Order of Business this morning, is an example that typifies a mindset that needs to change with regard to infrastructural planning.  Someone should have foreseen an enormous delay to traffic and ensured the works took place at a time when such consequences could be avoided or mitigated.</P>
        <P>On a recent bank holiday weekend I travelled from the south east to Dublin on the N9 and there was a 40 to 45 minute tailback around Moone.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>Did the tailback occur at Castledermot?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>No, it was beyond Castledermot at Moone after the straight stretch.  I did not know whether an accident had occurred but it transpired roadworks were the cause.  My passenger was amazed it had not occurred to an official in the county council that traffic would be greatly increased on a bank holiday weekend and that the roadworks should be postponed until a more suitable day.  If one makes such mistakes in the private sector one tends not to be allowed repeat them. However, such discipline does not exist in the public sector and I believe this should be examined.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The increased expenditure we are discussing has come from enhanced resources.  Those resources come from a stronger level of activity which was led by difficult, far-reaching decisions made by Government, pursued by dedicated officials in the public service and greatly assisted by enterprising people in the private sector.  Many of these resources derive from the property sector and we have become dependent on the construction industry.  There seems to be something of a slowdown in that sector at present, especially regarding the sale of houses, and I compliment the Minister on making certain concessions on stamp duty for first-time buyers in recent years.  I would like to think this policy will be extended and that those buying above a threshold will pay stamp duty at the higher rate only on the excess above that threshold.  A great deal of revenue comes to the Exchequer from the sale of a house to a first-time buyer through income tax on the workers involved, stamp duty on the purchase of the house and value added tax on furnishings and <Col N="553"/>so on.  This area, therefore, should be considered for change.</P>
        <P>I have mentioned value for money and I feel it is a huge issue in the public sector which should be prioritised by Government.  My experience in business makes me think some &euro;4 billion to &euro;5 billion is being spent unnecessarily which if stopped would not affect quality of service.  It may not all be waste, but some of it is and the area should be examined.</P>
        <P>People in business will attest that the Irish worker, long recognised as committed and dedicated, may be starting to reflect their counterparts in Germany where people, as they became more affluent, did not wish to work long hours or as hard as they did in the past.  They sought to enjoy the fruits of their labour.  In some sectors employers are not certain Irish workers will turn up for work on Monday mornings, do overtime or work on Friday afternoons.  No such difficulties arise with Polish employees.  A campaign should be introduced to inform people throughout the public and private sectors that hard work and commitment delivered economic success and that these qualities remain priorities in times of affluence.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senators from all sides for their wide-ranging contributions to the debate on the 2007 Estimates.  Before addressing the specific issues raised, I reiterate that in framing the Estimates the Government sought to strike a balance between providing for spending on improved public services, meaning social and infrastructural priorities, and preserving the sustainability of public finances.  In day-to-day expenditure on services, the Government has again given priority to spending on health, education and social welfare, with 76% of current expenditure on a pre-budget basis allocated to these top three priority areas. </P>
        <P>Senator Daly referred to the importance of expenditure on national monuments.  The Office of Public Works, for which I am responsible, has responsibility for 775 national monuments and historic properties, and expenditure on this area will amount to &euro;42.7 million in the coming year.  A significant proportion of the overall Estimate for the Department will be spent on this important work.</P>
        <P>Senator John Paul Phelan sought clarification on the reduced allocation for the CL&Aacute;R programme.  The overall allocation for the programme decreased by &euro;2.7 million to &euro;20.2 million in 2007.  Given that its expected 2006 outturn is &euro;18.5 million, the 2007 allocation provides for an increase in actual expenditure.</P>
        <P>The reduction of 15% in the provision for the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland is due to a once-off purchase of new equipment in 2006.  The Senator also referred to a number of offices which show a decrease in their administrative budget.  The administrative budgets in Depart<Col N="554"/>ments and offices are set within agreed limits with savings carried forward into subsequent years.  These savings will be added in the Revised Estimates Volume when it is published in February.  In addition, value for money expenditure is reclassified between administrative budget subheads to increase transparency on value for money and IT expenditure.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senators expressed scepticism regarding the Government&rsquo;s commitment to value for money and Estimates reform.  In the 2006 budget the Minister for Finance introduced significant reforms of the Estimates process.  Under these reforms, D&aacute;il consideration of the 2007 Estimates will be better informed than in previous years.  After the Revised Estimates Volume for 2007 is presented to the D&aacute;il in February next and referred to the various select committees for detailed consideration, each Minister will table with his or her Estimate an annual output statement covering the Departments and offices under his or her aegis.  The statement will set out the high level goals of the Departments and offices, as contained in their strategy statement, and the programmes and strategies being followed to achieve each goal.  For each programme, the statement will outline the financial resources contained in the Estimates and the human resources deployed.  On the output side it will give the key output targets to be achieved in 2007.</P>
        <P>Under the improved value for money and policy review arrangements announced last June, 90 value for money reviews with an indicative minimum coverage of 10% to 15% of each Department&rsquo;s budget will be carried out in the period from 2006 to 2008.  These and other general reviews that impact on value for money carried out by Departments and agencies must be sent by them to the relevant select committees.  This will complement the information which will be available in the new annual output statement.  Select committees giving detailed consideration to the Estimates in 2007 and beyond will have available to them high quality, comprehensive information to assist their deliberations.  As a result of the robust value for money framework established by the Government, most major projects are being completed within budget and ahead of schedule.</P>
        <P>I reject suggestions that large amounts of overseas aid are being contributed to international organisations.  The large increase in overseas development aid expenditure in recent years has resulted in tangible achievements in the countries assisted by Irish funding.  In Lesotho, for example, where Ireland is the largest donor, the mortality rate of children aged under five years has declined by 32% since 1990.  In Tanzania, with Ireland&rsquo;s support, the number of children in primary school increased from 4.8 million to 7 million between 2002 and 2004.  Over the same period, 32,000 new teachers were recruited and 30,000 classrooms built.  In Mozambique Irish Aid, through a partnership with the Clinton <Col N="555"/>Foundation and Government of Mozambique, is making a major impact on the treatment of people who are HIV positive.</P>
        <P>I also reject claims that the 2007 Estimates are based on stealth taxes or that the significantly increased levels of public expenditure under this Government have been funded through increased taxation.  Aside from a technical increase in the employees&rsquo; annual ceiling for PRSI purposes, which is in line with normal practice, the Estimates are not based on increases in charges, nor did increases in charges form part of discussions on the Estimates.</P>
        <P>The overall amount available to local authorities under the local government fund will be approximately &euro;1.5 billion in 2007.  The Exchequer contribution to the fund continues to be in excess of the statutory minimum set out in the 1998 Act establishing the fund.</P>
        <P>Deputy Bannon raised the impact on the elderly of increased fuel prices.  The Estimates for the Department of Social and Family Affairs provide an additional &euro;59 million for the free schemes to improve provision for elderly people in meeting their fuel costs.  The number of electricity units carried by the free electricity scheme will increase from 1,800 to 2,400 per annum for example.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Criticisms were levelled at the Government&rsquo;s approach to health.  Major improvements in health services have been made possible by significant increases in the front-line staff provided for by the Government.  Since 1997, almost 2,400 additional medical-dental personnel, almost 8,400 additional nurses and more than 8,000 other health professionals, such as speech and language therapists, physiotherapists, social carers and social workers, psychologists and environmental health officers, have been recruited.  In addition, more than 750 additional consultant posts have been filled.</P>
        <P>The large increases in expenditure under this Government have led to real improvements in health services.  Total patient throughput in hospitals has increased by more than 300,000 to more than 1 million per annum.  Waiting times for operations have been dramatically reduced from years to months.  Cancer patient hospital admissions have increased by more than 40,000 and more cancer sufferers are being treated and surviving the condition.  More than 3,000 home care packages are in place for older people.  In 1997, no home care packages were available.  Approximately 1,500 additional acute hospital beds are in use.  The health service has, therefore, benefited from major improvements in a range of areas.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Government will maintain the stability orientated approach to the public finances which has delivered prosperity and social progress.  It will continue to improve the quality of public services through the provision of sustainable levels of resources and the pursuit of value for money.  Gross pre-budget provision for public <Col N="556"/>expenditure in 2007 will increase by 8.1% to &euro;54.3 billion.  The Minister for Finance will announce a social welfare package and additional expenditure on health on budget day.  The National Development Plan 2007 to 2013, which will be published in January next year, will set out the Government&rsquo;s seven-year investment programme for sustainable social and economic development over the medium term.  I commend the 2007 Estimates to the House.</P>

    <Title>Prisons Bill 2006: Second Stage (Resumed). </Title>
        <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to the House.  I take the point he made yesterday about the withdrawal of the Prisons Bill 2005, a limited Bill, and welcome the introduction of this new legislation.</P>
        <P>I have visited Mountjoy Prison twice and I was struck by the poor conditions of the buildings.  The purchase of a new site at Thornton Hall for a new prison to replace Mountjoy is a welcome development.</P>
        <P>The Prisons Bill 2005 dealt with video conferencing and the closure of Mountjoy Prison but this Bill is more comprehensive.  The overtime question, which it addresses, has always been of great importance to the prison service.  The Minister has made arrangements to allow for greater flexibility and efficiency that will make the State&rsquo;s prisons easier to operate.  The additional hours to replace overtime are welcome.</P>
        <P>Many speakers referred to drugs in prisons.  The Minister has published a strategy on drugs for the prison service, which is a welcome development.</P>
        <P>The planning provisions for the construction of new prisons and extensions to existing prisons are also included in the Bill.  This is relevant following the announcement in the news about the prisons in Cork.  When it was proposed some years ago that a prison be built in the west, there was interest in the idea.  Castlerea was chosen but many other towns were keen to be the site of the prison.  It would generate employment and a prison would ensure people did not have concerns about security.  The prison in Castlerea has proven its worth.</P>
        <P>The Minister mentioned the possibility of prison escort services being contracted out.  This is an area where progress has been made and I hope to see further developments.  There were many problems, although some of the stories were exaggerated.  It was said that prisoners from the west were often sent to Dublin but then sent home again and that people were left unattended at stops during the journey.  I do not know how true those stories are but sometimes people who had committed minor offences went missing.  I hope when the question of escort services is <Col N="557"/>addressed, a robust and secure system will be in place.</P>
        <P>The Office of Inspector of Prisons is an interesting idea.  I am familiar with the inspection regime for psychiatric hospitals because there have been numerous reports published on the subject.  We must bear in mind that some prisons, like Mountjoy, are out of date.  When the Minister talks about a new prison, we are comparing it with very old institutions and inspectors do not often realise this.  The same is true of hospitals, particularly psychiatric hospitals, and very old buildings are compared with very new buildings.  I presume that will be taken into account with inspections, which I hope will be carried out in a very thorough manner.</P>
        <P>Prison discipline is mentioned in the Bill, and I know prison visiting committees have been perhaps much maligned.  I have spoken to people on such committees and they were able to keep in contact with prisoners and discuss issues which affected them.  This may have prevented some of the disciplinary sanctions that might have been imposed.  It is important that prisoners are given as much information as possible relating to prison rules or inquiries that have to be made, and if a sanction is put in place by the governor it should be thoroughly explained.</P>
        <P>I have spoken to many governors through the years and I find them very humane.  To give an example, prisoners serving a short sentence can be helped through the family occasions of a baby being christened or a first communion.  I welcome this and I hope it always would be the case.</P>
        <P>I have read through the Bill and have nothing but the height of praise for it.  There is a reference to a live television link with regard to certain applications to court.  Perhaps the Minister could explain this in more detail in his reply.  I spoke earlier about video conferencing, which I have noticed is done fairly frequently in the health services.  I noticed recently on a trip to the Aran Islands that if a doctor is not available, one can sometimes have a link from an island to the main hospital in Galway to discuss an ailment.  How would that work in this case?  It is an interesting technology which has been used by health services for some time.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Bill and hope it receives a quick passage through the Houses.  I hope there will be more definite action on prison buildings as we have fallen behind on prisons we know are in very bad condition.  We aspire to have all buildings like our more modern prison facilities.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to have an opportunity to speak on this Bill and I welcome the T&aacute;naiste to the House.  This is a period of considerable opportunity for the prison system for a number of reasons, such as the welcome additional funding that can modernise the number of prisons within this jurisdiction. Another glaring reason I have come to this conclusion is that the very substantial subversive <Col N="558"/>threat posed to this State since its inception is now dwindling, and although it has not been completely eliminated, it is virtually gone.  Over the period of time since independence, a substantial number of the prison population incarcerated for all kinds of reasons was directly related to subversive organisations.  As those organisations have now accepted the legality and legitimacy of the State, we now have more space for people who should be in prison.</P>
        <P>In that context, it still irks me to see those responsible for very serious crimes in this State, most notably the manslaughter of Detective Jerry McCabe, operate their own regime, effectively an open prison.  I am glad to say they remain in prison despite the Government&rsquo;s U-turn on the matter.  However, they decide what they eat and when they want to eat it.  The Government should not send such a signal through such people, that in effect they can decide what they want to do when they so wish. Our prison service should not be run like that and nobody should have a <i>carte blanche </i>approach to the operation of prisons, even if they are in a special category.  The individuals to whom I am referring clearly think of themselves in that way, as do their political masters in the other House.</P>
        <P>It is worth noting one of the great achievements of &Eacute;amon de Valera when he was Taoiseach.  He did exactly what Margaret Thatcher did in 1981 in refusing to accept the political status of hunger-strike prisoners in the North, which led to three of them dying in the 1940s.  The great statesman that he was, he recognised the importance of not undermining the State by allowing any group to decide its own rules and conditions in prisons.  This is a very important principle which de Valera set out, which Thatcher followed and to which all Administrations in this country have adhered since the foundation of the State.  I see it as an opportunity that those persons who had previously represented large proportions of our prison population are no longer there.</P>
        <P>One of the most depressing experiences I have had to go through was an opportunity to visit Mountjoy Prison when I was asked to participate in an Open University course which some prisoners were taking.  When I finished my contribution after an hour or two and left the training centre, 15 men were lined up to see me, all of whom came from my constituency.  It was like a virtual prison clinic, and all the men were asking questions about their family at home or if I would make representations for a girlfriend, partner etc.</P>
        <P>We need a very strong and independent voice within the prison system which is prepared to highlight awkward issues from time to time.  The Minister&rsquo;s relationship with Mr. Justice Kinlan may not be the best because of his very blunt and independent comments on the prison system from time to time, but there is a need for such independence of mind and people within the system who are prepared to say awkward things <Col N="559"/>to the Government and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in particular.</P>
        <P>I welcome that the Minister is now putting the prisons inspectorate on a statutory footing and that reports to be given to the Government from the inspectorate are to be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.  There is a responsibility on the Government to publish such reports as soon as possible.  From reading the legislation, I understand there is no time limit on when the Minister must publish a report coming from the prison inspectorate.  That is wrong, and we should consider amending it on Committee Stage of this Bill.</P>
        <P>Previously, Ministers with the Justice portfolio have been determined to publish reports at their own political choosing, and that is wrong.  If we are putting this on a statutory footing, which I welcome, we should use the opportunity to lay down a guideline or strict rule as to when that report will be published.  It is the possession of the Oireachtas rather than the Government of the day.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Human Rights Commission recently put forward the view that with regard to people coming before it on the issue of leaving prison, the matter should be referred to an independent third party or judicial system.  I do not accept that and I agree with the Minister.  It is always proper for the Government to refuse to grant a release for an individual, for whatever reason.  The power should remain squarely with the Government, as there are always reasons the good judgment of the Government would require persons to remain in prison, irrespective of what others might say.  The Minister is correct in taking a different view from that of the Human Rights Commission and I am interested in his views on the matter.</P>
        <P>Prisons are places where serious criminals need to go for a period of time and it must be ensured their prison sentence is upheld.  There have been examples of persons committed to prison for non-payment of fines.  This should be regarded as a last resort because prisons are places for serious criminals and not places for people who have not paid small fines.  The prison system should be safely guarded and kept for those who require it.</P>
        <P>I listened to the comments of the previous speaker about the prisoner escort system.  I share his concerns that the Bill allows for the part-privatisation of the prisoner escort system.  I presume significant sums of money will be saved if this option is adopted.  The Bill provides that the Minister will be required to certify companies for this service.  This is a sensitive and fundamental issue and we should tread warily and carefully before going down the road of allowing this part-privatisation to emerge.  There are many examples in other jurisdictions where this system has failed, where there is no accountability and where ultimately the system has been the subject of ridicule because those private operators have neither the experience nor the expertise to intro<Col N="560"/>duce the service.  There are some areas in which the State should be mindful of looking after services and the prisoner escort service is one of them.</P>
        <P>On the question of prison construction, the Minister has made a recent announcement about Cork and I welcome that decision.  There needs to be some role for some kind of independent view involved in the planning of a prison programme as this does not exist currently.  The Fine Gael spokesperson on justice has put forward some strong opinions on this issue, particularly with regard to Part 4 which may need to be revisited on Committee Stage to decide whether the Bill provides the kind of due regard and observance of the views of others when dealing with the location of a prison in an area.  I concede that these are very difficult decisions.  However, I refer to the unique example of Castlerea, County Roscommon where Senator Leyden will agree the community was more than happy to take a prison.  It is more difficult to reach an agreement in a larger urban setting.</P>
        <P>The Bill deals with drugs-free regimes in prisons.  Mountjoy Prison has one drugs-free wing.  In my constituency I have seen extraordinary results from methadone programmes.  They may not work for everyone but they are successful in some circumstances.  I would be interested to hear of the experience of the Irish prison system with regard to this regime.</P>
        <P>Many people in prisons lead chaotic and difficult lives.  They are in prison because of the circumstances of their lives and their environment.  We must ensure that when a person leaves prison, they have some social equipment to deal with the life ahead of them.  People often remain in the cycle of crime.  We have a responsibility to rehabilitate prisoners and to ensure they return to the community with some element of stability.  Too often people who leave prisons are back within a short time because nothing is in place for them and their chaotic lives cannot be changed.  We have a responsibility to use the regimes of drugs-free and methadone to replace what has failed in other areas and I urge the Government and the prison authorities to consider this option.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister to the House.  I commend him on bringing this Bill forward and for the amount of legislation for which he has been responsible since becoming Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
        <P>This is a comprehensive Bill and I welcome its provisions.  The question of prison reform is worthy of debate, giving Senators an opportunity to put forward their views on this matter.  I served on the visiting committee for the Curragh Prison for a period some years ago.  It was an interesting experience as it gave me an opportunity of meeting the governor, officials, staff and prisoners.  We were afforded open access as members of the visiting committee.  There is no reference to the vis<Col N="561"/>iting committees in the Bill so I presume there will be no change in their role.</P>
        <P>The visiting committee of a prison prepares an annual report on the general workings of the prison over the period of the inspections.  I ask the Minister and his officials to review those reports.  This will not be relevant in the case of the Curragh Prison because the Minister has decided to close it down.  It was not the most suitable location for a prison as it did not have all the desired facilities which would be available in a new prison.</P>
      </Speaker>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>It was referred to as the Vatican but I will say no more about that.</P>
        <P>When I visited the Magilligan Prison in County Derry, I noticed a sign which said, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t serve time; let time serve you&rdquo;.  This was a very good message to prisoners.  The loss of freedom is the most serious deprivation and it is a most chilling experience to visit a prison.  One is aware that one could walk out but the prisoners were locked up from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m.</P>
        <P>Oscar Wilde&rsquo;s famous &ldquo;The Ballad of Reading Gaol&rdquo; describes what it is like to be a prisoner, particularly a prisoner such as Oscar Wilde who was charged with a crime which has now been decriminalised.  I hope there will be a pardon for Oscar Wilde because he was one of our greatest writers of the 19th and 20th centuries.</P>
        <P Just="Left">To refer to a topic of local interest in County Roscommon, the Castlerea Prison experience has been very successful.  It came at a time of terrible economic difficulties in the constituencies of Longford-Roscommon and Galway East.  The Government of the then Taoiseach, Albert Reynolds, and Minister for Justice, M&aacute;ire Geoghegan-Quinn, made a Cabinet decision to locate the prison in Castlerea on the site of the former psychiatric hospital at Harristown, Castlerea.  The project was mothballed and threatened to be dropped by the rainbow coalition Government, when Nora Owen was Minister for Justice, and this led to widespread street protests in Dublin.  A campaign was launched and led by the Bishop of Elphin, Dr. Christopher Jones.  Two Americans were overheard to remark in Tully&rsquo;s Hotel in Castlerea, &ldquo;Gee, honey, are they protesting against a jail in Castlerea?  No, honey, they are protesting for a jail in Castlerea.  Well, in America, honey, we would be protesting against a jail.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>Castlerea wanted a prison because of its economic benefits and this is what it has proved to be.  It has a total of approximately 180 prisoners and the 150 staff all live in rural areas around Roscommon, Castlerea and into east Galway and are a great boost to the economy.  The town of Roscommon has benefited as has Castlerea and all the rural towns.  These are high calibre staff who play an important role in their communities.  The policy has worked out very well.</P><Col N="562"/>
        <P>I wish to allay the fears of those who worry about living close to a prison.  It is one of the safest places to live.  I appeal to anyone in north Dublin or Cork that they have nothing to fear but fear itself.  One person at the time told me they were appalled at the idea of living next to a prison.  There may be potential difficulties but the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na keeps a very good eye on the outside and the prison officers keep a good eye on the inside and in general it works very satisfactorily.  I hope the Minister can take the time to open the courthouse at Harristown which adjoins the prison.  Instead of prisoners being brought to court at Roscommon or elsewhere, they can be brought there.  The building was never officially opened and that is rather unusual because most Governments are delighted to stage such events to indicate investment in the area.  I hope the Minister can take the time out of his busy schedule to do this.  He will get a good welcome in Castlerea.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>There was a fairly serious industrial dispute in the prisons in April 1988.  However, that month lost to a strike is now affecting the pension rights of staff.  It would be a nice gesture if the Minister could give this matter consideration.  I am not saying that he can solve it, but the prison officers are prepared to repay whatever contributions were involved.  They will now have to work longer to make up for that lost month.  Let the past be the past.  It did not happen on the Minister&rsquo;s watch.</P>
        <P>I am fascinated by the new rules and regulations regarding the building of prisons.  I accept what the Minister has put forward to ensure proper consultation, but it is in the national interest to have prisons.  I note that the Minister is proposing not to locate the Cork jail on Spike Island.  I have visited the old jail on the island and it is a beautiful location.  I know there are difficulties with landing the boats and the cost of the bridge is prohibitively expensive.  If that site is not used for a jail, it has great potential for housing.  It is a historic island and would also have great potential for a museum.  People can continue to use the ferries out to the island from Cobh.  Being an island, the location is very secure and it is difficult to get off it.</P>
        <P>Cork Prison, which I have visited, certainly needs replacing.  I have visited nearly all our prisons and it gives me the opportunity to speak about them.  Governor McCarthy in Cork Prison was the most enlightened and progressive governor I have met.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>It did not rub off on the Senator though.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>As regards the inspectorate, the Minister might consider giving visiting committees some role in consultation with the officer appointed.  Perhaps the chairman of the committee could meet with the officer annually to discuss any issues arising.  A requirement could be made <Col N="563"/>that he or she would consult and meet the visiting committees on an informal basis.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Christmas is a special time.  While I know it causes tremendous hurt for the families of the victims of crime, humanitarian leave for Christmas Eve, Christmas Day and St. Stephen&rsquo;s Day should be given to prisoners where possible.  As a family man, I know the Minister will look at this.  This leave should be granted with rules attached specifying that prisoners cannot leave their home or socialise outside it as that can cause difficulties.  I know there is a good regime in the Prison Service that grants leave where it can.  Were something to happen while a prisoner was on leave, the Minister would be blamed.  However, there is nothing better for the rehabilitation of prisoners than giving them experience of family life.  There is nothing worse than being away from one&rsquo;s loved ones.  For children&rsquo;s sake particularly, I appeal to the Minister to go as far as he can in granting compassionate leave.  In individual cases I am prepared to contact governors.  However, I am selective in the type of cases I become involved in.  Every public representative must be careful in this regard.</P>
        <P>Where prisoners seek day release, they should be allowed to pay for it where they have the money.  Some prisoners are quite wealthy and I am happy to see this provision included in the Bill.  I also want to see the skills of prisoners utilised in a productive way.  Prisoners were engaged in hard labour or sewing bags in the past.  When I visited Mountjoy Prison, some of the prisoners were making stands for the Special Olympics.</P>
        <P>I must conclude now.  I am glad of the opportunity to contribute to this Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>The inappropriate detention of children and young people is something on which I wish to focus.  The Government is making much of its plans to have a referendum on the rights of children.  However, it is a disgrace that children and young people are still inappropriately detained in prisons and institutions such as St. Patrick&rsquo;s.  We must complete, as a matter of urgency, the building of appropriate detention centres for young people.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Government must fully implement and resource the Children Act.  Other Members have mentioned the alternatives to detention.  The Minister himself has said that detention should be a matter of last resort and I support that.  The Government should invest in long-term alternatives to detention.  Senator Walsh mentioned restorative justice and juvenile justice schemes.  If we put resources in place, it will save us money in the long term.  The Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report compares the use of the probation and welfare service with detention.  It shows that the former is much more cost effective.  It may even be more effective overall, but that needs further analysis.  The Minister will shortly implement legislation on anti-social <Col N="564"/>behaviour orders, ASBOs.  When young people are served with ASBOs, it is important that the supports are in place to allow them comply with their undertakings and conditions.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Inspector of Prisons and Places of Detention, Mr. Justice Dermot Kinlen, has been critical of St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution, as has Father Peter McVerry.  They both mentioned the need for hope around young people.  If there is hope for anyone to be rehabilitated, there must be hope for young people.  We must provide the resources and facilities for this to happen.  In his speech, the Minister spoke of his desire to do more in providing for the rehabilitation, education and training for prisoners.  He cannot simply talk the talk; he must also walk the walk.  When interviewed in May, Mr. Justice Kinlen spoke about the 18 training and educational programmes for young offenders in St. Patrick&rsquo;s that had closed.  These included workshops in photography, carpentry and domestic sciences.  The judge spoke about a course where young people were taught to drive and repair cars from which some had gained useful employment.  The trend in recent years has been to cut back education and training.</P>
        <P>I visited Mountjoy Prison with the Minister a few years ago and we were shown the work carried out in workshops.  Some prisoners had gone for the President&rsquo;s Award and had carried out different projects.  We spoke to the people involved in education and training and even at that time things were at a marginal level and were being further cut back.  The Minister must do much more.</P>
        <P>I am not one of those who believes we should not put people in prison.  I am for putting people in prison when appropriate.  However, I see no point putting people in prison, particularly as so many are in prison for a relatively short period of time, if we do nothing to change their behaviour.  We should provide them with education and training so that when they are released, they can work and make a living and a life for themselves without having to resort to crime.</P>
        <P>As I said previously, it is very important something is done for prisoners when they are released from prison so they are rehabilitated back into society.  Mr. Justice Kinlan was involved in a project in that regard but more needs to be done to ensure housing for them and that if they need drugs treatment, those facilities are there.  I have dealt with people whose children have been in prison.  They do not want their children back living with them when they are released from prison because they fear it will affect their tenancy if they are council tenants.  Often when prisoners are released, they are basically homeless and it is not long before they again become involved with the wrong crowd, drugs and crime.</P>
        <P>The Minister said he wants to ensure our prisons are humane.  That is not the case at present.  Slopping out and the conditions in which prisoners live are shocking.  We must treat prisoners with dignity so they will treat other people <Col N="565"/>with dignity too.  As a society, we must show that we have certain standards in terms of human rights and the way we treat people.  The Minister has been talking about ending the practice of slopping out for a few years.  Why is it taking so long to do something about this issue?</P>
        <P>With regard to the planning issue, a couple of years ago I wrote to the director of prisons on behalf of some residents living in the vicinity of Cloverhill and Wheatfield Prisons to see if the Prison Service would liaise with the local community on certain issues in regard to the prisons.  However, I did not receive a reply to my letter.  The residents had the same problem and the reason I wrote to the director of prisons in the first place was to try to set up that dialogue between the community, the prison service and those prisons.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In the context of the new planning regime introduced in this legislation, if prisons are to be built, it is important there is communication between the prisons and local communities so that if problems arise or there are any concerns, the local community can speak to the appropriate person in the Prison Service about them.  That type of liaison could lead to positive outcomes in regard to projects which could be undertaken by the community and the Prison Service in terms of what happens prisoners when they leave the system.  It might also lead to a more positive attitude among the local community to what is happening in the prison and perhaps to its involvement on prison visiting committees.</P>
        <P>I, too, have concerns about privatisation.  The Minister is right in that there is a need to take on the vested interests in the public service and that includes the Prison Service.  However, there is much to be said for investing in public facilities and infrastructure.  There are so many areas where the Government is investing in private schemes to deal with various public services.  That money is going into a black hole because one has no assets or anything built up for the long-term despite the money pumped into privatisation schemes.  I urge caution in that regard.</P>
        <P>Much crime relates to drugs and people with drugs problems so it is important we provide drugs treatment to prisoners.  There was a very harrowing story during the summer where a young woman basically refused to go back to prison.  The judge agreed with her because she was not getting the necessary treatment there.  It is all about trying to change people&rsquo;s behaviour and ensuring we get value for money in terms of what we invest in prisons.  We must provide the education, training and drugs treatment.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and this legislation.  His presence in the House during the passage of legislation is much appreciated.  For someone who is occasionally accused of arrogance, he does a lot of listening here.  In that respect, he resembles one of his predecessors as <Col N="566"/>Minister for Justice, the late Charles J. Haughey, who also took a very personal interest in the passage of legislation through the House.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>Given the events of recent days where a Latvian woman was assassinated, a woman beaten within an inch of her life in the Wicklow Mountains, drug abuse and people being shot dead in apparent drugs-related feuds, I have not heard the suggestion from any Member that prisons are not necessary.  Indeed, they are very necessary for certain people who are a danger to the community.  The notion that crime can be directed from prison would be a very disturbing development.</P>
        <P>No one disputes the need to have modern, effective and humane prisons.  A prison like Kilmainham when it opened in 1795 was modern and progressive for the time but obviously standards have moved on a great deal.  I am liberal in some respects but not in others.  One of the advantages of a greenfield prison is that, hopefully, it will break the link with a type of rampant in-house prison drugs culture.  Presumably that is one of the objectives the Minister is trying to achieve.</P>
        <P>An issue at which we will need to look at some time in the future and progress &mdash; perhaps this is on the liberal side &mdash; is the question of conjugal visits which exist in some parts of the world and whether that would have a good effect on prisoner behaviour.  The Minister is correct to keep the outsourcing facility.  That dispute is over and has been resolved.  However, having got that far down the road, there is no harm putting a safety net in place.</P>
        <P>The question of video links for what one might call formal and brief court procedures has a capability of saving public money.  There are adequate protections in terms of prisoners being able to appeal.  Quite an elaborate system is set out in the Bill in regard to sanctions for misbehaviour.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The other reason I rose to speak is to refer to a small section of the prison population which one would have hoped might not be there given the developments in the peace process, that is the paramilitary prisoners.  Apart from a few dissident paramilitaries in Castlereagh Prison, they are mainly in Portlaoise Prison.  One must distinguish between different organisations and different types of dissidents.  One cannot have a problem with dissidents in the sense of disagreements in political debate in a democratic society.  The INLA, whatever about any extra-curricular activities, at least agreed a ceasefire in the broad political sense in 1998, and in the political sense of that term has, broadly speaking, observed it.  Unfortunately that is not the case for the Real IRA, which declared a ceasefire after the catastrophe of the Omagh bombing but, foolishly from many points of view, broke it approximately a year later.  There is also the Continuity IRA, <Col N="567"/>which likes to present itself as the sea-green incorruptibles of republicanism.  It is a curious sort of republicanism which does not recognise the existence of this republic, which is one of the principal achievements of republicanism in the 20th century.</P>
        <P>This is mainly a security issue and after 1998 fortunately most, but not all, activities have been foiled.  The political purpose of the bombing in the centre of the mainly nationalist city of Newry was difficult to fathom.  In one of last week&rsquo;s Sunday papers somebody close to them suggested that if they shot a police officer the security authorities in both jurisdictions would come down on them like a ton of bricks.  It is unsatisfactory that this continues.  There is, as there was in the main peace process, a political, ideological dimension to it.  Although most of the people involved regard themselves as left-wing progressive, if one believes the ideology the &ldquo;government of the republic&rdquo; is an anonymous military dictatorship which, unlike any democratic government feels it has the right to apply corporal and capital punishment in complete ignorance of human rights.  Last weekend, despite the overwhelming will of the Irish people North and South, a conference asserted some historic right as if the people alive today had no right to decide how the legitimate ideal of a united Ireland might be pursued and achieved.</P>
        <P>The relevance of this to prison legislation is that the Prison Service is one of the few points of contact between the Government and such organisations.  As has been shown in more mainstream organisations, prisoners can influence those outside.  This and the corresponding problem of loyalist paramilitarism constitute an incomplete part of the peace process, regardless of what happens with the St. Andrew&rsquo;s Agreement.  While inevitably it must be conducted by security means, the political and ideological dimension is not to be neglected.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister and I am pleased that another significant piece of legislation has been introduced first in the Seanad.  This is good because the Seanad should be used to examine, generally in a non-partisan way, Government legislative proposals.  From reading the explanatory memorandum and other material this Bill has two principal purposes.  The first is to allow the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to contract out prisoner escort services.  There has been a problem with this over the years.  It has used many Garda resources that could have been more profitably engaged in other areas.  It also brings up the way the banks use the services of the State to escort their money, which has been examined in the past couple of years and which is a less worthy use of Garda and Army resources.  The second purpose of the Bill is to use pre-trial hearings in which people can be interviewed on video.</P><Col N="568"/>
        <P>Both purposes of the Bill have certain aspects to recommend them.  My only hesitation is that I do not like franchising out tasks too much.  We have a regrettable tendency to follow America in many respects, both good and bad, often in an unthinking fashion.  America has franchised out the entire prison service, which has led to a considerable degree of brutality and confusion, which I deplore.  The principal motive for people engaging in this is not the service of the community or the welfare of the State but profit.  While there may be a practical argument for moving in this direction one must be careful that the profit motive does not dominate.</P>
        <P>I welcome the fact that section 3 requires the Minister or his representatives to provide certification that people employed in this are fit and proper persons so to do, that this can be reviewed and that such validation lasts for five years and can be revoked by the Minister.  The principal difficulty with the pre-trial hearings that has been drawn to my attention is the matter of definition.  I wonder if the Minister will re-examine this and provide a definition of a pre-trial hearing or explain to the House whether or how he feels it is satisfactorily defined in the legislation.  If we are to have it, we must be clear on what constitutes a pre-trial hearing and what does not.</P>
    <HtmlBk SectId="6" />
        <P>Also envisaged in this Bill are strict planning rules for new jails.  I want to address the subject of Thornton Hall.  I will not re-open the question of the purchase, which has been extensively ventilated in both Houses of the Oireachtas and the media, because it appears to be a done deal.  However, the fact that the Central Mental Hospital is to be relocated to the grounds to Thornton Hall is a serious cause of concern for many people. I am sure the Minister has come under pressure from the relatives.  He is shaking his head.  That is very interesting.  I have, and I wish to pass on some of the pressure to him.  Relatives of inmates, representatives of groups such as Schizophrenia Ireland, doctors and constituents have expressed considerable concern about this.  I welcome the fact that Deputy Tim O&rsquo;Malley, party and Government colleague of the Minister, recognised early in his tenure the unsatisfactory nature of the Central Mental Hospital in Dundrum.  He pledged to close it and I salute him for taking this honourable position.  It is a good thing to close the Central Mental Hospital.</P>
        <P>I remember it when it was called the Central Criminal Lunatic Asylum.  An advertisement that made a joke of this had to be withdrawn from Irish television in the not too distant past as a result of complaints by relatives.  If the Advertising Standards Authority is prepared to remove an advertisement on the basis that it creates an unfair stigma to refer to the original name, the Central Criminal Lunatic Hospital, we have to be careful about associating a prison and a mental hospital.  Some of those incarcerated are there because of actions &mdash; perhaps violent actions &mdash; <Col N="569"/>taken in pursuit of deluded notions.  Schizophrenia, for example, can lead to delusions where sufferers believe they are being attacked and are the prey of sinister forces.  To those outside the mental world, their behaviour seems extraordinarily dangerous and threatening, as indeed it is.</P>
        <P>Some 35% of inmates of the Central Mental Hospital have never been charged with any crime.  The remaining 65% of inmates may have committed acts under the influence of mental illness as a result of delusion.  Dr. Paul O&rsquo;Connell, a consultant at the Central Mental Hospital, has stated that the patients he works with are those who, by nature of having a severe mental illness, fall foul of the law, perhaps by committing a violent offence in response to a delusion, and that all Western societies recognise that when an offence of this kind occurs as a product of mental illness, hospital treatment rather than imprisonment is the civilised response.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I return to the determination of the Minister of State to close the Central Mental Hospital, which I have applauded.  He is also on record as saying that locating the revamped Central Mental Hospital within the grounds of Thornton Hall is not an ideal situation.  He said, &ldquo;I accept that in an ideal world it would be better not to have it near a prison but we do not live in an ideal world.&rdquo;  We do, however, live in a State with plenty of resources and it is not necessary to build the hospital there.  It is convenient and saves a certain amount of money.</P>
        <P>There is an extensive site in Dundrum.  What are the plans for this site?  Will it be sold to generate further capital for the Exchequer?  Why is it not considered appropriate to redevelop the hospital on this site, where it has been and where the local community accepts it?  The grounds are an attractive retreat for those who suffer from mental illness.  The proposed move will create considerable disturbance to the residents and their relatives.  Dundrum is reasonably accessible from all parts of Dublin by bus, train and Luas.  Thornton Hall is not, despite the proposed system of shuttle buses.  It is a pity that the decision appears to have been taken.  A spokesperson for the relatives and carers group describes the decision to combine a mental hospital and a prison as &ldquo;warehousing&rdquo; patients.  I hope this matter can be reconsidered.</P>

        <P>Senator Mansergh suggested no one thinks prisons should not exist.  I am a Utopian and, in an ideal world, they should not exist.  In my opinion, they should be the last resort.  The Minister has encouraged community service orders and so on.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I will now don my right-wing hat, which will delight the Minister.  For the heinous crimes involving guns that occur throughout the city, such as the monstrous slaying of the young Latvian woman, prison is not just appropriate but essential in order to protect the community.  There should not be a soft regime for these people.  For them I would be quite happy to see the reintroduction of hard labour.  Anyone who can approach a young woman, the mother of two defenceless children, and callously blow her off the face of the earth should not be allowed to relax in peace, comfort and security.  That person should be daily reminded, by the conditions in which they are kept, of the awfulness of the crime and the seriousness with which society regards it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>I commend the Minister for the tenacity of his efforts to reform and modernise the prison system.  Although he may not refer to it, I can imagine the vested interests he has to tackle, in the same way as those who are trying to reform the health system.  The prison regime is an exceptional problem but he has researched it well and has a vision for it.</P>
        <P>One is caught between a rock and a hard place in this debate.  One cannot expect victims and their families to feel sympathy for what happens when a prisoner is sent to jail.  This is particularly true in the context of the brutal nature of crime today.  In our wildest nightmares we could not have envisaged some of the crime being committed on the streets.  Victims and their families may feel criminals should be locked up and forgotten.  We have seen this thinking in the prison regimes of other countries.  The film &ldquo;Midnight Express&rdquo; depicted the prison regime in Turkey.  We have seen what prison can be like at the other extreme.</P>
        <P>One must also think of families whose sons or daughters found themselves in the wrong place at the wrong time.  One speaks to these decent families and tries to empathise with them.  I have been involved in a number of prisoner cases in Britain and Ireland.  I have met these families and my heart goes out to them.</P>
        <P>On the other hand, I am friends with a family whose father, in his 40s, was shot dead over the Christmas period.  I can still remember the young son, 14 years old, running down to the graveyard and throwing himself across his father&rsquo;s grave.  Within four years the killer was on the streets, making a second hell for that family.  I wish to tease our certain issues because they are important, the first perhaps from a philosophical perspective.  If one brutalises prisoners within a regime, one generally brutalises oneself and society because when these prisoners emerge from prison having had this experience, there will <Col N="571"/>be no question of their being improved citizens who have learned from their mistakes.  One suffers at the other end of the line.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Nobody is suggesting we have the type of regime that would make it attractive for people to be committed to prison but there is a certain element of attraction.  I have watched television footage of young people coming out of the courts after being sentenced and giving the two-finger sign to the cameras and the public.  There is no question of any remorse.  I am slightly worried that they are being influenced by the image of the hard man and the way their mates or peers will perceive them once they have been sent to prison.  A message must be sent, either through the media or community groups, that there is no question of a prison term doing anything for a person&rsquo;s standing in the community.  It must be made quite clear that a person has isolated himself or herself from normal decent practice and has not afforded to other people the compassion or understanding which he or she at times claims and demands.  This message must go out loud and clear.</P>
        <P>In many ways, the prison regime is a reflection of society.  If drugs are used, dealt and sold and people come from such an environment, they will bring this culture with them into the prison.  One of the most disconcerting messages is the suggestion that drugs are freely available in prisons.  There seems to be a certain element of truth in this.  Every effort, including mandatory testing with which I fully agree, must be made to ensure that illegal drugs are not accessible in prisons.  Irrespective of how they are carried out, these efforts must be made for two reasons.  First, the availability of such drugs is to all intents and purposes making the prison regime unmanageable.  Second, one is placing a temptation before young people who might have an opportunity of being made, in some way, accessible to society again.  We should not bring them into a worse environment than that in which they lived outside prison.</P>
        <P>I will extend this point.  On one hand, one finds what people might term the habitual criminal, while on the other hand one finds the other type of prisoner who is just unfortunate enough to find himself or herself in that position.  We must find some way of segregating in a practical fashion those two types of prisoner.  I am aware that efforts to segregate these two groups are always being undertaken and that the open prison is part of this concept.  One case with which I am dealing concerns a prisoner in Britain who will, hopefully, be repatriated to Ireland in the very near future.  The one appeal the family made was that he should not be put into a regime which would give him no light at the end of the tunnel and which would make him a much worse prospect for any kind of rehabilitation for the future.  The family has made heartfelt pleas to me.  This is probably an individual case but we must keep it in mind <Col N="572"/>as a general principle.  We simply cannot have a situation where there is no hope for reform or rehabilitation.</P>
        <P>I have always been very impressed and inspired by John Lonergan, the governor of Mountjoy Prison, and a fellow Tipperary man.  I have heard him speak and have always been surprised by his courage in engaging in debate on radio and television programmes.  The one thing that comes across is the great balance which exists for him.  On one hand, there is the compassionate and human side, but on the other hand there is the question of having to bring about control within society.  I am impressed by the manner in which he can harmonise those two concepts.  The Minister is also faced by these concepts.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The unauthorised disclosure of information is a cancer in the system.  There is nothing worse than reading a report in a tabloid newspaper about what someone in prison did or did not have for breakfast.  It is wrong for two reasons to disclose this type of information.  First, the information is not being transmitted without a price.  The fact that a price is put on it stains the entire character of the prison system and all those good people within it.  Second, because this information is reported in a sensationalist fashion, it does not bring home to the public the horror of prison life.  If a person is deprived of his or her freedom, this is the ultimate punishment.  It sends out the wrong message if one ignores the fact of the deprivation of freedom and depicts some type of luxurious situation within the prison system.</P>
        <P>We must believe that good will always triumph over evil.  If we do not believe this, we and society face difficulties.  With this in mind, giving people the opportunity, even within the prison regime, to develop their full potential is absolutely vital, even if they do not succeed.  They must feel that this is an extension of what would have been available to them outside prison.  I do not see this as a luxury.  I see it as a practical contribution in the context of humanity and, above all, in the context of rehabilitation. Hopefully, in the final analysis, if one listens to a prisoner who has emerged from prison speak about the experience after being rehabilitated, one will hear one of the most powerful messages that can be given.</P>
        <P>I always find it very distressing when I hear of a death in prison.  I believe that sometimes such deaths are due to the environment, particularly overcrowding of cells.  Hearing about more than one death in a prison, given the brutal nature of such deaths and the silence which follows, makes it clear that some way must be found to deal with them.  I am not saying it is central to the overall issue but it sends out the wrong message that a jungle exists within the prison, there is no control and people can do exactly what they please.  Only a small number of deaths take place in prison, but when two or three deaths follow each other, it makes one feel particularly uneasy.</P>
        <P>I also compliment the Minister on the manner in which he is moving forward the plans for new <Col N="573"/>prisons.  As in the case of schools and factories, there will always be someone who will object to any development that interferes in some way with his or her landscape.  I am not taking from any legitimate arguments such people may have, but if we cannot progress with the building programme, how will we handle some of the problems in the archaic prisons we already have?  How will we tackle the many issues we face?  The Minister is deserving of our full support.</P>
        <P>I am glad the two aims are reform and modernisation.  Modernisation without reform or reform without modernisation would not be a particularly good policy.  The Minister has encapsulated that particularly well in what he has put forward.  There are no quick fixes and the Minister knows this.  He also knows he did not create the society we have, which is part of a new development within the world.  The Minister is trying to tackle that.  He has, to some extent, tried to tackle it in the past and correct it for the future.  I have no doubt that he has the will, tenacity and commitment to do this.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senators for their contributions to this debate.  Many thoughtful contributions have been made and it has been a pleasure, rather than a chore, to be here and listen to the views expressed.  I will deal with a number of points in this brief reply to Second Stage.  </P>
        <P>I want to thank in particular Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; for his kind words.  When he was not speaking kindly of me he was speaking broadly on subjects related to prisons, and I did not disagree with one word he said.  I was impressed by the terms and humanity in which he spoke.</P>
        <P>In regard to Senator Cummins&rsquo;s question on the construction and extension of prisons, I want to make a few points clear because some Members of the other House, although not Senator Cummins, are a little confused about this.  Under Part IX of planning Acts I am currently entitled to build a prison anywhere in Ireland without reference to the planning system in any shape or form.  I am entitled to buy a piece of land anywhere in Ireland and build a prison, a police station or anything else on it.  That is the existing position.  In this respect, there is nothing about me being arrogant or giving myself new powers in Part 4 of this Bill.  The position is quite the reverse.  I am introducing a new element of accountability and transparency into the decision-making process for new prison projects.</P>
        <P>What is proposed in this legislation is that this and the other House, for the first time, will have two roles in regard to any new prison project.  This will include Thornton Hall and the Munster prison in case any Member is under any illusion about that.  The two roles are as follows.  If the Minister of the day proposes to develop a new prison or a significant extension of an old prison, he or she will have to give public notice of his or <Col N="574"/>her intention to do so, carry out an environmental impact assessment and move resolutions in each House of the Oireachtas separately to approve his or her proposal.  Having received the approval of the Houses and having laid all the documents, including the environmental impact assessment and the report of the rapporteur on the public reaction to the proposals, before the Houses, presumably the Minister will have a debate in each House on the proposal.  If each House approves the proposal, the Minister then has to push through the Oireachtas a confirmatory Act.</P>
        <P>That is a rare model only to be found in the old restrictive practices legislation, which predated the Competition Act.  It provided that the examiner of restrictive practices would examine a profession or a trade and come forward with a report.  The Minister responsible would then make an order to prohibit anti-competitive behaviour or whatever it might be and that would have the force of law only if a confirmatory Act of the Minister&rsquo;s order were made.  That was the way the groceries order, to which we often refer, came into existence.</P>
        <P>What we are doing in this legislation is vesting in the two Houses of the Oireachtas, first, an examining function for a proposal from the Minister based on all the documents being laid before both Houses, second, the right to veto the proposal and, third, a function in confirming and making it the law of the land that the proposal in question should proceed.  I do not believe anybody could describe that as an arrogant political change, bearing in mind the current legal position is that I could, in theory, buy a few hundred acres, build a prison and say I do not propose to talk to anybody about it or discuss it and that it is nobody&rsquo;s business.  What is proposed has been misinterpreted not in this House but elsewhere as some kind of effort to increase the power of the Minister.  It is not, rather it is to give back to the Oireachtas and to each House of it the power to have a say in what any Minister in the future does.</P>
        <P>I also wish to make the point in regard to Part 4 that it does not do what some people suggested it might do, which is to give the Minister the right of compulsory purchase.  I was criticised by some people for not having a power of compulsory purchase to buy land at agricultural prices, build a prison wherever I wanted using Part IX powers and then confer on the State a huge benefit of being able to buy land at agricultural prices and develop it for a non-agricultural purpose.  I was criticised for that, but I believe the right way to proceed in this respect is either to use land that is in the possession of the State or to buy land on the open market.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">When we did that we had two choices, we could buy it secretly and sent in <Col N="575"/>people wearing mackintoshes to stand at the back of auctions to pick up a farm without ever telling anybody what we had in mind, or we could do what we did, which was to place advertisements in the newspapers and say we asked people to come forward with lands for a major prison site in the environs of Dublin.  We chose the latter course.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As was pointed out by Secretary General and Accounting Officer of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform before the Committee of Public Accounts, as a result of taking that course we paid more than we would have had we sneaked into an auction room and bought on the quiet.  That process was likely to produce an uplift in price but it was an honest and transparent one.  What was not said in the media was that when the Comptroller and Auditor General queried this, the majority of the participants at that meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts said the Accounting Officer of my Department was right to recommend the open transparent way of doing it and reject the notion that we should have acted in a clandestine or secret way.  It was interesting to note that when the parliamentarians received the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report, they emphatically endorsed the open-handed approach of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I was very grateful to them for that support because it was suggested in some sense that this was wasteful, but it was not.</P>
        <P>I wish to make a further point while we are dealing with the issue of Thornton Hall because Part 4 of this legislation will apply to it.  There is no tract of 150 acres 14 kms from O&rsquo;Connell Street which was available for any lesser price.  People can cod themselves and talk about agricultural prices and the price of farms in counties Meath or Louth or elsewhere, but nobody would sell such a large tract of land to the State that distance from O&rsquo;Connell Street for less than &euro;200,000 an acre.  Nobody has ever pointed to a single transaction either around that time or since that time when a similar tract of land that close to the city centre was sold for a lesser price.  I want to put that on the record.</P>
        <P>I want above all to say that the view of the Accounting Officer and Secretary General of my Department, Mr. Se&aacute;n Aylward, that this process should be done openly and fairly through public advertisement was strongly supported by the members of the Committee of Public Accounts of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  I am glad that happened because it was vindication for high and decent standards in public accounting and public responsibility.</P>
        <P>In regard to the broader philosophical questions that have arisen in this debate about whether prison is or is not of any use.  I listened <Col N="576"/>to Senators Norris, Ryan, &Oacute; Murch&uacute; and others who have differing points of view on this issue.  My view is that prison is a necessary adjunct of a democratic liberal society.  In an ideal world none of us would want to see anybody go to prison.  I have consistently enunciated the view that going to prison is usually a personal disaster for the person involved and it is usually, even in the minds of the most strict of judges, the course of last resort.  However, there are crimes, as has been pointed out here, which must be punished.  It is not fashionable to say any more, even though it is true, that if crime went unpunished, it would be the end of civilisation as we know it.  The public need to see the wrongdoer punished, although not in some kind of vindictive or retributive way alone.  An element of punishment must be included and, on this side of the Atlantic at any rate, an element of rehabilitation.  We must have light at the end of the tunnel and a sense of redemption in almost every case possible.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>We do not go for the notion of &ldquo;three strikes and you are out&rdquo;.  I recently heard on BBC Radio 4 that a 16 year old in Colorado could be sentenced to life without parole for murder.  That is not the European perspective on criminality and punishment.  I do not want to criticise the United States.  However, the US political culture has a stronger emphasis on retribution than the European culture.  In this regard, Ireland is closer to Berlin than Boston.</P>
        <P>Consider the fact we have approximately 3,500 prisoners, which means less than one person in 1,000 is serving a custodial sentence.  Compare that to states in the US where three or four people, mainly black and poor, in 100 are in prison.  We have different emphases and outcomes.  Whatever view we have on what to do about crime, let us remember we must always approach it exactly on the basis Senator &Oacute;<?oasys _jy ?>Murch&uacute; pointed out, which is how one treats criminals is an indication of the type of society in which one lives.</P>
        <P>I invite every Member of both Houses who has not seen Mountjoy Prison to make arrangements to do so.  One does not need to be soft-hearted to walk around the prison and come to the clear conclusion that one could not be proud of it and it must be finished.  I do not claim moral superiority for championing the end of Mountjoy Prison.  Anybody who walked around it, particularly someone with ministerial responsibility, and considered people deserved those conditions would have great difficulty looking at himself or herself in a mirror.  My view is that Mountjoy Prison must be closed.</P>
        <P>The same applies to St. Patrick&rsquo;s Institution.  I agree with what Senator Tuffy stated.  Even with the additional educational facilities and workshops opened recently, it is not the right place for young people.  It is not a decent environment in which to deal with criminality.</P><Col N="577"/>
        <P>Senator Norris spoke about the Central Mental Hospital and that the Minister of State, Deputy Tim O&rsquo;Malley, stated in an ideal world one would locate a forensic psychiatric institution distant from a prison.  The great majority of customers of the Central Mental Hospital are involved with the criminal justice system in one way or another.  The situation at present is not merely far from satisfactory, it is bordering on the indefensible.  I had to deal with the United Nations and the Council of Europe on the approach of the Irish State to mental illness in prisons.  It is a difficult pitch to defend in any way what happens here at present.</P>
        <P>The Central Mental Hospital is not physically located or orientated towards its main customer base.  We must remember a considerable number of people sent to prison for serious crimes either suffer from a psychiatric illness of one type or another short of criminal insanity or manifest such psychiatric conditions frequently.  Anybody who went to Mountjoy Prison and saw as I did on my first trip a man in his thirties or forties crouched in a darkened padded cell resembling an oversized darkened phone box, lying on the floor in his underpants with a pot beside him, a little mattress and a slightly pink lamp above him could not rightly think the regime was anything other than grossly inhumane.  As a result of that we accelerated the provision of observation cells and decent facilities for people undergoing psychiatric crises, even in prisons we intend to demolish.</P>
        <P>A person in prison who is psychiatrically ill should be removed to a psychiatric hospital as quickly as possible and dealt with there.  We cannot have the present situation whereby because of physical and intellectual distance between the Prison Service and the psychiatric facility designed to serve it people remain in inhumane circumstances and are not given the type of psychiatric care to which they are entitled.</P>
        <P>These issues are real and not imaginary.  I still await the report of Michael Mellett, a former deputy secretary of my Department, into the death of Gary Douch.  The circumstances in which a prisoner was released into Mountjoy Prison having been committed to the Central Mental Hospital some days prior still await satisfactory explanation.</P>
        <P>I do not want to speak for too long and trespass on the patience of the House.  However, I want the House to know that Thornton Hall and the new Munster prison will allow a different approach to the question of drugs in our prisons.  I do not agree with the proposition that because drugs are outside the walls of prisons we must accept they will be inside the walls of prisons, anymore than one could state because drugs are outside the walls of schools or discos they are inside the walls of schools or discos.</P>
        <P>As a society we have an obligation to ensure our prisons are rehabilitative and not places where people amass further debts to drug lords <Col N="578"/>and have their lives run by drugs, their personal safety ruled by drugs and die of self-administered overdoses.  That is not acceptable in any circumstance.  The fact drugs are outside prisons does not justify tolerating drugs inside prison.</P>

	<P>How does the Minister propose to stop them?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Our strategy is to introduce sniffer dogs to the system and new visiting arrangements.  I do not agree with the proposition it is more humane to have physical contact in a drug-ridden prison than to have a drug-free prison with substantial restrictions on physical contact with prisoners.  If the price of physical contact is rampant drug infestation in a prison it is no mercy on any prisoner including drug-free prisoners who are surrounded by prisoners who are a danger to them.</P>
        <P>This Bill provides for mandatory testing.  It will be uncomfortable for prison governors to be in a position to admit that a certain proportion of prisoners show up positive for barbiturates, heroin or cannabis.  We must deal with these issues.  The strategy being rolled out is the correct way to progress.  I have always welcomed the tough words used by Mr. Justice Dermot Kinlen.  Contrary to what has been suggested here, I get on very well with him personally and in every other away.  We have a warm and long-lasting friendship which, despite the fact that we take lumps out of each other in public in respect of our various interests, has endured and continues to do so.  I thank him for his forthrightness.  I do not agree with everything he says and when I do not agree, I say so.  Similarly, he does not agree with everything I say, in which case he says so also.  That does not mean, however, that we are at loggerheads or personally ill-disposed to each other.  I assure the House that is far from being the case.</P>
        <P>If it can be done economically, it is more desirable for prison escort services to be provided by public servants.  A privatised system is one of last resort.  In effect, I have done a deal with the prison officers whereby if they provide the prison escort service in a form which is economically sustainable, Part 2 of this Bill will never come into operation.  As far as I am concerned, that is a deal which I do not intend to renege on.</P>
        <P>The dispute about overtime was one in which a minority of prison officers predominated over the interests of the great majority.  The result was that huge sums of money were being cannibalised in overtime, which should have been spent on improving the prison service, including rehabilitative and psychotherapy programmes.  I am confident, however, that the new system is now working.  The big winners are the prison officers because instead of getting a decent wage by having to spend 100 hours a week in a prison, which is not the most uplifting way to spend one&rsquo;s working life, they now know that if they do their part <Col N="579"/>of the bargain, the emphasis is on minimising the amount of time they must spend at work rather than maximising it.  That is a big step forwards, so they have been the winners in that regard.</P>

      <Speaker pid=""><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>Before we commence, I remind the House that Senators may speak only once on Report Stage, except the proposer of an amendment who may reply to the discussion on the amendment.  In addition, each amendment must be seconded on Report Stage.  In respect of the expected recommittal motions, I understand that as the Government amendments Nos. 15, 19, 20, 44, 47 and 48 do not arise from committee proceedings, Senator Jim Walsh will move a recommittal motion for each of them as they arise.  I understand that Senator Tuffy will also be seeking recommittal in respect of her amendments Nos. 1, 5 to 11, inclusive, and 13 and 14, which do not arise from committee proceedings.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  I call on Senator Tuffy to move amendment No. 1.</P>

	<P>This Bill will eventually become an Act.  If it was referred to simply as a Land Act it would give a misleading impression as to what kind of Act it was.  The Land Acts generally concerned land purchase and registry, whereas this Bill is slightly different.  Its equivalent in the United Kingdom in 1925, which shows the House how far behind we are, <Col N="580"/>was called the Law of Real Property Act.  Most people do not know the difference between real and personal property anymore.  These terms mean nothing.  Therefore, I chose the Title to say that it is a law reform Bill to deal with land and conveyancing law.  I would prefer to keep that Title.</P>

        <P LI="1" el="5">In page 17, to delete line 13 and substitute the following:</P>
        <P LI="2" el="5">&ldquo;(<i>e</i>) if the person concerned has agreed to service of notices by means of an electronic communication (within the meaning assigned by section 2 of the Electronic Commerce Act 2000) to that person (being an addressee within the meaning assigned by that section) and provided that there is a facility to confirm receipt of electronic mail and that such receipt has been confirmed, then by that means; or</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendment No. 3 makes more detailed provision for the service of notices by electronic communication and by means of facsimile.

	<P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 17, line 37, after &ldquo;giving&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;full&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The Minister&rsquo;s amendment may deal with some of the issues I am raising.  The purpose of amendment No. 5 is to give the Minister greater discretion to compensate for the removal of the power to modify Acts.  Regarding amendment No. 6, we believe the subsection, as it stands, would be of dubious constitutionality as it allows the Minister to amend the law by regulations and we refer, in that regard, to the recent Supreme Court decision on Mulcreevy<i> v.</i> the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Regarding amendments Nos. 5 and 6, subsection (1) is a standard type of provision for the making of regulations on an ongoing basis.  Subsection (2), on the other hand, is an exceptional and time-limited provision designed to deal with any unforeseen difficulties in implementing the Act or other statutes it amends.  Any modifications made to such regulations must be in conformity with the purposes, principles and spirit of the Act.  In this sense it is not simply a general licence to the Minister to modify the Act by legislation.  Many existing statutes contain a similar limited safeguard provision on these lines and I can see no constitutional reason to remove subsection (2).</P>
        <P Just="Left">If this subsection were used in a manner that violated the principle or purpose of the Act it would be subject to judicial review and the Judiciary would be keen to prevent the Minister from perverting the meaning of the Act.  It is customary in broad-ranging reforms of this kind to make provisions like this, rather than allow the whole edifice fall flat owing to an unforeseen difficulty.  This is frequently done in other major reforming statutes.</P>
        <P>While considering Senator Tuffy&rsquo;s amendment it became clear that some matters would be more appropriate for rules of court.  Arising from this I tabled amendments Nos. 44 and 46 which provide <Col N="582"/>the detailed rules for the registration of both judgments and <i>lis pendens</i> will be set out in future rules of court rather than in regulations under section 5.</P>

        <P LI="1">&ldquo;and without prejudice to section 26(2)(<i>f</i>) of the Act of 2005,&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">We tabled this amendment to make it clear that the rule in section 8(2) is unnecessary as the same point is stated in the Interpretation Act 2005, section 26(2)(<i>f</i>).</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">This is largely a matter of drafting.  I do not see a good reason to include a specific reference to section 26 of the Interpretation Act 2005 in section 8(2).  The Interpretation Act, by definition, applies to all Acts of the Oireachtas and all of its provisions, including section 26, will apply to this legislation when enacted.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
      <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 18, after line 40, to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="1">&ldquo;(3) In so far as they survive, titles of honour or dignity arising from feudal baronies and manorial lordships are abolished.</P>
        <P LI="1">(4) If after the commencement of this section a person purports to sell or offer for sale a title of honour or dignity abolished by <i>subsection (3)</i>, he or she shall be guilty of an offence.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I raised this issue when the Bill was discussed by the joint committee with Professor Wylie.  The Government official said the Department found it difficult to address this in the legislation.  The issue of the sale of bogus titles has been raised with the Labour Party, other parties and the Minister and his party by the Genealogical Society of Ireland.  According to the society, such titles should be registered as <i>incorporeal hereditament</i> and continue to exist in law.  Consequently they need to be abolished specifically and I wondered if the Minister had further thoughts on the issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a proposal to prevent people from purporting to convey feudal baronies and manorial lordships, a class of <i>incorporeal hereditament </i>under the present law.  The group that devised the Bill examined this issue and came to the conclusion that, whatever of their origin in the feudal era, titles of honour had <Col N="583"/>evolved over the centuries into personal rights now rather than interests in the land and should not, therefore, be dealt with in the Bill.  I tend to agree with their view that, since titles do not amount to an interest in land, this Bill is not the appropriate legislation in which to address the matter.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>Professor Wylie said something similar to the Minister so I accept his response.  The matter may be raised by my party in the D&aacute;il, given another opportunity to consider it.  I hope the Genealogical Society of Ireland will be happy with the Minister&rsquo;s explanation.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 9:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 19, line 5, to delete &ldquo;in&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;under&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This is a drafting amendment as, we believe, section 9(3)(<i>b</i>), as worded, suggests it only affects section 10, rather than the concept of an estate generally.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Section 10 contains provisions relating to the concept of an estate in land and section 9(3) makes a reference to that concept as set out in section 10.  I cannot see any reason to substitute the word &ldquo;under&rdquo; for &ldquo;in&rdquo; as proposed in the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
      <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 10:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 19, between lines 10 and 11, to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="1">&ldquo;(4) Subject to this Act a fee simple shall be freely alienable by the owner thereof.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">While section 9(3)(<i>c</i>) states that section 9(2) does not affect the rule against inalienability, the rule itself is contained in an Act that is repealed by section 8(3) so the rule is not stated in the Bill.  This has the potential to cause confusion so we believe it is necessary to state the rule in the Bill so that it is clear what rule it refers to.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not believe this is necessary but I will consider the point between now and the debate in the other House.  If I change my mind I will deal with the matter in that House, if that satisfies the Senator.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
      <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 11:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 19, between lines 10 and 11, to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="1">&ldquo;(4) A tenant of a local authority who whether before or after the commencement of this section purchases a fee simple from the <Col N="584"/>authority may alienate the fee simple without the consent of the authority.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This amendment might be more appropriate to a housing Bill but I have become aware, as a public representative and a solicitor, that a council tenant when purchasing a council house needs the consent of the local authority for the first sale or transfer.  This also applies when tenants who have purchased a house wish to put it in the names of both spouses.  I have often encountered former local authority tenants in these circumstances.</P>
        <P>It was common practice in the 1960s and 1970s to put tenancy agreements in the name of the husband.  As a result, when houses were purchased from local authorities in the 1980s, ownership transferred to the husband whereas nowadays it is taken for granted that a husband and wife will acquire or transfer property in both names.</P>
        <P>Rectifying this problem requires a straightforward change.  It is in the interest of everyone concerned that a house be in the names of both spouses.  In many cases, couples fail to do this until they are about to make a will when they will seek to ensure that, in the event of the death of one spouse, the surviving spouse is not required to incur the expense involved in getting probate.</P>
        <P>We discussed whether a property should be in joint ownership or tenancy in common.  It is beneficial for a husband and wife to have their house in both names in order that a surviving spouse will keep the house when his or her spouse dies.  In such circumstances, the surviving spouse need only bring to the Land Registry a declaration that his or her spouse died and a copy of the dead spouse&rsquo;s birth certificate.  This process does not cost much whereas probate and transfers require the services of a solicitor which can involve substantial cost.  The purpose of the amendment is to allow former tenant purchasers to transfer a house into the names of both spouses without first securing the consent of their local authority.  I realise, however, that this legislation may not be the correct forum in which to address the issue because the relevant provision is in another Act.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Senator Tuffy on the issue of transfers.  During many years of service on a local authority I always considered it an anomaly and encumbrance that tenants who had purchased a local authority house were required to deal with the local authority before selling on the house.  This requirement is an unnecessary intrusion.  Senator Tuffy&rsquo;s former leader recently informed me that, as a result of the increase in the value of property in Ringsend in Dublin, those who bought their homes through the tenant purchase scheme were investing in foreign property or buying homes in the countryside.  This has improved their quality of life and encouraged family members to visit them abroad.  It is great that people who once qualified for a local auth<Col N="585"/>ority house because they could not afford to buy their own property are reaping the benefits of the tenant purchase scheme.  Interference in this area should be kept to a minimum.  Like Senator Tuffy, I am not certain this is the correct legislation in which to address the matter. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I agree with Senator Tuffy on the matter of a fee simple being unencumbered.  I will draw her remarks to the attention of my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, because the issue should be considered in a housing or local government Act.  I am loath to accept the amendment in the context of this legislation.  It is also a policy area where I would have to obtain the say-so of the Minister.  If it is of any assistance to the Senator, I agree with her and Senator Jim Walsh on this issue.</P>

        <P>Bill reported without amendment.</P>
      <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 12:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 20, between lines 35 and 36, to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="2" Just="Left">12.&mdash;(1) (<i>a</i>) It shall be a condition of any planning permission for an apartment development that the applicant will form a management company and arrange for the issue of shares in the company to purchasers of apartments in the development.</P>
        <P LI="2">(<i>b</i>) Where a permission has been granted prior to the commencement of this section for an apartment development, the developer shall form a management company (if not already formed) and arrange for the issue of shares in the company to purchasers of apartments in the development (if not already issued) within 12 months of the commencement of this section.</P>
        <P LI="1">(2) Section 34(4)(<i>f</i>) of the Act of 2000 is amended by the addition after &ldquo;houses&rdquo; of &ldquo;or apartments&rdquo;.</P>
        <P LI="1">(3) On demand made by a majority of the purchasers of apartments in an apartment development, or on completion of the development, whichever first occurs, or in the case of developments completed prior to the commencement of this section, on the date which is 12 months from the commencement of this section, the developer shall transfer ownership and management of all common areas to the management company referred to in <i>subsection (1)</i>.</P>
        <P LI="1">(4) A purchaser may apply in a summary manner to the court in the event of a failure to comply with this section and the court may <Col N="586"/>require the applicant or developer to take such steps as the court directs to comply with the section and to pay compensation to the purchaser in such amount as the court thinks fit.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">It is essential the Government address the issue raised in the amendment, although this legislation may not be the most appropriate place to do so.  A recent report by the National Consumer Agency noted the need to regulate management companies, with which many people have problems.  In some areas, councils are wrongly establishing management companies for mixed developments that include housing.  While I accept the need to have management companies for apartment developments, they should be regulated.  Legislation should be introduced specifying that such companies must be non-profit making and their membership must consist of residents of the apartments in question who should determine which persons may be employed by the management company to provide various services.</P>
        <P>This detailed amendment addresses some of the problems arising from the use of management companies and is similar to provisions contained in legislation on apartment owners introduced in the United Kingdom.  That legislation should be examined in light of the increasing number of apartments being built which is, incidentally, not a good idea.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Tuffy for raising the issue on which I am in a position to report progress.  Since the matter was last debated in the House, I have had an interesting meeting with Ann Fitzgerald, the chair of the National Consumer Agency, at which we discussed management charges.  As the Senator noted, this is a complex area because it relates to apartment blocks.  In some cases, it involves what are called gated developments while in others it relates to open spaces in old suburban areas which, although shared spaces, are becoming extremely valuable and have never been vested in local authorities.  Pressure is being exerted to build in these areas and all sorts of issues arise.</P>
        <P>There is also the issue of developments, particularly in west Dublin and adjoining counties, where it could be suggested that local authorities semi-privatised their functions by requiring developers who build large estates to establish a management company to provide lighting and maintenance of public areas in their estates.  This has given rise to the peculiar situation in certain areas that some estates have been taken in charge, while the residents of other estates are liable to large annual bills for the same services their near neighbours have provided free of charge by the local authority.</P>
        <P>Having considered these issues, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, and I have agreed to establish an interdepartmental working group <Col N="587"/>to make progress on the issue of estate management charges.  To kick-start this process, on 25 January next, we will have a major conference to which we will invite all the interested parties to discuss the issues and possible solutions.  This is not an easy task as one cannot cure all these problems on the back of an envelope.</P>
        <P>Even in relation to apartment complexes, some of the conveyancing documents provide that the management company does not come into existence until the developer has sold off all the apartments and that a temporary arrangement exists in the meantime.  If the developer does not sell off all the apartments, he or she effectively will be required to keep in place indefinitely the contemporary arrangement against the wishes of the tenants.</P>
        <P>While I do not wish to be too prescriptive at this stage, it occurs to me that we should establish a body to which apartment owners and others who live in communal areas can apply when a company has not been formed to enfranchise the owners by giving them the right to found a management company or, where a management company has collapsed or is in deadlock, to which tenants in such circumstances can submit a scheme of reconstruction for the management company so things can start again for those tenants in a way that is fair to all.  Legislation will be needed but I want a conference to ventilate these issues first so people will have an input instead of the Department deciding a policy in secret.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>It would be important to involve those experiencing problems in any such conference.  The managing agents for an estate in Lucan organised a meeting miles away from the estate at an inconvenient time to make it impossible for most people to attend, although they are supposed to be members of the management company.  The establishment of a body where people could raise such issues would be of benefit.</P>

        <P LI="1" Just="Left">&ldquo;(4) Where on the commencement of this section, or on a person becoming entitled to a fee tail after such commencement, another person&rsquo;s estate or interest inland is extinguished by virtue of <i>subsection (3)</i>, the second-mentioned person may apply to the court within 12 years of such extinguishment for an order determining the amount of compensation if any that should be paid to the second-mentioned person, and such order may make provision for charging the payment on the land subject to such conditions as the court sees fit.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">University College Cork academic Mr. John Mee has pointed out that section 13(3) may be unconstitutional as it provides for the abolition of property rights without compensation.  Our amendment is designed to save the section from being struck down as unconstitutional by allowing a court to determine if compensation should be paid.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">It has been the case since the 19th century that entails can be barred without compensation.  I do not want to dispute the constitutionality or otherwise of a section with a learned academic but one of the aims of the Constitution is that property rights should be exercisable and regulated in accordance with the common good.  Entails are not generally synonymous with the common good. They are an anachronism and usually contrary to the common good.</P>
        <P>Section 13 was amended on Committee Stage to ensure consistency between sections 13(3) and (4) by providing that the conversion of a fee tail into a fee simple would only take place where any protectorship has ended.  That was intended to avoid interference with any existing interest in the land but the contingent interest in a fee tail situation is not one we accept merits provision for compensation.  I ask Senator Tuffy to reconsider her amendments in light of the changes made on Committee Stage and suggest that the constitutional argument is not as simple as was pointed out in the article in question.</P>

        <P LI="1">In page 27, between lines 36 and 37 to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="1" Just="Left">28.&mdash;Where a co-ownership is to be established, it shall be established as a tenancy in common and no joint tenancy shall be created unless&mdash;</P>
        <P LI="2">(<i>a</i>) it is the stated intention of all parties to the co-ownership to create a joint tenancy, and</P>
        <P LI="2">(<i>b</i>) each party to the co-ownership has signed a declaration to the effect that he or she understands&mdash;</P>
        <P LI="3">(i) the difference between a tenancy in common and a joint tenancy,</P><Col N="590"/>
        <P LI="3">(ii) that the creation of a joint tenancy means that, upon his or her death, his or her interest in the land passes automatically to the surviving co-owner(s), and</P>
        <P LI="3" Just="Left">(iii) that a joint tenancy cannot be severed other than in accordance with <i>section 28</i>.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This was discussed at length on Committee Stage.  I believe many joint tenancies are unintentionally created by buyers as they unaware of the consequences of their actions in this respect.  The amendment would not make the creation of a joint tenancy any more difficult but it would ensure informed decisions by buyers.  With the increased measures laid out in section 28, it would be more difficult for joint tenants to sever a joint tenancy or convert it to a tenancy in common.  This should be accompanied by the increased safeguards against purchasers making decisions on the basis of misconceptions.  I read the debate on Committee Stage and the points made by Senator Tuffy so I am interested in hearing the Minister&rsquo;s opinion.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>As I said on Committee Stage, I am unsure that the amendment should be accepted but tenancies in common and joint tenancies are an issue.  Could this be simply addressed by a change in terminology?  Perhaps &ldquo;joint tenancy (automatically terminating at death)&rdquo; could be used to make it clear that there is a termination period for a joint tenancy that would put people on notice that they were entering into something they may not have intended.  Perhaps &ldquo;tenancy in common (including successors and assigns)&rdquo; might signal enough to people.  Where it is set out in legal documents, there would be an expansion of the terminology that clearly signals the implications.  As I have stated before and was acknowledged by the Minister, it is not only immigrants who have difficulty, and most Irish people would not be able to make the legal distinction between a tenancy in common and a joint tenancy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I always remember, while studying property law in King&rsquo;s Inns, trying to memorise the distinguishing features between a tenancy in common and a joint tenancy.  It occurs to me out of the blue after 35 years that there was an acronym to remind me of the distinguishing characteristics of joint tenancy, PITT.  It stood for possession, interest, time and tenure.  I knew going into the examination hall that I would be able to parrot it back out.  With all the accumulated knowledge, I would be a right idiot to abolish the difference.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>Not after having gone to that trouble of learning the difference.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.  The intention behind Senator Cummins&rsquo;s amendment No. 16 is to <Col N="591"/>require co-owners to take deliberate steps to create a joint tenancy, if that is their collective wish.  Otherwise, a tenancy in common would be the default position.  What we are discussing is really a choice of default positions.</P>
        <P>Senator Cummins will have read the debate on the previous Stage where I indicated I would consider the issue carefully, and we did so in the Department.  Although many people may not be aware of the legal implication of creating a joint tenancy rather than a tenancy in common, we remain unsatisfied that it is a sufficient reason to change the law and produce a different default position.</P>
        <P>Almost everyone who buys property in Ireland will need to hire a solicitor to engage in the conveyance of the property.  It is a matter, usually for the solicitor, to fully advise the client on the legal implication of either form of conveyance.  Any person intending to buy property, be it in Ireland or abroad, would be very foolish to do so without getting independent legal advice on a matter of such importance, particularly if the person is unfamiliar with the law.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I am also mindful that the intention of the amendment would perhaps be inconsistent with section 14 of the Family Home Protection Act 1976, which encourages married couples to create joint tenancies in respect of family homes by reducing the costs involved in creating joint tenancies.  It is a value of that Act that the costs of creating a joint tenancy are reduced compared with other transactions.</P>
        <P>Section 14 states, &ldquo;No stamp duty, land registration fee, Registry of Deeds fee or court fee shall be payable on any transaction creating a joint tenancy between spouses in respect of a family home where the home was immediately prior to such transaction owned by either spouse or by both spouses otherwise than as joint tenants.&rdquo;  In that case we effectively give a subsidy or tax exemption for a transaction going in favour of joint tenancy.</P>
        <P>With regard to other amendments in the grouping, amendment No. 17 is a drafting amendment, with amendments Nos. 18 and 21 consequential to amendments accepted on Committee Stage.  Amendment No. 19 amends section 28(3) by deleting the reference to the vesting of an estate or an interest of an insolvent joint tenant in the official assignee or a liquidator.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It emerged during the consideration triggered by Senator Cummins&rsquo;s original amendment that operation of the right of survivorship could create difficulties if a joint tenancy were deemed not to be severed in the case of a bankruptcy or liquidation.  The amendment also clarifies that while the registration of a judgment mortgage against a joint tenant does not sever the joint tenancy, the judgment mortgage is extinguished in the event of the death of the judgment debtor, and it does not remain a burden on the surviving joint tenant or tenants.</P><Col N="592"/>
        <P>That is an important point.  For example, if a husband and wife own a house as joint tenants, and if the wife, to take an unusual example, ran up debts and a judgment mortgage was registered against her interest in the land, it would die with her.  The husband&rsquo;s interest in survivorship would be taken clear of the judgment mortgage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>I was not going to speak to this amendment, but there is another issue if it is automatic for it to become tenancy in common instead of joint tenancy.  Tenancy in common can be held in different shares, and there could not be an automatic tenancy in common without clarifying the shares.</P>
        <P>With a joint tenancy, the survivor does not lose anything, but with a tenancy in common the survivor loses something if it is wrongly assumed.  If a tenancy in common is assumed, a living person on the title deeds could lose out if a mistake occurred.  The person could lose half a house, for example, as it could go to the estate.  Much more could be lost by the survivor if there is an assumption in favour of the tenancy in common in preference to the joint tenancy.  I make these points in case the issue arises in the D&aacute;il.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I am grateful to Senator Tuffy and if the argument is made again in the D&aacute;il, I will summon her in aid on this matter.</P>
        <P>Senator Walsh suggested we should change the title to clarify the meaning of each term.  That is tempting on one level, but there is a volume of existing case law, law books, legal dictionaries etc., all of which deal with joint tenancy.  If we came up with different labels, even if they had the advantage of being more explicit to the lay person, it would probably make the law much more difficult for lawyers.  We will leave it as it is.</P>

        <P FLI="0">This relates to easements and <i>profit &agrave; prendre</i>, specifically &ldquo;An easement or <i>profit &agrave; prendre</i> shall be acquired at law by prescription only on registration of a court order under this section&rdquo;.  It appears to be unduly onerous and as was stated on Committee Stage, a deed surely can be created to acknowledge such a right without the necessity for a court order.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P Just="Left">There is a contradiction between section 33(2) and section 38(2), which states, &ldquo;A conveyance of land creates for the benefit of that land any easement or <i>profit &agrave; prendre</i> over the land retained by the grantor which it is reasonable to assume, in the circumstances of the case, was, or would have been if they had adverted to the matter, within the contemplation of the parties at the date of the conveyance as being included in it.&rdquo;  It is assumed that, had it been discussed at the time of the agreement, the parties would have accepted that the easement or <i>profit &agrave; prendre </i>formed part of the conveyance.</P>
        <P>No court order appears to be necessary in respect of section 38, and this appears to contradict somewhat the provisions in section 33.  We were asked to submit this amendment again on Report Stage and I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s comments on it.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>As I explained on Committee Stage, I do not propose to accept this amendment.  Introducing the words &ldquo;or otherwise&rdquo; without any definition of what &ldquo;otherwise&rdquo; might mean could render the section vague and uncertain.  The provisions in section 33 which replaced <Col N="594"/>the provisions of the Prescription Acts 1832 and 1858 are based on detailed Law Reform Commission recommendations set out in its report on easements and <i>profits &agrave; prendre </i>by prescription, which is Law Reform Commission report 66 of 2002.  Section 33 clarifies and simplifies the existing law providing that legal title to an easement or profit by prescription may only be obtained by a claimant on the basis of a court order which is then registered in the Land Registry or the Registry of Deeds.  Section 69 of the Registration of Title Act 1964 provides for the registration of easements or profits not created by express grant or reservation or by means of such a court order.</P>
              <P>With reference to what Senator Cummins was saying about section 38, the disposition we are dealing with in subsection 38(2) would normally be done by way of deed.  I do not think it is necessary, therefore, to make the proposed amendment No. 22.</P>

        <P FLI="0">I tabled this amendment on Committee Stage.  The Minister did not see the need to make this provision.  If the builder owner is in dispute with the adjoining owner about the exercise of rights <Col N="595"/>under section 42, he or she may apply to the court.  It would seem that in the case of a dispute, either side should be able to go to court.

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Although one can call it the building owner or use the phrase, &ldquo;builder&rdquo;, we are dealing with one neighbour and another neighbour.  One neighbour wants something to happen and is the active neighbour.  We do not see any reason a passive neighbour would want to go to court if the active neighbour who wanted to do something did not want to go to court.  We do not want a situation where if something is not going to happen and the would-be building owner is not disposed to go to court, in some circumstance he would be brought to court by the passive neighbour who has no proposal in mind to have a matter adjudicated which is almost moot.  In light of the Committee Stage debate, I re-examined this amendment but my mind has not changed.  I ask the Senator to withdraw the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>What if there were a dispute over the money to be paid under the provision?  Section 42 refers to making good all the damage caused to the adjoining owner.  What if the adjoining owner had issues about those provisions?  Should he not be allowed go to court?</P>
        <P>It is obvious that the best way to deal with those issues in a dispute is by means of arbitration.  I suggest we need to start writing arbitration into the legislation.  I referred to this before and it may be relevant here.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the Senator.  Most fair and reasonable solicitors should now inform their clients.  The superior courts in England have now come to the point where they direct solicitors who fail to inform their clients about alternative dispute resolution, including conciliation and arbitration, that the solicitor may be liable for the costs of going to court.  Without being too prescriptive again, sometimes people are very trigger happy with litigation and it might be a good idea if the courts fired a few shots across bows of people who go to court first and ask questions later, so to speak.</P>
        <P>If a building owner fails within a reasonable time to pay reasonable costs or compensation under section 42(2), the adjoining owner can recover such costs and expenses or compensation as a simple contract debt in a court of competent jurisdiction.  This is the remedy to allow the adjoining owner to get compensation from a court.</P>

	<P>This amendment was discussed on Committee Stage.  Section 3 of the Conveyancing Act 1881 provides that subject to certain exceptions, a purchaser is precluded from requiring production of any title documents dated or made before the time prescribed by law or stipulated in the contract for the commencement of the title and from making requisitions, objections or inquiries as to such prior title.</P>
        <P>The Law Society standard contract for sale now contains provisions of a similar nature and these provisions are intended to facilitate effective conveyancing of land while at the same time protecting the interests of purchasers.  I am not aware of any concerns on the part of the Law Society in respect of section 56(1) of the Bill as it now stands.</P>
        <P>I do not wish to create a charter for people to mess around, so to speak, in conveyancing.  There are some people who put down a deposit on land and while they get together a line of credit or whatever, throw up a kind of screen of anti-aircraft fire, so to speak, to prevent the conveyance going through and prevent themselves from having to complete the transaction.  If we deviate from normal commercial practice to allow people to insist on old title documents to be produced, I feel this would be abused by people to delay conveyancing and through up false obstructions in the paths of others.  Occasionally, the contract will have to exclude certain documents which have been lost or misplaced.  I have often seen cases where people have sought additional time to get together the banking facilities for loans just to think of any old reason not to complete the contract and spurious requisitions are sent to the other side.  I do not want to give life to that kind of conveyancing messing around, it is often done in bad faith.</P>

The section deals with cases where the mortgagee has reasonable grounds for believing the mortgaged property has been abandoned but that may not be the case.  To allow <i>ex parte</i> applications means they could be open to abuse and that would not be in the public interest.  However, as an alternative to permitting <i>ex parte</i> applications, amendment No. 41 provides that the court will be allowed to make an order &ldquo;notwithstanding that the mortgagor dissents or does not appear&rdquo;.  It makes clear that the non-appearance of the mortgagor is not fatal to the making of a court order.  It is as good as we can do to compromise on this.</P>

I read intensely the book by Professor Wylie when studying for the Law Society of Ireland exams and it was a great book.  Thankfully, I never used fee tails or leases for lives renewable forever in my career as a solicitor.  It is good that many of these items have been abolished because they are no longer relevant.

I thank the Minister for suggesting on Committee Stage that such a meeting take place.  It did not happen before Report Stage but we are glad it will take place.

I express my thanks to Mr. Carroll and Ms O&rsquo;Keeffe, who have been with this programme at every stage, including collaboration with the Law Reform Commission and in this House, for all the work they have done.  It is a significant achievement for this House to have adopted and passed major legislation.  I hope that when it goes to the other House, it will be passed quickly.  It is not a matter of party political difference as the debate here has clearly shown.  On the other hand, as the life of this D&aacute;il is short, it would a pity if it were somehow left on the shelf and not progressed.

        <P Just="Left">As Senator Tuffy pointed out, Professor Wylie of the Law Reform Commission has made some of his own work redundant but their value will remain.  There will be many new editions of conveyancing and land law books to be published.  The task of students, practitioners, judges and lay people will be made much simpler when this Bill is enacted.  Some of the antiquated aspects of conveyancing law which were real mysteries to people will have been swept away.  I express the hope that Professor Wylie will be in a position to cash in on the revolution he has helped bring about by producing new books, if not in time for the Christmas market this year, then for the Christmas market next year.</P>
        <P>As we are talking about Christmas, the Revenue sheriffs were too busy to meet us before December.  That is why we were not in a position to have a meeting before Report Stage.

      <sTitle>Sex Offenders Register.</sTitle>
      <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>It is urgent that we ensure the regime in place to deal with registered sex offenders in this country is comparable with those in other countries, including the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland.  There have been many reports in recent days about registered sex offenders who have come to this country.  It is important they are not allowed to come here to take advantage of what they might perceive to be a less strict regime.</P>
        <P>I have read various comments by Ministers on this issue in recent days but I am concerned that it appears the onus is very much on the registered sex offender to register with the Garda.  I strongly believe there should be a failsafe mechanism so that if they do not register, there is perhaps a penalty or otherwise.  We should not have a system of which they can take advantage.  I would like the Minister to explain what is in place and what is proposed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Tuffy for raising this matter on the Adjournment.  I assure her that the Government shares her concerns that no opportunity is given to convicted sex offenders to take advantage of any differences in the law and arrangements in place in the different legal jurisdictions.</P>
        <P>I will set out briefly the legal position regarding convicted sex offenders who either have served a sentence imposed or did not receive a sentence of imprisonment.  The Act of 2001 put in place a notification system under which, to put it generally, convicted sex offenders are obliged to notify the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of where they reside and any changes to their addresses or their names.  It is modelled on similar systems in other common law jurisdictions and, in particular, because of our common travel arrangements with the United Kingdom, it is closely aligned to its system.  When the Sex Offenders Act was being prepared we not only made a conscious decision to model it closely on the UK model but also to improve it in many respects to take account of our own circumstances.  Among the major differences were a shorter period in which to notify the Garda, provisions requiring offenders convicted in Ireland to notify the Garda when going abroad and, significantly, provisions requiring offenders convicted abroad who had a similar notification obligation in their own country to notify the Garda when coming to Ireland, whether to live or for shorter stays.</P>
        <P>The UK has since updated its notification procedures and I have instructed my officials to examine our laws to identify what changes would be desirable so that sex offenders would experi<Col N="605"/>ence broadly similar regimes here and in the UK and, in particular, in Northern Ireland.  One change already announced is that failure to comply with the notification procedures will be an arrestable offence.  This is included in the Criminal Law (Trafficking in Persons and Sexual Offences) Bill, which is being drafted in the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel and is to come before the D&aacute;il soon.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Another area we are particularly looking at is the position of foreign sex offenders who come to Ireland.  Despite recent media reports, it is important to emphasise that we are probably the only country that requires persons convicted abroad of sex offences to comply automatically with notification procedures here when they would have to comply with similar procedures in the country in which they were convicted.  In that respect, controls here are already more severe than elsewhere, and it would be wrong to suggest our regime encourages sex offenders from abroad to come to Ireland.  However, I am not complacent and, as I have already indicated, we are examining the possibility of tightening even further the operation of the notification procedures in so far as they apply to sex offenders convicted either here or abroad.</P>
        <P>Legal provisions are only part of the picture.  We also have to keep under review, and improve as necessary, the arrangements and procedures in place to enforce these provisions and ensure the safety of the community.  Next Monday the Under-Secretary of State at the Home Office and I will sign a memorandum of understanding on information sharing arrangements between Ireland and the UK on sex offenders.  The signing at Hillsborough will be co-hosted by the Minister of State at the Northern Ireland Office.  This memorandum of understanding was negotiated between my Department and the Home Office, with input from the Northern Ireland Office.  It relates to information about persons travelling between Ireland and the UK who are subject to sex offender notification requirements in their own jurisdictions.  It therefore covers sex offenders travelling between Ireland, Britain and Northern Ireland.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The purpose of the memorandum of understanding is that information of this type will be shared between the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and British police forces for the purposes of protecting the public from the risks presented by sex offenders and investigating serious sexual offences.  It covers any information necessary to achieve these purposes.  It will cover soft and hard information.  The memorandum of understanding is part of the work undertaken following the intergovernmental agreement on North-South co-operation on criminal justice matters signed on behalf of the Irish and British Governments in July 2005.  Under the agreement, a registered sex offender advisory group has been established consisting of representatives of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Police <Col N="606"/>Service of Northern Ireland, Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Northern Ireland Office.  As part of its work, this group evaluates the potential for sharing information, examining the registration criteria in both jurisdictions for sex offenders and identifying areas for further co-operation.  As part of their ongoing co-operation, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the PSNI examine on an ongoing basis how the means of transmitting information to each other and the training given might be improved.  I commend both forces on their adoption of positive measures to improve the flow of information and expertise between the two jurisdictions.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As a result of the memorandum of understanding, the exchange of such information between the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and British police forces, which has already been taking place for some time, is being put on a formal footing.  The memorandum of understanding will be underpinned by further provisions contained in the Criminal Law (Trafficking in Persons and Sexual Offences) Bill.  Head 19 of that Bill, which can be viewed on my Department&rsquo;s website, places a statutory obligation on the Garda Commissioner and the director of the probation and welfare service to establish arrangements to assess and manage the risk posed by convicted sex offenders and to share that information with one another.  Such information may also be shared with the relevant authority in another jurisdiction in accordance with the terms of any written agreement or understanding for the reciprocal exchange of the information.</P>
        <P>The memorandum of understanding with the UK is the first agreement of its kind and will therefore enable such information to be shared with UK police forces, including the PSNI.  If the memorandum of understanding operates successfully &mdash; I am confident it will &mdash; there may be scope for similar agreements with other countries.  The two Governments undertake in the memorandum of understanding to discuss its use and effectiveness.  In this way, any improvements which might be desirable will be considered.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The law and procedures currently in place provide a high degree of protection from foreign convicted sex offenders who visit or reside in Ireland.  However, it does not apply to people who are not required by their native jurisdictions to register and that is an obvious deficiency.  We must ask ourselves if it is reasonable that a person who has no registration in his or her country where he or she commits an offence fails to register if he or she comes to Ireland because he or she is ignorant of the law here.  It is possible to take two views on that issue and we will examine it to the best of our abilities and see how it can be fairly dealt with.  We live in a common travel area in the EU and if somebody from the Czech Republic, for example, is not required to register at home and had never even heard of the concept of registration, it would be harsh to suddenly <Col N="607"/>arrest him or her in Ireland for failing to register.  We must think about this.</P>
        <P Just="Left">All laws and procedures must be kept constantly under review to ensure they are adapted and improved in response to developments in society and the behaviour of sex offenders.  I attach a very high priority to this work.  Given that we live in a society that has no border checks, people can come into this jurisdiction in many places without being checked.  Therefore, there is no foolproof system and we can only do our best.

	<P Just="Left">While I do not claim to be an expert on marine issues generally or razor clam fishing specifically, I have been made aware of a possible issue in Portmarnock in my constituency of Dublin North.  The Minister will be aware that fishing for razor clams in certain areas is not prohibited by the EU habitats directive 1992, as transposed into Irish law.  However fishing for razor clams is managed as a living aquatic resource under the Common Fisheries Policy.  I understand the harvesting of razor clams is subject to legislative controls and the areas in which such harvesting can take place is classified by ministerial regulations.  These are applied every six months following consideration of the results of the ongoing sampling programme.</P>
        <P>In light of the provisions of the habitats directive, particularly Article 6, and the EU ruling on cockle fishing in special areas of conservation in the Netherlands, should razor clam fishing near Portmarnock be allowed to continue?  With the legal precedent set in the EU in terms of the definition of a project, I would like the Department to publish its criteria for the assessment of razor clam fishing adjacent to an SAC and sometimes within an SAC off Portmarnock beach in north Dublin.  The Minister might also reassure the House that the Department&rsquo;s inspectorate staff continue to carry out periodic inspections of fishing in this area to ensure harvesting is undertaken in accordance with prevailing regulations.</P>

	<P>The Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Browne, regrets that he is unable to attend the Seanad this afternoon but is grateful to Senator Morrissey for raising this issue.  Natura 2000 is the EU-wide network of nature protection areas established under the 1992 habitats directive, which aims to safeguard Europe&rsquo;s most important wildlife areas.  It comprises special areas of conservation, SACs, designated by member states under the habitats directive, and special protection areas, SPAs, which they designate under the 1979 birds directive.  The establishment of this network of protected areas where special measures are taken to conserve biological diversity also fulfils a clear community obligation under the UN Convention on Biological Diversity.  The habitats directive identifies some 200 habitat types and 700 species of plants and animals of EU importance.  The birds directive lists 181 vulnerable species for which habitat protection through site protection is required.  It also recognises the need to protect areas of importance for migratory bird species, particularly wetland habitats.</P>
        <P>The long-term conservation of these habitats and species cannot be achieved by protecting isolated pockets of nature however great their individual value.  By establishing a network of sites across the full distribution of these habitats and species, Natura 2000 is intended to be a dynamic and living network providing a guarantee for their conservation.  Natura 2000 is not a system of strict nature reserves where all human activity is excluded.</P>
        <P>On the establishment of management regimes for the sites, in 2005 the Minister for Communication Marine and Natural Resources formally launched the management framework for shellfisheries, committee structures, functions and process.  The committee structures, functions and administrative arrangements were agreed following intensive consultation with all those involved in inshore fishing.  The network of inshore fisheries local advisory committees, species advisory groups and the inshore fisheries review group are now playing their part in setting the objectives for inshore fisheries, the development of local management plans to deliver these objectives, and the efficient and effective implementation of these plans.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Sound objectives and good management must always rely on solid counsel.  We must move from divergence and isolation to consensus and inclusiveness so that inshore fishermen move forward together with a shared vision and objective for the benefit of all.  The talents and abilities in the fishing industry, BIM, the Marine Institute, other State agencies and in the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources represent the best available to produce scientifically based management advice on an annual basis.  It will be on the basis of that advice, pro<Col N="609"/>duced in partnership with stakeholders, that we will move forward.  The framework is based on working as far as possible on a voluntary partnership basis rather than relying too much on legal instruments to deliver management plans effectively.  The Minister of State is convinced that such a partnership provides not only the best opportunity for success but also the only way to capture the spirit of stewardship that resides in all those who make their living from the sea.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In respect of the specific interaction between inshore fisheries and SACs, there is an obligation under the habitats directive to be cautious with respect to the impact of fishing activity in marine SACs.  The directive does acknowledge that traditional activity in the SAC may continue provided there is no escalation.  With activities that are thought to impact negatively on the structure and function of the ecosystem and especially where the level of such activity may be increasing within the SAC a precautionary approach is warranted.  The management advisory committee considers the impact of the fishing activity on the environment generally and more specifically when that activity occurs within an SAC.  Fishery management plans are drafted that consider the impact of the fishery on the target species but also develop particular environmental objectives that will aim to minimize the impact of the activity where this is thought to be important.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Concerns have been raised in respect of razor clam fishing in the region of Portmarnock beach.  Fishing for razor clams in the area is not prohibited by the 1992 habitats directive as transposed into Irish law but is managed as a living aquatic resource under the Common Fisheries Policy.  The harvesting of razor shells is subject to legislative controls and the areas in which such harvesting can take place is classified by ministerial regulations every six months following consideration of the results of a sampling programme.</P>
        <P>A system of gatherer dockets is also implemented whereby important information is collected on the fishery in such aspects as the precise location and date of harvesting, the quantities involved and the destination of the harvested razor shells.  The Department&rsquo;s marine inspectorate staff also carries out periodic inspections of fishing activity to ensure that harvesting activities are being undertaken in accordance with the prevailing regulations.</P>
        <P>As part of the work of the molluscan species advisory group, established under the shellfish management framework and which includes a representative of the razor clam fishermen, a razor clam local advisory committee has been established and held its first meeting in March 2006.  The next meeting is planned for January 2007.  This committee is facilitated by BIM and will seek to develop a sustainable management framework for the fishery.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I wish to highlight the need for the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs to provide an update on the current status of the application made by Mac Eoin Park residents association, Longford, for funding under the programme of grants for locally based community and voluntary organisations.  The object of this scheme is to support the activities of local voluntary and community groups through grants for the refurbishment of existing premises used by such groups and that, where disadvantage in the community is being addressed, up to 90% of the cost will be met.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Mac Eoin Park residents association, is open to all residents of Mac Eoin Park and surrounding new developments and local agencies such as the VEC, local partnership, etc.  The association has two houses, which were donated for the benefit of the association, and is situated in a very socially disadvantaged area with a high poverty index. The area suffers from extreme anti-social activity and drug and alcohol abuse.  Some 70% of the residents of Mac Eoin Park are on some form of welfare, 60% are under 18 years of age and 33% are seriously disadvantaged.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Mac Eoin Park is situated in a RAPID designated area.  The association runs a very successful national school after-school service but urgently needs to provide facilities to help adults, teenagers and other members of the community through education programmes in an educational setting to be provided at the centre.  With the help of appropriate funding the Mac Eoin Park residents association could fully equip the community centre, enabling both adults and children to use the centre for educational and information purposes.</P>
        <P>In its application for funding the residents association seeks to promote the interests of the Mac Eoin Park area and of the people of the locality as they pertain to the social, cultural and general welfare and common good of the community.  There are significant and well-recognised social problems within certain local authority estates within Longford town, where a high level of long-term unemployment, generational unemployment, substance abuse, early school leaving, vandalism and crime are persistent and demoralising problems, leading to a breakdown and erosion of community morale.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Mac Eoin Park residents association is an example of community-based self-help effort at its best.  The advantages to an area like this, which suffers every social disadvantage imaginable, cannot be overstated and funding for this community project is an investment in the turnaround that we all hope can be achieved to improve the quality of life for such communities.</P>
        <P Just="Left">With the voluntary effort going into the provision of community services such as that of the Mac Eoin Park residents association, I expect that every effort can be made by the Department of <Col N="611"/>Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, through Pobal, to provide the necessary funding to assist this worthwhile venture.  I commend the hard work of Mr. Peter Clyne, co-ordinator, Ms Isobel Daly, chairperson of the Mac Eoin Park residents association and the committee for their hard work and dedication to the project.  The basis of the mixed economy of welfare is dependent on the endeavours of such committed people.  I expect a positive response.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs is mindful of the importance of funding under the programme of grants for locally based community and voluntary organisations.  An application has been received from the group referred to by the Senator.  Applications under the scheme of equipment grants and the scheme of training, education and research grants closed on 25 September.  This application has been made under the scheme of equipment grants, one of three schemes under this programme, the other two being the refurbishment grants scheme and the training, education and research grants scheme.</P>
        <P>I can confirm that almost 1,200 applications have been received to date under this programme.  The significant level of interest in this programme highlights yet again its value to local groups.  Clearly this particular programme helps to meet the needs of such groups in carrying out their valuable work in their communities.  The equipment grants scheme enables local community organisations to buy IT equipment, photocopiers, phones, fax machines, desks or tables that their organisation needs.  The refurbishment scheme allows groups to maintain or re-decorate community halls and other community facilities.  The training, education and research scheme enables groups to build their own skill levels and to increase the capacity of their group to make a positive contribution in the lives of their community.</P>
        <P>The Government considers this type of funding to communities to be of considerable importance.  For this reason, the Government has provided an increase of funding for this programme from &euro;3 <Col N="612"/>million in 2006 to &euro;13 million in the 2007 Estimates.  The process of assessing the 1,200 applications so far received is a considerable one but has been under way since shortly after the 25 September closing date for the receipt of such applications.  Each application must be assessed individually against the published criteria for the schemes before a final decision can be made.</P>
        <P>I understand that this assessment process is proceeding and that recommendations on all complete applications received to date should be available to the Minister of State for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs within eight to ten weeks.  The refurbishment grants scheme remains open for applications for this current programme and, accordingly, further applications under that particular scheme continue to be received by the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.</P>
        <P>The group referred to by the Senator received an acknowledgement from that Department when its application was first submitted.  Subsequently, on 20 October its application reference number was confirmed for any future correspondence.</P>
    <HtmlBk SectId="8" />
        <P>I also understand that this group has submitted previous applications under this programme and I am glad to acknowledge that under last year&rsquo;s programme, its application under the scheme of equipment grants was successful.  The grant on that occasion would have facilitated it in acquiring IT and other equipment which, I expect, will have been put to good use for the benefit of the Mac Eoin Park community.</P>
        <P>As I have indicated, once the assessment process has been finalised and a decision is made on this group&rsquo;s latest application for equipment funding, the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs will be in contact with it immediately.</P>
