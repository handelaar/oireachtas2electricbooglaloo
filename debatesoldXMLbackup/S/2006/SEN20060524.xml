	<P>I have received notice from Senator Fergal Browne that he proposes to raise the following matter on the Adjournment:</P>
    <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to outline the reason for the delay in the vetting of home help, that home care personnel are subjected to by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>

   <Title>Order of Business.</Title>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Order of Business is Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4 and 24, motion 22. No. 1, a motion referred to the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service which has completed its deliberations concerning the extension of the Freedom of Information Act 1997 (Prescribed Bodies) Regulations 2006 to additional bodies which now brings to more than 500 the number of bodies covered by the Freedom of Information Act, to be taken without debate; No. 2, Employment Permits Bill 2005 &mdash; Second Stage, to be taken on the conclusion of the Order of Business to conclude not later than 1.30 p.m., spokespersons have 12 minutes and other Senators eight minutes, the Minister to be called upon to reply not later than five minutes before the conclusion of Second Stage; No. 3, statements on school transport, to be taken at 2 p.m. and to conclude not later than 4 p.m., spokespersons have ten minutes and other Senators six minutes, the Minister to be called upon to reply not later than five minutes before the conclusion of the statements; No. 4, Road Safety Authority Bill 2004 &mdash; Report and Final Stages, to be taken at 4 p.m. until 5 p.m. and to resume at 7.15 p.m., to conclude not later than 8 p.m.; and No. 24, motion 22, to be taken from 5 p.m. to 7 p.m. There will be a sos from 1.30 p.m. to 2 p.m.</P>

   <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Leader agree that both Houses have an immediate obligation to respond to yesterday&rsquo;s Supreme Court ruling on statutory rape? Will she find out, for the information of the House, what is the Government&rsquo;s intention on proposed legislation to respond to the unanimous view of the court concerning this issue? Once again, in my mind, the Oireachtas has been caught napping on an issue which was flagged as far back as the 1990s when it came from a specific recommendation of the Law Reform Commission.</P>
    <P>An horrific situation has developed. This ruling has implications for persons convicted of statutory rape or who have yet to stand trial for that offence. More important, it has significant implications for persons who are now on the register of sex offenders and could be removed as a result of the ruling. It is urgent.</P>
    <P Just="Left">Will the Leader ask the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to make a statement in this House and tell us what is the Government&rsquo;s intention on legislation? Will the Leader and the Minister respond to the fact that this not only involves young women in an abusive or predatory relationship with older men? It also involves young men who could be abused by older women. I had a brief opportunity to examine the 1935 legislation. It only refers to young girls under the age of 15. It is utterly wrong in this day and age, when young men can be abused, that they should be excluded from the law. This brings into focus the issue of the age of consent. We must debate this and introduce legislation to address these loopholes. The Government, which has known about this since 1990, has the ultimate responsibility to respond urgently.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>On a related matter on the question of abuse of children, the House is aware of the extraordinary statement made by the representative of the Christian Brothers to the redress board during the week, to the effect that victims of clerical sexual child abuse put forward their complaints in the hope of getting money. This House debated those issues on a number of occasions and showed extraordinary sensitivity and understanding of the troubles and traumas of these victims. We should make it clear that we vehemently reject this statement.</P>
    <P>I should also bring to the attention of the House that the same person who made the allegation to the redress board during the week is a trustee of Marino Institute of Education and dealt with the complaints there. On &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; he stated to me that he had never received a complaint, although I was holding copies of 15 complaints he had received during the previous year. He refused to acknowledge them. We know how he deals with complaints. He states victims of child sexual abuse are only in it for the money, and he ignores people doing a day&rsquo;s work in Marino Institute of Education and throws their complaints in the bin.</P><Col N="1475"/>
    <P>The connection between what is happening in Marino and the issues investigated at the redress board is sinister. I would like the Minister for Education and Science to indicate to us whether she is aware of any connection between them. Is it appropriate that somebody who made that comment about victims of trauma should be in a position of trusteeship for the Marino Institute of Education? It is quite appalling.</P>
    <P>Senator Coghlan and I have an item on the Order Paper regarding the rights of muintir na Gaeltachta to decide on the names of their own places of residence, as applies to every other part of the country.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>I saw that.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>We have a piece of legislation which would give back to muintir na Gaeltachta an cearta sibhialta sin at&aacute; ag aon duine eile timpeall na t&iacute;re. That is the right to decide and determine the name of their own place and have a referendum on it.</P>
    <P>In the past week, Kerry County Council has taken a decision, by 21 votes to four, to allow a plebiscite of the entire Dingle area in the autumn. Senator Coghlan and I feel it would be more appropriate to move the motion after that. The Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs could then come before the House to tell us his reasons if he refuses to accept the views of the people.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>

	<P>He has said he will do that.</P>

   <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a case of democracy turned on its head by this Minister.</P>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>It has nothing to do with c&oacute;naitheoir&iacute; na Gaeltachta. That is a decision which is not taken by the people in any area, despite a suggestion made here last week that muintir na Gaeltachta could decide to be in or out of the Gaeltacht. That is decided politically, and it is a matter for Government.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>D&uacute;irt m&eacute; go raibh s&eacute; de shaor-rogha ag pobal an Daingin aon ainm a theasta&iacute;onn uathu a bheith ar a mbaile.

I cannot see the logic. If the people of Dingle want to leave the Gaeltacht, so be it. It is their absolute right as free citizens.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not their right. It is a decision of Government to take them out of it.</P>

	<P>Order, please. The Senator should allow Senator Ryan to speak.</P>

   <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I have no idea why Senator Norris feels it necessary to abuse the fact that I can speak Irish.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I enjoy listening to the language. I like the blas.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Ryan, without interruption.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I speak the two languages with reasonable comportment. If people wish to leave the Gaeltacht, nobody will stop them.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>It does not arise. The people of Dingle have never indicated they want to leave the Gaeltacht. They have never given such a view. It is a matter for the relevant Minister.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Ryan should be allowed to speak without interruption. Senator O&rsquo;Toole has made his contribution.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Until recently, when the people of the Gaeltacht received funding, the people of Dingle made it quite clear what they thought of the Irish language. It was only when muintir na Gaeltachta managed to have spending power that pobail an Daingean discovered that the Irish language had some positives. I will repeat this.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>We will not have a debate on the Gaeltacht.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Is that the position of the Labour Party? The people of Dingle would be very pleased to hear this.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask Senator Ryan to continue on the Order of Business. We will not have a debate on the Gaeltacht.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask for a debate on the priorities of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. On the one hand, it was warned by a Law Reform Commission report in 1990 about problems with the legislation which was struck down by the Supreme Court yesterday. It is that long ago, but the Department never got around to acting on the matter. At the same time, the Department is fighting a diligent rearguard action to protect itself and its agencies from the Freedom of Information Act. In spite of the request of the Information Commissioner, it has resolutely refused to bring the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under the terms of the Freedom of Information Act. I hope that Mr. Justice Morris&rsquo;s further reports will be <Col N="1477"/>published shortly, and we will realise the degree to which public scrutiny of the Garda and how it operates is increasingly necessary as a result of what Mr. Justice Morris has brought to our attention.</P>
    <P>At the same time, the Department is resolutely refusing to have any part in the refugee process being brought under the Freedom of Information Act. I hope all of us behaved with considerable restraint and responsibility last week in the face of what occurred in St. Patrick&rsquo;s Cathedral. To encourage those actions would have been profoundly wrong. The issue has been dealt with well. There is a fundamental question remaining in that we do not know how many of these refugee agencies work.</P>
    <P>In particular, there are many stories about extraordinarily uneven decision making by appeals commissioners, with some people refusing everybody, and allegedly boasting about it. Other people are more reasonable. We will not be told of this. The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, which forgot about a Law Reform Commission report for 16 years, is resolutely working to persuade the Government not to extend the Freedom of Information Act to it. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform should come in here to explain the peculiar priorities of his Department and there should be an attempt to get it in line with what the public generally feels.</P>
    <P>It is at least a month since I raised the fact that the Taoiseach&rsquo;s Department website has not noted that James Connolly founded the Labour Party in the man&rsquo;s biography. In a week when the Taoiseach is busy correcting records, perhaps he will get around to correcting his own website also.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>On several occasions in the House, Members have placed on the record our abhorrence of the terrible abuses which were perpetrated against innocent young people in institutions in this country. At the same time we endeavoured to be fair to everybody in order to ensure that natural justice would apply to all people. The record will not show that the representative of the Christian Brothers stated that those who were abused were bringing claims just for monetary gain.</P>
    <P>My understanding is that the statements were questioning the credibility of some of the claims, a different issue altogether. In the spirit of the previous debates here, it would be exceptionally surprising for us to suggest that the Christian Brothers, going into a forum provided by the State, would not endeavour to protect themselves, those who are deceased and other innocent people within the order. At they same time they would apologise profusely for the terrible happenings in those institutions. This was done.</P>
    <P Just="Left">Yesterday, one of those responsible for the murder of solicitor Pat Finucane was released after serving three years of a 22 year prison sentence. The significance of this case is that this <Col N="1478"/>man was a paid informer of the British security forces. Britain used the conviction and the trial to delay any question of an inquiry. During the intervening period, legislation was introduced in the House of Commons to ensure there would be neither a public nor independent inquiry.</P>
    <P>It is vital, for the status of the present police force and democracy itself, that the Finucane family&rsquo;s wish for an independent public inquiry be granted. There is no doubt at the moment that there was collusion with British forces in the killing of Pat Finucane. I am glad to see legislators in America and elsewhere coming out strongly in recent weeks demanding such an independent public inquiry.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>In 2003, Deputy Dermot Ahern, then the Minister responsible, designated sporting events which were free to air. In recent times there was a debate focused on that issue, with the Ryder Cup coming to this country. The competition will cost approximately &euro;15 million but will do tremendous work for the general tourism industry in Ireland. The Minister had a consultation process, but in April last, it was announced that the Ryder Cup would not be designated.</P>
    <P>We have recently had the Heineken Cup final in rugby. Remarks were made in the House yesterday on what occurred last weekend. I am disappointed having read in newspapers on Monday that last week was the last time the Heineken Cup final would be on free-to-air television. In future, Sky Sports will have exclusive rights. It appears that Rupert Murdoch has won this match as well.</P>
    <P>In April 2006, the Minister stated that he had received representations about the Heineken Cup. In that context he did not agree it was important for society. Having attended the match at the weekend with a group from Newcastle West rugby club, and having shared a hotel with a large group from Donegal wearing the Munster colours, it struck me that it was not a Munster event but a national event.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I will clarify the position. Senator Finucane is making the case for free to air television.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn"><NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
	<P>The Supreme Court ruling must send a shiver down the spine of every parent the length and breadth of this country. I strongly support what Senator Brian Hayes said, as must all right-thinking people. This House has taken the lead in the past in tackling urgent matters and no Member would object to sitting at any time, even on a Sunday and with the shortest possible notice, to address the issue in an appropriate way. Time is not on our side but I read in the newspapers that people on the sex offenders&rsquo; register would probably apply to have their names removed as a result of the judgment, which is a worrying prospect. It will give those twisted people who abuse young boys and girls a pretext under which to claim they did not knowingly break the law.</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to come to the House for a debate on knife crime, which is creating a serious problem across the water and is common in this State. Knife crime is as prevalent as gun crime, which we have already debated, and hardly a week passes without a number of knife murders. It is time for appropriate action to be taken. I have previously called for equipment to be installed in night clubs and discotheques to detect offensive weapons on persons, which is not being done at the moment, and for random searches on suspects. The number of people who die from knife attacks is unacceptable.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; on the need for an independent inquiry into the assassination of Pat Finucane. It is dreadful when such murders occur but even more dreadful when a government agency of some description is suspected of involvement. Contrary to Lord Denning&rsquo;s view, appalling vistas must be confronted rather than avoided because if they are avoided they will continue to occur. I hate the idea of governments being involved in such crimes but, regrettably, it is the case all over the world. If it emerges that the British are implicated then so be it. There must be an independent inquiry.</P>
    <P>The Supreme Court judgment, mentioned by Senator Brian Hayes, is very important but we should not just approach the issue as a reason for tightening up loopholes. We should look at the whole question of the age of consent and the nature of consent itself. There have been cases involving women teachers&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>We were just discussing that.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Such relationships are not always vicious. I know of a number of reported cases where a couple went on to marry and have families. Obviously when a teacher is involved there is a potential violation&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="1480"/>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Of trust.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>As a teacher I assure Senators that as a principle I never had anything to do with any of my students in that regard. The Law Reform Commission has produced a sensitive set of proposals that treat the matter in a subtle way. There is no point in using the arm of the law to crush people in consensual relationships. If we are concerned, as Senator Glynn and I are, about the welfare of youths, let us do something about a matter which we can clearly control, namely, the appalling epidemic of bullying, in the form of homophobic abuse, which was exposed in a report published last week. The report also stated that whereas 90% of teachers were aware of it, 80% did nothing about it. One of the principal reasons for that is its occurrence in church schools. The report traced much of the homophobia back to church statements and that is why we are all afraid to address it. If we are serious about the welfare of young men and about preventing bullying and possible suicides we should tackle this behaviour.</P>
    <P>Can we have a debate on the role of utilities in society? We have been flogging everything, such as Aer Lingus and Eircom. I noticed that one of my colleagues described the company buying Eircom as &ldquo;Ballcock &amp; Brown&rdquo;. A right ballcock has been made of the entire matter and as a consumer I am not pleased. We are told the lines belong to consumers if there is something wrong with them but to the company when we have to pay the rent. Can the Leader ask the Government to treat this matter in exactly the same way as it dealt with ground rents? I have, as have other Senators, paid several times over for the cost of a line but we are still charged &euro;30 or &euro;40 per month for it. It is absolutely outrageous, and is an imperialist tactic. Now Monsieur Fanon and other investors will rule the roost and they have said they want to make money out of it. Lots of other people have done so, including the proprietor of the <i>Irish Independent</i>, whose front page expresses pleasure about the deal. What about the unfortunate telephone users?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FrancisOBrien"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>Last week the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children and the Government received the report on the death of Mr. Pat Joe Walsh. As of yesterday, the family had not received the report or any details pertaining to it. Will the Leader ask the T&aacute;naiste or the Government how soon the report will be made available to the family, or whether the Department of Health and Children or the Minister can communicate details of the report to the family to appraise it of the sequence of events that led to his death?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I strongly agree with the views expressed by Senator O&rsquo;Toole. Underlying the question of the renaming of Dingle is the basic democratic principle that the people of the town <Col N="1481"/>have the right to decide it for themselves, without it being imposed on them, as has been the case. Kerry County Council is to proceed with a plebiscite, which will be carried out in an orderly manner, and I hope the Minister will take heed, as the Leader has indicated he will. I look forward to hearing her further comments on the matter.</P>
    <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>By their own sweat, the people of the town have built up the internationally known brand name of Dingle. I mean no disrespect to towns in other counties called &ldquo;Daingean&rdquo;, notably the one in County Offaly, and I support the use of the name in the right context, but this town is &ldquo;Dingle&rdquo;. That is how it is known and its fame is the result of a lot of effort in past years. The result of the plebiscite should be respected by all good democrats.</P>
      </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>I could not help but reflect that I will make telephone calls asking people to watch &ldquo;Oireachtas Report&rdquo; tonight to see the spat between Senators Ryan and O&rsquo;Toole on the Order of Business. All Senator Norris&rsquo;s talk about ballcocks should also make for riveting television.</P>

   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Senator to address his remarks to the Order of Business.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>On a serious issue, I found it somewhat coincidental that Senator Norris referred to Lord Denning&rsquo;s &ldquo;appalling vista&rdquo; remark in the week in which Richard McIlKenny, one of the Birmingham Six, died. I am sure Senators will join me in expressing sympathy to Dick McIlkenny&rsquo;s family. The &ldquo;appalling vista&rdquo; to which Lord Denning referred was the prospect of accepting the possibility that the West Midlands police force could have conspired to jail innocent people. As we are all aware, history proved otherwise. Before entering the House, I and others were involved in the search for justice for the Birmingham Six. When we consider how the world has moved on since, it seems a long time ago. The death of Mr. McIlkenny serves as a reminder to all those who took an interest in the Birmingham Six and other miscarriages of justice of that time, including that perpetrated against the Guildford Four. I ask that the Leader convey the sympathy of the House to Mr. McIlkenny&rsquo;s family.</P>
    <P>As the former president of the INTO is present, I will choose my words carefully. I have been contacted by a number of parents regarding the INTO campaign to reduce class sizes by exerting pressure on the Minister for Education and Science. While I and the parents who have contacted me support the purpose of the campaign, <Col N="1482"/>as a parent of a ten year old child who earlier this week arrived home with a letter asking parents to support the initiative, I share the disquiet expressed by other parents that youngsters are being manipulated politically. I do not want my ten year old son to do anything other than enjoy his childhood.</P>
    <P>Although the case being made by INTO is a good one, the problem in my local school is not one of class size but of one teacher teaching two classes comprising 36 pupils in one classroom. Addressing this issue is a greater priority than reducing class sizes. The numbers of pupils in many rural schools causes overcrowding because the buildings do not have sufficient capacity to have different classes taught in separate rooms. Surely the stress on teachers and students of having two classes taught by one teacher is unacceptable. In the wider context of the current INTO campaign I hope the Leader will initiate a debate on class sizes and the management of schools in general.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>On yesterday&rsquo;s Supreme Court decision striking down as unconstitutional legal provisions on statutory rape, I urge the Leader to exert pressure on her Government colleagues to ensure legislation is introduced as quickly as possible to close the loophole the ruling has created. Senator Ryan is correct that legislation should have been ready in anticipation of the judgment. I will co-operate with the Government to ensure such legislation is passed. As legislators, we have a duty to ensure speedy action is taken to address this matter as to do otherwise would fail children. Certain individuals will use the court&rsquo;s decision as an excuse to take advantage of children and young people.</P>
    <P>While I accept a debate is needed on the issue of consent, I oppose lowering the age of consent because the possibility that young people will be pressurised by their peers raises questions about whether consent is genuine. I accept, however, that there may be different levels of culpability and the age of an offender may need to be taken into account. Nevertheless, it is important to ensure that a debate on this matter in the Oireachtas does not delay the introduction of legislation to deal with the consequences of yesterday&rsquo;s judgment. To allow such a delay would let down children as they may become the victims of adults who will take advantage of and exploit them.</P>

	<P>I support the comments of Senators &Oacute; Murch&uacute; and Norris on the Finucane case, in particular, the need for an independent inquiry. It is disappointing, albeit not surprising, that the British Government failed to meet the commitments it made at Weston Park on accepting the recommendations of its appointee, Judge Cory. It is appropriate that the House speak with one voice on this issue and I suggest that the leaders of all parties agree a motion on <Col N="1483"/>the issue, particularly in light of the recent decision of the US House of Representatives to endorse a resolution calling for an independent inquiry into the case. It would be an anomalous situation if the House did not fully endorse that decision.</P>

	<P>Senator Ryan&rsquo;s comments on this matter are correct.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FrankFeighan"><NameTxt>Mr. Feighan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Comptroller and Auditor General yesterday issued a disturbing report on serious abuse of the rent supplement scheme, which will have cost almost &euro;2 billion in slightly more than five years. Politicians will have seen many instances of the scheme being abused. In one case an asylum seeker who was working illegally claimed around &euro;85,000 in more than four years but faces a decrease in rent supplement of just &euro;15 per week. This contrasts with the treatment of the naive individuals caught with offshore accounts who were hounded and faced the prospect of prison because of the penalties imposed on them.</P>
    <P>It is more lucrative for a landlord to rent a property to a single person receiving rent supplement than to a professional couple. The Government has failed to tackle the rental market with the result that large amounts of money are being lost. This episode also shows that the successors of the health boards are incapable of properly administering our finances. Responsibility for the administration of the rent supplement scheme must transfer to local authorities. It is about time this serious abuse of public funds was highlighted because we are sick and tired of it. With average rents in Dublin now &euro;276 per week, the waste of money in the rent supplement scheme must cease. I propose that the House debate this serious issue.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DrMauriceHayes"><NameTxt>Dr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the call for a properly constituted and empowered inquiry into the death of Mr. Pat Finucane. His wife and other members of his family who have conducted themselves with great dignity over the years deserve no less.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelCoonan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coonan</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to broaden the discussion on concerns raised by Senators about the welfare of Irish children. As of next week, thousands of children from Belarus will come here to stay with Irish families. I ask the Leader to organise a debate with the Ministers for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Foreign Affairs or at least <Col N="1484"/>one of those Ministers to discuss the uncaring attitude adopted by the Government towards issuing visas to the citizens of Belarus. Many families who contacted me recently are devastated because children who have been their guests for a number of years have been denied visas. The children or their families must travel to Moscow at considerable expense to secure visas, which they are often denied. If we care about our children, we should also show a caring attitude to other children. Many Irish parents are devastated because children from Belarus who have made friends with their own children are being denied access to Ireland this summer. It is time to take action to ensure this is not allowed to continue. I call for a debate on the matter about which the Minister for Foreign Affairs is both aware and concerned.</P>
    <P>Last week I called for a debate on a agriculture. This debate should focus on the nitrates directive and the cost it is imposing on farmers. Across the country, various local authorities have introduced stealth taxes in the form of development charges. These charges are severe in certain counties, medium in some and non-existent in others. There should be an equilibrium in this regard. We need to update the rate of grant payments to farmers for works they must carry out under the nitrates directive. The current costings relate to 2004 but we are all aware that they have risen steeply, so a discussion is required on that matter. The Minister should implement proper costings for grants available to farmers, otherwise there is no point in her saying that she is doing a great job in getting an extra 10% for farmers in Europe.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DonLydon"><NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the call by Senators &Oacute; Murch&uacute; and Jim Walsh for an independent inquiry into the brutal murder of Pat Finucane. I know that an inquiry of this type may expose the duplicity of the British Government in its dealings with Irish people, but then what is new?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome yesterday&rsquo;s Supreme Court decision and call on the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to bring forward legislation urgently to take account of the ruling. I am aware of one particular case where a young man met a girl who was drinking with her father in a pub. Relations took place between the young man and the girl, following which he was prosecuted for having sex with a minor. However, the father was never prosecuted for buying drink for his daughter whom he clearly knew was under age, and the pub owner was never prosecuted for having a minor on his premises. The young man was bribed and told that the charges would be dropped if money was paid. He refused to pay as a matter of principle, went to court and fought the case. For his troubles, he received a jail sentence and is now on the sex offenders register.</P>
    <P>I welcome yesterday&rsquo;s Supreme Court ruling because of that particular case. There are two sides to every story, as we all know. I call on the <Col N="1485"/>Leader to invite the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to the House to debate this matter. The Minister should urgently introduce legislation to take account of that court ruling.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PeterCallanan"><NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad that Senator Coonan raised the issue he did. It affords me the opportunity of saying that the costings announcement will be made in the next 24 or 48 hours. We should appreciate that fact and welcome it.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator is very well informed.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Reliably informed.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PeterCallanan"><NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is important that the proper response be made. The issue Senator Coonan raised about having standard development charges throughout the country is equally important. I totally agree with him that something should be done about that.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister for Agriculture and Food on the changes she has introduced concerning the early retirement scheme. It is good news and we should avail of the opportunity to say so.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelCoonan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coonan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister should be invited here so that we can all have a chat with her and tell her how good she is.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PeterCallanan"><NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
	<P>All right.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Brian Hayes mentioned the Supreme Court ruling which astounded everybody who read it. He referred to young women in predatory relationships and that also relates to young boys. There was a case in the United Kingdom concerning a teacher who subsequently went to jail after appearing in court charged with having an improper relationship with one of her students. Later on, however, she married that young student. Yesterday&rsquo;s ruling must be addressed urgently because what could and, I am sure, will happen is wide open now. I take the Senator&rsquo;s point and I note the Minister said he was reviewing the ruling with urgency and would act accordingly. Everybody is interested in what has happened and is determined that there should be a new decision on the matter.</P>
    <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole referred to the link between a Christian Brother at the redress board and his work with the Marino Institute. We all want to see young people who have been abused in reformatories and schools receiving redress. Nonetheless, I have always been worried that an entire order of nuns or brothers would be included, as if all of them had been acting in a nefarious fashion. It is wrong to do so because, while wrong things were done by some members of the clergy, we should not cloud every priest, brother or nun with the same bad aura, as if they had all been involved. We have dealt with the matter through redress boards and in other ways. In addition, the Taoiseach has issued an apology <Col N="1486"/>in this regard. It is a pity that so much good work by the religious is overlooked. Without their contribution, so many people would not have received an education and a good start in life, when free schooling was not available. The good work of the clergy can be brushed to one side, while the &ldquo;baddies&rdquo; are highlighted all the time. Redress must come about, however.</P>
    <P>I heard what this particular Christian Brother said quite clearly. He did not say that everybody who went to the redress board did so for financial gain, but said there was an element who did. I do not know enough about the matter to know if that was so. For some time, I have felt a great sense of unease about cloaking everybody in the same bad aura.</P>
    <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole also referred to the plebiscite in Dingle on which there were interesting developments at the weekend. The plebiscite will be held but on the &ldquo;Politics Programme&rdquo; the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, said he understood Senator O&rsquo;Toole had tabled an amendment to a Bill. The Minister did not refer to Senator Coghlan&rsquo;s Bill but said he wanted the amendment to be moved so that he could discuss it in this House. I suppose we must await the outcome of the plebiscite before we can move further on that matter but as soon as it emerges we should do so.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan asked about the priorities of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. He also wants the Taoiseach to amend his website to state that James Connolly founded the Labour Party, which he did indeed. I will mention that to the Taoiseach.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>He is good at correcting the record at present, so he is in the humour for it.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; spoke about equity and fairness in dealing with the Christian Brothers. He also referred to the need for an independent public inquiry into the Pat Finucane case, particularly in view of the noted collusion of British forces therein.</P>
    <P>Senator Finucane got a great run on Saturday afternoon, which was as good as any we have seen.</P>
   </Speaker>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Finucane has done well and seems to have had a good time. He wants the Minister to attend the House. As the Cathaoirleach wisely said, his contribution was based on <Col N="1487"/>having a debate on what sporting events should be free to air.</P>
    <P>Senator Glynn mentioned the Supreme Court ruling and asked if it meant that certain people would be removed from the sex offenders register. I did not read that in the Supreme Court ruling but it is a hidden danger and the Senator is right in that respect. He also sought a debate on knife crime. It was announced on the BBC this morning that there will be a five-week amnesty in England and Wales during which knives can be handed in without prosecution. If the Minister attends the House I do not know whether we can have an omnibus debate but we do want him to talk about the Supreme Court ruling, which is important.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris mentioned the Finucane inquiry and the report on school bullying, which was published last week. It was quite terrifying because such bullying was seen to be based on homophobic attacks. That matter should certainly be addressed through a debate on the report.</P>
    <P>Senator O&rsquo;Brien asked when the family of Patrick Joe Walsh would receive the report on his death. As I understand it, the T&aacute;naiste is studying the report, which will then go to the family. Obviously, they want it urgently and I can understand that.</P>
    <P>Senator Coghlan mentioned the plebiscite in Dingle, the result of which will go to the Minister and then the Senator&rsquo;s Bill will come into play. We would be keen to have the Bill debated here. I suppose we will await the result of the plebiscite.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Leader accept the Bill?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Mooney referred to the death of one of the Birmingham Six, Richard McIlkenny. He also raised the INTO campaign whereby children were sent home with a letter to their parents. I have vivid memories of a particular circular which every child in the land received to take home. I do not remember complaining about it. Given that I was the Minister involved, when my second child came home with the letter, I was not going to kick up about it. In a way, the child is just bringing the letter from teacher to Mammy or Daddy. It is a good way of getting the propaganda out. It is a good case and I would not get too worked up about it. Class sizes are important but sending a child with a letter to his or her parents is an age-old means of communication. The Senator called for a debate on class sizes.</P>
    <P>Senator Tuffy asked for legislation to be introduced as quickly as possible to close the legal loophole arising from the court decision. She made the point that we risk putting children in danger and, therefore, letting them down.</P>
    <P>Senator Jim Walsh supported Senator &Oacute;<?oasys _jy ?><?oasys _dc28- ?>Murch&uacute; with regard to the Finucane case. Perhaps<?oasys _dc0- ?> there is a case to be made for a motion to be <Col N="1488"/>signed by all Senators on the matter. The Senator also agreed with Senator Ryan on his interpretation of the Dingle issue and suggested that if the people of Dingle want to keep the English name of the town, it should not be a Gaeltacht area.</P>
    <P>Senator Feighan referred to the local authorities. The Senator must often have made a case for rent subsidy for a needy person given that he deals with such cases all the time. However, the local housing officer in a local authority, be it a town or county council, must now sign that form before it goes to the health board office, which pays the subsidy. The housing officer must attest to the fact that the man, woman or couple are on a housing list and living at the stated address. There is involvement by the local authority.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FrankFeighan"><NameTxt>Mr. Feighan</NameTxt>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator referred to the Comptroller and Auditor General. I constantly seek rent subsidy for needy people, as does the Senator if he is doing his job &mdash; I am sure he will be very successful. We cannot on the one hand regret what has emerged in the figures and on the other not accept we are part of the issue through seeking to make representations.</P>

	<P>Senator Maurice Hayes supported the call for a proper inquiry into the Finucane murder.</P>
    <P>Senator Coonan referred to Belarus. While I have come across the problem to which he refers, the authorities in Belarus and adjoining countries are clamping down heavily as part of the rights they have acquired as emerging democracies. I know of the sad case of a couple who took a Belarussian child for three months every year but who can no longer have him visit because the authorities will not let him travel. They have become very punitive in that regard.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelCoonan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coonan</NameTxt>

    <P>Senator Coonan also sought a debate on agriculture and asked the Minister, Deputy Coughlan, to come to the House. The Senator suggested that work carried out under the nitrates directive should be index linked, a point put to me at the weekend. The Senator is correct.</P>

    <P>Senator Callanan rallied to the Minister&rsquo;s cause &mdash; good for him. He suggested there should be a standard set of development charges.

  <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">This Bill passed all Stages in the D&aacute;il following a constructive and wide-ranging debate. We were happy to take on board a number of Opposition amendments where we felt they made genuine improvements to the Bill.</P>
    <P>In overall terms, the Bill provides a framework within which there is the flexibility to adapt and <Col N="1490"/>use different migration policy instruments to respond to changes in the economy and labour market as they arise. Flexibility is the key to this legislative framework. The Bill has two key objectives. First, it puts in place a statutory foundation which will be built upon to implement an active and managed economic migration policy. The three pillars of this employment permit policy will be green cards, an intra-company transfer scheme and a revised work permits system. Second, it provides a number of new and important protections for migrant workers in the Irish labour force. I intend to describe the context for the Bill, I will then discuss its primary objectives and I will conclude by describing the sections of the Bill in detail.</P>
    <P Just="Left">As regards context, economic migration policy must be responsive to different stages of economic development and labour market conditions. Our own recent experience teaches us this lesson. Ireland has moved from being a country of emigration to one of immigration in a remarkably short period. In 1986 the unemployment rates was over 17% and almost 45,000 people were emigrating annually. Twenty years later the Irish economy has experienced a major reversal in fortunes. The economy continues to perform strongly. Economic growth of approximately 4.6% is projected for this year and strong growth is also expected for 2007. In consequence, total employment is projected to rise by over 3%, or 60,000, this year, while unemployment will be at a low rate of 4.3%.</P>
    <P Just="Left">We cannot be complacent. We must quickly develop an innovation-driven, knowledge-based economy if we are to continue to compete in the global marketplace. This means that we need to upskill our workforce. Our skills policy will be predicated, first, on upskilling our resident workforce; second, on maximising the potential of EEA nationals to fill our skills deficits; and, third, on the introduction of a new green card and revised work permit system for non-EEA nationals to fill strategic high skills deficits which cannot otherwise be resolved. Our buoyant employment market has attracted workers from abroad. We now have significant inward migration made up of returning Irish nationals, workers from the European Economic Area &mdash; including the new accession states, non-EEA nationals which are the subject of this Bill, and considerable numbers of students. Most of those coming to Ireland to work in the past two years have been from the new EU member states.</P>
    <P>On 1 May 2004 Ireland fully opened its labour market to the nationals of these new EU states. Since then nationals of these states have been free to come to Ireland to work or reside without restriction or prior permission. They may change employment as circumstances or opportunities arise. The only requirement for entry into the labour market is the need to arrange a personal public service or PPS number for social insurance purposes. This is a universal requirement and <Col N="1491"/>applies to Irish and non-national people working in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Since May 2004 more than 200,000 PPS numbers have been issued to EU-ten nationals and Revenue data indicate that approximately 70% of them may have participated in our labour market at some stage. Many will have come to work in Ireland for a while before going home again. This influx from the new accession states has had a major impact on the number of work permits being granted. The number of new work permits issued has fallen from close to 22,000 in 2003 to just less than 7,400 last year. There would also have been renewals of permits.</P>
    <P>Employers source most of their labour requirements from within the enlarged European Union. In general, a sufficient pool of potential labour exists within the European Economic Area to meet Ireland&rsquo;s requirements for low skilled jobs but not all of our high skills needs can be met from this source.</P>
    <P>The report published by the expert group on future skills needs and Forf&aacute;s in October 2005, entitled Skills Needs in the Irish Economy: the Role of Migration, identified sectors where the skills needs of our economy would not be met from within Ireland or the European Economic Area. These sectors include information and communications technology, health care, construction, financial services, engineering, pharmaceutical and biotechnology.</P>
    <P>In this context, the Bill puts in place a statutory framework within which a responsive, managed and skills-based immigration policy can be implemented. Economic migration policy for nationals from outside the EEA will be vacancy-driven rather than based on quotas or points. That means that the core of the policy is the offer of a job. It will be transparent and have the potential to react to changing labour market conditions. It will provide protections for migrant workers from potential abuse by unscrupulous employers.</P>
    <P>I will outline the main features of the new green card and work permit arrangements. The green card system will be for occupations where there are high level or strategic skills shortages. The key features of this new green card system will be as follows. Where the annual salary, excluding bonuses, on offer is in excess of &euro;60,000, which is twice the average industrial wage, the green card will be available for an extensive list of occupations. In effect, all occupations except those which would not be in the national interest offering this level of remuneration will benefit from this valuable concession. The new green card arrangements will comprise immediate family reunification and immediate unrestricted access to employment for spouses and normally a pathway to permanent residency after two years. Green cards will also be available in the annual salary range from &euro;30,000 to &euro;60,000, which is between the average industrial <Col N="1492"/>wage and twice that level, for a restricted number of strategically important occupations where we are experiencing skills shortages. These occupations will be identified taking into account the advice of the expert group and will be reviewed on a regular basis. The new green card system will ensure that Ireland can attract and retain the skilled personnel needed to quickly move our economy to one in line with the vision of the enterprise strategy group&rsquo;s report.</P>
    <P>The revised work permit system will have the following features. Work permits would have to be applied for in respect of those occupations in the annual salary range from &euro;30,000 to &euro;60,000 for which green cards will not be issued and a limited number of occupations below an annual salary of &euro;30,000 where there are significant labour shortages; these occupations will be identified after taking the advice of the expert group. In both cases a labour market test, including advertisements in the national and-or local press, showing that the positions could not be filled from within the EEA, will need to be met. Work permits will be granted first for a period of two years, and then for a further period of three years. The fee will be the same as now &mdash; &euro;500 per annum; in other words, &euro;1,000 for the first two-year period and &euro;1,500 for the following three year period.</P>
    <P>The intra-company transfer scheme will also be re-established on a formaI basis under the new employment permit system. This scheme allows for temporary key management transfers from overseas associate or affiliate companies to their Irish branches or headquarters. This scheme of permitting these transfers, which may be for up to five years, will align our system with current best international practice in this regard.</P>
    <P>Another key objective of the Bill is to strengthen the protections for migrant workers. On application by either employer or employee, the green card or work permit will be granted to the employee; and the permit will contain a statement of the entitlements of the migrant worker including their remuneration, their right to change employers, and any deductions for board and accommodation. It will be accompanied by a summary of the principal employment rights of the employee. An employer who contravenes any of the provisions of the Bill is guilty of an offence and may be liable for a fine of &euro;5,000 up to &euro;50,000 and-or imprisonment for a period from 12 months up to five years. I acknowledge the welcome which these provisions received in the D&aacute;il.</P>
    <P Just="Left">Section 1 provides definitions for certain terms used throughout the Bill. In addition, subsections (2) and (3) address the circumstances under which a recognised employment agency enters into a contract with a person to work or perform a service for a third party. Employment agencies may not apply for an employment permits on behalf of a third party. Members will no doubt be pleased to note that the more appropriate term <Col N="1493"/>&ldquo;foreign national&rdquo; has replaced &ldquo;non-national&rdquo; in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Sections 2 and 3 amend section 2 of the Employment Permits Act 2003 to allow the employment of foreign nationals in accordance with the provisions of section 7. An amendment was introduced on Committee Stage which placed the duty on a primary contractor using sub-contractors who in turn employ non-EEA workers to perform a task or render a service to ensure that such workers are permitted to work in the State under the employment permit arrangements.</P>
    <P>Sections 4 to 6 state the various conditions under which an application for an employment permit may be made and the information which must be provided. Section 4 provides for the making of an application and outlines the four categories of persons who may apply for an employment permit under this Act &mdash; an employer in the State, a foreign national, a foreign contractual service supplier, and any other person party to the employment of a foreign national in the State.</P>
    <P>Section 5 provides that all employment permits are granted to the foreign national employee, irrespective of who is the applicant. This is one of the more significant changes that the Bill proposes. Work permits are currently issued to the employer. Granting them to the employee will increase the power of migrant workers in the employment relationship.</P>
    <P>Section 6 specifies the information to be provided in an application for a permit by an employer. The information which is required mirrors existing specifications with regard to work permit applications. It ensures that the proposed candidate has the necessary skills qualifications and-or experience for the position and that the position is of a nature that would require to be filled by a foreign national.</P>
    <P>Section 7 specifies the information to be provided in an application for a permit by a foreign national, that is, in applications for green cards by foreign national employees. This information is currently required to be provided by applicants for work visa or work authorisation.</P>
    <P>Section 8 provides for the granting of employment permits by the Minister. This is a fundamental part of the employment permit process, which until now has not been provided for in legislation. It provides for the granting by regulation of permits of unlimited duration to foreign national applicants &mdash; that is, it will provide for the introduction of the new green card system.</P>
    <P>Section 9 provides for the issuing of employment permits granted under section 7 and for particular information to be stated on the permit. An employment permit granted under section 7 shall be issued to the foreign national employee. Where the application was made by the employer a copy of the permit will be issued to them. Information relating to the rights and entitlements of the migrant worker, including their remuneration and a statement of the national minimum wage, the right to change employers and the prohib<Col N="1494"/>itions on deductions from remuneration and retention of personal documents will be stated on the work permit.</P>
    <P>Section 10 is designed to meet our EU treaty &ldquo;Community preference&rdquo; obligations not to grant an employment permit unless it has been offered to EU nationals first. Section 11 stipulates further conditions for consideration when granting of work permits, including ascertaining the legitimacy of applications for employment permits, the economic policy of the Government at the time and the terms of any regulations in force regarding the granting of employment permits.</P>
    <P>Section 12 outlines the conditions for refusal to grant an employment permit and the procedures to be applied when an application has been refused. Section 13 provides for review procedures in the case of a decision to refuse to grant an employment permit under section 12. Section 14 deals with the making of regulations governing the granting and renewal of employment permits, including limiting the number of permits granted, the categories of employment and qualifications or skills and the period covered by the permit. This section together with section 15 enables the Minister to monitor and adjust the employment permits system in line with prevailing economic conditions.</P>
    <P>Section 15 specifies the criteria that must be observed when making regulations under section 14. These criteria relate to economic and social development and competitiveness in the State.</P>
    <P>Section 16 lays down the conditions under which the Minister may revoke an employment permit and sets out the conditions that determine at what stage the revocation will take place. Section 17 provides the conditions under which a decision to revoke an employment permit may be submitted to the Minister for review. If the decision to revoke an employment permit is cancelled, the period for which the permit ceased to be valid is disregarded.</P>
    <P>Sections 18 and 19 describe various misuses of employment permits that are prohibited and provide that persons in contradiction of these provisions are guilty of an offence. Such misuses include forgery and fraudulent use or alteration of employment permits, or illegal transfer of permits. Section 20 provides for the renewal of employment permits in various circumstances. A significant aspect of this section is its provision to allow the renewal by regulation of permits of unlimited duration. This in effect allows the provision of permanent residency for the foreign nationals concerned. Applicants must confirm they have complied with the terms of the permit and of this Act up to the point of application for renewal, if deemed necessary. As is the present practice, it is not necessary for them to undertake a labour market test to ensure the skills deemed necessary for the employment cannot be sourced locally. Section 21 allows for the cessation and reinstatement of employment permits in line with orders made under the Immigration Act 1999.</P><Col N="1495"/>
    <P>Section 22 provides for the appointment and conditions of officers authorised for the purposes of the Act. In practice, the Garda National Immigration Bureau enforces the law on illegal working. The labour inspectorate of my Department has responsibility for the monitoring and enforcement of the rights, protections and entitlements under the employment protection legislation.</P>
    <P>Section 23 provides additional statutory protection for migrant workers, which include the prohibition on employers either deducting recruitment expenses from remuneration or from retaining workers&rsquo; personal documents, including passports. Any employer or person acting on his or her behalf, who contravenes any of the provisions of this section, is guilty of an offence.</P>
    <P Just="Left">Section 24 provides for the circumstances pertaining to the surrender of an employment permit. The holder is obliged to return the permit to my Department within four weeks of the date the employment ceased. Section 25 relates to the provision of false or misleading information, which is an offence. Section 26 was introduced on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il. It prohibits an employer penalising an employee for making a complaint to a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or the Minister that a provision of the Act of 2003 or this Act is not being complied with, giving evidence in any proceedings under the Act of 2003 or this Act, or giving notice of his or her intention to do any of these things.</P>
    <P>Section 27 obliges employers to retain, make available and furnish to an authorised officer if requested, books, records and accounts concerning a foreign national employee. A person who contravenes this section is guilty of an offence.</P>
    <P>Section 28 provides for the establishment and maintenance of a register of employment permits granted under the Act. This information is already recorded by my Department. Sections 29 and 30 enable the Minister to make regulations to govern the procedures with regard to the application and renewal of an employment permit and on other issues referred to in the Act. Section 30 provides for the laying before the Houses of the Oireachtas of regulations made under section 14. These sections deal primarily with administrative matters.</P>
    <P>Section 31 provides for the serving of notices and their requirements. Section 32 provides for penalties and proceedings with regard to offences incurred under this Act. On conviction for an offence under this Act, a person may be liable for a fine from &euro;5,000 up to &euro;50,000 and-or imprisonment for a period from 12 months up to five years. Section 33 qualifies section 32 by setting out a standard provision on offences by corporate bodies and places responsibility for such offences on individuals where appropriate.</P>
    <P>Section 34 was introduced on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il and has the effect that if an immigration officer or an authorised officer under this Act observes a person performing a task consist<Col N="1496"/>ent with the person being employed in that workplace, then unless the contrary can be proved, that person is deemed to be so employed. Section 35 was also introduced on Committee Stage. It provides for the giving of evidence through a live television link in any proceedings for an offence under the Act.</P>
    <P>Sections 36 to 41 provide for the delegation of certain functions to officers, data exchange with other Departments, transitional arrangements for permits currently in force, deletes the definition of non-national and substitutes foreign national in the 2003 Act, provides sanction for the expenditure incurred in the implementation of this Act and the preliminaries common to all legislation.</P>
    <P>By means of Schedule 1, the Minister may refuse to grant an employment permit if an offence is committed under any of the Acts listed in this Schedule. Schedule 2 permits an employee to complain to a rights commissioner regarding breaches of this Act and the 2003 Act.</P>
    <P>I commend the legislation to the House. It is balanced and strategic and is particularly important in terms of the development of the Irish economy. For the first time it puts on a statutory basis a framework for modern economic migration policy. A constructive debate was held on the legislation in the other House and the Bill was amended in accordance with a number of the wishes of D&aacute;il Members. It therefore arrives in this House as a stronger, enhanced Bill. I look forward to the debate which will now ensue.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House, and welcome his remarks generally, particularly what he said about the raft of amendments submitted by my colleague, Deputy Hogan, in the D&aacute;il, which the Minister accepted on Report Stage. Accordingly we will be accepting the Bill at this point.</P>
    <P>The country&rsquo;s immigration system has been something of a shambles and I welcome what the Minister said about providing a proper framework. Immigration is the greatest social challenge we face. We all accept we need foreign workers. We benefit from them, and our society is richer for their presence. I particularly welcome the Minister&rsquo;s assertion that the term &ldquo;foreign national&rdquo; is much more appropriate than &ldquo;non-national&rdquo;. In any event, immigration is a challenge we must face, and please God, will do so successfully as a country.</P>
    <P Just="Left">It is worth reflecting on the statistical analysis of Mr. Aidan Punch of the Central Statistics Office, who commented that the republic&rsquo;s population is expected to jump from the current level of just over 4 million people to 5.5 million by 2030. He went on to say in his speech to the Magill summer school that births are projected to average around 63,300 annually, with deaths averaging 32,400, leading to an annual natural increase in population of 30,900. However, migration is projected to differ markedly from <Col N="1497"/>that experienced in the past. In short, we have a job to do.</P>
    <P Just="Left">Upon publication on the Bill, the Minister stated with regard to work permits that the legislation will enable the Minister every two years to set the maximum number of employment permits to be issued both in total and by sector to identify the skills and qualifications required for the grant of a permit and to identify the categories of employment which may or may not be subject to the granting of permits. That is entirely right, and we welcome the provision. I also welcome the provisions in the Bill for migrant protection. The shocking revelations at Gama and Irish Ferries &mdash; which it seems considered &euro;1 an hour a fair and equitable wage &mdash; have become the lightning rods for criticism of a modern Irish society that increasingly knows the price of everything and the value of nothing. However, I worry that while we are creating more law, we may be doing nothing about order. We have already witnessed this year flagrant breaches of existing laws designed to protect Irish and non-Irish workers. In Gama Construction&rsquo;s offices in Santry in North Dublin, ingenious schemes were cooked up to pay those unfortunate workers half nothing while they built the country, and nothing was done. Not one individual has been punished for the disgraceful treatment of an Irish Ferries employee who had to go to the Labour Court to get her thoroughly deserved &euro;25,000 compensation from Irish Ferries, whose status as the pariah of Irish industrial relations solidifies with every passing day.</P>
    <P>Now, the Minister comes to us with more legislation but tells us little of how it will be enforced. While I broadly accept what he says, I would like to know what extra resources will be made available to the labour inspectorate and other bodies which will enforce the legislation, how the Department intends to communicate these new rights to migrant workers and how the Minister intends to co-operate with foreign embassies in ensuring these rights are translated into meaningful improvements for migrant workers upon entry to this country.</P>
    <P>The Government does not have a good track record when it comes to cross-cutting initiatives. If it did, this Bill would have been announced as part of a package of measures promoted jointly by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Department of Education and Science and the Department of Foreign Affairs. Needless to say, one arm of Government often does not know what the other is doing. It would be good if the Minister would answer the questions I have asked.</P>
    <P>The Minister will be aware that our international reputation took another hit last month when the Polish edition of<i> Newsweek</i> reported that Ireland was a &ldquo;living hell&rdquo; for many Poles, who arrived expecting to be able to pick and choose jobs and instead found themselves sleeping rough and living on charity. The Polish <Col N="1498"/>Embassy has suggested that approximately 10,000 Poles living in this country are experiencing difficulty. Astoundingly, it is not just the &ldquo;pinkos&rdquo;, as the former Minister for Finance would have called them, who have been calling on the Government to get the lead out on this issue. No more conservative body than IBEC has been calling for a proper immigration and green card system. In incurring the wrath of CORI and IBEC, the Government seems to have mastered the art of pleasing none of the people none of the time.</P>
    <P>This Bill must work effectively. I hope the Minister is willing to be flexible on Committee Stage. I have put down few amendments because I accept what the Minister said about amendments in the Lower House. Without foreign labour, our roads will not be built, our service industries will collapse and our way of life will suffer. I am sure the Minister accepts that. That flow of foreign labour will quickly find somewhere else to go if we gain a reputation for exploitation.</P>
    <P>Why does the Bill make no reference to the spouses and families of the tens of thousands of workers who will be allowed to come here? This is a glaring omission. We cannot seriously hope to attract enough people of a high enough calibre if we are not willing to allow their families avail of the same rights. By failing to allow families, as opposed to individuals, apply for these green cards, we severely limit our chances of attracting quality candidates. More importantly, perhaps, we are consigning those who do not come with their families to a life of misery.</P>
    <P>It is amazing that this opportunity has been missed. Perhaps it is symptomatic of the Government&rsquo;s uncaring approach to this problem &mdash; do the least amount possible for the least number. These people do not vote so there might be an attitude that they do not matter.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, we are broadly at one with the Minister on this issue. We will support the Bill on Second Stage. We must be up-front and honest in establishing the economic case for immigration, setting a level and establishing and enforcing a sensible, compassionate immigration policy that will allow the engine of the economy to continue to run. I sincerely hope the Minister agrees.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for personally bringing this Bill before the House. He will have the full co-operation of all sides of the House in making the Bill law as quickly as possible. Hopefully, Committee and Report Stages will be completed next week. It is important legislation.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister on bringing this progressive Bill forward and am delighted to have an opportunity to speak on it. Our economic growth has been fuelled in no small part by the influx of workers from around the world. The Government&rsquo;s progressive strategy was demonstrated by its brave decision to allow workers from the new EU member states to live and work in Ireland. <Col N="1499"/>This decision has benefited not only our economy but also our society in terms of the diversity one sees in every town in the country.</P>
    <P>I had some reservations about that policy at the time because I feared a greater influx than actually occurred. The Government made a strategic decision and I believe the new members of the European Union appreciate our gesture. It has benefited us economically and I am sure the Minister will discover, in the context of his work on trade issues, that he will face an open door in the new member states. The Government must do everything in its power to make it easier for hard working, honest people to come to Ireland and use their skills. These people come to Ireland not to sponge off our workforce but to make a better life for themselves and their families. These are qualities which I and everybody throughout the country admire.</P>
    <P Just="Left">It is interesting to reflect that what is happening now in our economy could not have been foreseen 20 years ago. At that time, Ireland was providing employees for Britain and other countries. Irish people contributed greatly to the building of Britain and the United States of America. Our work is known throughout the world. I am the youngest in a family of eight and five members of my family are working in both Britain and the United States. That is an indication of what happened to families in the 1940s and 1950s. There was huge emigration. It was a hardship for families to part. There was almost no telephone service and certainly no mobile phones. It was a difficult time for Irish families.</P>
    <P>It is wonderful, therefore, that the Minister and the Government are giving an opportunity to people from abroad to come to Ireland and secure employment. We are reciprocating what was done for us in Britain and elsewhere. In fairness, Britain was good to our workers, although our workers were equally good for that country because they built its economy in all industrial sectors, particularly nursing, services and the car industry. In the United States, there are 40 million people of Irish descent. In every part of the United States there are Irish people who have made a major contribution to that country.</P>
    <P>There have been a number of scandals about the under-payment of immigrant workers in Ireland. It is clear that employment rights and permits must be tailor made to suit Government policy. When workers such as the Turkish construction workers employed by Gama, to take just one example, are not receiving fair reward for the contribution they make to our economy and society, something is amiss. This Bill will resolve that problem. It will empower the workers who are essential for our sustained economic growth.</P>
    <P>The ESRI and other organisations have pointed to the need for migrant labour to meet the workforce demands of our buoyant economy. Immigration will be essential if we are to maintain the economy while providing quality support <Col N="1500"/>for our increasing retired population. The existing employment permits legislation, which was introduced in 2003, has been overtaken by the massive surge in immigration. The policy of requiring employers to apply for work permits on behalf of their employees often resulted in immigrant workers feeling powerless and beholden to their employers.</P>
    <P Just="Left">This issue has been raised many times and the Minister has decided to resolve it in an intelligent way. The Department has drafted an excellent Bill and the debate on it in the D&aacute;il was most constructive. I commend the Minister for accepting well thought out amendments that are beneficial. We are all in this situation together. It affects Ireland incorporated. Every Member of the House would prefer to have an improved situation.</P>
    <P>The current situation is extraordinary. The employer has control over the employee. There have been many examples of people who were controlled in terms of the houses they rented and the services that were provided for them. They had no recourse to moving employment. The Bill gives them this opportunity, which tremendously empowers them.</P>
    <P>There is great loyalty among those workers. I have seen them in Roscommon where they work in Kepak in Athleague, Hannons Poultry and other industries. They are mainly Brazilian and are highly qualified in that sector. They have made a contribution to the economy. No Irish person has complained to me that they could not get a job in those industries. This is because they are simply not interested in those jobs and are not prepared to take them.</P>
    <P>This is also probably due to our education system. The Minister, as a former Minister for Education and Science, will recall the contribution he made to the system, particularly in primary schools with the provision of computers. Although Ireland missed the industrial revolution, it is at the cutting edge of the knowledge-based information and communications technology revolution. Our young people, the best-educated workforce in the history of State, are attracted to working in this field. Most young people go on to third level education and the Government has recognised it must develop fourth level education.</P>
   <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
    <P>The introduction of free second level education by Donogh O&rsquo;Malley was the greatest innovative policy in the history of the State. Senator Norris and I visited Kenya several weeks ago. Education is much sought after there and is provided by Irish missionaries. I was astounded that second level education must be paid for by people who are impoverished. Due to drought and the subsequent loss of cattle herds, many people cannot pay fees for secondary education. The lack of access to education is one of the reasons why Kenya and other African countries are being held back.</P><Col N="1501"/>
    <P>The introduction of free second level education, the brainchild of the Lemass Government, was an innovative policy. Before then, it was an economic burden for people to send their children to secondary school. It was an even greater burden to send children on to university. Many intelligent children were deprived due to the economic situation. Free second level education was the greatest investment by the State which is now yielding results. The economic results mean the Minister has had to introduce the Bill because Ireland needs more skilled workers than it can provide itself. One lesson that other countries can learn from our experience is that the provision of free education was the largest contributory factor to the Celtic tiger.</P>
    <P>Abuse of the immigration system allowed groups of employers to undercut those who play by the rules. The Irish workforce stands with the best in the world. No Irish worker needs fear competition from immigrants once the playing field is level. The Employment Permits Bill will level the playing field. The Bill will stand the test of time as it is well crafted. I welcome the provision to ensure employment permits will in future be issued to the employee. The permit will state the certain rights and entitlements of the worker concerned and will prohibit an employer holding on to an employee&rsquo;s personal documents. The key to a fair workplace is the empowerment of employees. The Government has an admirable record when it comes to protecting workers&rsquo; rights. I am pleased to see this protection extending to immigrant workers.</P>
    <P>I want the Government to work to a position where Ireland can attract workers from all over the world, a scenario where we can fill jobs with the best people regardless from where they come. Such a scenario would benefit those born in Ireland as much as it would benefit those who, as the national anthem states, &ldquo;come from a land beyond the waves, sworn to be free&rdquo;. In rural areas, it is difficult to attract Irish people to work in the agrifood sector. It is mainly people from abroad who now work in it. Immigrant workers have contributed greatly to dramatic changes in rural areas. The atmosphere in towns such as Roscommon has been greatly enhanced by the new workers, whether they are Polish, Latvian or Brazilian.</P>
    <P>I note the Government&rsquo;s concern with workers from the new EU applicant states coming to Ireland and that the strategy must be worked out when their accession occurs. I welcome this cautious approach because there must be some form of regulation for workers coming from those states to Ireland. The skills should fit the available jobs. If, for example, there is shortage of builders, then it should be addressed first. An excess number of permits awarded for a particular skill should not be allowed.</P>
    <P>My family has been in the stonemasonry trade for generations. Polish stonemasons now share their skills with their Irish counterparts. One can <Col N="1502"/>see the slight variations in stonework designs, which all adds to society. In rural areas, there is a great harmony between the Irish and immigrants. Towns, like Roscommon, are booming because of the new influx of immigrants. There was a time when none of the major supermarkets was located in Roscommon, now all the main ones are.</P>
    <P>It is a great time to be in politics. In the 1980s when there were great economic difficulties, we took hard decisions and many politicians suffered electorally. The right decisions were made and the results are now evident. I wish the Administration great success and hope it is returned to power. Members should not care about the recent opinion poll because that was just a day in the life. When people realise they should not risk the future, they will vote the Fianna F&aacute;il-Progressive Democrats back into Government.</P>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome most of the timely provisions in the Bill. I have raised as a humanitarian matter the plight of migrant workers. I remember seeing two unfortunate young Turkish lads in floods of tears on Butt Bridge. They had come to Ireland on the understanding they had jobs and work permits. When they arrived, they discovered they were defrauded and viciously exploited by Irish employers. Without enough money to get home, they were forced to live on credit and in hostels. The Minister will recall the plight of some Polish workers in Donegal, who were promised jobs by a local builder but who left them high and dry. I am glad traditional Irish hospitality came into play. The woman, in whose guesthouse they were staying, went on the airwaves outlining their cases and they managed to get other jobs.</P>
    <P>These types of situations have not really gone away. I was horrified by the recent situation at Holles Street Hospital where nurses from the Philippines came to work on agreed contracts. Those contracts were welshed on and their employment conditions changed with a halving of their income. Some were bullied into accepting these changes. This is one of the principal medical institutions in the State. I am glad the master of the hospital has apologised for it.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the work of Deputy Joe Higgins. Without his incisive intervention in the <Col N="1503"/>case of a group of Turkish workers in the construction industry, we still would have a difficult situation. Several of the issues clearly highlighted in that case, the proper keeping of records and the issuing of a work permit to the worker, are addressed in the Bill. It used to be the case that the employer had possession of the worker&rsquo;s work permit. The Bill provides for the employer or the employee to apply for the permit. Will the Minister explain why the employer should be included in this process? The permit should be the entitlement and the property of the individual worker.</P>
    <P>The State retains an interest in the work permit and the right to have it returned. There is also some degree of a fee to be paid for it. I presume the &euro;500 charge for the permit is cash up-front. That is a large sum of money for those workers coming from economically deprived areas, particularly when they must make other financial arrangements for accommodation and so forth. I assume the fee applies to those on lower wages who receive a work permit rather those on the green card. That introduces a class system for professionals such as doctors and those working at the cutting edge of science.</P>
    <P>We are happy to take them and place them at an advantage because of our own requirements. That is acting clearly out of self interest, which is sometimes justifiable, but I am concerned about the creation of a two-tier system and class structure in what we are continually told is a classless republic in which all children of the nation are treated equally.</P>
    <P>This is a new situation for people as long in the tooth as me. I remember when unemployment was the principal problem in this country. Senator Leyden referred to our visit to Kenya, where he visited many projects and I saw a few, and the situation in Nairobi is one of 80% unemployment. That was the level of unemployment in the area of Dublin I moved into during the late 1970s. It is horrifying but true that there was 85% unemployment in the north inner city. That is largely gone now and we are having difficulty filling jobs in key economic sectors and are looking abroad for workers.</P>
    <P>This is an unusual situation that is positive in some ways but that also contains dangers. If we do not treat these people reasonably and decently, they will treat us in the same mercenary fashion we treat them and the minute they have made enough loot to buy a kiosk wherever they came from, they will leave and, very reasonably, feel they have no obligation to us and no reason to do other than leave us high and dry.</P>
    <P>Once again there is a difference. The professional people are given immediate opportunities to reunite their families but those on the lower economic scale are not. I do not like that. I am an egalitarian and if we believe in the principle of family unity it should not be related to income unless there are good reasons. I cannot <Col N="1504"/>imagine what those reasons are and I do not think they can be simply economic because someone on &euro;30,000, with the supports we have in this country, could afford to maintain a family.</P>
    <P>Often in the case of nursing and medical staff, the spouse is also engaged in this line of work and could quite happily come here. I personally know a number of Filipino nurses and they are thoroughly disillusioned with this country. The Minister is a former Minister for Health and Children and will be aware of this fact. They have given extraordinary service in the health area, where the wages and conditions are not great, and often they are not given the facility to reunite with their families. This must be examined if we want these people to make their talents available.</P>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Those on work visa applications, including in the health, technology and construction professional areas, form a separate category from those on work permits. They are allowed to bring their spouses to Ireland. The Bill also deals with them.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>That is the sort of information I welcome because my information is anecdotal and if the situation has improved, I welcome it.</P>
    <P>Senator Leyden referred to the situation in Kenya. It is a country that must be beautiful in certain areas but the economic situation is horrendous. Many people want to leave and do not want to return. One of the problems arising from this is sophisticated and complex. We are cherry picking in areas such as health care, information and communications technology, construction, financial services, engineering and pharmaceutical biotechnology, skills which are badly needed in these poorer countries. We are impoverishing these people by removing their skills from their native environment. I acknowledge the difficulty that if we do not take them, someone else will, but it demonstrates the lack of balance. For that reason, I hesitate about this discriminatory idea of people earning over &euro;60,000 enjoying immediate family reunification provisions when lower paid workers do not have the same access.</P>
    <P>The Minister&rsquo;s explanation of the Bill was useful and I support much of it, such as the intercompany transfer scheme that brings us into line with the global economy. I do not see why the employer should have any right to apply for the employee&rsquo;s work permit. If the employee is concerned about it, he or she should be able to tell the employer to apply for it. I like the idea that the permit contains a statement of entitlements, including remuneration, and acknowledges in clear print a person&rsquo;s right to change employer. <Col N="1505"/>Often people felt as if they were bonded labourers.</P>
    <P>Could there be a provision to deal with driving? A high proportion of accidents are caused by migrant workers. There should be a booklet made available to them containing the rules of the road and advice about where to get driving lessons. It might save some lives. I am not saying migrant workers are worse drivers than us but they are driving in unfamiliar circumstances.</P>
    <P>Section 11 gives the Minister the right to vary the conditions for the granting of work permits in line with the economic policy of the Government of the time. The terms of any regulations enforced with regard to the granting of employment permits give power to the Minister and I hope these regulations will be put before the Oireachtas for approval, otherwise I will table an amendment. The ability to vary conditions and requirements for work permits without recourse to the Oireachtas grants a wide power to the Minister.</P>
    <P Just="Left">There are some good sections in the Bill. Section 26 prohibits an employer from penalising an employee who makes complaints to the Garda about mistreatment under this Act. What a terrible prospect. It is a reproach to us that we must introduce this provision because employers did penalise their workers for seeking to establish their rights. I am glad the Government is defending these rights.</P>
    <P>The retention and making available of records is welcome, as is the maintenance of a register of employees. The scandals involving Turkish construction companies where there were no records or tax documents would not have been discovered without Deputy Joe Higgins.</P>
    <P>It is also welcome that there is provision for the giving of evidence by live television link. Sometimes workers who have been badly treated, as we have seen historically, returned to their home country and found it difficult to return here, so this is useful. Permission is also granted under Schedule 2 to an employee to complain to a rights commissioner about breaches of this Act and the 2003 Act, a provision that must be welcomed.</P>
    <P>In broad outline, I strongly support this Bill. Members from all sides have called for it on humanitarian terms. There is a balance in the Bill between a recognition of certain humanitarian elements and a strong element of self interest. It is up to the Minister and his advisors to balance these two elements and ensure that self interest does not overburden the provisions that are meant to take the welfare of the individual worker into account.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House and regard this Bill as enlightened labour legislation, continuing a tradition that goes back to 1946 and which includes the Industrial Relations Act of 1990 and health and safety legis<Col N="1506"/>lation. It is major legislation, for which I congratulate the Minister.</P>
    <P Just="Left">We all remember that in the late 1990s, in the full flush of the Celtic tiger economy, the economic migration and asylum system was somewhat <i>ad hoc</i> and chaotic. I am delighted that we have managed, over the last nine years, to put that area in order, largely speaking. I congratulate the Minister on this excellent Bill.</P>
    <P>An issue that is of wider interest than just employment policy is the use of the term &ldquo;foreign national&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;non-national&rdquo;. That is clearly an enlightened move because &ldquo;non-national&rdquo; could imply that one is referring to stateless persons, which is obviously not the case.</P>
    <P>Along with three other Members of the Oireachtas, who are members of the Committees on Finance and Public Service, and Enterprise and Small Business, I attended an economic conference in Munich earlier this month, which was discussing off-shoring, out-sourcing and migration policies. Speaker after speaker referred to Ireland as an EU country that had got its migration policy broadly right and had benefitted from inward migration. The implication was that some of the larger continental countries had got it wrong and were having great difficulty filling highly-paid posts in sectors where, despite unemployment rates of 11%, there were skills shortages.</P>
    <P>Factors such as our taxation policy, education system, membership of the eurozone and English-speaking population have made Ireland an extremely attractive place in which to do business, which attracts people to the country. Part of the problem 70 years ago was that conditions were more attractive in other countries, including the United States of America and Great Britain, which was why emigration continued. We have reversed that situation, I am glad to say, in the last ten years in particular.</P>
    <P Just="Left">Having made Ireland a very attractive place to do business, we need people who can carry out that business. Members will remember that 20 years ago there were skills shortages in certain areas. The expansion of European Union and the provisions of this legislation give us enormous flexibility. We are no longer forced to rely solely on the people we can train and educate ourselves. I have read supplements and long articles in French newspapers encouraging young graduates to seek employment in Ireland rather than demonstrating on the streets about employment law in France. The legislation will enable us to avoid acute labour shortages.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that the minimum wage will be specified on employment permits. What will happen where there are agreed minimum wage rates for a particular industry or sector? Is it to be understood by those obtaining work permits that such agreed rates will apply to them, rather than just the national statutory minimum wage?</P>
    <P>I agree that the experience of the work permit system to date has been that it was lopsided and <Col N="1507"/>that exploitation undoubtedly took place. People felt vulnerable and dependent and, in that context, I welcome the fact the employees will be given the work permit and will be able to move, at least within the relevant sector, if necessary. That will contribute efficiencies to the whole economy. I also hope the Bill, along with other measures, will contribute to a successful outcome to the current social partnership talks.</P>
    <P>I wish to draw the Minister&rsquo;s attention to an issue of concern. As public representatives, we regularly receive queries regarding employment permits. Sometimes people allow their permits to lapse briefly and encounter problems. They receive draft deportation orders and so forth. I recall, in particular, the case of a South African cook, who was very much appreciated in Tipperary town. He attended an employment conference addressed by the T&aacute;naiste and former Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, in 2000. At that time, which was prior to EU enlargement, the Department was busy recruiting people from other parts of the world. The man was facing a deportation order and found it very difficult to obtain an early response, either from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment or the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, to representations made on the matter. There will always be queries at the edges of the system and I would welcome a more streamlined and prompt response to correspondence or telephone calls.</P>
    <P>I do not accept many of the reservations about the Bill expressed by Senator Norris. With all due respect, we are not talking about the children of the nation but about foreign nationals. Provided it is done in a clear and transparent manner, every country is entitled to make arrangements that accord with its own interests, even if it means differentiating between categories of people. It is also right that the Minister has a degree of flexibility in this area and can adjust the system at the edges according to labour market conditions. I have no difficulty in entrusting that power to him.</P>
    <P>Concerns are expressed about Ireland drawing well-qualified people from countries where they are badly needed. However, there is a positive way of looking at that issue. Such people are gaining valuable work experience and are earning money. In some cases, they are building up a fund which will enable them to set up a business at home. While some will stay here and settle, many people will be here for only a two, three, four or five year period. They will then return home and that will be of benefit to their countries.</P>
    <P>There was some correspondence in the newspapers, especially <i>The Irish Times</i>, suggesting that since we joined the European Union, and especially having regard to the state to which it has got now, we have lost 70% or 80% of our sovereignty. This legislation is a response to that. This is not EU-dictated legislation. It is us decid<Col N="1508"/>ing on the appropriate employment permits regime we want and it clearly differs from some other EU countries. This process appears to be a clear exercise of sovereignty.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on what I consider to be landmark social legislation which I believe will be of great benefit in helping to sustain the prosperity and forward momentum of this economy.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>I, too, welcome the Minister to the Chamber. I am glad this legislation is being implemented. It is important social legislation which has a good economic background. Indeed, the Minister referred to an economic managed framework for employment. Over the past 12 months there was a plethora of cases &mdash; there is a new one every day &mdash; involving the wrong type of employment being given to people from other countries and in particular we heard about the abuses that have been perpetrated. The Minister did his very best in the Gama case but he was unable to get the necessary information to fully address the problem.</P>
    <P>The procedures relating to the application grant and refusal of work permits are clear in this legislation. The Bill allows the Minister to introduce a green card type system for highly skilled migrant workers. That was necessary and perhaps when replying the Minister will indicate if that system has been introduced. In the case of a firm in Moate, a mathematician from India was the only person with the necessary skills for the computing type work available. He was the only one the employer could take on but he was not allowed to bring him into the country. When he eventually got him in his wife was not permitted to join him. It was a nightmare and a quagmire of giving with one hand and taking with the other. With this Bill the Minister will put a proper framework on many conflicting legislative measures governing the employment arena and that is welcome.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides a number of new important protections for migrant employees. I gather the employer, and this is interesting, will continue to request the work permit but it is issued in the name of the employee. Is that correct?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Both.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Giving more to the employees rather than treating them as pieces of baggage employers could take on and then summarily let go without little consultation is welcome. This sensible legislation is an outcome of all that has happened. I am sure it is the wish of the Department officials and the Minister to put a shape on all of that.</P>
    <P>There was much huffing and puffing about taking on workers from the accession countries but if we did not have those workers all the Radisson hotels throughout the country would close because they are all staffed by very skilled, pleas<Col N="1509"/>ant Polish people. Equally, many other places of employment would virtually close because we would not have the employees to fill the jobs available.</P>
    <P>I was amazed recently to read the figures on the number of people here from the accession countries, more of whom I hope will follow. Those workers bring in their wake various attendant problems including housing needs. Also, the face of Ireland will change because intercultural marriages will take place and that will involve visits to and from the various countries, which is very interesting.</P>
    <P>I am currently involved with a Polish family. The young woman concerned has got engaged to a very nice young Irish man. It is all very happy, I hope, but there is much toing and froing between the two countries. Her family are coming here in droves and his family are visiting Poland in droves and returning with stories about the wonders of other lands. That is all very interesting in a European context. One might visit Poland and someone from Poland might visit here but this interaction will be widespread and amazing for Irish people and those from countries like Poland from where this young woman comes. That is beside the point, however. Many are coming here.</P>
    <P>As far as I can see the Bill does not address the question of the people who have been granted permission to stay; I am not sure of the proper term. They may not yet have citizenship but they have been given permission to stay here. They want to work. They can contribute. I am dealing with a couple in Athlone. The man is from Nigeria and is a computer software engineer. This couple got permission to remain here because they had an Irish-born child after the appropriate date. That is all in order and they are happy. His wife is attending the Athlone Institute of Technology. She did the access course and has now got a place on a college course beginning in September but that raises another question.</P>
    <P>The VEC will not grant any amelioration to this woman, even though she would be considered a mature student. I realise that is not the Minister&rsquo;s field but the matter should be highlighted because this couple are not eligible for grants. The fee is &euro;5,000 but she does not have that money and will never have it. He cannot get a job even though he has been granted leave to stay but he has not progressed beyond that part of the process. I suppose the next stage would be citizenship. I do not know if this Bill embraces that; I do not believe it does. These are skilled people who should be in the workforce but they cannot get into it because their papers state that they have leave to stay under the Irish-born child rule&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>They are entitled to work without a permit to get back into the system.</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="1510"/>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for that information. There is an anomaly in regard to entitlement to educational grants. This couple are entitled to stay here and the Minister has indicated they are entitled to work without a work permit&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The only other option might be the back to education allowance.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not a huge amount and the fee for the year in the institute of technology is alarming for this person because she would not have a chance of paying it.</P>
    <P>What is interesting also about the Bill is the fact that it makes us think of how far we have all come historically. I was reading a book recently &mdash; I forget the name of it &mdash; which referred to the fact that coloureds and Irish were told they need not apply in rooming houses and places of employment at the turn of the last century in the United States. Those people could not get employment because they were Irish and the Irish were considered feckless. That has all changed.</P>
    <P>I applaud the Minister&rsquo;s vision in this legislation. It fits in with what I see as his social responsibility on which he was always very strong. It also fits in with our economic needs. The Minister has married the two successfully. He has allowed for economic growth in certain areas where it is highly necessary, in which we have lacunae that we cannot fill ourselves. The Minister has also allowed for our European policy of opening up the country to people from the accession states. We were one of only two countries which did so. The naysayers were full of doom and gloom, stating we would be overrun but that is not so. We are greatly enhanced by what has happened. This legislation will enhance it further.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank all Senators who spoke for their broadly strong support for the legislation. I look forward to going through the details on Committee Stage. Senator Coghlan stated his party would accept the Bill.</P>
    <P>A number of issues were raised, including the Gama situation, which is still before the Supreme Court. We worked on this issue through the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court, and with officials from the trade union movement. Officials from the Department worked extremely hard. They travelled to Finansbank in Holland, where accounts were held and it is estimated that approximately &euro;24 million was recouped for the workers. That is a significant sum of money. My officials did a great deal of hard work with all concerned and we continue to work on that issue. We cannot comment on the legal aspects because it is still with the Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>The concept of joined-up Government was mentioned. I work hand in glove with the Mini<Col N="1511"/>ster for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on the issue of families applying for work permits. He will bring forward an immigration residency Bill and we have synergy between both Departments. While this legislation facilitates the issuing of a green card, which Senator O&rsquo;Rourke stated was urgently required, the residency aspect will be determined by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>A one-stop shop will be created and, ultimately, we will have one system for people who apply for green cards, work permits and residency. That will involve the Departments of Foreign Affairs, Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Enterprise, Trade and Employment. It is evolving.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>When will that be?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>It has already been established, although my Department retains the economic migration policy function, which is important because we deal with industry, enterprise and business. The Departments of Foreign Affairs and Justice, Equality and Law Reform have already come together and we now work with that group. INIS is the name of the group, and its fundamental objective is to make it more effective and efficient for the individuals, companies and all concerned.</P>
    <P>Recent changes to work permits mean the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will allow the spouses of work permit holders to also apply to come in. If they are above the family income supplement&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Is that contemporaneously with their spouse?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, if they are above the family income supplement threshold. Some provisions will be made on that. The only issue is that people must have sustainable employment for the future. I will return to the issue of Senator Coghlan&rsquo;s sustainability policy later. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has already moved on that issue and articulated publicly on it. Work permits will be for two or three years once this legislation is passed and people will be able to bring their spouses. We recognise that the humanitarian aspect is common sense.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris made a point on work visas. Work visas were introduced to fast-track employment in areas where we had skills shortages in the past, such as health and construction. They were allowed bring in their spouses approximately two years ago, for obvious competitive reasons.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Keep them happy.</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="1512"/>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>It is also the right thing to do. We learn as we go along. I stated before &mdash; Senator Mansergh made the same point &mdash; that in 1999 only 5,000 work permits were issued in this country. By 2003, 50,000 were issued annually. Since May 2004, 200,000 people have entered the country. It is rapid and fast-moving.</P>
    <P Just="Left">I met Bruce Morrison before I formulated the Bill and I had constructive engagement with him on it. He observed that Ireland has the highest <i>per capita</i> inward migration level globally. I do not know whether it is accurate. It may be disputed. The rate and pace has been extremely fast and enormous.</P>
    <P>Senator Leyden spoke eloquently about the emigration experience of the Irish, which is always useful in the context of this debate. Senator O&rsquo;Rourke also alluded to the fact that we should always remember our own who emigrated abroad, the experiences they had and the degree to which they contributed to economies and societies such as America and Australia and others across the world. It informs our mindset on how we approach people who now come here to settle, live and work.</P>
    <P>Senator Leyden raised the issue of abuse of workers&rsquo; rights and was particularly supportive of the Bill. The Bill is strong on worker protection. We have learned lessons from what has happened and people cannot complain about the strength of the Bill in this regard. We have good examples of where people did what they should not.</P>
    <P>The vast majority of employers will welcome this. Abuse of any worker, irrespective of nationality, creates an unsatisfactory situation for all concerned. It is particularly reprehensible that already vulnerable people coming to this country would be exploited in such a manner. From a humanitarian perspective for the individual concerned, it is wrong. A lack of uniform standards also creates an uneven playing pitch in economic activity and competitiveness in tendering for projects.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris raised a number of issues, including why an employer should continue to employ. Senator O&rsquo;Rourke also posed that question. Many employees want to pursue a job. The Bill is based on the offer of vacant jobs. I accept that. An employee in another country may see a job advertised and apply for that job and a work permit. Equally, in some instances the employer may do so, such as in the case of Filipino nurses. There is nothing wrong with the Health Service Executive or the Mater Hospital making an application for a work permit on behalf of the employee. It saves them &euro;500 if nothing else. The employer can organise and facilitate a great deal for the workers. The workers need not necessarily go down that route.</P>
    <P>The Bill allows an employee to change employment after a year.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>They stay for one year.</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="1513"/>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>If they see a new opportunity, they can apply for work permits to work there and approach the employer to ask whether he or she would employ them if they obtain work permits. If an employee has a bad experience during the first year, he or she can leave and we will facilitate him or her with a new work permit. This will ensure they do not have an unacceptable experience in terms of exploitation or abuse. That is also built into the legislation.</P>
    <P>One cannot merely state that one does not want abuse. To counter abuse and exploitation, a traceability system is required.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The one advantage with the employer applying is that one can go to source quickly. One can ask for the books and state if the employer does not rectify what he or she has done wrong, he or she will never get a work permit again and the sanctions of the Bill will be applied.</P>
    <P>Senator Mansergh raised the issue of the information on the work permit. The agreed remuneration rate will be on the work permit and will include registered employment agreements. The work permit will not issue unless the level of remuneration the employer is prepared to offer is clear in the application. Senator Norris raised the issue of self-interest and the salary thresholds pertaining to issuing of a green card. Senator Mansergh also mentioned payment rates.</P>
    <P>In my speech I mentioned the significant work undertaken by Forf&aacute;s and the expert skills group. That work, which we published prior to the Bill, informed much of the philosophy behind the Bill. Economic migration works if it is sustainable. If only low-skilled workers were brought in, the impact on social services, education and social welfare could quickly become unsustainable. I acknowledge that more work needs to be done internationally on this, but the evidence is that high-skilled inward migration assists the sustainability of the entire project. The green card system is for non-EU citizens, and this year we only issued 9,000 new work permits on top of approximately 20,000 reissued permits.</P>
    <P>We know we have skills shortages in this country, and an expert group has identified clearly where they are. Required personnel include professionals in engineering or construction, financial services, health and research and development, which will increasingly be a function of State investment. It is important that we have the capacity to bring such people to Ireland. There are a number of ways this can be done but we went for the salary threshold methodology. The Bill gives a framework which can change over time, and I favour this approach. That is the reason regulations are important. It gives us flexibility without having to come back all the time with primary legislation. Regulations would have <Col N="1514"/>to be laid before the House, as is the case with all other regulations.</P>
    <P>We have struck the correct balance. We have skills shortages and there is a degree of self-interest. No country in the world has an open situation where anybody can come in. With regard to the European experience, the ESRI carried out a study suggesting we are not maximising or optimising the skill levels of those coming from EU states. It is important that economic migration policy is managed to try to maximise economic growth. Ultimately, if added value comes from a migration policy and there is economic growth, it perpetuates a good scenario and cycle. Difficulties can arise if this does not come about.</P>
    <P>The biggest challenge facing us will be integration.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>My Department is beginning to work on this issue. We have taken submissions and people are working on the challenges that the rapid inward migration pattern of recent years presents to Irish society, both at a societal level and from the Government&rsquo;s perspective of policies that need to be developed.</P>
    <P>The permit must indicate a statement of the agreed remuneration, which relates to Senator Mansergh&rsquo;s point. This would indicate, where applicable, the amount payable under an employment regulation order or registered employment agreement. If the level of remuneration is not offered, the permit application is refused. The permit will be granted and issued in all cases to the employee, irrespective of who makes the application. Senator Norris asked a question on this issue.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>I see.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The permit will go to the employee and it must include the agreed remuneration.</P>
    <P Just="Left">Section 9(3), as amended on Report Stage in the D&aacute;il, provided that the permit shall include or be accompanied by a statement of the employee&rsquo;s employment rights and protections. A statement of the rights and entitlements under Irish labour law will be included.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>It will be a pocket version.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Norris raised that issue.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris wondered if we were discriminating in favour of the highly skilled. We expect most of the low and medium-skilled to come from Europe. There are significant numbers coming in, and it does not make sense to duplicate that scenario with those from outside the EU. Over 200,000 people have come in since May 2004.</P>
    <P>The Senator also raised the issue of the employer and we can consider the matter again on Committee Stage. It is important that <Col N="1515"/>employers have a right to apply for a work permit. One could argue with the Senator why they should not be allowed to do so.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>There should be portability for employees.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Norris asked why employers should apply, but why should they not? There are many decent and honourable employers out there who will need to fill their skill needs. They may need to do it urgently, and there can be specialist niche areas. There should be a balanced approach, and this is provided for in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Senator O&rsquo;Rourke&rsquo;s points are important, particularly those regarding refugees and the parents of Irish-born children, who have now been accepted in terms of legislation. They can work without a work permit.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>No permit is needed.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Some are moving on to the social welfare system also, as recent employment figures would show. People are now moving from the justice system into the social welfare and employment system. Those foreign nationals, in particular, who have been granted leave to stay in Ireland have the one-parent policy.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not know the title of those granted leave to stay.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Those with humanitarian needs are slightly different. Irish-born children have, in essence, residency and are here for good. Therefore, they can work and draw social welfare. It is only in the context of drawing social welfare that the idea sprang to mind in the specific case raised by the Senator. There may be room with regard to the back to education allowance.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>There may be room for that.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not sure of the entitlements with regard to fees.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a matter for the Department of Education and Science.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I will take the point on board and discuss it with the Minister, Deputy Hanafin. Part of our agenda in that respect will be to move people into the labour force. It would not be a good experience if people had to move out of the justice system &mdash; the accommodation centres, for example &mdash; on to social welfare. That is the case at the moment but we are anxious to act on this fairly quickly. People will have the opportunity to enter the labour force. The best way to do this is through access to education.</P><Col N="1516"/>

	<P>I am pleased the Seanad has decided to discuss school transport this afternoon. I welcome the opportunity to outline the range of measures my Department has put in place in recent times to improve the safety, the range and the quality of school transport services.</P>
    <P>I will first provide Members of the House an outline of the extent of the school transport service. It is a significant operation, managed by Bus &Eacute;ireann on my Department&rsquo;s behalf and covering over 46 million miles annually. Over 135,000 children, including more than 8,000 children with special needs, are transported in over 3,300 vehicles on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country. In addition to the 135,000 children carried, Bus &Eacute;ireann also issues over 9,000 tickets to schoolchildren for travel on public and privately licensed scheduled local and national bus and public rail services.</P>
    <P>Government investment in the scheme has increased very significantly over the years. In 1997, expenditure stood at &euro;49.6 million, while this year&rsquo;s allocation is &euro;152 million. This investment has been targeted toward the development of new services, improvements in the quality of services and extensions and alterations to existing services, mainly relating to special needs. In 2001, several improvements were made to the school transport services. The number of eligible pupils required to establish and maintain a new primary school service was reduced from ten to not less than seven. The threshold for maintaining a post-primary service was reduced to four eligible pupils, provided there was a minimum of six fare-paying pupils using the service. At post-primary level, the combined daily travelling and waiting times were reduced from a maximum of three hours to 2.5 hours. In addition, the distance requirement for remote area grants for primary pupils was reduced from 4.8 km, or three miles, to 3.2 km, or two miles, and the distance requirement from the nearest route was reduced from 4.8 km to 3.2 km in respect of fully eligible post-primary pupils.</P>
    <P>While the overall number of children being carried has decreased by approximately 12% since 1997, this has not resulted in a commensurate reduction in cost. Members will <Col N="1517"/>appreciate that a reduction in pupils being carried on an individual bus does not automatically mean that a smaller bus will suffice.</P>
    <P>A major focus of the increased investment is the provision of improved services for children with special needs. It is estimated that 33% of the financial allocation for school transport, approximately &euro;50 million, is now being expended on transport services and grants for children with special needs, who account for about 6% of the overall number of children carried. Costs are high in this area because it is not always possible to accommodate these children on regular school transport routes. Accordingly, special transport, such as minibuses, wheelchair-adapted vehicles and taxis, must be provided.</P>
    <P>This substantial expansion and improvement in school transport services, mainly for special needs, is best illustrated by the fact that in excess of 600 additional services have been introduced since 1998, almost 400 of which were minibus and taxi services, which were mainly for children with special needs. In addition, the total number of vehicles in the school transport fleet went up from 2,418 in 1998 to over 3,300 in 2006. In the same period, taxis were introduced as a new category of school transport and more than 280 are now in service. Taxi services are primarily for special needs children, for whom transport by car is often the most appropriate option.</P>
    <P>Other factors have contributed to the growth in expenditure, such as public demand for improved services in the form of extensions to provide home pick-ups, more buses to facilitate shorter travel time, separate services instead of combined services and more modern and more specialised school buses. Educational choice has also emerged as a significant factor. Traditionally, children attended their nearest primary school. However, parents are now afforded a greater choice of educational facility and many of them exercise this choice by sending their children to schools such as gaelscoileanna, gaelchol&aacute;ist&iacute; and multidenominational schools, in addition to denominational schools. This obviously involves the establishment of new services for eligible children or the payment of a grant to the parent to assist with the cost of making private transport arrangements.</P>
    <P Just="Left">Another factor is the retention of school transport services in rural areas, even where numbers fall below the threshold for establishing a service. In addition, contractors have to be paid higher rates as their cost base rises. This includes factors such as labour, insurance, fuel, spare parts and replacement vehicles. From this outline, I hope I have conveyed to the Members of the House a sense of the scale, development and cost of school transport services. I also convey my appreciation to Bus &Eacute;ireann for the efficient and effective manner in which it manages such a large operation.</P>
    <P>I emphasise that the safety record of the school bus service is good, due in no small part to the <Col N="1518"/>skill of school bus drivers and the expertise of Bus &Eacute;ireann which administers the service. However, there can be no room for complacency in this regard and the small number of tragic accidents which have taken place over the years, including recent incidents, serve as a constant reminder to us to keep safety at the top of the transport agenda.</P>
    <P>As part of my commitment to safety, I launched a flashing lights warning system pilot project on 22 school buses in Ennis in January 2005. This system is designed to alert motorists to the presence of a school bus as it stops to allow school children to board and alight and minimise the possibility of accidents occurring at such times. An evaluation of the pilot scheme has been encouraging and I am investigating the possibility of extending it to a small number of other areas. This would enable more extensive tests on the effectiveness of the initiative to be carried out. Based on the outcome of these tests, I hope to be in a position to decide whether to extend the scheme to the remaining parts of the country.</P>
    <P Just="Left">Just weeks prior to the tragic accident in County Meath last May my Department and Bus &Eacute;ireann had commenced another safety initiative ahead of the introduction of seat belts on school buses. Two demonstrator buses were introduced over a two-week period in counties Meath and Kildare. These buses were fitted with three seats on one side of the aisle and two on the other, all of which were equipped with seat belts. From my Department&rsquo;s viewpoint, the exercise served to test the reaction of pupils to the wearing of seat belts, the type and size of belt fitted and the seating configuration to which I referred. At the time my Department had been working on proposals for phasing out the three-for-two concession on school buses.</P>
    <P>Following the unfortunate accident in County Meath, the Government established a working group comprising representatives from the Departments of Education and Science, Transport and Finance to progress measures to enhance school bus safety. Bus &Eacute;ireann also attended as required. In July 2005, following recommendations from the working group, the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Hanafin, and I announced a package of measures to enhance the safety of school transport operations. The measures included the phasing out of three for two seating on post-primary services by the end of December 2005 and for primary services by the end of December 2006; the acquisition of additional buses by Bus &Eacute;ireann and the hiring in of additional private vehicles to meet the consequential capacity shortfall; the immediate fitting of seat belts on the Bus &Eacute;ireann school bus fleet; and the setting of a target date of December 2006 for private buses in the scheme to be fitted with approved seat belts.</P>
    <P>I understand from my colleague, the Minister for Transport, that the regulatory framework governing safety belts is settled at European level <Col N="1519"/>and addressed through requirements targeted at the vehicle and its occupants. Earlier this month the Minister made regulations giving effect to Directive 2003/20/EC relating to the compulsory wearing of safety belts in motor vehicles. Essentially, these regulations provide that seat belts must be worn once they are fitted. The regulations also oblige owners of buses fitted with safety belts to ensure passengers of such buses are informed of the requirement to wear safety belts while they are seated and the bus is in motion. This obligation may be discharged by one or more of the following means: announcement by the driver or conductor; audio visual means; or signs or pictograms displayed at each seat. l am satisfied the provision of seat belts on school buses constitutes a further safety improvement.</P>
    <P Just="Left">The feasibility of retrofitting safety belts in existing school buses was considered by the working group to which I referred. The group consulted national experts in a number of European Union countries and the European Commission on the matter. In considering a retrofit programme in existing school buses the view was taken that any retrofit specification would need to be as consistent as practicable with EU standards for new vehicles. In general terms these standards provide for the fitment of three-point belts in exposed seats and either three-point or lap belts in other seats. On the basis of observed international practice and EU standards, the working group was of the view that lap belts, with associated safety measures, were the most appropriate option for installation in school buses undergoing a retrofit. The associated safety measures include the use of energy absorbing material on the backs and tops of seats. The view of the working group on this matter informed the decision of the Government that all vehicles used in the school transport scheme would be equipped with safety belts by December 2006.</P>
    <P>Having installed seat belts on school buses, it is essential that all children wear them at all times and their behaviour is always safety conscious while travelling on or in the vicinity of school buses. Calls have made for the provision of escorts on all services, not only those provided for children with special needs, as is currently the case. I am having arrangements made for the development of an information campaign for all school transport users which I expect to be launched to coincide with the commencement of the next school year. Schools, parents, Bus &Eacute;ireann and my Department can work effectively together to develop and reinforce good safety practices on school buses.</P>
    <P>I now propose to provide a progress update for Senators in regard to the roll-out of the various measures announced last July. More than 220 vehicles have been hired in from the private sector to address a capacity shortfall arising from the phasing out of the three for two seating arrangements on school buses at post-primary level. In <Col N="1520"/>addition, Bus &Eacute;ireann has purchased 51 modern second-hand coaches and arrangements for the acquisition of a further 30 such vehicles are in hand. The company has also placed orders for the acquisition of 20 new dedicated school buses. A number of the second-hand vehicles have already been received and it is expected that the balance of the vehicles will be delivered later this year.</P>
    <P>At this stage, one-for-one seating is in place on all but 31 of the 2,500 post-primary services. Bus &Eacute;ireann has commenced retrofitting seat belts on its own school bus fleet and work is progressing well. The contractor for the work has developed specifications for each vehicle type in the company&rsquo;s fleet and already 210 of Bus &Eacute;ireann&rsquo;s cohort of approximately 650 school buses have been fitted with seat belts. Currently, 20 buses per week are being retrofitted, with work set to be accelerated over the summer holidays and expected to be completed later this year.</P>
    <P>More than 2,600 private contractors&rsquo; vehicles operate in the school transport scheme and I understand many of these are already fitted with seat belts. The standard to which belts on contractors&rsquo; vehicles have been fitted will need to be assessed and Bus &Eacute;ireann is making arrangements for the necessary inspection to be carried out on a contractual basis. The representative organisations for these contractors have been advised of Department of Transport requirements for retrofitting and discussions have commenced on how best to implement the seat belt installation by the target date.</P>
    <P Just="Left">The move from three-for-two to one-for-one seating arrangements serves to emphasise the priority that must be given to pupils who are fully eligible for school transport. This, in turn, highlights the position of catchment boundary and concessionary pupils, an issue I now propose to address. Post-primary pupils who are eligible for school transport to the post-primary centre in their own catchment area may sometimes elect to attend a post-primary centre in a different catchment area from that in which they reside. In such instances these pupils may avail of school transport to the post-primary centre they have chosen to attend. However, such pupils will only be offered transport if spare seats are available on the relevant bus after all eligible pupils have been accommodated. Such pupils are referred to as &ldquo;catchment boundary pupils&rdquo;. This rule has always applied.</P>
    <P>Catchment boundary pupils are not guaranteed school transport for every year of their schooling. Rather, the granting of transport in such instances is dependent on the availability of spare seats on the buses used to transport eligible students. Any such additional capacity is calculated on a term to term basis. This approach has always pertained. Catchment boundary pupils are required to pay the same contributions as eligible post-primary pupils to avail of school transport. In addition, such pupils are responsible for getting to the catchment boundary or to the nearest point inside <Col N="1521"/>that boundary at which they are picked up by the relevant bus.</P>
    <P>In the case of primary and post-primary pupils who are ineligible for school transport on the basis of the distance requirements transport may be offered on a concessionary, fare paying basis. The charge for such concessions is &euro;26 per term for primary pupils and &euro;51 per school term for post-primary pupils. Again, it has always been the case that such pupils are not guaranteed school transport for every year of their schooling. The granting of concessionary transport is dependent on the availability of spare seats on the buses used to transport eligible students. Any such additional capacity is calculated on a term-to-term basis. The position I have outlined is in accordance with the provisions of the school transport scheme. It is my intention to apply these provisions as we develop and improve the services.</P>
    <P>A related issue which has been topical in recent times is that of catchment boundaries. There have been calls for local and general reviews of these boundaries to enable pupils to be accommodated with school transport to attend a school of their choice. Catchment boundaries have their origins in the establishment of free post-primary education in the late 1960s. For planning purposes, the country was divided into geographic districts, each with several primary schools feeding into a post-primary centre with one or more post-primary schools. The intention was that these defined districts would facilitate the orderly planning of school provision and accommodation needs. They also facilitated the provision of a national school transport service, enabling children from remote areas to get to their nearest school.</P>
    <P>While the service has been developed over the years to take account of linguistic and denominational considerations in the matter of school choice, it was never the intention that such choice would be unlimited. Clearly, the cost of operating such a scheme would be unsustainable. It is entirely reasonable for parents to exercise educational choice but expectation as to the extent to which choice can be facilitated must be tempered with realism.</P>
    <P>A review of catchment boundaries may be appropriate where, for example, a new post-primary school is established in an area where previously there was none, or conversely where a sole-provider school closes due to declining enrolment. However, to revise boundaries in order to provide school transport for pupils to their school of choice would not be appropriate and it is not my intention to undertake such a review.</P>
    <P>Considerable progress has been made over the lifetime of this Government in developing school transport services. I am anxious to ensure that the current momentum, especially in regard to safety, is maintained.</P><Col N="1522"/>
    <P>I thank all the Senators for their attention and for having raised this debate initially. I thank you, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, for your patience.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House for this timely debate coming, as it does, on the anniversary of the greatest tragedy in the history of the school transport system. Last evening in County Meath, the parents, fellow students and friends of the five schoolgirls who died, marked the first anniversary of their deaths.</P>
    <P Just="Left">I am appalled by the Minister of State&rsquo;s address in the context of what the parents and school children of the country have endured within the last 12 months. The record speaks for itself. Five children died in County Meath last year. There was a tragedy in Offaly earlier this year and a near tragedy in County Meath a few weeks ago. In her remarks, the Minister of State said that considerable progress has been made in the lifetime of this Government, but I do not know what she means by progress. Since 1967, when the school transport system was initiated on a statutory basis, little or no progress has been made other than the fact that additional buses have been hired to provide the service. Fleet replacement was only undertaken in response to emergencies. The new buses to which the Minister of State referred are, in fact, second-hand vehicles. Less than 1% of the total fleet comprises new, purpose-built buses for school transport.</P>
    <P>Some 33% of the increased allocation for school transport, while welcome, has been for a new, specialised category of people with special needs. Since 33% of total funding goes towards transporting 6% of the passengers, we can see the perspective of what the Minister of State terms &ldquo;progress&rdquo;. It is laughable in the extreme. If special needs are removed from the equation, no progress has been made and most people would say that our school transport system has deteriorated. When we peel away the monetary percentages we can see the reality of what is happening. The school transport system is basically a rural service and the partners in education &mdash; parents, children and school management boards &mdash; are seriously concerned about safety. One of the shortest paragraphs in the Minister of State&rsquo;s address, paragraph five on page six, deals with safety. It is not good enough. Where is the commitment?</P>
    <P>I thought the Minister of State would confirm the commitment given, under pressure, by the Taoiseach in the Lower House to audit and test the school transport fleet independently. Despite all the tragedies, why is it that nobody with responsibility for school transport in the Department of Education and Science has moved an inch? It is not good enough. Bus &Eacute;ireann must have a special facility to test the school fleet. Why are school buses not exposed to the same rigorous tests as commercial buses or private vehicles in the NCT?</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="1523"/>
   <Speaker pid="SiledeValera"><NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
	<P>They are.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>If that is the case, there is something seriously wrong with the particular process concerning school buses. I live near an NCT centre where commercial goods vehicles are rigorously tested every day. If the smallest flaw is found they are returned to the garage for repairs. That is not the case with school buses, however. Anyone can see that school buses in rural areas need to be replaced for safety reasons. The report of the accident in County Meath clearly stated that the school bus in question on that terrible day was not roadworthy. That was not the only bus in such a state of disrepair. All necessary steps should be taken to resolve this matter. Will the Minister of State confirm the Taoiseach&rsquo;s statement earlier this week that an independent audit of the school bus fleet will be carried out, whether the vehicles are run privately or by Bus &Eacute;ireann? That is the kernel of the matter which concerns parents of children using school buses. The Minister of State should confirm the Taoiseach&rsquo;s statement, which is what most people want to hear as an end result of this debate. She should have something to say about that.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SiledeValera"><NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
	<P>I will do so in concluding the debate.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sorry it was not included in her opening remarks, which I have heard before. On 29 September 2005, the Minister of State made a similar presentation to the Joint Committee on Education and Science. There is very little variation from it in today&rsquo;s speech, as she will admit herself.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SiledeValera"><NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
	<P>I will not.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>The same format and topics are followed through the speech, so obviously the Minister of State is not prepared to move on this situation. Why is it that buses under contract to the Department of Education and Science are only replaced in an emergency? While the average age of buses is now just 12 or 13 years, what of the older buses? Many buses up to 18 years of age are still on the road and Bus &Eacute;ireann will keep them on the road as long as they are ticking over. That is not good enough for the school transport system when safety should be the priority.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister of State sends a message to Bus &Eacute;ireann that she expects reliability as we approach the examination season. Children should not be worried before an examination that they may not get to their examination centres. It is an issue many have raised with me due to children having to travel in inferior buses.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State referred to catchment areas but only minor adjustments have been made in this regard since 1967. It was stated that some rural bus services have been maintained <Col N="1524"/>despite declining numbers but that situation has changed with the increase in population in recent years and it is now a factor only in rare circumstances. The issue of catchment areas should be examined in light of the reality of the situation on the ground.</P>
    <P>I have always questioned, and did so at the recent committee meeting attended by the Minister of State, whether it is appropriate that a partner in education, the chief executive officer of vocational education areas, is the transport liaison officer. While it is becoming less of a factor, in most instances the chief executive officer has responsibility for schools within the vocational education committee area. While I do not say this with disrespect to any chief executive officer, it is not appropriate that the chief executive officer would continue to operate in this area. A liaison officer should be appointed who does not have any affiliation to schools within a catchment area.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State will remember a situation in Kinvara, County Galway, where a parent had to drive behind a school bus for five miles from the family home to the catchment point before the children were picked up, despite the bus travelling by their door. Taken with the question of concessionary tickets, the two issues are an integral part of a serious problem in the school bus system. I hope the Minister of State will indicate that it is past time for a review of the catchment areas and concessionary ticketing. These programmes are welcome to many but they cause division among communities, neighbours and families because one child gets the service and another does not, and others are incorrectly blamed.</P>
    <P>There are now 3,300 school transport vehicles in operation but I do not know what expenditure there has been on the replacement fleet. When vehicles are finished on the Dublin routes, they are cast aside and brought to rural Ireland to provide services. I checked on two buses recently which had given a lifetime of service for Dublin Bus before operating in a rural area for eight years.</P>
    <P>I compliment Bus &Eacute;ireann for transporting thousands of children over thousands of miles. However, there is now a greater number of vehicles on the roads and a greater need for safety. The Minister of State and the Government must categorically state that there will be an independent audit of the fleet. While the Government will choose who tests the vehicles, it should be done in an open, transparent way so all involved in providing school transport will be tested to the same standard, as is the case for all other commercial vehicles on the road.</P>
    <P>Safety is the priority. These buses carry children. Everybody welcomes the fact we have made progress with regard to the wearing of seat belts and the two-for-one rule. However, the expenditure figures outlined by the Minister of State could be misrepresented in so far as the Government is obliged by legislation to provide for chil<Col N="1525"/>dren with special needs, which we all welcome and which had to be done, but all of these services are provided by private carriers. This reflects the fact that Bus &Eacute;ireann has not yet accepted the need to provide facilities whereby children with special needs could be integrated into the normal transport system.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State referred to a flashing lights warning system, which is a wonderful initiative and one I hope will be extended. It is an important issue for many, particularly those using dark rural roads in winter. The Minister of State must insist fire fighting equipment is in place on every school bus.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State. Her work on the safety of school buses is to be commended and encourages us greatly. These measures and others she has outlined in great detail in this debate deserve our full support and the full and immediate support of Government. While I have criticisms of the school transport system, they are not directed at the Minister of State, her Department or her colleague, the Minister. There has been a national malaise but the Department is an insignificant part of it. The criticisms made by Senator Ulick Burke, some of which are relevant, are misdirected.</P>
    <P>It is sad that exceptionally tragic accidents involving school buses have occurred on our roads recently. We have a moral imperative, above all other national, community and personal needs, to identify the culprits and embark immediately on a crusade in the interests of the safety of our school children when using public roads. It is not acceptable that it has taken the loss of young lives, full of promise and potential, to challenge us to look at ourselves. Simply put, we must immediately and urgently become honest and objective appraisers of our shortcomings.</P>
    <P>Like all road accidents, school bus accidents occur because of institutionalised attitudes and practices. Our immediate crusade must be to root out the cultural factors that skulk in the casual undergrowth of road accidents. Current policy in this regard is misguided and is not yielding the desired results. A collaborative approach to road safety for all road users, schoolchildren and adults alike, one to which everyone can subscribe, is urgently needed.</P>
    <P>If we, as legislators, want garda&iacute; to win public approval for enforcement of road safety laws, we must as a series of measures stop them from skulking behind walls and hedges along wide, safe roads to plunder money from the motorist. My message is clear: let us stop shooting fish in a barrel. Every stretch of road should have a hazard rating based on the number of serious accidents over, for example, a ten-year period. This would be divided by the length of road in miles, multiplied by the number of cars using it daily. This would give a simple serious accident index for roads such as the N17 between Galway and Tuam, which I used thousands of times over 30 <Col N="1526"/>years, of perhaps 300 accidents divided by 20 miles, multiplied by 8,000, being the number of cars using the road daily, divided by 10,000. This would give an accident index of 12. It could also be divided by, for example, 1,000, and the accident index would be 120. The public would quickly begin to acknowledge that accidents are prone to happen on many of our minor roads. This would have a much more positive effect than the pieces of steel casually placed on roads &mdash; I mean no disrespect &mdash; stating that 88 people were killed on the roads of Wicklow over the past four years.</P>
    <P>We have been able to bring the economy from the brink of bankruptcy to the dizzy heights of being one of the wealthiest countries in the world. Let us apply the same principles of partnership and collaboration to save lives on our roads. Let us do it with the same urgency and determination. Is not the solution as simple and as plain as the nose on one&rsquo;s face?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>Who is &ldquo;we&rdquo;?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>It is regrettable that this debate is taking place against a background of exceptionally tragic accidents involving school buses. I convey my condolences and sympathy to all the families, extended families and communities that were touched so traumatically by the unfortunate accidents in Meath and Offaly.</P>
    <P>As with every road accident, those accidents had their root causes in human failings, shortcomings or errors. I hasten to add that such causal factors do not pertain to drivers alone. Those responsible for poor quality roads are frequently the culprits in terms of responsibility for road accidents. It is unacceptable that county councils should erect an accident blackspot sign on a road and consider that an adequate discharge of their responsibility. I would go so far as to say it is irresponsible.</P>
    <P>There should be a statutory requirement for an independent engineering report on every serious accident scene and the local authority responsible should be obligated, immediately and above all prior budgetary plans, to make safe structural or design deficient roads. There should be no tolerance of hazardous roads just as we have no tolerance of hazardous buildings or environmental hazards.</P>
    <P>Of the two school bus tragedies I have mentioned, there seems to be <i>prima facie </i>evidence from all I have read that the roads at both scenes were not up to acceptable standards of safety. This is a major issue and one which has been relegated to insignificance and obscurity by the constant attribution of all road accidents to speeding and lack of enforcement.</P>
    <P>Surely school buses do not offend in respect of speeding. This merely serves to underline that there are other significant causes of road deaths apart from those so persistently reinforced in the public perception. I venture humbly to suggest <Col N="1527"/>that the local authorities should be made stringently responsible for the removal of bad bends immediately, the correction of improper cambers, the removal of vertical upright edges on traffic calming islands and chicanes and their replacement with sloping high visibility edgings. I can develop at length on any of these aspects. We must also address the cultural factors that skulk in the casual undergrowth of road accidents. These are the prevailing attitudes of drivers, their norms of behaviour, norms of belief and their general disposition towards compliance and law enforcement.</P>
    <P>As a country, we need a collaborative approach to road safety, one to which everyone can subscribe. This will not be achieved while there is an adversarial attitude towards the driver. If the Garda want public approval for enforcement, and we want it to have that approval, it must stop skulking behind walls and hedges to plunder money from the motorist. The Garda does not mount speed traps on minor roads because such roads, from one perspective, will not yield the revenue. Current policy in this regard is misguided and is not yielding the desired results.</P>
    <P>What Gay Byrne is tasked to do is to change our prevailing cultural attitude to driving and safety. That means looking at basics such as maintaining a vigilant inspection regime in respect of public service vehicles, especially school buses. The Minister of State has convinced me that is well in train and being comprehensively looked at from her Department&rsquo;s point of view. Let us demand that the revenue be front-loaded and available to her to ensure this aspect is fully implemented. It also means enforcement that is pertinent, relevant and balanced. It is not shooting fish in a barrel.</P>
    <P>Like all road accidents, school bus accidents occur because of institutionalised attitudes and practices. Their emotional impact jolts us out of the complacency and comfort with which we accept institutionalised norms. It is sad that it has taken the loss of young lives, full of promise and potential, to challenge us to look at ourselves. We are great at blaming others, such as young speedsters and drunken drivers &mdash; always somebody else.</P>
    <P>I would like to see a more rigorous analysis of road accident data. I would also like to know how many road accidents are caused by the road hog who insists on travelling in the middle of the road at a slow speed building up the frustration of all behind him until someone in blind rage risks dangerously overtaking and causes an accident. We need to acknowledge these factors and to punish such selfish drivers just as we punish drivers whose speed and recklessness imperils the safety of other road users. Anyone who is not driving at the speed limit should by law have to move over or pull over to let other traffic pass.</P>

	<P>Cyclists and pedestrians should be made just as amenable as drivers to the rules of the road. The current position is appalling. Cyclists ignore all classes of convention and laws such as one-way streets, footpaths and traffic lights. We will never engage the collaborative goodwill of all unless we stop the targeted victimisation of one sector as a mere revenue collecting ploy. We must bring equity and common sense to our crusade because it is a crusade we need.</P>
    <P>It is significant that school buses have focused our reflection on the issue of road safety. We never prioritised their road worthiness until tragedies befell. I point the finger at everybody since the foundation of that service. Now we are wringing our hands in exasperation that things had got so bad unbeknownst to us.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. P. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Senator repeat that?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>They got bad because of the endemic neglect that has prevailed over the lifetime of all Governments from the foundation of the service. &ldquo;If it is not broke, do not fix it&rdquo; seemed to be the prevailing approach, yet when tragedy strikes we are horrified. We seek to find somebody else to blame. The reality about the school bus issue is the same as the reality about road safety. We have not been honest and objective appraisers of our own shortcomings. We need fresh resolve, a frank analysis of shortcomings and a comprehensive resolution to the problems.</P>
    <P>I commend and salute the Minister of State, Deputy de Valera, for the manner in which she has outlined her commitment to giving absolute priority to the school bus and school transport system.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I am happy to welcome the Minister of State to the House. She and I are old colleagues from the days when we soldiered together on the former women&rsquo;s rights committee. We got on well and I think we still do. Although I will have some criticism, as others have said it is not a criticism directed personally at the Minister of State.</P>
    <P>I recognise the difficulties in terms of expenditure, timescale and so on. It is appropriate because today&rsquo;s anniversary focuses people&rsquo;s minds on the tragedy involved when young lives are snuffed out. However, on that occasion it was not a problem of the school bus or the driver, as far as I can make out. It was principally a problem of the road surface. That is a real scandal, for which the Minister of State has no responsibility, and which resides with the local authorities. The situation regarding road surfaces is continuing and there will be further fatal accidents unless it is addressed.</P>
    <P>I shall resist the temptation to travel in the general direction of road traffic which my honourable friend, Senator Fitzgerald, used to take the opportunity to score a couple of notable points on the subject of Garda interventions and <Col N="1529"/>shooting fish in a barrel. I agree with him but for me that is a slightly different debate, although the Senator used the latitude afforded by these statements to introduce those points. They are good points. I am not sure they relate as well as they might to the question of school safety, but it is an appropriate time to look at this matter.</P>
    <P Just="Left">One of the main issues I wanted to raise has already been raised in part at least by Senator Ulick Burke, namely, the roadworthiness of many of these vehicles. The Minister of State intervened to say they are being tested. If so, the test is not satisfactory, because over the past year or two we have all heard descriptions of buses with so much grass growing out of them that one could feed a herd of cows. One bus burst into flames. Other buses may be deemed roadworthy by some group but they are not even weather-proof. Last year, a group of courageous young schoolgirls in Donegal were so concerned about the decrepit condition of their bus and its absolute lack of roadworthiness that they refused to use it and walked to school on a regular basis. That story was broadcast over a couple of days. Those children were quite right.</P>
    <P>The Minister says there is some form of test. That must be examined because it is a lousy test. Nor is it appropriate that school buses should be given a special test. I have also asked repeatedly, without ever getting a satisfactory answer, whether general buses are subject to a national vehicle test. Either they are not, or the test is unsatisfactory. An ordinary private vehicle with one little rubber stud missing from the inside of the boot will be failed by the NCT service. I know that because it happened to me, yet I see school buses pouring out black smoke which obviously have not been serviced for years.</P>
    <P>We also have the record of the consumers, the young schoolgoers who constantly report on the state of the buses. Clearly, either no test is applied or a test is applied which is less stringent than that applied to cars. Furthermore, if we are concerned about the safety of adults using their own vehicles of their own free will, by choice, with no direct Government involvement, should we be much more concerned about whether the Government has accepted some degree of responsibility in providing school transport? That point must be considered. I raised it a number of years ago, as I did the issue of safety belts.</P>
    <P>I appreciate some of what the Minister of State has said, but to adapt her leader&rsquo;s slogan, I would say &ldquo;some done, lots to do&rdquo;. When I first raised the issue of safety belts, I was surprised and shocked with regard to the situation of parents of &mdash; I hope this is not politically incorrect &mdash; mentally handicapped children who would now be described as educationally disadvantaged for whom there were no safety belts on buses. Putting a child with an intellectual disability of some kind who may find it more difficult to follow instructions than an average student in such a situation was a recipe for disaster, particularly <Col N="1530"/>when three for two seating was operating on such buses, with no safety belts.</P>
    <P>I raised that issue possibly four or five years ago and I am sorry to see it has not been addressed, although I give credit to the Minister for State for some moves in that direction. That is clear from her script. However, I am not convinced enough is being done. I assume too that when the Minister of State talks of the use of taxis, this is found to be more satisfactory, amenable, comfortable and appropriate for certain disadvantaged children.</P>
    <P>I assume the paragraph of the speech which deals with safety is very carefully crafted. I know the Minister of State is no mean hand at linguistic skills &mdash; if that is not mixed a metaphor &mdash; but she says the safety record is a good one. Then comes an interesting phrase, &ldquo;This is due in no small part to the skill of the school bus drivers and the expertise of Bus &Eacute;ireann, which administers the service.&rdquo; In other words, it almost seems to be implied there that the professionalism of the drivers compensates to some degree for the decrepitude of the buses, which decrepitude is an established fact. We should not have to rely on the skills of the drivers, although we are grateful for them.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting the Minister of State is immune to safety concerns. That is made quite clear in the paragraph which followed, which is about flashing lights. This is a lovely idea because it is so simple, clear, practical and necessary, precisely because of the awful behaviour in which so many Irish drivers engage. When buses are pulling in, I have seen people passing them out on the inside. Children could be alighting from a bus, could be in positions where it is difficult to see them, so flashing signals are a good thing. A pilot project was launched in Ennis and I hope it will be extended because it is practical and simple.</P>
    <P>With regard to the working group, it was stated that three for two seating on primary school bus services will be phased out by the end of December 2006. At least that is a commitment and a target date. However, as I raised this issue a number of years ago, I am rather taken aback that it is still on the burner. I would have hoped it would have been completed by now and I trust this is an absolute commitment to have it done by December 2006. I note too that the Bus &Eacute;ireann buses must all be fitted with approved belts.</P>
    <P>I found the Minister of State&rsquo;s speech interesting because of the references to the European Union conditions and standards obligatory as a result of EU directives. This worries me in a sense because though I may be misinterpreting, or there is a looseness of expression, I almost get a feeling from this that in terms of safety, we are doing what we are obliged to do by the EU. The Minister of State is vigorously shaking her head. Nevertheless, it makes it appear that we are obliged by the European Union to take these measures. We should be putting in place those <Col N="1531"/>measures a long time before we are obliged to do so.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SiledeValera"><NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
	<P>We are.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I hope so, although I am not fully convinced, because the Minister of State has said that the fitting of safety belts will be mandatory for new buses entering the service from 20 October 2007. That is great, but it is 18 months away. That will make it about seven years since I first raised the issue. The Minister of State went on to say that the only exceptions are the buses used on single stop urban services. The EU directives do not require the retro-fitting of seat belts. I understand there is a limited programme of retro-fitting, which is not complete. The Minister of State may correct me if I am wrong but I understand there is no commitment to fully retro-fit every single school bus in the country, that there will be a phase-in, phase-out situation, so to speak. That is not acceptable. All the buses should be retro-fitted. The Minister of State said that in recent years, a significant number of larger buses entering into the service of this country have been fitted with safety belts. They should all be fitted.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SiledeValera"><NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
	<P>They will be.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Good. By what date?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SiledeValera"><NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
	<P>December 2006.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Will they all be retro-fitted by then? That is fine by me.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State will have the opportunity to reply, and others are waiting to speak.</P>
      </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I may not be in the House but will read the reply of the Minister of State with interest. I am glad to hear the positive drift of her comments. Safety belts must be worn once they are fitted but that requirement is absurd when some of them are not fitted. We are making it mandatory where they are fitted but we not living up to our obligation to have them fitted. The Minister says they will be fitted quite soon. However, I raised this issue many years ago and I am sorry it has not yet been done.</P>
    <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The directives also oblige owners of buses fitted with safety belts to ensure the passengers of such buses are informed of the requirement that they be seated while the bus is moving. Again, this relates to the situation after the belts have been fitted. I hope there are no accidents before this desirable overall refit is complete. I am not satisfied that there is proper testing of buses. It is perfectly obvious that there is not. The tests are either not the same as the NCT or they are unsatisfactory.</P><Col N="1532"/>
    <P>Finally, the Minister of State stated, and I promise to read her reply to this debate in detail, that the overall number of children being carried has decreased by 12% since 1997. That is interesting. Why is that? Why has it not had a further effect? If the number is decreasing, why is it not possible to extend the scheme to give people choice? That would be very good although expensive. Give people choice so that if they wish to send their children to a multidenominational school five miles further away, it can be done. That would be healthy. The slack created by the fact of this decrease could be used to include such people in the scheme.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>It is timely that we have this debate now to focus minds on this issue again, particularly in light of the tragedies that occurred over the last year in Meath and Offaly. I am sure the Minister was anxious to come to the House to outline her views and the progress to date with the school transport system. I will use some headlines from her speech to show what progress has been made. As the Minister said, more must be done but it would be wrong to suggest that nothing has been done.</P>
    <P>I wish to put on record what the Government and the Minister of State, Deputy de Valera, have done and are doing in this area. The Minister has shown sensitivity and compassion with regard to the tragedies that have occurred with school buses. To allay the fears of parents, the Minister is working hard to ensure there is an upgraded transport system to carry schoolchildren to and from school.</P>
    <P>One of the headlines in the Minister&rsquo;s speech relates to the cost of the school transport service and how much has been put into improving it. In 1997, expenditure on school transport was &euro;49 million; today it is &euro;152 million. A great deal of money has been spent on improving the service. One might ask how the money is being spent.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>Fewer students are using it.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>If the Senator interrupts me, he must allow me to interrupt him when he speaks. There are improvements in the service. The number of pupils required to establish and maintain a primary school service has been reduced from ten eligible pupils to seven. That is positive. The threshold for the post-primary service has been reduced to four eligible pupils, provided a minimum of six fare paying pupils use the service. The time spent travelling has been reduced from three to 2.5 hours. These improvements must be put on record and the Minister deserves credit for her sensitivity and commitment in detailing how we can further improve the service.</P>
    <P>Escorts are now provided for special needs students and taxis, minibuses and wheelchair adapted vehicles will be provided to transport handicapped children to school. This is a huge improvement from five years ago when this was <Col N="1533"/>not available. Let us be fair when making our contributions to this debate. The total number of vehicles in the school transport fleet has increased from 2,418 in 1998 to over 3,300 in 2006, another positive change.</P>
    <P>The core issue is safety on the buses and how to provide it. There is no room for complacency. I would be the first to reinforce that point. It must be high on our agenda to ensure parents have confidence in the service. I welcome the flashing lights pilot scheme. It is a great scheme and I hope it will be widely introduced.</P>
    <P>Is there proper co-ordination between the local authorities, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Department of Transport? I can give an example that highlights my concerns about this. I was travelling down the country about three weeks ago and happened to pass a community school in a rural area between 3.30 p.m. and 4 p.m. I waited for approximately an hour in my car as I watched cars zigzagging here and there around a school bus. There should have been a garda and school warden on duty. There should be some regulation because the situation was inviting an accident to happen.</P>
    <P>The Minister cannot manage that situation from her office. There must be co-ordination in every school area so the local authority is aware of where there are problems on stretches of road. The school buses, therefore, can be made aware of the dangers by the local authorities. The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform should be made aware of what is going on by the local Garda station. The Minister cannot deal with this alone but must bring in backup support. I am sure she will do that.</P>
    <P>A great deal of work is being done but safety is the priority on everybody&rsquo;s agenda. There is a feeling, with regard to some buses, that maintenance is not up to standard. I hope the Minister will examine this issue. I have seen these rickety old buses and have wondered, when driving behind them and seeing smoke coming out of the back, if they are all right. Perhaps they are &mdash; they are probably better than my car &mdash; but one does not get a good feeling, particularly when there are many children on the bus.</P>
    <P>I wonder if the Minister is putting a huge responsibility on bus drivers to deal with teenagers of 14 and 15 romping around the bus. She has introduced the seat belt requirement and changed the three to two seating. However, is it possible to control the teenagers? Perhaps the Minister would give her views in that regard. It is one of my concerns. I urge the Minister to continue the good work. A great deal is being done and I am confident she will get it right.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State gave the figures for the huge number of children who use the school bus service. It is almost a year since the tragic accident last year in Meath, in which five schoolgirls lost their lives. There have been seven <Col N="1534"/>accidents since then, with one resulting in a fatality. It is an urgent issue that must be addressed.</P>
    <P Just="Left">The Minister of State outlined what the Government is doing about it but I have a number of questions. I have found some contradictions in her statement. On the recommendations of the working group, she stated, &ldquo;the measures included the phasing out of three-for-two seating on post-primary services by the end of December 2005&rdquo;. Later she stated, &ldquo;At this stage, one-for-one seating is in place on all but 31 of the 2,500 post-primary services.&rdquo; That means the target was not met.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State also spoke on what she said was &ldquo;the immediate fitting of seat belts on the Bus &Eacute;ireann school bus fleet; and the setting of a target date of December 2006 for private buses in the scheme to be fitted with approved seat belts&rdquo;. Later she stated:</P>
    <P LI="1">Bus &Eacute;ireann has commenced retrofitting seat belts on its own school bus fleet and work is progressing well ... already 210 of Bus &Eacute;ireann&rsquo;s cohort of approximately 650 school buses have been fitted with seat belts.</P>
    <P FLI="0">The targets laid down by the working group have not been met. Although much welcome work has been done, the Government should at least meet the targets of its working group, particularly when it is expecting private contractors to do so by 2006.</P>
    <P>To meet the phasing out of the three for two school buses, some 2,600 extra vehicles have been hired. Will the Minister of State clarify if those buses are required to have seat belts and have in place the other required safety standards? The Minister of State referred to how our legislation complies with EU directives in this area. Has domestic legislation been drafted for requirements for school bus safety to ensure it is on a statutory basis? While we may consider the EU directive, we must draft our own laws.</P>
    <P>I note from parliamentary questions the Minister for Transport stated a review is being carried out by the Department on safety on school bus transport. A comprehensive audit must be completed to include the buses involved, the routes used and their safety, bus drivers and insurance. It is possible for the Government to do this in a relatively short time.</P>
    <P>The overall road safety issue needs to be tackled. Safe driving plays a large part in the prevention of road accidents. We must ensure our roads are safe. That seems to have been a major factor in the Meath school bus accident. Although the school bus fleet has increased, it could be better. In many suburban areas in west Dublin, large numbers of schoolchildren are taken to school by car. Some of the distances justify an extension of the school bus transport system to these areas. Such a move would also help in tackling traffic congestion in these areas. South Dublin County Council is carrying out a feasibility study on providing a local authority run <Col N="1535"/>school transport system. It may cost money in the short term but, in the long run, it will save money.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the report presented by the Minister of State, Deputy de Valera, outlining the improvements that have been possible to make to school buses. The school bus system is an essential everyday social service for thousands of children. To a point, one can only judge if it is an issue from the representations one receives. From my regular meetings with school principals in south Tipperary, I do not recall the school bus service ever being raised with me. In the few instances parents raised it with me, it was because their son or daughter had to go to a school closer to home but not one which the family went to over several generations.</P>
    <P>We cannot ignore the tragedies that have occurred. Having worked in Government, I know the Minister of State is not a free agent in these matters. If there is anything the Department of Finance keeps an eagle eye on, it is the costs of the school bus service. Over the years, reports have been commissioned to see if some way could be found to reduce the escalating costs of it. It was understandable. Due to the paucity of resources available, old buses on a make-do and mend basis were employed.</P>
    <P>The current bus fleet is not as old as it was ten years ago. Improvements have already been made. The Minister of State referred to 20 new purpose-built buses. It will not happen this year or next year but I would like to see a dedicated school bus fleet. All such vehicles have an operational lifespan but there is no justification for carrying our children round in buses that are older than the fleet used for bus users in general. The contractors that carry out this service for the Department of Education and Science, including principally Bus &Eacute;ireann, are carrying out a public, social service. The resources we put into safety reflect the value we as a community place on the safety of our children. I acknowledge the Minister of State outlined progress in her speech but we should be ambitious in the long term.</P>
    <P>Picking up on Senator Tuffy&rsquo;s remarks, there are many solo school runs by car that use up a lot of energy and give off emissions. Any sensible family, if there is a bus or train service close by, should use it. It should be Government policy to facilitate that because the school run contributes to congestion.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House. I will start by reminding the House of the shambles last August when the decision was made to end the three for two seating arrangement. It was the correct decision but it could not have been taken at a worse time of the year. August, which is normally a quiet time for politicians&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="1536"/>
   <Speaker pid="SiledeValera"><NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
	<P>What time of year would the Senator suggest?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I certainly would not suggest August when the VECs were forced to act under significant pressure. The Department owes an apology to those staff for the manner in which this was done. We all attended public meetings, including Government backbenchers, and no one criticised the policy but the announcement, however, should have been made before August. I phoned the Minister for Education and Science and she washed her hands of the issue. When I phoned the Minister of State&rsquo;s office, no one could tell me who was in charge of the system. There was a complete lack of accountability and transparency. VECs and school principals found themselves in a very awkward situation.</P>
    <P>Has the Government learned lessons from this shambles? It is planning a similar move for primary schools in December, a better time of the year, so it should apply those lessons when putting the new arrangements in place. Deputy Michael Moynihan, who is a member of the Joint Committee on Education and Science, was inundated with telephone calls from those across the country who faced chaos. I compliment the staff of the VECs, who were in an impossible situation. We attended many public meetings. This was not an issue in Dublin but it affected every other county. I hope the Department has learned from this episode.</P>
    <P>Catchment areas are another burning issue. Some people believe they should be reviewed, and I see merit in that, but I also see dangers because the problem could be made worse further down the line. Parents need some flexibility, however, when children attend the same school, particularly brothers and sisters. We had a crazy scenario in Carlow last year where children sitting examinations received bus tickets while their siblings at the same school, but in a different year, did not get tickets. The issue was finally resolved but it was not handled well.</P>
    <P>Who is responsible for children when they have been dropped off at school and before they are collected? At one school in Carlow, instead of there being two buses, one bus operates two runs. One group of children arrives early in the morning and a second is collected late in the evening. There is ambiguity about who is responsible for those children. The Minister for Education and Science has intimated that it is the responsibility of the board of management of the school but it has stated that is not the case. The issue should be examined.</P>
    <P>Teachers finish work at 3 p.m and in most schools they invariably stay on after hours and there is no difficulty with that. Some day, however, a teacher who normally stays behind will have to leave and there might be an accident that could lead to a court case or, worse, a fatality. The Department must set out clear guidelines on this and let the boards of management know <Col N="1537"/>exactly who is responsible for children before school begins and after it ends.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State&rsquo;s speech is 14 pages long but there was not a single mention of the independent audit mentioned by the Taoiseach in the D&aacute;il a few weeks ago. Has that been dropped? Has the Taoiseach rolled back on that issue? Why was it not mentioned in the Minister of State&rsquo;s speech?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SiledeValera"><NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
	<P>I will have an opportunity to mention it when I am concluding.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>It does not inspire confidence when such a major issue is not mentioned. Fine Gael would support an independent audit of school transport, as outlined by the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>Senator Ormonde remarked that there are fewer children now travelling by school bus than ever before but the school bus budget has spiralled out of control in the context of the numbers travelling. We must remember that other costs are involved.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris said that children should be allowed to go to any school they want. The State has a limited amount of money and there is an onus on it to provide transport for children who live more than three miles from the nearest school and within reason in other cases. We cannot, however, have a scenario where children in Bagenalstown who decide to go to Carlow can expect a bus service automatically. That is not possible, although children who want to go a gaelscoil or Church of Ireland school are allowed to go if there is no available school in the area.</P>
    <P>I would like to hear the Minister of State outline the arrangements for the independent audit of school transport and receive an assurance that the Government will have learned something from the shambles of last August by the time the primary school regulations come into effect.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TomMorrissey"><NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House. We are holding these statements in the context of a bleak year in the safety of our school transport system. Recently there was a fire on a bus in County Meath and in another incident, a 13 year old boy fell from the emergency exit of a school bus in Monaghan. Last month, a school bus and a waste disposal lorry were involved in a collision near Roscommon, resulting in seven teenagers and another passenger being taken to hospital. There was also the tragic death of Michael White near Clara in County Offaly and the five teenage schoolgirls who died following the crash in Kentstown near Navan last year. The House will join in restating our expressions of sympathy and regret to all those who are hurt or who suffer loss on our roads. The current situation is not acceptable and we must try harder to make our transport system as safe as possible.</P>
    <P Just="Left">There is no doubt there are problems with the school transport system. That is acknowledged and steps are being taken to address the issue. <Col N="1538"/>We must examine the situation objectively. More than 135,000 children are carried on school transport services each day to primary and post-primary schools. Taxpayers invest over &euro;120 million in the service and deserve the best and safest facilities for their money. In addition to this service, Bus &Eacute;ireann also provides 10,000 tickets to school children to travel on local and national bus and rail services. More than 3,200 vehicles are on the road every day ferrying children to and from school. These are both Bus &Eacute;ireann and contractor vehicles. The operation is a large one and any adjustment will not happen easily or overnight, although some in this House have spoken as if that were possible.</P>
    <P>It is not useful to make statements to the effect that the transport fleet that is entrusted to take our children to school is now the least safe method of public transport. Nor is it any great comfort to those who were injured or who have lost a loved one to know that Ireland has one of the best international safety records with regard to school buses. In this area, as in many others, we must make further progress in reaching a reasoned and useful assessment.</P>
    <P>The school transport system is an extensive operation and thankfully, the school bus fleet has had a good record since its introduction in the late 1960s. Much of the debate on school transport safety has centred on the age of the bus fleet. The average age of the fleet, comprising both Bus &Eacute;ireann and private buses, is approximately 11 years. This is not of particular concern. We should move away from a discussion of the age of the fleet and focus on the issues that concern parents, for example, the roadworthiness of the buses that ferry children to school.</P>
    <P>Roadworthiness is a key factor, although it is not always a black and white issue. The bus that was involved in a fire recently, for example, had passed its annual roadworthiness test last August and was checked, under the maintenance programme, at the end of March of this year. Therefore, focusing on the age of the bus, roadworthiness testing or any other single issue will not provide us with all of the answers.</P>
    <P>One concern about the roadworthiness checks is the fact that they are carried out by CIE staff, which is a less than ideal situation. If possible, school buses should be checked independently, but given the numbers involved, such a change is easier said than done. That said, I commend the Government on its recent move to investigate this possibility.</P>
    <P>Another topic that is often highlighted when school transport is discussed is the fitting and wearing of seat belts. Again, there is no easy solution to this problem. Recently a boy fell from the emergency exit of a school bus. That bus was fitted with seat belts and signs instructing the children to wear the safety belts. In that context, solutions are not as obvious as some would lead us to believe.</P><Col N="1539"/>
    <P>I recently read correspondence from the Canada Safety Council to the National Safety Council of Ireland on the issue of bus safety. The council pointed out that, statistically, the school bus is the safest way for children to get to and from school. Without a bus, children are exposed to the risk of walking to school or using other forms of transport. Most injuries happen outside of the school bus. Children are 16 times more safe riding in a school bus than any other passenger vehicle. The Canada Safety Council also argues that seat belts would not make school buses any safer.</P>
    <P Just="Left">We know there are problems with the school transport system. The system itself is extensive and there is no single, easy fix to the problem. With regard to the age and road-worthiness of the fleet and the fitting of seat belts, we need reasoned, broad and considered action. Outrage, while understandable, or hand wringing and desk thumping, will only get us so far. We can do better and much work is being undertaken to improve the situation.</P>
    <P>The school bus replacement programme has been in place since 2000. In that time, Bus &Eacute;ireann has spent over &euro;6 million on new vehicles. This will help to address the bus age and roadworthiness issues. All school buses operating within the school transport scheme will be equipped with seat belts from next year. The three children to two seats arrangement will be discontinued next year. The Government is to be commended for ordering a full review of the maintenance testing of Bus &Eacute;ireann fleet vehicles and those contracted to the school transport service. We are making progress on a number of fronts and I am sure the Government will remain open-minded with regard to other steps that can be taken.</P>
    <P>The National Parents Council has recently considered motions calling on the Department of Education and Science to introduce a road safety module to the primary school curriculum. It has also argued that it should be illegal for vehicles to overtake a school bus when it has stopped to pick up or set down children. I look forward to hearing the Minister of State&rsquo;s views on these ideas.</P>
    <P>We cannot latch on to a single panacea, cure-all or silver bullet when it comes to school transport safety, or road safety generally. We know the issue is complex. Addressing the age of the bus fleet, examining the roadworthiness testing system and fitting seat belts are all part of the solution. None alone represents the entire answer. The Government is taking steps that will pay dividends but they will take time. I encourage all to be proactive, open minded and patient as we move towards delivering the safest possible transport system for the country&rsquo;s children.</P>
    <P>I remember the introduction of the school transport system. Indeed, I used the school transport system in Cashel in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Without the school bus, I do not know how <Col N="1540"/>we would have got to school. I suppose we would have walked through the fields. A three-mile rule applied at the time and our house was only 2.6 miles from the school. However, we were picked up by the bus on the way out from the school, which meant that we actually travelled over seven miles to school every morning. My fondest memories of that time are of the journeys and the social interaction that took place on the buses.</P>

   <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House. I was interested to hear some of Senator Morrissey&rsquo;s comments regarding his memories of going to school. I also have memories of my time on school buses, but in the context of today&rsquo;s discussion, they might not be the most appropriate topic to deal with now.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State has become very familiar with the safety concerns that exist since she took on the onerous task of dealing with school transport safety within the Department of Education and Science. There are difficulties surrounding the management of passengers on school buses and Senator Morrissey alluded to that fact. My own experience, as well as stories I have heard from bus drivers, backs up the fact that it can be a difficult task to control pupils. As Senator Morrissey has outlined, there is no single solution that will resolve the problems that exist.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister of State for resolving the seat belt issue and for ensuring that it will no longer be acceptable to carry three pupils to every two seats on buses. I applaud the way in which the Minister tackled these issues and fought hard to secure the necessary funding. Such changes will bring about a much safer situation for the transport of school children and are very welcome. However, we must ensure that students wear the seat belts that are put in place at enormous cost to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>Some contributors have said that travelling on a school bus is one of the safest ways to get to school. However, there has been an increase in the number of serious incidents involving school buses, some with very tragic consequences. It is important that school buses are maintained to a very high standard and perhaps the standard should be set even higher than is currently the case, particularly as more information becomes available and technologies improve.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the hiring of private buses by the State, through Bus &Eacute;ireann, to augment the school bus fleet. I recently met members of the Private Association of Motor Bus Owners, PAMBO, which represents a large number of private operators who are doing their best to provide a good service. They expressed concern that the highly competitive nature of the tendering process has the potential to lead to a compromising of safety standards. While some would argue that such a statement is to be expected from PAMBO, its members argued that there are rogue operators within the private bus market who are prepared to drive down the <Col N="1541"/>tendering price by compromising safety standards.</P>
    <P>Allegations have been made to me that vehicle test certificates can be bought. I have no direct proof of that but it has been brought to my attention that this happened in a number of cases. If that is true, it is very serious because if the State&rsquo;s testing system is being compromised it might jeopardise the service being provided. A number of bus operators would say that the rogue operators who have equipment that does not satisfy the safety standards but who succeeded in getting safety certificates are operating in an environment that allows them tender at a lower price and that the individual tendering the lower price sets the market for the others. Operators are indicating to me that they are not in a position to carry out regular maintenance on their buses because of what they call a cut-throat business. Their margins are at such a low level they are not in a position to ensure their fleet meets the required standard. If that is the case it is very serious.</P>
    <P>I base that assessment on conversations I have had with members of PAMBO, people whom I know and believe to be of the highest repute. They are reputable operators and they are in a position to make these type of allegations. They indicate that there are people driving buses without the requisite licence to do so. If that is the case, it is very serious. If these rogue operators are in the marketplace they are creating difficulty for legitimate operators and a hand-to-mouth type situation which is making it more difficult to ensure safety standards are adhered to.</P>
    <P>The cost of oil and other such elements are creating problems too. The Minister of State is aware of the figures. A total of &euro;112 million is spent annually on school transport, 30% of which relates to children with special needs. The Minister of State outlined the position in detail. What she is doing in that area is of exceptional benefit to many people but there is a huge cost because of the support children must get in that regard. A total of &euro;44 million of the allocation is spent on the private bus element and &euro;36 million is spent on the public side through Bus &Eacute;ireann. However, there are four times as many private buses in operation as there are Bus &Eacute;ireann buses. There is a huge disparity in terms of the numbers yet the costs are relatively close. That appears to suggest we are not spending enough on the private fleet and seems to bear out the point made by the members of PAMBO.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister of State to inquire about the issue that has been raised and carry out a review of the standards of testing to ensure these rogue operators do not jeopardise the safety of our children. I have no doubt the proposed road safety authority will have responsibility for the management of the test and perhaps therein lies the solution.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister of State to the House. She was a familiar figure in Limerick West recently with regard to the problem we had with the school bus for the secondary school in Askeaton. I am glad the matter was satisfactorily resolved for the people from the Ballybrown area in particular who were able to continue using the school bus facility. The Minister of State may recall that because of demographic changes and the educational scene in Limerick city area particularly, many of the parents felt they were being set adrift and were anxious that their children attend the school in Askeaton. The matter was satisfactorily resolved however, although I realise the Minister of State was adhering to the Department guidelines at the time. I hope a similar problem will not arise in September for the pupils attending those schools and that the Ballybrown pupils, and also the new pupils, can continue their education in the secondary school.</P>
    <P>School transport is focused sharply in people&rsquo;s minds now as a result of several recent tragedies. Any of us who have travelled to America in particular will have noticed the yellow school buses which appear to be very sturdy. Some of the school buses used here are 17 or 18 years old. Following the fire on a school bus recently, which happened very quickly, one could see the flimsy structure that was left after it had been put out.</P>
    <P>We must seriously consider modernising the school transport fleet. I realise economics dictate the number of school buses provided but there is something wrong when school buses start to break down. I raised a problem with a school bus in Galbally, which broke down frequently, on the Adjournment. That bus is 18 years old and it makes one wonder if the school bus fleet is satisfactory.</P>
    <P>Questions have arisen over some of the buses in the fleet. Bus &Eacute;ireann does an excellent job in maintaining the fleet but questions must be asked because in the recent case the bus had been serviced only recently. Bus &Eacute;ireann admitted subsequently that there was an engineering fault with the bus. This issue will remain in sharp focus for many people.</P>
    <P>There is concern also about school buses in rural locations carrying primary and secondary level children in the same bus. I would be interested to know if there has been any movement on the seat belt issue. The objective was to move in the direction of eliminating the three-for-two seat belt arrangement and there was talk of the second level institutions also. Has there been any progress with regard to the primary schools because primary and secondary students are often carried on the same bus? How does that equate in terms of modernising the bus fleet?</P>
    <P>Private bus routes operate in many rural locations because the parents want to maintain a link with a preferred school outside the regular catchment area. In that case they pay the school fee to the bus providers on a weekly basis, usually <Col N="1543"/>a private provider. In that context, what is the scope with regard to the maintenance of those buses and in ensuring they conform to test standards? What is required is an audit of school buses with regard to the existing resource, mechanical deficiency and so on. The same should be done on the private side.</P>
    <P>A special committee was set up after the tragedy in Meath a year ago but I understand that committee has met only once. Perhaps the Minister will confirm that. What has the committee achieved since then? As a result of what happened with the private bus in Offaly, the accident in Meath and the recent fire, where thankfully no one was hurt but it could have been catastrophic, people&rsquo;s minds are focused on the efficiency of our bus service and it behoves us to ensure we have an effective school bus service for our pupils.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy de Valera, to the House and compliment her on the work she has done in her Department. The Minister of State is responsible for school and she has made a major impact on that area over the past few years.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State has told us that approximately 135,000 children use school transport with an additional 9,000 having a ticket to obtain transport by other means. She said also that 33% of those children availing of school transport have special needs and approximately 600 people are employed to escort those children. That is an important service. Those figures speak for themselves. It is a success.</P>
    <P>Regarding catchment areas and school transport, bus routes should not be set in stone but there is reluctance to change routes in rural areas. Many children must go to a crossroads or junction to catch a school bus which then travels a road on which there are few houses. Many of those children may live on a nearby road and it would not add much mileage to put the bus on that road. From time to time parents approach us about changing routes, but for whatever reason, we do not seem to do so. We should consider the route which would allow the maximum number of children to be collected, even if it means a slightly longer journey.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister of State&rsquo;s comments on safety and the steps she has taken on flashing lights on buses and introducing safety belts on all buses by the end of 2006. Whether a school is based in a rural area or a town, parents also have a responsibility. Many parents deliver children to school by car but they do not park their cars, they abandon them. School buses try to get in and out to collect and drop off children. This dangerous practice is not the fault of the bus drivers, it is simply that of irresponsible parents. The Department and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na should take action. Parking or abandoning cars should not be allowed within a defined area around a school.</P><Col N="1544"/>
    <P>The students themselves also have responsibility. In a recent case, a young person fell from a school bus through an emergency exit. Those buses are required to have emergency exits in the event of a crash. They do not spring open. Someone must interfere with the mechanism to open them. Parents have a major responsibility to outline to their children that they must sit down and stay in their seats on the school bus.</P>
    <P>Recently, we had a sad occasion when a crash involving a school bus occurred in my county. We were extremely lucky that it led to only one fatality, although, unfortunately, one fatality is one too many. I am delighted the Minister of State mentioned that flashing lights can be used when children disembark from buses in rural areas, as fatalities have occurred. It is hoped the situation will improve.</P>
    <P>A good State testing system is in place. People going for tests with buses or trucks have told me in the past that they had to get cracked glass on tail-lights or headlights replaced. We must do more spot-checking on bus drivers and ensure they are licensed and properly qualified. In the event of something happening to a bus, temporary replacements are used. That is not on. It would be better to leave the children at home than take a chance by using an inferior bus to transport them.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister of State for her work on school transport. It has been a major success for many years and many people are in extremely good employment because the Minister of State and the school transport system afforded them the opportunity to attend school. They may not have had that opportunity if the school transport system was not in place.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SiledeValera"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Cathaoirleach. I am delighted to be here to listen to the Senators&rsquo; remarks. My overriding concern is safety. I hope the ethos of safety permeates the speech I gave earlier and, more important, the day to day work we do in the Department on all of the issues referred to today, particularly those on the three for two seats, seat belts etc.</P>
    <P Just="Left">Getting rid of the three-for-two meant we had to find further capacity for 3,500 students to ensure all eligible students had a seat. To put Senator Tuffy&rsquo;s mind at rest, all buses being introduced will have seat belts on them. I reiterate that as far back as May of last year I stated on RTE radio that we should go beyond the directive of 9 May, which only refers to the use of seat belts where they are provided. I felt we should have seat belts on all school buses.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris also raised this issue. I stated we will have seat belts on all school buses and our target for doing so is December 2006. We will have a seat with a seat belt for each student. That was reiterated in a press statement the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Hanafin, and <Col N="1545"/>I issued last July. We are keeping up with those targets.</P>
    <P>I am glad so many Senators referred to the flashing lights. All research shows that the real danger is within the vicinity of the bus when people are getting on or off. The information I received back from that pilot scheme is that it was extremely successful. I hope to roll it out throughout the country.</P>
    <P>This is the first time we will introduce dedicated school buses, and a total of 20 will be introduced. Work on that started with the introduction of school buses in Meath and Kildare prior to the great tragedy of May of last year. Bearing in mind all of those accidents, I hope people understand the work we do in the Department emphasises safety first and foremost.</P>
    <P>Reference has also been made to special needs. I make no apology to anyone for spending the necessary amount of money to ensure our special needs children have the same opportunities as everyone else to attend school. It is not true to state that all, or a great deal, of the money spent is on special needs. Yes, a large portion, one third, of the budget is spent on special needs children. However, even taking that one third out of the equation, the amount of money to be spent on school transport has doubled since 1997.</P>
    <P>It is also important to point out that if a bus is second hand it does not mean it is not safe. At all times, we must ensure a maintenance regime is in place. An annual roadworthiness test applies to all goods vehicles as well as buses. It is carried out by designated garages on behalf of the Department of Transport, which has responsibility for legislation and regulation in this regard.</P>

	<P>I was just coming to that.</P>
    <P>Bus &Eacute;ireann also services its vehicles every 12 weeks or 10,000 miles, whichever comes first. Senator Burke and others raised the important point this afternoon of the independent review of Bus &Eacute;ireann buses. It is incorrect for Senator Burke to state the Taoiseach made a statement under pressure to this effect in the D&aacute;il earlier. The day before the Taoiseach made that statement in the D&aacute;il, the Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen, had already initiated discussions with CIE and Bus &Eacute;ireann on this matter, asking for an independent review within Bus &Eacute;ireann of the arrangements and systems in place for the management, operation and maintenance of its fleet, both owned and contracted. This was to ensure ongoing safety and roadworthiness. The Minister has asked that this review be completed as soon as possible, as he wants it at the earliest date possible.</P>
    <P>A number of people raised the question of catchment areas and boundaries. I outlined the <Col N="1546"/>issues relating to this in my initial contribution. Where there is concession for students, it will be where there is room on a bus. That is on a term-to-term basis and has always been so. That is the current position. I do not accept that the arrangements for school transport last September were in any way a shambles. We were trying to phase out the three-for-two system. The Senators should give me a good time during a school year to phase it out.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>It would not be August.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SiledeValera"><NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>

	<P>It is important to point out that at the beginning of every school year there can and will be delays, as people see if they have a concessionary place on a bus. Many people eligible for buses do not let the Department know early enough to deal with the issue.</P>

   <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>Why is it not flagged earlier?</P>
   </Speaker>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SiledeValera"><NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Tuffy referred to whether the target would be met on the three-for-two issue. Eligible people have not contacted the Department to let us know the position, and we cannot give away a place which is already designated for an eligible person unless we know that eligible person does not wish to take the place.</P>
    <P>I refer particularly to the order on a school bus, a matter which Senator Ormonde and others raised. At the beginning of the next school year, when everybody is gearing up to go back to school, we will have an advertisement on television and other media emphasising the importance of wearing seat belts. We look forward to working with parents, teachers and students to ensure seat belts are worn and that the importance of wearing them is put across to students.</P>
    <P>Senator Tuffy also mentioned our deadlines. We have begun the retro-fitting of seat belts on school buses. Some 20 per week are being fitted out. So as not to have further disruption within schools, we are ensuring that the major work on retro-fitting will take place during the summer months. The retro-fitting of seat belts where needed is on target for completion by December 2006, as promised.</P>
    <P>Senator Tuffy may have had some difficulty understanding what I was saying with regard to the directive. The directive only goes so far, and we in the Department believe this is not far <Col N="1547"/>enough with regard to the school transport system. We wish to go beyond that directive. We will have far more stringent regulations, and we will have a seat belt for every child.</P>
    <P>Vetting was another issue which was mentioned, and it is a very important issue with regard to codes of practice. Bus escorts are currently vetted, and arrangements are being made for the vetting of drivers. There is ongoing liaison with the Garda vetting office on the issue, as it has the responsibility in this regard.</P>
    <P>Roadworthiness is top of our agenda, and I have explained the current situation and what the Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen, is doing in that regard. I have explained the tests involved and the review which has been requested. I have referred to the importance of flashing lights and I hope to run such a system throughout the country. We are on target for providing seat belts for each child by December 2006, and we are on target with regard to the three-for-two system.</P>
    <P>I assure the House that we are looking at every opportunity to improve safety with regard to school transport. We are open-minded in doing this, and we are prepared to listen to any proposal put forward. I disagree with the sweeping statements made by Senator Browne, where he stated that finances relating to school transport were &ldquo;spiralling out of control&rdquo;. I assure the Senator that every penny we fight for in that part of the Department is used well. I make no apologies to anyone for looking for further funding as needs progress.</P>

	<P>I want to refer to an issue which Senator Dooley raised, namely, the standards of the school transport scheme. The standards are very high, and those in the scheme must comply with all the rules and regulation set down by the Department of Transport. If Senator Dooley has evidence, he should let the relevant authorities know. None of us would stand over a situation as described by the Senator, nor would we wish to.</P>
    <P>I thank Senators for the debate and giving me the opportunity to assure the House that we are continuing to do all we can to improve the safety of our transport system.</P>

    <P FLI="0">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, back to the House. We were here for three hours yesterday on Committee Stage of this Bill, and there was a good debate. Many interesting points were raised.</P>
    <P>I have submitted this amendment again, and we gave it a good airing yesterday. It would give the road safety authority the power to look after maintenance, road signage, markings and a number of other issues. It would act to pull a number of agencies together with regard to areas of responsibility. These would include, for example, the Garda; the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform; the Department of Transport; the Department of the Environment and Local Government; and local government. All these could be pulled together by one agency, the road safety authority. This amendment would ensure this would be done effectively and state the purpose in the legislation.</P>

These functions include those relating to the driving test, registration of driving instructors. etc.</P><Col N="1549"/>
    <P>With regard to the various subsections, registration of vehicles lies with the Revenue Commissioners and we intend to leave it with them. Driver testing is covered and the registration of qualified driving instructors has also been covered. The national driver file is held by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government but both the Department of Transport and the road safety authority will have full access to it, to ensure its maintenance. If we were to change the situation it would create practical difficulties. It may take some time and would involve software changes. The Department and the road safety authority has adequate responsibility.</P>
    <P Just="Left">We are working on the rules of the road, which will be published very soon and will be available in Irish. Road signage and markings are matters for the National Roads Authority and the local authorities, which, under section 7, will be two of the State agencies with a direct link to the road safety authority. It is important for the authority to consult with them on the matter. Policy advice to the Minister and certain other bodies is also dealt with.</P>
    <P>While most of what Senator Paddy Burke proposes is dealt with in the Bill, there are justifiable reasons for what is omitted. There is a lot of goodwill for what Senator Paddy Burke and Senator Brian Hayes propose but the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government will have responsibility for the file and the Revenue Commissioners for the registration of vehicles.</P>

	<P>I second the amendment. What Senator Paddy Burke has said is endorsed by the failure rates. There is a connection between test failure rates and the numbers who provide driving tuition. While people who are accredited and licensed have established themselves as reputable outfits, changes in testing procedures in the past five to ten years have made it an urgent necessity to impose higher standards on those seeking to establish themselves as instructors and collect fees for tuition.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>I have no difficulty with the principle of what Senator Paddy Burke proposes. It is only right and proper that the Bill provides for functions relating to the registration of instructors, to be specified in regulations made under the Road Traffic Acts. The new authority will be designated as an approved body and can issue instruction certificates for the purpose of regulating driving instructors but there is no power in the Road Traffic Acts to regulate driving schools. Section 18 of the Road Traffic Act 1968, as amended by section 19 of the Road Traffic Act 2002, is intended to regulate individuals who provide driving instruction.</P>
    <P>Driving instructors and driving schools are different entities. The former will require certificates and will have to maintain high standards, to which end they will be check tested at regular intervals. If found not to meet the required standards they will be removed from the register so the tests will be stringent. If we were to introduce the provision overnight, however, there would be a vacuum so there will be a moratorium for a period. It will all dovetail within a reasonable time.</P>
    <P>There are no powers under this Bill or the other Road Traffic Acts to regulate driving schools but they are regulated under company law. The relevant section of the Bill will address the issues with which both Senators are concerned.</P>

	<P>Amendments Nos. 4 to 6, inclusive, are related and may be discussed together by agreement.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. P. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
    <P LI="1">In page 17, to delete lines 33 to 42.</P>
    <P FLI="0">These amendments were discussed in detail on Committee Stage. They relate to the Minister&rsquo;s <Col N="1551"/>intention to exclude Members of the Oireachtas, MEPs and local authority councillors from membership of the road safety authority. Members were able to understand why MEPs and Members of the Oireachtas should be precluded from the board of the authority but there is no reason why local authority members should. They have vast experience of road safety, realigning roads, speed limits, etc. Members on all sides of the House &mdash; the Government, the Fine Gael benches and the Independent Senators &mdash; were all of the same opinion.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State gave an assurance that he would review the matter overnight and come back with a positive response today. I hope he will accept the amendment because, as Senator O&rsquo;Toole pointed out yesterday, there have been precedents where similar provisions in Bills put forward by parliamentary draftsmen were removed. There is no reason why this provision cannot be removed as well.</P>
    <P>I implore the Minister of State, even at this late stage, to accept the amendments. I have discussed the matter with my colleague in the other House, Deputy Olivia Mitchell, and she will see to it that the Bill is allowed a quick passage through the other House if the Minister of State wants to re-amend it. I believe he is fully committed to this proposal, though there may be obstacles in his way. Perhaps the Minister, Deputy Cullen, is not in favour of it. The Minister of State indicated he has no problem with the proposal and on Committee Stage he assured Senators that he hoped to return on Report Stage with a favourable response.</P>
    <P>There are more than 1,000 local authority members, both town and county councillors. They have considerable expertise in the area of road safety having collectively acquired thousands of years experience of local government. Surely they would have much to offer the board of the road safety authority. It is an insult to members of local authorities that they should be precluded from membership of the road safety authority on the grounds that they have been elected to represent the public. I ask the Minister of State to reconsider the provision and accept my amendment.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment. I am pleased to have an opportunity to speak to the amendment because I was in the Chair during discussion of a similar Committee Stage amendment, which prevented me from contributing to the debate. The Minister of State will recall that on Second Stage he handed a Senator a list featuring the names of members of the road safety authority. When they were read out Senators paid tribute to the individuals in question and noted their suitability for the positions to which they had been appointed. The chairman, Mr. Gay Byrne, for example, was described as an inspired <Col N="1552"/>choice, while the list also featured a rally driver and former county manager.</P>
    <P>Having served with councillors such as Peter Feeney, Bridie Willers, Michael Mullins, Tom McHugh and Tiernan Walsh, I oppose the decision to prevent local authority members from contributing as members of the road safety authority which is committed to improving safety on our roads. The proposal appears to follow an agenda set some time ago and which has become apparent in all legislation providing for the making of public appointments. Exceptions should be made to this policy, including with regard to appointments to the road safety authority.</P>
    <P>During an earlier debate on school transport many Government Senators identified the quality of roads as a major factor in accidents, including the recent tragedy involving a school bus in County Meath. I mean no disrespect to Members when I state that councillors are in a particularly good position to make a contribution to road safety. Having considered the matter overnight, I ask the Minister of State to accept the amendment.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DiarmuidWilson"><NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
	<P>As I indicated during the Committee Stage debate, I fully support the amendments which, as Senator Paddy Burke noted, secured cross-party support. It would be unfortunate if we were to continue with the recent trend of barring members of local authorities from sitting on particular State boards. It is lunacy to suggest that an individual considered good enough to sit on the board of the road safety authority would be deemed unsuitable for the position if he or she were elected to serve a community on a local authority. This is a ludicrous suggestion, with which I know the Minister of State disagrees.</P>
    <P>As a former member of a local authority, the Minister of State will be aware of the work done by county councillors. They have vast experience, with a collective involvement in local government of hundreds of years in each county. They represent people, deal with road safety issues on a daily basis and lobby to secure improvements in their respective localities. Despite this, they are not considered good enough to sit on the board charged with overall responsibility for road safety for no other reason than their membership of a local authority. This proposal must not proceed and Members must take action to stop it.</P>
    <P>If the Minister of State cannot see fit to accept the amendments and chooses instead to send out the message to local authority members that they have no role in the road safety authority, I and my colleagues who spoke against the provisions will be forced to vote in favour of the amendments. The Minister of State gave a commitment that he would do all in his power to change the provision and I accept he would have done so if it had been possible. Having known him for many years, he is a man of his word and a friend of local authority members, as he has proved time <Col N="1553"/>and again. I implore him to accept the amendments.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the comments of the three previous speakers. I am disappointed that a provision to preclude members of local authorities from membership of the road safety authority has come before the House. It shows a lack of consideration and respect for the democratic process as well as those who put themselves forward for election. A similar provision was proposed during the lifetime of the previous Seanad. From speaking to Ministers at that time, I am aware that many Ministers in different Departments were disposed towards removing the provision but had difficulty with their own officials in this regard. Nevertheless, a number of them took the courageous decision to remove similar provisions, which at one point featured in a great deal of new legislation. These provisions have now reappeared and it is incumbent on Senators to cry &ldquo;Halt&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I also agree with the comments of Senator Wilson and Paddy Burke regarding the Minister of State. Given his experience of councillors and the democratic process, he will be disposed to listen to the arguments Senators make. I hope, therefore, that a way can be found to remove this provision as it is an insult to people across the county who put themselves forward for election and represent the public on State bodies. While I do not advocate appointing councillors to every public body, if a local authority member has the expertise needed to make a positive and constructive contribution to a State body, he or she should not be prevented from being appointed to one.</P>
    <P>The changes being made to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including the formation of joint policing committees, will give councillors a much greater involvement in all policing activities, for instance, traffic control. Most, if not all, councillors receive regular statistics updates on road accidents and so forth and carry out their own assessments of areas in their locality which present a high risk of road accidents. Once established, the membership of any of these boards is open to a ministerial decision. I cannot understand, however, how legislation can be brought before the House which automatically excludes people simply because they are involved in the democratic process. It is unfair, unjust and probably would not stand up to any sort of scrutiny or assessment by due process.</P>
    <P>I join with those who have argued that the subsection should be deleted. I ask the Minister of State not to put us in the embarrassing position whereby we, who feel so strongly about this, would have to go through the division lobby to support something to which we are fundamentally opposed. It is unfair, unjust and should not happen. I appeal to the Minister of State to run with the Opposition amendments which, as has been said, can be dealt with easily in the Lower House. That happens from time to time when <Col N="1554"/>Bills which are initiated in this House are amended in the Lower House and dealt with swiftly when they come back here. I urge that that be done in this case.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="GeraldineFeeney"><NameTxt>Ms Feeney</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senators from both sides of the House who have sought the acceptance of this amendment. Last week, on Second Stage we all sang from the same hymn sheet. I commend the Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, for taking the approach he did last night and reflecting on the matter to see if there was anything he could do about it. I appeal to him now to examine the matter carefully and fairly. As local representatives, councillors know best what is going on in their own areas. They are responsible for roads and road safety but are being left out of this authority because they are public representatives. That is a terrible indictment of us as legislators.</P>
    <P>During last week&rsquo;s debate on Second Stage, somebody said that when Bills come before the House to establish public bodies, a list of people are exempt from membership. It seems to be a uniform approach but perhaps now is the time to abandon it and examine each Bill separately. Some public bodies may not be able to accommodate local representatives but this particular one should do so.</P>
    <P>On Second Stage, I also spoke of the importance of having a number of youth representatives on the authority. The Minister of State should re-examine that relevant point because many road fatalities involve young people. Middle-aged politicians, Gay Byrne and others who will be members of the authority may not be able to get through to such young people. Their peers might have more influence on them, however. Without labouring the point, I ask the Minister of State to use his influence. I know how persuasive he can be when it comes to something as vital as this. I call on him to use those powers.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>Reflecting on the last few remarks of our friend and colleague, Senator Feeney, how could the Minister of State possibly ignore the flattery of such a distinguished Member of the House? She has put forward a passionate argument in favour of the amendment, to which I add my voice. Senator Jim Walsh&rsquo;s comments reminded me that I was present in this House when a previous Government withdrew a similar amendment in the face of similar passionate arguments from all sides. The fact that the then Government was a rainbow Government, and did not have all the numbers in the House, may certainly have focused its mind. Nonetheless, it could have made an issue of it subsequently, as we all know, but graciously accepted there was an overwhelming argument. Like Senator Jim Walsh, I thought this matter had been put to bed.</P>
    <P>It reminds me of the computer term &ldquo;default&rdquo; with which we are all familiar. It is an automatic entry whenever one presses a particular button. It seems to me that, in the absence of a contrary <Col N="1555"/>viewpoint from the Minister of State, this is not a Government policy written in stone. It is a default operated by the parliamentary draftspeople who insert this section automatically in most Bills on the basis of precedent. In other words, we do it because we do it. There is no particular reason it is done but we do it anyway because it has been there from the year dot. In this day and age, however, that argument does not hold up any more.</P>
    <P>Without labouring the point, there is an extra dimension to this issue. When one considers the amount of expertise available to a local authority, why will it be denied not just to this authority but to every other authority whose legislative establishment is debated in this House? Like Senators Wilson, Jim Walsh, Feeney and, I presume, Senator Dooley, I will be marching through the lobbies to vote against something with which I fundamentally agree. We do it because, in the main, we are all party politicians who sign up for the good and the bad. If the Minister of State refuses to accept this amendment, it will be a bad day.</P>
    <P>In anticipation of what he may or may not say, I understand the Minister of State&rsquo;s position in that he must discharge his own responsibilities in this regard. While none of us would suggest that his heart does not lie where ours do, I hope he will have something positive to say about this matter. If the amendment falls, the plea that has been made on both sides of the House will hopefully ensure this type of section will not appear in future legislation.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>In speaking about this issue on Committee Stage yesterday, I said that, whatever about Oireachtas Members and MEPs, the exclusion of local councillors from such bodies is disgraceful. It is an affront to democracy to debar local councillors from this authority and other State boards. Councillors have a vast amount of experience in road safety and other areas. They are responsible for setting speed limits and for roads in their areas. It is disgraceful to decide, with one stroke of the pen, that they are not qualified to serve on bodies such as the road safety authority.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister of State will agree to the amendment, which has been genuinely supported by Members on the Government side of the House. This is a matter of principle that affects each and every one of us. Why are local representatives, who are elected by the people, being debarred from these boards? That is the question that must be asked. If this policy is passed by the House this evening, will it apply in future to every other board? I ask the Minister of State to concede the point, since he said he had been a member of a local authority for many years. If it is decided that members of local authorities are not qualified, it is a poor day for democracy.</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="1556"/>
   <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>I join with colleagues in asking the Minister of State to give serious consideration to this amendment, which is put forward for all the right reasons. The Minister of State might think that, as Senators, we are just protecting our electorate. I have spoken in almost all recent debates on the establishment of authorities. While this issue did not arise in the past, I have always had the view that as a society we are moving too much responsibility into a bureaucratic environment. However, members of the public do not see it like that. They still demand of Government the kind of functions that are often passed to authorities. If there is a problem in an authority, as elected representatives, we get the blame, regardless of the authority&rsquo;s position. I understand why Members of the Houses would not be included as board members on this authority, namely, we have our say in terms of policy and the enactment of the legislation. However, councillors are a totally different category.</P>
    <P>Road safety, as the Minister is aware, is one of the topics of great interest at present due to the carnage on our roads. It is widely accepted by those who have a view as to the resolution of this matter that a solution will require the buy-in of the public. To suggest that we can devolve responsibility to some authority or other bureaucracy without retaining a link to the community is a fallacy. Members of a local authority could bring to bear a connection between the functions of the local authority, particularly given the work they do in terms of setting speed limits, maintaining roads, dealing with signage and remaining in contact with the community. It is a concern that the road safety authority has the capacity to become another bureaucracy with some level of remove.</P>
    <P>The NRA does not have this kind of bar. I am aware of at least one and possibly two members of local authorities who served with great distinction on the NRA. From talking to NRA members, I know they recognise that the input from a member of a local authority, Ms Connie N&iacute; Fh&aacute;tharta, was of great benefit in terms of the deliberations of that authority. The same kind of sanity and understanding of the nuts and bolts on the ground could be applied in this case.</P>
    <P>It can be argued that professionals from different backgrounds should be involved in safety regulations and standards, and so on. However, in practical terms, the councillor is closest to the man on the ground and closest to the knowledge base. I am sure the Minister of State has retained contact with the man on the ground. Even when he served in Europe, he still acted in a clear way to his constituents. The same kind of contact is needed in this regard. We know what happened with An Bord Plean&aacute;la when it was pushed to a remove away from those who had an interest or an involvement in the local community or local authority. It was a retrograde step. It would be sad if it were allowed to happen in this regard.</P><Col N="1557"/>
    <P>Apart from road safety, the section to some extent casts a slur on the work of members of local authorities and councillors. I realise this is not the Minister of State&rsquo;s intention. He has worked closely with councillors, with whom he has developed a strong link. However, I am concerned as to why this measure was included. It would be a bad day if it was introduced. I hope the Minister can help us in this regard.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I support my colleagues, none of whom spoke against the amendment, which they all support. Politics is about people and delivering services for people within their communities. The locally elected representative is the first person on whom the public calls to deliver services. Every day, we can see the services that were put in place due to the work of local public representatives. When we look out our windows, we see public lighting, footpaths, roads, signage and so on, which were put in place due to the work of elected public representatives. Over the years they have done a good job, although they often do not get the recognition they deserve.</P>
    <P>At various times Ministers address conferences organised by the local authority representative associations such as LAMA, the General Council of County Councils and AMAI. These bodies have all referred to enhancing the role of the locally elected representative. This is a golden opportunity for the Minister to accept an amendment that gives additional powers and responsibilities which local councillors are well able to take on. I ask the Minister to accede to this request because it is important the amendment is accepted.</P>
    <P>It is an opportunity for the Minister of State to make his mark. I heard him speak at LAMA conferences throughout the country when I was general secretary of that association. On every occasion, he spoke about what he would do to enhance the role of and give additional responsibilities to locally elected representatives. Local representatives are the voice of democracy at local level and it is important the Minister concedes this point.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Fine Gael spokesperson on transport and road safety for proposing the amendment. I hope the Minister will accept it.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Paddy Burke&rsquo;s amendment. The Senator has been labouring in the vineyard on this issue for the past 24 hours. The case is straightforward. There is a unanimous view on both sides of the House that we should not preclude councillors from being members of this authority &mdash; that is the net point. I suspect the Minister of State, in his deepest thoughts, agrees with us, so let us get on and accept the amendment.</P>
    <P>It is often a question of a Minister standing up to the alleged official advice and to those who allegedly know better. One of the problems in this country is that we all stand back and watch <Col N="1558"/>the constant dumbing down of politics and politicians. We are the people who do this. We follow maniac advice from people who do not know a thing about politics and politicians. We are all responsible for this.</P>
    <P>I have great respect for the Minister of State as a politician who is always close to his community and roots, and close to councillors. He know this business thoroughly, as one who represented the country in the European Parliament and serves as a Minister of State in this Government. I know he does not agree with this measure. I ask him to respond positively to the amendment.</P>
    <P>One of the measures taken by the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, which I welcome, was the constitutional recognition of local government for the first time. A situation now arises whereby we will exclude a group of people who have been democratically elected by the people while we recognise their position and the position of local government in our Constitution. If ever a case was to be brought to the Supreme Court as an example of a direct form of discrimination, it is this.</P>
    <P>Nobody is suggesting that there would be X number of places on the authority. There is no problem nowadays providing places on authorities for great celebrities. Some of these have done very well out of the State. However, when it comes to those elected by the plain people of Ireland, they are to be excluded.</P>
    <P>I recently heard Gay Byrne speak on a television programme. Pat Kenny asked him when he would allow motorcycles to use quality bus corridors. He replied that he was considering the matter, that he hoped to get it done soon and that he would come back to Pat Kenny on it. It is a measure for which politicians have been calling for the past six years by way of Adjournment motions, parliamentary questions and all the rest of it, God help us.</P>
    <P>We need to cop ourselves on. The Minister wants to accede to this request and I hope he does so. He should put to one side the great &ldquo;I am&rsquo;s&rdquo; of Irish politics, who know everything, and tell them he is not accepting their advice on this and that he will accept the amendment.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>In the course of the debate on Committee Stage, I said sincerely that I wanted some time to think about this matter. We drew clear water between the position of members of the European Parliament, the Oireachtas and local authorities. I was a member of a local authority and served my time in what I would describe as the university of politics in the local authority. I was involved in LAMA at the early stage. I have respect for all public representatives, including those at the coalface who take the punches for us, given that we cannot be represented due to the legislation which stipulates that Members of the Oireachtas cannot be members of local authorities.</P><Col N="1559"/>
    <P>I want to repeat what I said last evening and I do not want to sound facetious. I fully appreciate the genuine case made by Senators Ulick Burke, Paddy Burke, Wilson, Walsh, Feeney, Mooney, Cummins, Dooley, Bannon and Brian Hayes. Last evening I said there were Senators who were not elected by councillors and they also made the case. Let us put that aside. There is no question of my insinuating in any way that Senators are looking after the interests of their electorates. I believe they are not and are making the case sincerely.</P>
    <P>The proposed amendment by Senators Paddy Burke and Hayes has widespread appeal across the political divide in the House. I am sure every Senator holds the same view because those who have spoken are a microcosm of the entire Chamber. The amendments sought to include Members of the Oireachtas, Members of the European Parliament and members of local authorities on the board. It is not a slur or a question of members not knowing anything about road safety, being unqualified, as was suggested, or not having expertise. I appreciate they all have expertise. Senator Feeney suggested there should be a prescribed body that would include young people. I remind Senator Feeney there are a number of young people on the board with expertise who will reflect the view of rally drivers or the younger generation.</P>
    <P>If local authority members were to be included on the board there is no compulsion on this Minister or any Minister in the future to appoint them. However, it is the principle that concerns Senators. I draw Senators&rsquo; attention to section 7 which provides that when preparing a programme the authority &ldquo;shall&rdquo;, not &ldquo;may&rdquo;, consult with each State agency responsible for implementation of measures contained in it. &ldquo;State agency&rdquo;, which is defined in the Bill, includes the local authority. Section 7(6) reads, &ldquo;In this section &ldquo;State agency&rdquo; means the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, a local authority, the National Roads Authority or such other person as the Minister considers appropriate.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Had it not been defined I would have had to flesh it out today so the Minister would consider it appropriate. The local authority is involved. The road safety authority shall consult with local authorities. That means the authority will have to establish advisory committees. If the authority is to consult with them, that is an opportunity for local authorities. That is a much stronger provision.</P>
    <P>The fact is we can do that and not appoint them. It is more important to do it this way and that they can feed directly into the board. Section 7 does not preclude members of local authorities. Therefore, the experience of local authority members gained over many years is not lost. I concur with the contributions of Senators that they can and will make a major contribution. That section includes local authority members.</P><Col N="1560"/>
    <P>I am aware from the debate on Committee Stage that this may not necessarily be what Senators require. I genuinely thought about this matter, not just after I left the House, but in the early hours of the morning I was still trying to come to terms with it. From 7 a.m. I had calls from a number of people on this side of the House who are in the difficult position of having to vote for something in which they do not believe. I wish to make it clear to local authority members that they will be included. More members of local authorities can be included on advisory committees than if one were to be appointed to the board of such a committee.</P>
    <P>We are living in the days when it is not appropriate to have Oireachtas Members on the board because there is a conflict of interest. We are legislators. Local authorities will also have an input. They are responsible for signage and other factors that could impinge in some way. The local authority will establish advisory committees which will include appropriate representation from local authorities where this is necessary.</P>
    <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>While I am not accepting the amendments, there will be stronger local authority representation and a stronger feed into the National Roads Authority on those advisory committees. Senators will be aware that a procedure is in place where councillors from various parts of the country feed into the Health Service Executive. I genuinely regret I cannot accept the amendment. I had much consultation up until the last minute with councillors from both sides of the House. I refer Members to section 7. I do not suggest it is a compromise but that it is even stronger.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
	<P>I have seen a case in the past where legislation was changed. This may be the thin end of the wedge. We are referring to local authority members elected by the people. Anybody who is elected by the people to serve should not be debarred from membership of a board. That is my personal opinion. When it comes to voting I have to listen to what the Minister of State has said. I had to immediately resign my position as a member of a board of Aer Rianta when I got a nomination to stand for the Seanad, not when I was elected to it. The secretary of the board was legally obliged to check the date I got the nomination to ascertain whether I had participated at any time at any board meeting. At the time I felt that was wrong. I could understand that when elected to the Oireachtas one would have to step down. I see similarities here. There are highly-qualified members of local authorities who should be allowed to serve on a board such as this. There are some other boards on which local authority members serve. The fear of some local authority members who contact us is that in future they will be debarred from serving on a board.</P>

    <P FLI="0" el="5">I move the motion because of the ongoing public concern in these matters. It is the considered view of the Progressive Democrats that there is a level of anxiety among the public, particularly but not exclusively among home buyers, about certain practices in the planning and development process. The level of anxiety is such that my party feels it would be useful to debate these issues in the Seanad and to hear the views of Members and of the Minister.</P><Col N="1562"/>
    <P>A recent review of planning and development legislation refers to Ireland&rsquo;s &ldquo;almost uniquely open system&rdquo; in respect of planning applications, and it is true that there is much to be positive about regarding our procedures. They have improved significantly in recent years with the most recent pieces of legislation. However, three specific areas of concern have arisen and these are referred to in the motion. First, there is public concern about the role of management companies in new housing estates, and charges being imposed on residents. It is accepted that in certain circumstances management companies are both appropriate and desired by the resident and the local authority. For example, there may be a relatively closed or private housing development where the residents require and are happy to have and pay for a management company to maintain infrastructure and look after the fabric of the estate. However, the Minister is no doubt aware that problems do arise elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Traditionally, when a development was completed in accordance with the planning permission granted, the local authority took that estate &ldquo;in charge&rdquo;, meaning that the council took responsibility for public infrastructure such as roads, footpaths, sewers, water mains and public lighting in the housing estate. Developers should, of course, be required through the planning permission process to complete each estate to a standard acceptable to the authority for taking in charge. That in itself has created difficulties in the past. The local authority obtained a bond from the developer as a prompt to get estates completed as quickly and efficiently as possible.</P>
    <P Just="Left">The public concern has arisen from a real or perceived move away by local authorities from that traditional process. For example, that includes the obligation on some home buyers to become a member of a management company; the associated obligation on home buyers to pay large sums to these companies to carry out work which traditionally was the responsibility of the developer, or eventually, the local authority, when the estate was taken in charge; and the uncertainty among these home buyers about what level of control or influence they have, if any, over the management company to which they are paying fees.</P>
    <P>Other problems include the linking by some local authorities of planning permission with the establishment of a management company in some developments, and the imposition of these conditions by some local authorities in a way that introduces uncertainty about what exact responsibility the developer has to complete the development and maintain and repair the infrastructure.</P>
    <P>We all know that purchasing a home is one of the most significant decisions anyone can make in a lifetime, and is very stressful for many people, such as a couple or a family, for whom it can be a once in a lifetime experience. Given the expensive market in which house buyers must operate today, this has never been more the case. <Col N="1563"/>The complexity of this issue &mdash; the role of management companies and &ldquo;taking in charge&rdquo; &mdash; merely compounds the stress. Young families have enough stress without thinking about who, if anyone, is going to keep common areas well tended and infrastructure in good repair.</P>
    <P>We would all be of the view that people in general are positive and active when it comes to keeping their own homes, gardens and surroundings of their estates in good order, and in the main, most families have no problem paying into their residents&rsquo; associations, which do a very good job to ensure green areas and verges are kept in shape. However, they do not need the stress of dealing with a poorly run management company, to which they pay a large sum, but over which they feel they have little control. They do not need the further stress of feeling caught in the middle of a difference of opinion between a developer and a local authority over who is responsible for infrastructure, for instance an unsafe footpath, unsafe unfinished wall or an unsafe absence of street lighting. They do not need the stress of wondering what will happen to the standard and condition of their apartment block because there is inadequate participation by certain neighbours in the management company, or the refusal of other apartment owners to pay the management company charge. They certainly can do without suspicions that their local authority may be using certain provisions of the planning laws to transfer or perhaps even abdicate responsibility for providing and maintaining public infrastructure.</P>
    <P>Some of these problems are specific to apartment blocks, and I accept that apartment living has multiplied in this country in recent years, with more than 100,000 apartments being built in the past ten years alone. However, I do not accept this as an explanation or an excuse for the aggravation that is being visited on home buyers today. Nor does a circular letter to city and county managers reminding them of their obligations and asking them how well they are meeting them represents substantial action.</P>
    <P>I will move on to the second area of public concern addressed by the motion, namely, the conflict of interest that might arise when senior planning officials take up employment with development companies operating in the same local area. Without naming names, which the Cathaoirleach would rightly disallow, as people should be able to defend themselves, the House will be aware that for example, no less than a former county manager of a local authority has taken up a senior position with a development company. The company in question had previously been granted planning permission for a large and controversial development. The ultimate deciding officer at the time when the permission was granted, three months later took up a senior and highly paid position with the developer in question. The perception of the person <Col N="1564"/>having been in a conflict of interest regarding the development is compelling, and is only one example.</P>
    <P Just="Left">Reference may be made to the Local Government Act 2001, Part 15 in particular; new provisions in the Civil Service code, standards in the Civil Service code; and Standards in Public Office Commission recommendations and review. However, as I understand it, the issue of senior local government officials accepting outside appointments or consultancies, following resignation or retirement, is not adequately covered by codes at present. We have a duty to address the concerns of the public regarding conflicts of interest, and subject to the Constitution and relevant legislation, investigate the feasibility of a moratorium on the take-up of certain types of employment by senior local authority personnel. This is a time of great concern among many citizens about the planning process and their capacity to influence it. It is also a time of massive development. This makes matters all the more pressing.</P>
    <P>There is sufficient concern to warrant action, namely steps to control whether consultancies or other areas of the private sector can get access to information gained by an individual previously and recently employed in a senior position by a local authority. I have sought legal opinion on the matter and have been told by counsel that if the restrictions are proportionate and reasonable &mdash; we could argue about what they might be, but counsel indicates a period of a year or so &mdash; there would be no legal difficulties about implementing these measures. I would be interested to hear how the Minister proposes to deal with this matter, if there are such proposals.</P>
    <P>At this point I turn to the third element of public concern outlined in the motion, the imposition of large development levies and special development levies by local authorities. Development contributions are attached as a condition of planning permissions and are paid by the developer in advance of construction starting, to provide a mechanism by which developers can contribute to the cost of providing public infrastructure and facilities that benefit development in the area. I have already outlined the public concern about local authorities in some way diluting or confusing their responsibility for maintaining public infrastructure and this is a compounding factor.</P>
    <P>I understand the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government contacted planning authorities in 2003 to advise them that while it was expected that developers should make an appropriate contribution towards the costs of public infrastructure and facilities, care should be taken to avoid development contributions that are excessively high. However, the level of the contributions is adopted by the members of the planning authorities and it is a matter for each local authority to make a judgment on what is appropriate in its area. That <Col N="1565"/>was done in County Kildare and there was considerable controversy about it. Furthermore, special development contributions or levies can be imposed on a development where exceptional costs are incurred by the local authority. I understand, and am open to correction, that such special development levies do not have to be adopted by a council.</P>
    <P>The Minister has stated the view that &ldquo;development contributions continue to be attached as a condition of planning permission, and are therefore paid by the person carrying out the development in advance of construction starting. They are not paid by individual house purchasers&rdquo;. That was in a reply to a parliamentary question on 29 November 2002. With in excess of &euro;500 million being collected by local authorities in 2005, the Progressive Democrats are concerned that an inordinate cost is being introduced into the home buyers&rsquo; market. Let us be clear about this. We believe that developers should make an appropriate contribution towards the costs of public infrastructure and facilities. That is not in dispute. However, we must also be confident that the pressure on home buyers is not excessive.</P>
    <P Just="Left">We must look at concerns recently expressed in the media that levies, meant to be paid by developers, are being passed on directly to home buyers, adding up to 6% to the price of the average new home, and that a typical &euro;350,000 home includes a &euro;20,000 levy, according to the Irish Home Builders Association which represents the majority of builders. Consider my constituency of Kildare, where &euro;250,000 was collected in development levies in 1996. In 2000, the figure was &euro;5.5 million. Last year it was &euro;18 million. In the neighbouring local authority area of south Dublin the figures for 1996, 2000 and last year are &euro;6 million, &euro;10 million and &euro;33.5 million, respectively. Will the Minister outline how the imposition of development levies and special development levies by local authorities might be monitored and controlled in the future?</P>
    <P>There is also the matter of the use of the large sums of money accruing from development levies. This money is supposed to be used for the acquisition of land, the provision of open spaces, recreational facilities, roads, bus corridors and infrastructure to facilitate public transport. They are to be used in the area in which they are collected. They are not for water treatment schemes, which are already covered by a national programme, or to be used in another location, as my colleague will later outline.</P>
    <P>Again, however, we have seen reports that development levies are in fact being used to pay benchmarking payments. As the motion states, the Minister might outline to the House how full transparency and accountability can be ensured regarding the spending of the money accrued from development and special development levies. Several of the members of Kildare County Council made strenuous efforts to find out from the council what the levies were, where they had <Col N="1566"/>been collected and how they were being used. Our efforts were met by what could be described as blockage and it took an enormous amount of time and energy to try to get that information.</P>
    <P>To conclude, the Progressive Democrats&rsquo; motion is precipitated by genuine public concern about certain aspects of our generally laudable planning process. I am pleased the Minister, Deputy Roche, is present and will avail of this opportunity to outline his assessment of these issues and to set out how they might be addressed, whether by primary legislation or otherwise.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the motion. As Senator Dardis has set out the issues mentioned in the motion at length, I intend to dedicate my time to the specific subject of large development levies and special development levies imposed by local authorities. I wish to make clear the Progressive Democrats&rsquo; view that planning authorities should ensure that developers make an appropriate contribution towards the costs of public infrastructure and facilities.</P>
    <P>Our development contribution system was revised with cross-party support via the Planning and Development Act 2000. The objective was a new and more transparent system. Under section 48 of the Act, planning authorities must draw up a development contribution scheme in respect of public infrastructure and facilities provided by, or on behalf of, the local authority that benefit development in the area. I draw attention to the words &ldquo;in the area&rdquo; and will refer to this point later.</P>
    <P>With regard to the issue of transparency, the new development charges scheme was intended to ensure that the long-standing practice of levying development contributions to fund local authority infrastructure and facilities &mdash; for example, community areas and recreation &mdash; is implemented in a more transparent and consistent way across the country. The Progressive Democrats put down today&rsquo;s motion because of genuine concern that transparency and consistency are not absolute by any means.</P>
    <P>It is worth noting the view of the then Minister in February 2004 that &ldquo;it is not anticipated that the contributions levied will unduly affect the price of houses, new industrial and commercial development or new agricultural developments&rdquo;. Again, there is concern that this anticipation has not been met. Development charges, as intended, are desirable and, indeed, necessary. The funds raised by local authorities through development contributions are substantial. In 2005, for example, they were &euro;12 million in Limerick county, &euro;18 million in Kildare, &euro;30 million in Wexford, &euro;38 million in Cork county and a massive &euro;50 million in Fingal. In addition, city councils collected &euro;89 million and town councils collected &euro;54 million.</P>
    <P>These substantial sums are intended to be part of a consistent, transparent and dedicated system. <Col N="1567"/>It is intended that the &euro;500 million collected in 2005 would not, for example, be spent on schemes or works that already come under schemes funded from the Exchequer and would not be spent on schemes or works outside of the area in which it was collected. There are two main points, what the moneys are spent on and where they are spent.</P>
    <P>For the purpose of illustration, I will use the example of the national water services investment programme. This programme consists of 900 projects and is funded to the value of &euro;5.1 billion. It is a national scheme introduced by the Minister which we applaud and wish well. National taxation funds the national scheme, and rightly so. Why is it that local authorities receive approval for water schemes under this programme but moneys received under the development contribution system are used to part fund them? That is contrary to the intention.</P>
    <P>Moneys received under the development contribution system are not intended to be spent on works prioritised by the local authority and subsequently approved by the Minister and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government under the national water services investment programme. The Minister and the Department cannot walk away from their specific responsibility to implement the national water services investment programme.</P>
    <P Just="Left">The new development contribution system introduced under the 2000 Act to provide consistency and transparency has, in fact, created a system of what may be described as &ldquo;law unto itself&rdquo;. Local authorities can decide when, how much of and how the gains are to be spent, regardless of the Minister&rsquo;s intention. There must be an immediate and annual audit of the collection and spending of development and special development levies by each local authority. In the interests of transparency and value for money to the electorate and our communities, whom the scheme was intended to benefit in the provision of facilities, there must also be an immediate and annual audit of schemes approved under the water services investment programme.</P>
    <P>The Minister or Department cannot simply say that this is a national scheme. Local authorities are using funds from the development contribution system for water treatment works. Meanwhile, a person who pays into the development contribution system finds the infrastructure and facilities their money was to be used for are lacking.</P>
    <P>The list of projects this money is intended for is quite explicit. The money is to be spent on the provision of open spaces, recreational facilities, community facilities, bus corridors and infrastructure to facilitate public transport and so forth in the area in which it is collected. It is not for water schemes that are already covered by a national programme and are located miles away. Under Part 3, section 28(7) of the Planning and <Col N="1568"/>Development Act 2000, local authorities setting their development contribution schemes shall have regard to any recommendations made by the Minister. Subsection (8) states that &ldquo;following the consideration of the manager&rsquo;s report, and having had regard to any recommendations made by the Minister, the planning authority shall make the scheme&rdquo;. The Progressive Democrats&rsquo; call for an audit of development contribution schemes is to improve the system in how moneys are collected, spent and co-ordinated to improve the facilities and services delivered to communities. It is not a blame-game.</P>
    <P>The new development charges scheme intended to ensure the long-standing practice of levying development contributions to fund local authority infrastructure, was implemented in a more transparent and consistent way. It is well-publicised that the levying of development charges is inconsistent. Business groups in particular have raised concerns about development contribution schemes differing considerably across local authority areas. Despite the desire for consistency, it is not the Department that sets the level of contributions on how local authorities calculate the charges. Each local authority decides itself.</P>
    <P>As a result, consistency and uniformity is lost. Consider the charge for a 200 sq.m. development. According to one source, in Dublin city the charge in 2005 was &euro;23,000, &euro;16,000 in south Dublin, and &euro;1,300 in Galway city. While this is a serious issue for businesses they have active interest groups to put their case. Our motion is more concerned with the concerns of the public. For example, the choice and location of services for consumers is likely to be affected by this variation. It is bound to influence where businesses locate, where services are provided to the public and where jobs are located.</P>
    <P>What are the Minister&rsquo;s views on this issue? Is he satisfied that the intended level of transparency and consistency is being delivered by the development contributions scheme, as implemented by local authorities. I thank the Minister for coming to the House to outline his views on these three significant issues &mdash; management companies, potential conflict of interest and development levies. I have focused on the development charge element of the motion. Senator Morrissey will speak further regarding management companies. As Senator Dardis stated, the motion is being moved in response to genuine concern among the public about these issues. We owe it to the public to outline what steps are being taken to address that concern.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I am surprised by a Government party tabling this motion. Housing has been one of its greatest failures as typified by the unwelcome appearance of many management companies leaping on the back of human need. The Fianna F&aacute;il-Progressive Democrats Government&rsquo;s attitude to the housing market has <Col N="1569"/>resulted in large increases in house prices and a scarcity of social and affordable housing, despite repeated promises. Young people now find it almost impossible to get onto the property ladder without mortgaging themselves to the hilt, if they can get a mortgage. Parents who could expect to be off the hook with regard to housing, are being asked to stump up deposits for their adult children. Those lucky enough to get a house must move further away from our towns and cities.</P>
    <?oasys _cl10.7- ?><P>The motion offers the House an opportunity to look at one aspect of the housing crisis, namely, the imposition of management fees that affects home owners and apartment dwellers. I hope it will be the beginning of a debate on how local government is financed and not over-burdened. The motion also plays into the hands of the Opposition which is more used to having to highlight the inadequacies of the Government parties with regard to housing issues. This time they are doing it themselves. It is also the reason we have not tabled an amendment to the motion.</P>
    <P>Apartment living has become a way of life for people in recent years. As the Celtic tiger roared into life and demographic changes put pressure on the existing housing stock, high-density apartment blocks allowed for cheaper, high-quality housing that allowed many young people onto the property ladder. Census 2002 shows that 110,458 households, approximately 9% of the total, live in apartments. This translates as 210,056 people, highlighting the fact that it is often single people and couples without children who reside in such housing. Since then, evidence suggests this trend is continuing. From 2002 to 2004, over 42,500 fiats and apartments were completed, comprising a fifth of new housing.</P>
    <P>Evidence suggests there are serious problems regarding apartment complexes which many residents feel powerless to address. These problems relate primarily to common areas and the failure of builders and managing agents to maintain them. Simultaneously they charge high management fees that increase each year, often with little or no provision for a sinking fund that is necessary to cover the high costs that occur every few years when major refurbishment is necessary. These fees can often be higher than two months&rsquo; mortgage payments. Residents are often at a total loss as to what they are paying for. Non-payment is not an option. Such a choice would lead to a debt being placed on the property that would have to be cleared before it can be sold. Residents have no State agency to which to complain. With an increasing number of non-resident investors in the apartment sector, it is often difficult to spur the necessary number of residents into action.</P>
    <P Just="Left">Politicians, both local and national, have no shortage of horror stories regarding apartment blocks. Unlandscaped gardens, unpainted walls, broken lifts, crumbling brickwork, unreliable refuse collection and broken fixtures and fittings are becoming common complaints. The Government failed to recognise the need for action during its first term. In 2002, the programme for Govern<Col N="1570"/>ment stated, &ldquo;We will consider the introduction of legislation to regulate the establishment and operation of apartment complex management companies&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In response to a parliamentary question in May 2003, the then Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government stated the regulation of apartment complex management companies was still under consideration and that he had no immediate plans to set guidelines on fees. By December 2004, the issue had hardly moved on. Responding to another parliamentary question, the Minister stated a Law Reform Commission working group was examining the law on these types of developments and it was hoped it would respond early in 2006.</P>
    <P>Earlier this year in the D&aacute;il, the Fine Gael Party brought forward a Private Members&rsquo; Bill to legislate for apartment complex management companies, in the absence of any State regulation, despite a Government commitment to do so. Ten years of the current Government has done nothing for those seeking an equitable and fair deal. Despite a commitment in the programme for Government, apartment dwellers are still left without proper State protection against their management companies and agents. The Fine Gael Private Members&rsquo; Bill sought to amend the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 by widening the role of the Private Residential Tenancies Board. If passed, the PRTB would become the regulator in this area, imposing a pro-consumer code of practice on managing agents.</P>
    <P>The code would protect residents in several ways. Developers would be obliged to set the same management fee for the first three years of a new complex at a level which ensured managing agents could meet the established minimum standards for that period. This way, there would be no sudden rise in management fees several years after an apartment has been purchased. The management fee would not be fully payable until managing agents were in place and the various services provided. Currently many builders demand payment of the first year management fee before the keys are handed over to the new owners. This is despite the fact that the new owners may be moving into what is essentially a building site and few of the services that the fee is paid for, such as cleaning, are provided. Owners should also be allowed to withhold a portion of the fee until all services are available.</P>
    <P>Provision for an adequate sink fund should be made from day one. It has emerged that many managing agents set the annual fee without any provision for large-scale refurbishments that must be carried out every few years. This leaves residents with a shortfall and a choice of paying several thousand euro at once or else living within a decaying physical environment. Neither scenario is tolerable.</P>
    <P>There are other areas in the apartment sector that need urgent attention. Fees should be set for the first three years of a new complex at a level which ensures managing agents can meet the established minimum standards for that period. The management fee should not be fully payable <Col N="1571"/>until managing agents are in place and the various services can be provided. At present, many builders demand payment of the first year&rsquo;s management fee before the keys are handed over to the new owners. This is despite the fact that the new owners may be moving into a building site.</P>
    <P>As a start, the Government should publish a Green Paper on this issue that we could all debate in the future.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CyprianBrady"><NameTxt>Mr. Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House and I fully support the motion. Vast development has taken place in Dublin in the last ten years. There were 99,000 planning applications last year alone, with 81,000 completions nationally. Those figures have increased consistently every year.</P>
    <P>Inconsistency is the problem with apartment complexes. Some complexes are working perfectly and residents in them are happy with the maintenance and landscaping. In other complexes, however, because of the nature of the management companies involved, there are problems. Consistency in the regulation of such companies as part of planning is an issue that should be debated. In suburban housing estates, there were issues with water treatment but the vast majority of local authorities do not impose regulations on planning permissions related to the appointment of management companies.</P>
    <P>I had the dubious honour of receiving a strident letter from a management company after I had canvassed an apartment complex. The issue related to whether it was public or private property and if I should have got permission to canvass in the complex. This is an issue across the city &mdash; the question of the land the apartments are built on being public or private arises. This will require legislation and I welcome the fact that the Law Reform Commission working group is looking at the area. Hopefully it will come up with recommendations that will lead to new legislation. The sooner this is done, the better.</P>
    <P>In Dublin, apartment complexes are being built in the suburbs, sometimes as part of housing estates and sometimes as stand-alone complexes. That leads to issues with traffic, services and the strains on existing infrastructure. When we look at the added value developers receive as a result of some of the services already in place, it is essential that they make a contribution. In my area, existing communities are being surrounded by development, putting pressure on infrastructure. Developers should make a contribution towards the services required in the area from their profits.</P>
    <P>We recently dealt with the Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Bill and sections of that deal specifically with not overcharging developers through the use of the phrase &ldquo;shall not require such an amount of financial resources to be committed for the purposes of the condition being complied with as would substantially deprive the person in whose favour the approval under this section operates of the benefits likely to accrue from the grant of the <Col N="1572"/>approval&rdquo;. Measures can be taken by legislation or regulation to ensure this is not an issue with developers either.</P>
    <P>The value of serviced land has increased horrendously in the last six years and with the amount of development going on at present, it will not decrease in the near future. We can, however, take measures to ensure that contributions that are made are used properly. They should go towards the provision of shops and cr&egrave;ches. The developments that are taking place are putting pressure on existing communities and this is where the contributions come into play.</P>
    <P>In Navan there are large housing estates, some of which do not even have a shop or telephone box. People must get a bus to get to the nearest shop. That should not happen and the more pressure put on developers to provide these facilities, the better.</P>
    <P>Senator Dardis referred to the purchase of a first house as the most stressful undertaking a person faces in his or her lifetime. It should be made as painless as possible. People are not sure what bills will arrive when they move into their new home because there is no clear requirement to provide a stated bill of charge for management service. There are issues related to the management of apartment complexes that will require legislation at some point. I look forward to hearing the Minister&rsquo;s reply.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Bannon made a great contribution. I am surprised, however, that no one else in the Labour Party or Fine Gael cares about this issue.</P>
    <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion. I will deal with the four issues dealt with here: the taking in charge of estates, management companies for housing estates, preventing conflicts of interest in retired local officials and the question of development contributions.</P>
    <P>On the taking in charge of housing estates, the responsibility of local authorities is absolutely clear, it is set out in law in the Planning and Development Act 2000. In that Act, the then Minister addressed this matter through the inclusion of strong provisions on taking in charge. Section 180 of the Act provides specifically that where housing estates have been completed satisfactorily, the local authority must, if requested to do so by the majority of owners or occupiers, initiate procedures for the taking in charge of the estate.</P>
    <P>There is a similar duty on the planning authority with regard to an estate which has not been completed in accordance with the permission and where enforcement action was not taken within the relevant period. The ultimate decision as to <Col N="1573"/>whether an estate is taken in charge is a reserve function for the local authority members. I urge Senators, therefore, who have some influence with councillors, to stress to them that this is not an issue on which councillors should regard themselves as passengers or observers. This is a matter over which they have control and the ball is in their court.</P>
    <P>At my request, the Department wrote to all planning authorities in January of this year, to determine if these provisions were being properly applied. In circular PD1 of 2006, planning authorities were reminded of the legal obligation imposed by section 180. The circular also stated that planning authorities must establish a policy for the completion and taking in charge of estates. The policy should include a requirement on developers to complete estates to a standard that is acceptable to the authority for taking in charge, details of the procedures to begin taking in charge estates promptly on foot of requests and the provision of sufficient funding. I am somewhat impatient that local authorities are not doing this. Councillors are elected to make sure that this happens and the county managers and councillors must apply the law.</P>
    <P>Planning authorities were asked for a report on their activity in this area and the responses received indicate that at least 560 estates will be taken in charge by planning authorities this year. Some planning authorities, including those close to Senator Dardis&rsquo; heart, were reminded that taking estates in charge 30 years after they were completed is not acceptable. I have made it clear that I am not prepared to accept any heel dragging from councils or county managers. In one case, I intend carpeting an individual on this issue. I am not prepared to accept this because people who have bought their houses have paid for the housing estates to be completed and taken in charge.</P>
    <P>Each local authority has been asked to develop a policy, which must be put to the members. I expect the councillors to remain vigilant on this matter and to request regular reports on the activity of their local authority. After all, that is what councillors are elected to do. I am not prepared to tolerate any foot dragging and I ask councillors to wake up and be more vigilant regarding this issue.</P>
    <P>The circular letter referred to earlier also stated that the existence of a management company to maintain elements of common buildings, carry out landscaping and so forth must not impact upon the decision by the authority to take in charge roads and related infrastructure. Senator Dardis made the point that there was some suspicion that councils were effectively trying to pass on their responsibilities in this regard. They should not do so.</P>
    <P>The issue of planning conditions relating to management companies is not a totally straightforward one. The Planning Act allows the attachment of these conditions, recognising the fact that management companies have been traditionally set up for the maintenance of apartment buildings and their attendant private grounds. It has been <Col N="1574"/>made clear that it is not appropriate to attach planning conditions regarding management companies in the case of traditional housing estates, by which I mean estates of houses with their own front and back gardens. I also consider it is appropriate that planning authorities should take in charge the public roads, no matter what type of residential estate is in question.</P>
    <P>However, as Senators will be aware, the traditional housing estate is, in many areas, being replaced by mixed estates which contain apartments, duplex houses and terraced houses with shared facilities such as car parking and gardens. Genuine questions arise as to whether it is appropriate that all these facilities should be maintained at the tax payers&rsquo; expense. After all, if these facilities were attached in the traditional way to houses the individual householder would not expect the taxpayer to pay for them. I am not sure whether Senator Bannon, in his contribution, was suggesting that it was Fine Gael policy that the taxpayer should pick up the tab for all of these costs. If that is his party&rsquo;s policy, it is a pity he did not say so.</P>
    <P>It is not possible to say that it may never be appropriate for planning authorities to require the formation of a management company, as Senator Dardis pointed out. In certain cases there may be facilities, for instance a shared playground or sewage system, which residents want to keep for their own use and they will meet the cost accordingly.</P>
    <P>As Senator Brady reminded the House, the Law Reform Commission working group is currently examining the legal aspects of the management of multiunit structures. The Government will consider the recommendations of its final report, including the need for any new legislation in this area. I have spoken with my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on this matter.</P>
    <P>In general there has been a failure in this debate to realise that there is a distinction between management companies and management agents. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has already indicated that he intends introducing legislation to regulate management agents. A regulator will be charged with regulating management agencies and many of the complaints of apartment dwellers will be addressed in that way. The main issue for people is the failure of management agencies to deliver the services for which they are being paid.</P>
    <P>Senators raised the matter of conflicts of interest and public officials. All public officials should avoid putting themselves in a position where there is a conflict of interest. It is of paramount importance that all local authority employees carry out their duties with integrity, impartiality and concern for the public interest. In that context, a code of conduct for local authority employees was published in June 2004 under the Local Government Act 2001. The code is a major step forward in local government and includes disclosure requirements concerning employment by serving personnel outside the sector and addresses situations concerning a conflict <Col N="1575"/>of personal or public interest. This builds on long-standing ethical requirements. The local government code was published before other codes of conduct.</P>
    <P>The question of senior local government officials accepting outside appointments or consultancies following resignation or retirement is not subject to the code of conduct at present. Provisions of this kind were introduced to the Civil Service code in September 2004, that is, some months after the promulgation of the new local government code. An amendment to the code to bring it into line with the provisions that apply to civil servants will be published shortly.</P>
    <P>Senators are aware of the importance of development contributions, which allow local authorities to recoup some of the costs of servicing land for private development. They are critically important to delivering a better environment and improving the quality of life for our citizens. It is right that the amount of development contribution be determined locally. This should not be determined centrally and is a matter for local councillors. It is also right that the adoption of the development contribution scheme should remain under the control of democratically elected councillors. Councillors are not mere passive observers in this process. This is one of the more important roles they have been given under the law. Councillors all over the country have rightly complained that many powers have been taken from them. They have the power in this case and should exercise it appropriately.</P>
    <P>My Department has given planning authorities guidance regarding development contributions and, in particular, about setting them at an excessively high level. It is patently wrong for local authorities to have dramatically different levels between one area and another. An interdepartmental committee is currently examining a number of issues regarding development contributions schemes, following which revised guidance will issue, if appropriate. However, I am reluctant to take powers away from local authorities. We all subscribe to the idea of local democracy and if powers are given to local councillors, it is reasonable to ask that they exercise them.</P>
    <P>On the issue of accountability and transparency, I have made it clear that I expect local councils and managers to be open, up-front and absolutely transparent in the matter of development contributions. The local authority&rsquo;s annual report must &mdash; it is not a <i>desiderata</i> &mdash; contain <?oasys _dc28- ?>details of moneys paid or owing to it under section<?oasys _dc0- ?> 48 and must indicate how such moneys have been expended. I wrote to council managers on this matter before the 2006 estimates cycle began, indicating that I expect councillors to have full information. Before the start of each local financial year, the manager must submit to the elected council a report indicating the programme of capital projects. If Members of this House believe there are council managers who are not doing this, I would be delighted to hear from them.</P><Col N="1576"/>
    <P>I am aware that the practice differs from county to county and Senators expressed concern in this regard. I draw the attention of the House of an excellent example of good practice. Mr. Danny McLoughlin, the county manager in Leitrim, drew up a report which was published in local newspapers and sent to all councillors, detailing the income from the development contributions scheme and precisely how he intends to spend the money. That type of transparency should be the norm in every council. If Senators believe county managers are withholding information they should let me know and I will pursue the matter. In addition, if Senators believe there is any evidence of development levies being abused by being decanted elsewhere they should let me know. They should not and cannot be used in that way and it would be illegal and improper for them to use them, for example, to pay benchmarking awards.</P>
    <P>I have made it clear that with effect from 2005, the annual financial statements of local authorities must show movement in balances of development levies from one year to the next, including income and expenditure, at year&rsquo;s end.</P>
    <P>Senators will be aware that it is not right or appropriate that the Minister of the day should interfere in the operations of local authorities but this is an area where managers must be up-front and transparent. I have met councillors in most counties, from all parties and none, and I have told them that if there is any evidence they should make me aware of it and I will have a word in the appropriate ear. It is very important that the partnership involving the local authority member, the Oireachtas Member and the county managers be respected. In partnership with local authorities, my Department is examining ways of building on this transparency and making the accounts of local authorities even more transparent. It is important that all stakeholders &mdash; local councillors, local communities and local businesses &mdash; are aware of the situation in this regard.</P>
    <P>Members will be aware that this year was a historic year in many ways because it was one of the first years where full information flowed to councillors. In fact, I published the development contributions. There was some criticism that this was tantamount to interference but I believe the local government system should be open, transparent and accessible. I will examine any proposal that is brought forward in that regard.</P>
    <P>I thank Senators for the opportunity to underline what the Government is doing in the area to ensure local democracy, accountability and transparency. It is important that our planning system operates to the benefit of all and not just a few. Councillors have a key role to play in this area, particularly in the matter of setting the development charges, ensuring proper accountability and that the development levies which are collected to provide benefit to the communities hosting developments are spent in the communities that have borne the brunt of carrying the development. I thank Members for their contributions.</P>

	<P>The Senator is well able to do that.</P>
    <P>There was a debate on this matter in the other House on 22 and 23 November last during which members of Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael, my party, the Green Party, Sinn F&eacute;in and the Independents spoke. No Progressive Democrats Member spoke in the debate but they voted against the motion. Not only did they not have this deeply found concern then, they did not bother speaking on it to defend themselves. They just went into the House and voted for an innocuous Government amendment which said nothing about the issue.</P>
    <P>This issue has become politically significant for unfortunate Government candidates knocking on doors but something Members of this House and the other House have noticed over the years is the snail&rsquo;s pace at which Fianna F&aacute;il responds to abuses by the building industry. It usually gives it a good four or five years to complete whatever new rip-off it has discovered and then, in a fit of righteous indignation, decides to do something about it. I presume the Progressive Democrats have caught up with it.</P>
    <P>The fundamental fact is that the Minister can issue all the well-sounding circulars and reminders to people but local authorities are staffed by people who cannot, without rigidly written down codes of practice, recognise that it is improper to move from a position of senior management in a local authority to senior adviser to a developer. They cannot see that that action of itself undermines both them and the process. How does the Minister believe that people who see the world like that will respond to a circular from a Minister for the environment who does not give them enough money to do the jobs they have to do?</P>
    <P>This country is building 60,000 or 70,000 units of accommodation a year. I am glad we are doing that but I wish we could get ourselves organised and recognise that building houses to provide people with shelter is one thing, but building houses to provide people with the easiest capital gain in the Western world, at one of the lowest capital gains tax rates in the Western world, is not <Col N="1578"/>necessarily the way to focus on providing housing for people who are otherwise without it.</P>
    <P>Investing in housing is one of the most lucrative ways of making easy money in Ireland and to a considerable degree it has been left alone. It is lovely to hear the way the commentators talk about the low levels of rent. The real gain from housing development is capital gain. If one is lucky, one can increase by 15% and pay 20% capital gains tax. Capital gains tax at 20% has its role in areas where we need to encourage investment but it does not necessarily have a role as a blanket levy.</P>
    <P>The two issues raised here are inextricably linked. It is about the dubious personal ethics of some people in senior positions in local authorities. I cannot understand the motives of somebody with a commitment to public service who has become aware over a lifetime working in the public service of the capacity of many builders to manipulate, ignore and avoid their responsibilities and that it has taken enormous efforts on the part of the Health and Safety Authority over years to get the building industry to begin to deal with safety problems. It is extraordinary that the Ombudsman is telling local authorities it is about time they used their powers to deal with illegal developments or people who do not properly meet their planning applications.</P>
    <P>We now have the minor Government party noticing that management companies are being put in. Management companies are not all an invention of the building industry; they are an invention of local authorities. Why do local authority officials and managers introduce management companies? We all know about multiple use and the intricacies of areas where there are apartments. All of that is dealt with in the Minister&rsquo;s speech, although we did not need him to tell us. We appreciate the complexities but the fact that there are complexities in some areas has begun to be used by local authorities as a reason to impose a blanket solution universally which is annoying people who are struggling to build their own houses. What constantly intrigues me is why it took so long for the Government to notice that.</P>
    <P>This new code of ethics the Minister has promised us for local authority officials should not be ready next month or the month after. It should be ready now and it should be clear and explicit that in any position a local authority senior official should not be able to work for anybody who had planning or other business to do with any local authority for a period of two to three years to sanitise that information. That should apply to Government advisers as well because we have had a steady trickle of them out of Government into positions where their knowledge was being put to dubious uses.</P>
   <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
    <P>The legislation must be amended to make it clear that under section 180, residents can insist that a local authority take an estate in charge, not that they can aspire to and negotiate. It must be made absolutely and unequivocally explicit to city and county managers that where residents request it, their only discretion is the process of moving <Col N="1579"/>there. They do not have the discretion to refuse to do so. If the developer has not brought the development up to the acceptable standards, the developer must be required to do so, and once it is done, it must be immediately taken in hand. Anything else is an escaping of responsibility by local authorities, for reasons which are, at the very least, dubious.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <?oasys _cl10.7- ?><Speaker pid="TomMorrissey"><NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister and thank him for being here for this important debate. I support the motion moved by my colleague, Senator Dardis. He clearly set out the broad elements of the issues raised in my party&rsquo;s motion. The motion before us refers to public apprehension about the role of management companies in new housing estates and apartment blocks, and the charges imposed on residents. Many residents in my constituency of Dublin North are concerned by the factors outlined by my party colleague, namely, the obligation to join a management company and pay a large sum and the uncertainty about their level of influence within that management company.</P>
    <P>People are worried about the link between planning permission and the establishment of a management company, who exactly has responsibility to complete, maintain and repair the infrastructure and the non-participation of their neighbours in the management company or their non-payment of the management company charge. I will outline one brief story. A person who bought a house three years ago in a particular estate in north Dublin contacted me. As part of the contract, he had to agree to pay a management company for the upkeep of the estate, which so far has amounted to &euro;500 per annum. The estate has both houses and apartments and all parts of it, including a green, are open to the public. It is not a gated community.</P>
    <P>This person opposes these fees for the following reasons. He believes that buyers have already paid for the facilities, as the local authority demands a development contribution from developers, a cost the person believes was passed directly on to the home buyers. He also believes that, as there is no local taxation in this country <i>per se</i>, the costs to the local authorities have already come from general taxation. The citizen believes his local authority has abdicated its responsibilities, as the authority is prepared to service older estates by repairing footpaths and cutting grass. Given that part of the fee the person must pay includes public liability insurance, and given that the green and footpaths are open to the public, he believes it is the local authority&rsquo;s responsibility to take on this insurance burden. Most important, this irate home owner sees management companies as &ldquo;a sham&rdquo;. This individual claims that in his estate the management company is a &ldquo;shelf company&rdquo; controlled by the developer, and that the only way to make the company do its job is through the courts.</P>
    <P>Imagine the stress this situation causes a new home owner, irrespective of the accuracy of every <Col N="1580"/>claim, and his many neighbours. We all know that even the smallest things can infuriate one when it comes to one&rsquo;s home, or when one feels one&rsquo;s family is being badly treated. The gentleman who contacted me pointed out a simple example whereby he claims the builder did not install proper TV points in the houses and, therefore, people must install illegal aerials or get satellite dishes which, he claims, the company states people cannot put on the sides of their houses.</P>
    <P>It is this type of simple annoyance, multiplied across homes and apartments, which creates the public concern referred to in our motion. In the case I outlined, the owners are resolved to setting up a residents&rsquo; committee with the long-term goal of removing the management company. That is the level of frustration, the feeling of zero control or input, even though one pays for the privilege.</P>
    <P>The issue of control is important. Even though management companies were supposed to provide residents with joint ownership over communal areas, the concern is that they merely formally install the developer, or a management company linked to the developer, in the position of power. I read of ridiculous management company contracts which grant the home owner one vote and the developer 1,000 votes. I have also read of residents not being able to call an AGM until every apartment in a complex is sold.</P>
    <P>What do home owners get for their money? It is difficult to find out. A household may pay &euro;500, &euro;1,000, or more, but has no inkling as to how or whether the management company uses the funds to maintain infrastructure. In Malahide, in a managed estate, which is an extension of an estate already taken in charge, a house owner pays &euro;1,250. This includes public liability insurance on infrastructure not yet provided, as the estate is still a building site. Does the builder not already insure that estate? The owner of a two-bedroom apartment in Balbriggan pays &euro;1,100 per year. This does not cover refuse charges. A two-bedroom apartment in Tyrrelstown costs a staggering &euro;1,400 per annum. Again, this does not include refuse charges. No one likes to be in a position where he or she pays something for nothing.</P>
    <P Just="Left">The public is right to be concerned if there is a transfer, no matter how subtle or complex, of responsibility from local authorities to the home owner for the maintenance of public infrastructure, such as roads, footpaths, sewers, water mains and public lighting in their housing estates. The management company appears to be the vehicle of transfer. What are the Minister&rsquo;s views on reports that existing or prospective home owners face zero choice on whether a management company is established, zero input into the annual charge residents in their estate or block will face, and zero information on what infrastructure their hard-earned money is spent on? I understand the Minister has taken some steps to clarify matters and address concerns but more needs to be done.</P>
    <P>If new appropriate measures have been considered to ensure local authorities take housing estates in charge, and where and when they should do so, what was the outcome of these <Col N="1581"/>deliberations? If they have not been considered, will the Minister consider doing so as soon as possible? The same applies on any new appropriate restrictions to prevent the attaching of planning conditions requiring management companies to be established in housing estates, as a means of confusing responsibility between councils and home owners.</P>
    <P>These are not vexatious arguments. They emanate from genuine frustration among new home owners, many of whom are young first-time buyers. They emanate from a frustration about simple things such as unfinished footpaths, unfinished or uncapped walls, poor drainage and broken street lights. On the face of it, these may seem to be small matters. However, they generate strong collective ire among a group of residents, particularly when they investigate only to find they are powerless, or that they pay money for no apparent return, or both.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and thank him for listening to our views. I invite him to set out how he feels he can remove this source of exasperation from home owners across the country.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Dardis and his colleagues for allowing us the opportunity to debate what is an extremely important issue, particularly in urban Ireland. It has become a major concern in new areas of Dublin. Ostensibly, it affects younger people who buy their first house and then find they must pay more than &euro;1,000 per year, as Senator Morrissey stated, on this additional charge which other householders do not have to pay.</P>
    <P>My view on this is straightforward. An argument can be made in favour of management fees for apartments. However, I recently visited my brother-in-law&rsquo;s apartment in Lisbon and was interested to discover that the owners or tenants from each of the ten apartments take turns each week to take responsibility for cleaning the stairwell and hall and ensuring that everything is fine. They do not pay a charge because they do the work themselves. In this country one has a tendency to foist responsibility on other people for where one lives. All over Europe, the practice for many years has been that people take responsibility for their own local environment.</P>
    <P>However, no case can be made for management fees in houses or new developments. I do not know why people must pay substantial fees for looking after the local environment in a new home. I recently put down a straightforward question through a councillor in my local authority of South Dublin County Council seeking the number of administrative staff in the local authority as against the number of professional and cognitive staff working in areas such as cleaning roads, picking up litter and planning. The ratio was 4:1. That is the problem. As long as we have a scenario where more public works, such as sewerage, roads and the cleaning and maintenance of public open spaces are being done by fewer local authorities, there will be a problem where other parties will have to fill the gap. That <Col N="1582"/>is the issue. When local authorities tell me they have four times as many staff engaging with the public, doing what the public wants them to do, as those who manage and administer, I will believe we are putting in place a good system.</P>
    <P>The Minister has stated that when it comes to planning conditions, there is a new practice where a manager will stitch into planning conditions the need for a management company. Councillors have no say in that regard. The councillors cannot have a say where an application goes before a manager and he or she inserts the establishment of a management company for a development as a specific condition. The councillors may be against it, but the managers are using this to attempt to bleed more money from prospective home owners.</P>
    <P>The Government cannot have it every way. It is getting approximately 25% in tax and VAT through the sale of all new homes anyway. The council gets a specific development levy on every sale within a housing estate. A large sum of money is going to central and local government, and the local authorities are making this a condition of a significant number of new housing estates. Blaming local authority members is not good enough, when one considers it is the manager&rsquo;s function to stitch in specific conditions. If he or she is putting in such conditions, it is not a fault of the county councillors in that area.</P>
    <P>My party has put forward a suggestion, as the Minister will know, that a new function should be given to the Private Residential Tenancies Board, which has been established and is working well. It could, in effect, become a national regulator to bring about some type of standard in this area.</P>
    <P>There are three factors we should bring about to put in place a code of practice. We should immediately establish in law or through a regulation involving the Private Residential Tenancies Board, that there should be no annual increase in an annual fee for at least three or five years when a development is taken over. This would be a moratorium.</P>
    <P>The management fee should not be fully paid until management agents are in place and various services can be provided. Many builders demand payment of the first year&rsquo;s management fee before the keys are handed over. That is a new practice. A person may buy a house in August and there is a demand within a month for the entire year&rsquo;s management fee, even though the person has not been living there for more than half of the year. The only way this practice will stop is through a code of practice, which the builders sign up to, or new legislation demanding that this comes about. We need the legislation either way.</P>
    <P>A suggestion has been outlined by Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd of my party that a sinking fund be provided, which would be available from the outset for the householders. Under current legislation, if half of the householders in a development come together and want to ditch the management company, they can do so. There should be a sinking fund in place from the outset whereby the community itself can decide what to spend money on. <Col N="1583"/>The fund should be made up of the amount left over from the development, with a significant amount paid by the developer once the management company is established. That is the way to go.</P>
    <P>I reiterate my total opposition to the establishment of management companies for ordinary domestic houses. Whatever the argument for apartments &mdash; it may be a good argument in this case &mdash; there is no argument for such companies with regard to houses built within new communities. People feel it is another type of stealth tax, whether it is paid to management companies or local authorities.</P>
    <P>There is an opportunity for the Government to respond imaginatively to some of the suggestions. We have put forward our views, and if there are better views on the establishment of a code of practice and giving a new authority new powers, we should have them. This issue will not go away until new legislation is implemented in this area which will give greater control to local authorities and their members, who could do more in this area.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the motion as it is timely and on an important subject. I noted the Minister&rsquo;s contribution and I welcome most of what he had to say. There is a need for issues surrounding these matters to be examined and dealt with in a better way than is evident to date.</P>
    <P>I remember when the Bill relating to the taking in charge of estates went through the House in 2000 and the discussions we had on it. If I remember correctly, there is an obligation on a local authority to take charge of any estate more than seven years old, if requested to do so by a majority of people living there. I remember stating at the time that this should put an onus on local authorities to monitor the construction stage, as they could conceivably be taking on potential liabilities if the developer has not satisfactorily provided the services or if major refurbishment is required prior to the council taking over.</P>
    <P>If this is happening at all, it is happening in few local authorities. It should be done as there can be considerable costs involved if there are issues with drainage, sewerage, roads or lights within an estate. We have all seen within our own jurisdictions, some difficulties relating to specific housing estates.</P>
    <P>From discussing this at local authority level I know officials will contend that a private housing estate is not their responsibility. They would further argue it is up to the people requiring the houses in the estate to satisfy themselves that all the services have been installed to their liking. The <i>de facto</i> situation is that in a large housing estate where people are purchasing a unit for themselves, they do not have the resources to ensure everything is done properly. They depend on the developer. When one considers the conditions attached to planning, there is an onus on local authorities from a planning perspective, even before one considers the issue of potential <Col N="1584"/>subsequent liability when the authority takes over a development.</P>
    <P>I note with interest that the Minister has taken up the issue of estates not being taken over by local authorities. At least 560 estates will be taken in charge by planning authorities this year. I would credit the Minister with that figure, as I am sure his letter prompted action in an area where action was not being taken. In many ways the figure probably highlights how attention was not being given to this area prior to the reminder from the Department. I am speaking generally, and there would clearly be exceptions among local authorities, as the Minister has pointed out. The action varies from authority to authority.</P>
    <P>With regard to planning conditions relating to management companies, there has been a move in this direction. The Minister has clearly set out the issue in a letter to local authorities. With regard to the standard local authority estate, the provision of a management company should not be a factor of a planning condition. With regard to apartments, management companies will apply for clear reasons, as there are common internal areas as well external areas. The building itself would also have to be maintained. Therefore, the owners of apartments generally, informing a company to own the freehold of the property, will designate a management company to take care of those specific areas.</P>
    <P>It may not be sufficient to urge local authorities by letter in this regard. There may be a need for a legislative framework, so it cannot be extended into the normal estates. I appreciate the point made by the Minister that there are difficulties with mixed estates where conventional housing units exist alongside apartment blocks. In such a case, the open areas and the general facilities, such as drainage and sewerage, should be the responsibility of the local authority. Ring-fenced legislation could be drafted to provide for that.</P>
    <P>The conduct of planning officials has been raised. I am a member of a scheme where apartments were built as part of an apart-hotel. A request to change the designation of the complex to residential when the tax incentives expired was refused. The county manager of the local authority who refused the application subsequently joined a company interested in purchasing the development. I will keep a watching brief to see what transpires in that regard. Local government arrangements which allowed senior officials to exit at an early age with a lump sum have led to a trend in people joining private interests where there are obvious conflicts of interest. There is a need for effective policing of whatever codes deal with such matters.</P>
    <P>There is a significant anomaly in a system whereby millions of euro from development contributions can be stashed away in an account and local authority members do not have a clue how much is involved. Officials have no accountability. As I know from my own experience, questions raised in this regard receive only vague responses. That should not happen because there is great potential for impropriety in that area arising from the secrecy surrounding it.</P><Col N="1585"/>
    <P>I would go further than the Minister and demand that all moneys collected from development levies should not just be accounted for in the annual report, which in many local authorities is only published 18 months or two years after the end of the year, but in the annual estimates. There should be a capital account as well as a revenue account and it should fully account for all moneys collected, as well as outline the projections for the following year. The capital projects on which the money is to be spent should also be outlined. There should be a full, transparent accounting system in each local authority, which should be easy to achieve. If a businessperson or anybody else allows laxity in a system he or she is as culpable as somebody who succumbs to the temptation to exploit it. Systems must protect employees and the public purse.</P>
    <P>It is undoubtedly appropriate that there be a contribution from developments toward the cost of various services, such as roads, sanitation, etc. However, they must relate to the services provided and should not just be figures picked from the air. That does happen, because I remember when we had responsibility for such a development in Wexford County Council and there was a degree of horse-trading among senior officials. It was far from a scientific approach and it struck me that we needed guidelines from the Department to bring some semblance of uniformity to the area, even though I fundamentally favour each local authority being autonomous and having the right to make its own decisions.</P>
    <P>Local government serves us well but it is important there is constant probing and prompting to ensure the best standards are upheld. In any large organisation, especially in a system not as democratically accountable as I would like, there is a need to ensure the structure and guidelines are in place so we achieve them.</P>

	<P>The proliferation of new houses is a good news story. Nobody could have imagined 20 or 25 years ago that we would be discussing these problems. Everybody&rsquo;s desire is to have a home of their own but as prices rise people take out larger mortgages and have less money to spend on what they would like. If they invest such large amounts of money and commit to a 35-year mortgage they deserve a finished product &mdash; something with which they are happy and which gives them contentment.</P>
    <P>In most cases local authorities have done a good job against all the odds. Given the extent to which houses are being built at the moment, in every village, town and city in Ireland, it must be very difficult for councils to meet their obligations and monitor proceedings. It is difficult to put in place the staff to provide adequate follow-up operations. However, it will not happen just by wishing it to happen.</P>
    <P>I have listened to the Minister on radio programmes on several occasions and he has appeared quite focused in his response to the difficulties that have arisen, and has made it clear where responsibility lies. Nobody should abdicate responsibility because it is unacceptable that a <Col N="1586"/>young couple incur huge financial outlay and a 35-year commitment but years later still live on an unfinished estate. There are safety issues and local authorities should ask themselves who will be liable in the event of major claims. Obviously the responsibility of the local authority will come into focus.</P>
    <P>We need an ongoing audit because there is a need for transparency and accountability. It will not be sufficient to depend solely on local authorities. There will either have to be legislation or a specific timescale for the completion of a project. That timescale could form part of the planning process. Planning permission is usually granted with several conditions attached but there should also be penalty clauses. If a builder leaves a development for another site but returns at a later date to complete work in conjunction with a management company, this work will be done in a piecemeal fashion.</P>
    <P>The issue of development contributions is a hardy annual. People have always resented paying these contributions primarily because they regard them as a penal tax or a way for local authorities to raise revenue without specifying the purpose. Members of the public need to understand the reason such charges are imposed. It is not necessary that they be used to develop roads, car parks or facilities of that nature.</P>
    <P>One of the main drawbacks of the housing boom is the lack of corresponding infrastructure for new communities. This leaves people feeling isolated and reminds me of the situation when Shannon was built and people used to say the town lacked heart because it did not have a community base or history. Although this is no longer the case in Shannon, this isolation occurs when one tries to create something from nothing. If development charges must be imposed, clear guidelines should apply and they should be used to fund the development of playgrounds and other infrastructure. There is nothing to prevent consultations taking place in this regard.</P>
    <P>The large number of new housing developments has in many respects created new villages and towns. The town of Cashel, for example, used to have a population of 3,000. At one point, I knew the precise number of houses in the town &mdash; 600 &mdash; because this information was required when doing a canvass. The number of houses in Cashel has increased at least threefold since then, which is equivalent to creating two new towns. Although services such as water, sewerage, roads and landscaping are, in the main, reasonably good, consideration has not been given to other aspects of development which are essential to community life. There is nothing to prevent development charges being expended on these back-up services. Those who provide the money know best what is needed. If everyone in a development of 300 to 400 houses pays a development fee, it adds up to a significant sum. It should be possible to interact with those who pay charges to determine what facilities are required. My principal argument, therefore, is that expansive and innovative guidelines must <Col N="1587"/>apply to the manner in which development charges are spent.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>I am fascinated that the intensity of the thunder emanating from the Opposition benches on the Order of Business on certain issues is only matched by the silence from Opposition Senators when the matters in question are debated in detail. I thank those Senators who contributed to the debate and I am sure the Minister will take on board the useful proposals they made. I am encouraged also by the Minister&rsquo;s positive contribution and thank him, in particular, for his undertaking to amend the code of practice for civil and public servants. I also welcome his decision to publish the new provisions shortly and to write to county managers reminding them of their obligations under section 48 as regards how moneys are expended.</P>
    <P>One of the problems with the taking in charge of developments, an issue raised by most speakers, is the requirement that estates must first be completed satisfactorily. While the position has improved since the legislation was introduced, I can recall cases of developers deliberately failing to complete estates to prevent them being taken in charge. After years of delay, the original bonds put up by the developers were of such little value that they could afford to sacrifice them.</P>
    <P>I note the differences between apartment developments and other types of development highlighted by the Minister and accept that management companies may be necessary in the case of the former. From personal experience, the management company in the apartment block in which my daughter lives has been very good and I have no criticism of it.</P>
    <P>Another issue raised was the practice of placing gates on developments. This creates private estates and gives rise to the access difficulties outlined by Senator Brady who recalled being told to stay off private property while canvassing. This is a two-edged sword.</P>
    <P>A thread running through the debate was the need for regulation to keep abreast of changing circumstances. Builders are clever and employ clever lawyers who are able to run rings around the law. If legal loopholes exist, it is our obligation to close them.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note criticism of local authorities made by Senators from parties which control the councils in question. The Minister spoke of the role of local authority members in taking in charge estates and contribution schemes. County Kildare, which is controlled by Fine Gael and the Labour Party, has been the focus of some of the heaviest criticism in some of these matters. One wonders how these two parties can have one standard for what they perceive to be national deficiencies in these areas, while overlooking the fact that they control some of the local authorities in question. Their attitude reminds one of the posters which have been erected around the capital informing us what Deputy Kenny will do with wasters. What will he do with the wasters about whom Senator Brian Hayes spoke, those respon<Col N="1588"/>sible for having four people employed in administration for every person working on the ground? Issues such as these resonate.</P>
    <P>Senators referred to underfunded local authorities. This year, &euro;9 billion has been allocated to local authorities from central funds, six times more than the allocation made when the Labour Party and Fine Gael were last in power. If local authorities have so little money, what are they doing with this sum of &euro;9 billion? Perhaps an auditing exercise is required although, I am aware the public auditor audits the local authorities.</P>
    <P>Senators voiced criticism of the lack of social and affordable housing. Given that Kildare County Council, my local authority, and D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, another authority controlled by the Labour Party and Fine Gael, do not have good records in this area, it is time for certain political parties to get their own houses in order before criticising others.</P>
    <P>Senator Jim Walsh made a valuable contribution on the need to examine the capital account in conjunction with the annual returns. Another thread running through this debate is the need for consistency, uniformity, transparency and accountability to give people confidence that the system is working properly. The Minister has outlined the local authorities&rsquo; obligations. However, members of local authorities find that trying to get details on revenue is akin to pulling teeth. While one will be given a global figure, it is difficult to determine how much is raised in specific estates.</P>
    <P>I accept that all the money raised in a given estate cannot be spent on the estate concerned because local authorities must also meet wider infrastructure costs, including those arising in areas where people do not live. Nevertheless, members should be given information on the areas on which money is spent. I believe the Minister accepts this proposition, having indicated that he proposes to raise the matter with local authorities.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s comments on amending the code of conduct and the obligations of members. This has been a good debate which I hope will advance the issue. I also hope the Minister will leave the House with some good ideas and will carefully consider what steps can be taken.</P>

   <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>Having read section 22(1), I was disappointed to see that once a member of the board becomes a local representative, a Member <Col N="1589"/>of the Oireachtas or an MEP he or she will cease to be a member of the board. I could not understand the thinking behind that but, having informed the Minister of State of our displeasure, he will hopefully rethink the matter.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State concluded his contribution earlier so there would be no reason for him to speak again.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>I know but I just wanted to put on record that I was displeased with that section and I want the Minister of State to be aware of that. It is a shame that members of local authorities in particular, who have experience in transport matters in their own areas, would be excluded from membership of the board. In that regard, I am displeased about section 22(1)(<i>d</i>).</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. P. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I am disappointed with the Minister of State&rsquo;s reply. I know he feels deeply about this section and that if it was his choice it would be removed from the Bill.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>I will give Senators a vote the next time.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. P. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State clearly has a problem with the Minister, Deputy Cullen, as this would otherwise be removed.</P>
    <P>This matter is embarrassing for the Minister, Deputy Cullen. I acknowledge the Minister of State&rsquo;s point with regard to section 7(6), whereby State agencies such as the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, a local authority and the National Roads Authority would be consulted by the board. I presume this would be a given in any case. Sub-committees may be set up. If so, I hope section 22 will not <Col N="1590"/>preclude councillors from being members of sub-committees.</P>
    <P>While acknowledging the Minister of State&rsquo;s contribution, this is an embarrassing issue for the Minister, Deputy Cullen. Local authority members and councillors play a major role with regard to the upkeep of roads, road safety, the compiling and introduction of speed limits and the introduction of black spots. If the road safety authority is to have any teeth, it will make recommendations on the operation of black spots. Given all of this, to debar more than 1,000 councillors from being members of the board is one of the most embarrassing things to have happened since I first entered the Chamber.</P>
    <P>Previous speakers noted that similar parts of other legislation were amended by the Parliamentary Counsel in terms of removing sections. Like Senator Mooney, I hope this will never happen again and that local authority members, the people&rsquo;s representatives, will not be debarred from being members of various boards, particularly this board, because they have a major role to play. One could well have a member of a local authority play a major role.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed. The Minister of State has done his best. We gave him time but I have no choice but to press the amendment. Amendments Nos. 4 to 6, inclusive, are being taken together. I will have to press a vote on amendment No. 6 because it deals with section 22(4) which states: &ldquo;A person who is a member of a local authority shall be disqualified from becoming a member of the Board.&rdquo; That aspect is also covered in the amendment to section 22(1). I have no choice but to press the amendment, although I thank the Minister of State for the way he has dealt with the issue.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
    <P LI="1">In page 22, after line 49, to insert the following:</P>
    <P LI="1">&ldquo;(1) As soon as may be after the end of each safety calendar year, but not later than 3 months thereafter, the Authority shall make a review of road safety in the preceding calendar year, to include performance against the annual targets set for the Authority.</P>

    <P FLI="0">This amendment deals with an issue to which we gave a very good airing on Committee Stage. It is about the road safety authority benchmarking itself on its successes or failures, and publishing a review every three months.

	<P>I appreciate the opportunity to say a few concluding words and to thank all the Senators who contributed. I do not want to focus on the issue which was of grave concern to them. I know that all who spoke on the matter did so with the utmost sincerity. The principle many of them enunciated in the House is one which we must look at in the future. The Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen, and myself worked closely together and I support the Minister in his view that it was essential to have this legislation enacted as quickly as possible because it gives a legal base to the road safety authority. This legislation gives a legal basis to the road safety auth<Col N="1593"/>ority. The chairman, chief executive, staff and board will play a major role in the compilation and provision of a new strategy, which will be approved by the Minister. We are anxious to reduce the number of deaths on our roads. In the meantime, there is an interim board and we want to ensure it is appointed on a permanent basis.</P>
    <P Just="Left">I concur with many of the views expressed by the Senators I mentioned earlier in the debate. It is not a question of not wanting local authority members to be involved. There is provision in section 7 to involve local authority members. Ironically, if local authority members were included, it need not necessarily follow that they would be on the board. However, they are prescribed in section 7(6) as one of the State agencies to be involved. I am also sure they will serve in the sub-committees and have a direct input into the board. The experience mentioned by various Senators on both sides of the House will be of invaluable assistance to the board.</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister of State for the hard work he has done on this Bill and ensuring it is passed by the Oireachtas. It is important legislation which, hopefully, will result in fewer fatalities on our roads. I acknowledge the contributions of Senators on both sides of the House, particularly those of Senator Paddy Burke, who made some positive suggestions during the debate.</P>
    <P>The issue on which all Members agree is that people elected by their local communities to serve on local authorities should not be barred from serving on this or any other authority. I urge the Minister of State to arrange to have this amendment made at the earliest opportunity. I thank the Minister of State for his efforts in this regard so far. I look forward to working with him in future when other legislation is brought before the House.</P>

   <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. P. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, for his work on the Bill. It was first known as the Driver Testing and Standards Authority Bill but has progressed to become the Road Safety Authority Bill. The Minister of State is to be complimented on his knowledge of the Bill and his work on it. This will be good legislation.</P>
    <P>I also acknowledge the input of other Senators who spoke at length on the Bill, particularly Senator Wilson who has been present for all Stages. I wish the road safety authority the best <Col N="1594"/>of luck. I do not know what Mr. Gay Byrne meant when he said on the &ldquo;Late Late Show&rdquo; that he hoped the other shower would not hold up the Bill. He need not worry about the other crowd because all of us are interested in reducing the number of road fatalities and in greater safety on our roads and in the workplace. No Member on any side of the House will stand in the way of making roads and cars safer for the people of this country.</P>

I thank the Minister of State and his officials. Perhaps he will consider an amendment if a suitable opportunity occurs in future.</P>
    <P>I thank Senators who spoke on the Bill and I wish the chairman of the road safety authority and his board the best of luck. No matter what the road safety authority and the Minister do, they must have the support of the public and motorists who use the roads. We urge everybody to take greater care on the roads. It will be a happier country, with happier homes, if the loss of life is reduced. However, unreal numbers have lost their lives this year.

	<P>I thank the Senator for raising this issue. I am responding on behalf of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The Garda central vetting unit, which was recently decentralised to Thurles, County Tipperary, is responsible for the criminal record vetting of persons who would have substantial, unsupervised access to children and vulnerable adults. The requirement to vet most certainly extends to the home help sector, as those employed therein have access to the private residences of adults, some of whom are vulnerable, particularly the elderly. There is absolute agree<Col N="1595"/>ment on this point between the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Department of Health and Children, the Health Service Executive and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, home helps have been properly subject to Garda vetting for many years. As the service is funded by the HSE, and in keeping with sound administrative practice, all applications for home help vetting to the Garda central vetting unit are processed centrally through the HSE, rather than at myriad local levels. There are no avoidable delays in the processing of vetting applications received by the vetting unit. In this regard, the Minister is informed by the Garda authorities that, on average, correctly completed vetting applications are processed to a conclusion in a four-week period. An additional period would be required for the paperwork to be processed through the HSE, but this would usually be a minimal time contribution to the whole process.</P>

    <P>The Minister does not consider the average period required for the processing of a vetting application from start to finish is unreasonable, given the important task being undertaken. It is in the nature of averages that individual instances of vetting may take a longer period. Where this occurs, there are usually legitimate and sound causes.</P>
    <P>One main reason for delay is an incomplete or incorrectly completed vetting application form, for example, where important information is omitted or mandatory entries are left blank. In such cases, in the interests of a robust vetting procedure, the application form must be returned for necessary attention by the applicant. Although in most cases, such errors are genuine oversights, occasionally such practices are used by unscrupulous persons to evade proper vetting. Senator Browne will appreciate the need to be fully vigilant in this regard.</P>
    <P>In the past few months, new liaison mechanisms with the Garda central vetting unit have been successfully implemented in the HSE. These include, most notably, the centralisation of the HSE&rsquo;s vetting operations to several regional centres, with the intention of transiting to a single <Col N="1596"/>national centre in due course. The centralisation allows for the development and concentration of expertise in the checking and countersigning of vetting application forms in the HSE. It is not the case that vetting procedures are simply an administrative routine. For vetting to be effective, a great deal of time and effort on the part of the recruiting organisation must go into, for example, verifying the identity of the applicant, confirming his or her past residential addresses and so forth.</P>
    <P>A further, frequent legitimate reason for delay in the vetting process is where criminal conviction or criminal prosecution information is disclosed by the Garda authorities in respect of an applicant. In such cases, it is a matter for the recruiting organisation, in this case the HSE, to consider the implications of the disclosed criminal history information in the context of all other pertinent recruitment information and to reach a decision on recruitment. Understandably, in the interests of natural justice, the recruiting organisation may wish to give extended consideration to individual cases.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is satisfied that vetting applications are processed in an expeditious manner by the Garda central vetting unit, in liaison with the HSE. Although delays may be encountered in individual cases, they are usually unavoidable and relate to such matters as incorrectly completed applications forms or to the detailed consideration of disclosed criminal history information.</P>
    <P>Although not directly related to the subject, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform wants to put on the record the fact that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na vetting services are undergoing significant expansion, so that the protection afforded by vetting can be enjoyed by all organisations that recruit persons to work with children and vulnerable adults. Although criminal record vetting is of tremendous importance, good recruitment and employment practices remain integral to the protection of service users. On behalf of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, I thank the Senator for providing the opportunity to consider these important matters.</P>
