	<P>I remind Senator White it is not in order for her to walk across the floor of the Chamber when the Chair is speaking.</P>
      <P>I have received notice from Senator Ulick Burke that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to indicate when she will approve the finance for the extension to the Mercy College secondary school, Woodford, County Galway, which is grossly overcrowded.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Kitt of the following matter:</P>
      <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to outline the present position on the Glenamaddy, County Galway, sewerage scheme.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Bannon of the following matter:</P>
      <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs to give an update on essential funding for Legan, County Longford, neighbourhood watch and community alert under the programme of grants for locally-based community and voluntary organisations.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>A great deal of attention has been focussed on the register of electors over the last few days. The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, has spoken about the issue. I do not think there is any more certainty on foot of his comment that the onus to carry out the work that is needed is strictly on local authorities. We are aware that changes to the register of electors have taken place in recent years. Political parties used to analyse the register in the past. That might still be possible in rural areas, but it is not possible in urban areas. Something new has to happen, therefore.</P>
      <P>Attention was firmly focussed on this issue over the weekend when the Trinity College branch of Fianna F&aacute;il published the results of its study of the register of electors in the Dublin South-West constituency. It found that 17,000 people should have been on the register but were not registered, while a further 15,000 people who should not have been on the register were on it. The findings of that study have crystallised our thinking on the urgent need to do something about this problem. Various options have been proposed, such as asking the census enumerators to carry out a study. Others have put forward the theory that it should be linked to PPS numbers.</P>
      <P>As we face the summer and the time when many students will be available, a scheme should perhaps be considered on which they could work. What is required is not necessarily to have them call to houses on a 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. basis, but possibly between 5 p.m. and 9 p.m. because many families are out during the day. Innovative thinking is required to reflect the times in which we live. Perhaps the old system cannot readily conform to modern norms, so I should like if consideration was given to my suggestion.</P>
      <P Just="Left">It is clear there was increased vigilance by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na over the bank holiday weekend when there was a remarkable number of 320 arrests for drink driving infringements. Although it does not seem to be getting through to motorists, we nonetheless welcome the extra Garda vigilance. I hope it continues over subsequent weekends. Following the events of the weekend, the chairman of the road safety authority, Mr. Gay Byrne, said the increase in drink driving arrests and continuing fatalities on our roads was terribly depressing. Up to the end of April there were 140 fatalities on the roads as opposed to 118 for the contrasting period last year. Therefore, there is still an enormous problem. However, the chief executive of the road safety authority said he was delighted with the public response to the road safety message, which would appear to contradict what the chairman had to say.</P>
      <P>We in this House have rightly highlighted the importance of personal responsibility on this issue. However, a series of measures needs to be introduced by the Government if we are to be serious about this issue. There is now a sense of urgency on many fronts and I hope all the neces<Col N="795"/>sary target areas will be prioritised such as the situation regarding provisional drivers&rsquo; licences, the driving test, random breath testing, speed cameras, the translation of the rules of the road into foreign languages and so on. These matters must be tackled as a matter of urgency, otherwise the statistics at the end of the year will be very unhealthy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>The House will be aware that on a number of occasions I have asked for a discussion on developments under the national partnership talks. Other colleagues, such as Senator Ross, have also asked for a debate, perhaps for different reasons. I ask the House to note, in particular, that at a time when house price inflation is running at over 10%, CEOs and directors are getting increases of more than 20% per annum in their remuneration and the economy is still growing at an unprecedented pace, IBEC can tell the people of Ireland with a straight face that it will hold workers at the economic coalface to low single figure increases in their remuneration over the next few years. It is important that public representatives, such as the Members of this House, should express their views on this grasping and greedy selfishness as articulated by IBEC.</P>
      <P>IBEC does not want to pay the workers on the ground, nor does it want more Government spending on services. Effectively, when it talks about competitiveness what it really means is trousering the gains from the wealth created by society. It is time we told it we will not put up with this. People do not have to show their hands on this but if we want to maintain the partnership spirit and good relations in the workplace, as public representatives we should be calling for a reasonably generous deal for workers at all levels of the economy. Nobody can object to that.</P>
      <P>In view of the line likely to be taken by Senator Ross and others, it is time we said this in the Seanad so that our position is quite clearly known. I have said it on many occasions but now is a particularly important time. As the discussions have been ongoing for a number of weeks, I remind the House that we agreed to return to this issue after Easter. The Leader has previously made opportunities available to the House to do this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>That is right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>However, these discussions have gone on for an unprecedented period. There has been some movement. Certain things have happened in the area of union recognition in terms of workplace legislation about which we do not know. The issue of money is now on the agenda. We should simply say we will not stand back and watch competitiveness reduced to greedy selfishness on behalf of IBEC, and that we need a greater and more appropriate distribution of the gain and wealth of this country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator O&rsquo;Toole for filling us in on the partnership talks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not in any way involved in them and I know nothing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>He is out of the loop now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator O&rsquo;Meara should speak on the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>
	<P>It might be useful to have a discussion on the issues surrounding the partnership talks but I wonder if it would make any difference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>
	<P>I wonder would the input be heard. I would be curious to hear the Leader&rsquo;s response on that because it has been a feature of the development of the partnership talks over a number of years that, as has been pointed out by other Members, the Oireachtas has played a very small, if any, role in the process. While it has yielded great results for the country in terms of our prosperity and so on, an issue has arisen in regard to a democratic deficit in particular.</P>
      <P>On the subject of democratic deficits, the issue surrounding the electoral register is of major importance. We all know how important it is to have the register up to date, particularly those of us who intend to face the electorate in the coming months. The issue is important enough to warrant having the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government come to the House to tell us what exactly are his plans. It is not enough to simply dump it on the local authorities and say it is their responsibility &mdash; it is all our responsibility. In the first instance it is our responsibility to ensure that local authorities have sufficient resources to keep the electoral register up to date.</P>
      <P>I am inclined to agree with Senator Finuncane that this is a job for people who are willing and prepared to work in the evenings because that is the only time one will find people at home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>From 6 p.m. to 9 p.m.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>
	<P>This is especially the case in the communities in which this impacts most &mdash; new communities where people are largely out at work during the day and it is virtually impossible to get them at home at any time except in the evening.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader of the House arrange a debate on the issue of accident and emergency units in hospitals around the country? Hardly a day passes that we do not read in the newspapers about a crisis in some accident and emergency unit, in many cases in our larger hospitals. The units in Drogheda and Letterkenny made the headlines most recently in terms of the HSE&rsquo;s own reports.</P><Col N="797"/>
      <P>I would like the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children to come to the House to report to us what measures she intends to take to ensure that those hospitals get the resources they need. In particular, I would like to hear from her that these hospitals are not to blame for the crisis that has been created but that is has to do with underresourcing and underfunding, especially in the past nine years of this Administration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>On the question of the register of electors, I have strongly advocated in this House and in other debates the register be dealt with on the same basis as the census. We have probably lost an opportunity in this regard.</P>
      <P>I am sorry but my mobile phone is interfering with the sound system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>All the way to Castleblayney.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I have noticed that many mobile phones are being put on silent mode but if they are not turned off completely they can still interfere with the sound system. I advise Senators to turn off their mobile phones completely when they come into the Chamber.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>In fairness to the people who carried out the census, they did not work just from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. That was certainly the case in County Galway. They did a very good job for very little money in some cases. We should examine the possibility of using these people or some other system to update the register of electors.</P>
      <P>When I look at the list of forms that are available for including people on the register of electors it always amazes me that one still has to have a garda sign a form.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not the case now until the draft register appears.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>
	<P>It is only the case for the supplementary register.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>To be added to the supplementary register one still needs a garda signature. It should be possible for a greater number of categories of person to sign so as to make it easier for people to be added to the supplementary register. If an individual is not on the first list, a garda must verify that he or she is living in the area. Other officials should be empowered to help people to register to vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the comments of Senators Finucane, O&rsquo;Meara and Kitt about the electoral register.</P>
      <P>I wonder whether we could put the issue of the e-voting machines to bed once and for all. They were clearly never designed to cater for the intricacies of proportional representation. It is time for the State to recoup what it can of the &euro;52 million outlay, not to mention the annual storage costs, and to sell the machines. That is the unani<Col N="798"/>mous view of the Committee of Public Accounts and it is possibly the unanimous view of the House. Has the Government made a decision in this regard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>The discrepancies that have been found in the electoral register are a disgrace. It is clearly a serious issue. However, with respect to students and part-time workers, getting them to carry out the work would not treat it with the importance it deserves. Voter registration should be linked to PPS numbers and a national identification card should be introduced to address a series of issues such as this.</P>
      <P>Whether we like it or not, we are going the electronic voting route, no matter how much it costs. It represents progress and the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator cannot be serious.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>E-voting could also be linked to a national identification card using chip and PIN technology, which should also be used in the areas of taxation, passports and so on. The sooner we wake up and begin to move forward, the better. The electoral register should be updated on a professional basis, not by part-time workers. It should be essential for every individual to exercise his or her franchise. When one considers what was honoured at Arbour Hill earlier, the right to vote is an honour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>I endorse the comments of Senators O&rsquo;Meara and O&rsquo;Toole about the need for a debate on so-called partnership. The House has surrendered a great deal of its power and influence in recent years by allowing talks to take place in Government Buildings without any input whatsoever or without having the opportunity to rubber-stamp them because they never come before the House. The primacy of democracy is an issue and we have happily surrendered it to unelected people outside the House.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator O&rsquo;Toole, who picked out the fat cats in our banks who have rewarded themselves with vast sums while others have not been rewarded with such lucrative sums.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>They are not rewarding their staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole is correct in identifying IBEC as the culprit. Two elements of what is going on in Government Buildings are disturbing. First, the two main parties &mdash; the employers and the unions &mdash; supposedly represent business and employees. However, IBEC represents big, fat cats in business and the trade unions represent only one third of the workforce. Their representatives are making decisions for the nation while we look on as political eunuchs. That is not acceptable and the House should debate the matter.</P><Col N="799"/>
      <P>The second element should be prominent in the debate. This is not only a pay deal. It has emerged in the past few days that all sides are seeking what they call a &ldquo;ten-year plan&rdquo;, which has nothing to do with a pay deal. It means this House and the D&aacute;il will be bound to a policy for the next ten years that will make both Houses less relevant. We will then have no need to talk about the electoral register because we will not have much to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>While the issue was raised last week, will the Leader consider asking the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to come to the House to discuss the electoral register? Some very good suggestions have been made here today on compiling this register. The experience within this House would be of great benefit to the Minister in creating a national plan for a proper register of electors. The recent census represented a lost opportunity as the facts are there and are easily compiled. Maybe we should use the staff that collected the census forms as they know the houses and the people living in them. They would make an ideal workforce for this task.</P>
      <P>I congratulate my colleague, Senator White, on being made an honorary fellow of the Sales Institute of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>It is an honour for her and for the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFeighan"><NameTxt>Mr. Feighan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is an honour for Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I congratulate all the Senators who have been nominated to stand for D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, especially Senator Feighan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not sure if that is strictly on the Order of Business. I think it is for election time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish the Senator well in getting one seat out of three in his constituency.</P>
      <P>I support the call by Senator O&rsquo;Meara for a discussion on accident and emergency units. The T&aacute;naiste is coming before the Fianna F&aacute;il Parliamentary Party this evening, but I call on the Leader to allow for a debate on this issue. In the local hospital in Roscommon, we have an excellent new accident and emergency department having spent &euro;8 million to &euro;10 million on the hospital, yet there are nine observation beds regularly left closed. A review of surgery at Roscommon County Hospital is taking place at Portiuncula and I would like to ask the T&aacute;naiste publicly about the outcome of this review. A hospital without surgery is not a hospital or an acute hospital. Any threat to surgery in Roscommon will be resisted by me now as in the past.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="800"/>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. P. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the call for a debate on compiling the electoral register. I also support Senator Finucane&rsquo;s proposal. It is a great idea to get the students of the country to look after the electoral register. It would re-engage them with politics and would give them a chance to see what politics is all about. I have no doubt they would do a tremendous job as well.</P>
      <P>I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on the BMW region and the amount of money that has been spent in that region in comparison to others. I understand that we are &euro;6 billion short of what we were supposed to get. What will the Government do to ensure that the BMW region gets its fair share of funding? Ireland got &euro;8 billion on the backs of the poorer regions in the early 1990s. The BMW has fallen very far behind the east coast, so I call for the Leader to arrange a debate on the issue in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn"><NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the calls by Members on all sides of the House for a debate on the compilation of the register of electors. The situation could be described as that of ongoing narcosis. In the wake of an election in 1979 in which I was elected, there was debate in Westmeath County Council on the inaccuracies of the electoral register. That debate takes place after every election, so the good thing about this debate is that it is taking place before an election.</P>
      <P>I also support the call for a debate in this House on accident and emergency services. We had a useful debate on the issue some time ago. I would like the debate to focus on the abuse of the services as well as on their use.</P>
      <P>I call on the Leader to invite the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment into the House, with a view to making a regulation that obliges the catering industry to provide detailed bills to customers. At the moment, a legislative void exists with regard to this matter. Many outlets do not provide itemised bills and on three separate occasions when I asked for an itemised bill, I discovered I had been overcharged. The case has been well made for introducing legislation to rectify that situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the calls made for a debate on updating the register of electors because, as we are all aware, it is a shambles. In bygone days, the register was the responsibility of the revenue collector, who was more commonly known in rural areas as the rates collector. However, the embargo imposed by this Government on the recruitment of local authority personnel has resulted in significant staffing shortages. It is a tedious job to visit the various parishes in a county to ensure everyone over the age of 18 is listed on the register.</P>
      <P>Most local authorities, including Longford County Council, have introduced a student scheme. I was ahead of my time on this matter when I suggested to the officials responsible for the register of electors in my local authority that <Col N="801"/>they should employ a few students over the summer to work on the register. This is a good idea which should be promoted because large numbers of third level students regularly seek employment with local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator should confine his remarks to the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>Longford County Council, which is one of the smallest local authorities in the country, has received more than 30 <i>curricula vitae </i>from students and I hope those people can be taken on. I would be delighted if they are employed in any jobs that become available in my neighbouring counties of Westmeath, Cavan or Roscommon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator has made his point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>It was a bit rich of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to claim on radio yesterday that local authorities are awash with money because that is not the case. A significant number of infrastructural and sewerage schemes have remained on this Government&rsquo;s waiting list for the past decade and more. Shame on the Minister for making that statement on the airwaves.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Mr. Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>In light of the fact that the price of a barrel of oil has increased beyond $74 and that supply difficulties have arisen due to uncertainties in Iran and Iraq and the nationalisation by Bolivia of its energy sector, can the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources attend this House to discuss our dependence on imported oil and the policies which can be put in place to prevent disproportionate suffering in this nation should a crisis arise?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>It is welcome that Bus &Eacute;ireann and Dublin Bus plan to spend more than &euro;16 million on new buses. However, it is a disgrace that none of these buses will be wheelchair accessible, even though the supplier can provide accessible vehicles. Given that 70% of New York&rsquo;s public transport system is wheelchair accessible, it is ridiculous that we are not buying wheelchair accessible buses. I ask the Minister for Transport to ensure that all buses purchased are wheelchair accessible.</P>
      <P>Comhairle is spending between &euro;1 million and &euro;1.5 million on updating its image and designing a new logo. At a time when so many cutbacks are being made to social welfare spending, it is immoral that a body working with social welfare recipients should spend up to &euro;1.5 million on a logo. The Minister for Social and Family Affairs should stop this project immediately and give the money to social welfare recipients who need it.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="802"/>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKett"><NameTxt>Mr. Kett</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Further to the points made by Senator Cummins, I call on the Minister for Transport to explain how CIE can purchase vehicles worth &euro;16 million without considering the needs of people with disabilities. Last year we went through the Disability Bill here and the cornerstone of the debate was that Departments should think of disability when they make plans for the future. If this is the way CIE conducts its business we have a long way to go.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Last week I spoke on the need to cap VAT on fuel. Unfortunately no action has been taken. Every day fuel prices continue to increase. When one considers that the weakness of the American dollar is saving us from further increases, one realises how vulnerable we are. Senator Hanafin&rsquo;s point is correct. I repeat my call that the Minister for Finance come here and explain why a cap on fuel VAT cannot be implemented. Why do we doubly punish the motorist? While we cannot control the price of fuel imports, we can control the VAT charges. It is outrageous that the motorist is hit with a double take every day while fuel prices fluctuate. It should be easy to organise a cap on fuel VAT. We owe it to the hard-pressed motorists who are every day crippled by tolls, motor tax and long commutes. There is a significant variation in fuel prices around the country, as was evident on today&rsquo;s &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo;.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>The phrase &ldquo;name and shame&rdquo; sprung to mind as I heard it on the radio. We need a debate on that. We also need to ask why petrol companies put up prices immediately even though they had stock in hand. Perhaps we could widen Senator Hanafin&rsquo;s call for a debate on that topic.</P>
      <P>I regret that the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, refused to attend the nurses&rsquo; conference this week. It is relevant because this seems to be a symptom of&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P Just="Left">There is a need for a debate in this House on energy policy. Ireland is dependent on oil and many experts believe that at current consumption levels the world stocks of oil will run out in approximately 50 years time. The likelihood is that consumption will increase as far-eastern countries such as China become more <Col N="803"/>developed and that the date will be brought forward. We should explore the use of rape seed and other crops and give more incentives that would decrease the price of vehicles modified to use this type of fuel. We seem to be frightened of wind energy and running away from it. Little wind energy goes into the national grid and we need to increase that.</P>

	<P>The Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources recently came across a man in the west who wanted to put a small wind turbine in his back garden to power some of his home&rsquo;s electricity needs and reduce energy costs. The circumference of the turbine would have been smaller than a satellite dish, yet while one does not need planning permission for a satellite dish, he must go through the planning process for a wind turbine. We need to encourage wind energy and need a debate on it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFeighan"><NameTxt>Mr. Feighan</NameTxt>
	<P>I join with my colleagues in calling for a debate on the electoral register. I am disappointed that the penny has just dropped because this issue has been raised many times. My colleague, Senator McHugh, raised this issue over a year ago when he outlined that PPS numbers should be used in the electoral register. Maybe it is not too late, but something should have been done before this. I join with Senator Finucane in his point that the increase in drink driving is serious. There is a new train of thought on the many drugs and illegal substances in use. A UK report found that up to 20% of drivers are known to be driving under the influence of illegal substances, such as cocaine. These are not being taken into account with regard to the serious accidents taking place throughout the country. I am not taking away from the fact that drink driving is a major issue but the increase in the use of illegal substances is causing many accidents.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Blanchardstown local drugs task force on setting up a local drugs hotline so those who want to pass on information on drug dealing in their communities can inform the operators of the hotline, who relay the information to garda&iacute;. As politicians, we take great pride in the fact that we know what is happening on our own patch and in our communities. If we know what is going on, we can also pass information to garda&iacute;. I have done this in my constituency on two occasions and on both occasions garda&iacute; were successful in ensuring that drugs were retrieved or that people on drugs were apprehended. Politicians have a role to play in ensuring that drugs do not take hold in our communities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Senator Finucane, acting leader of the Opposition, raised again the issue of the electoral register. The Cathaoirleach will remem<Col N="804"/>ber that there was an extensive debate on this matter last Thursday on the Order of Business. Senator Finucane came forward with an excellent idea, namely, that each county council could appoint students to work in this area, as happened with the student employment scheme. This would awaken interest in politics among the young. It is an idea that should be brought to the Minister, Deputy Roche, and I hope we will have him to the House to debate the issue.</P>
      <P>There is too much emphasis on the possibility that Sinn F&eacute;in will defraud the people of votes and that people will vote in dead men&rsquo;s shoes and all of that. The real fraud is that people who are entitled to vote are not on the register, which is a mammoth problem. I spoke last week of my experiences in this regard and will not bore the House again. However, I was out in my area again in the past two nights and it is a major problem in every area I go into. Out of 500 houses, 200 people were not on the register.</P>

      <P>I welcome and applaud the salutary actions of the Garda last weekend. I saw some quite sheepish men getting out of a car when they were apprehended. I said &ldquo;Well done&rdquo; to the garda&iacute; involved. The fact that the issue has been highlighted is terrific. We should applaud garda&iacute; for their vigilance over the weekend, even though there were deaths, which are always appalling.</P>
      <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole referred to the national partnership and IBEC. I read recently in a newspaper that Turlough O&rsquo;Sullivan, the head of IBEC, stated that talks had to break on Good Friday because of the stations of the cross but that IBEC was the only group doing the stations of the cross because it was so lumbered. I go along with many of the Senator&rsquo;s points. We had a debate on the issue but we can look for a further debate and ascertain whether the Minister will come to the House. The talks are going on for ever.</P>
      <P>Senator O&rsquo;Meara asked whether, due to the democratic deficit, our input would be heard if we had a debate. That is the point. The Senator stated that resources are needed for local authorities to undertake a proper electoral audit. The accident and emergency debate will be taken in the House next week, which should be very instructive.</P>
      <P>Senator Kitt referred to the electoral register. One can pick out the Members who are going forward for election because they are all talking about this issue. In the period before the draft <Col N="805"/>register is published in November, if the councils authenticate the names that have been put forward, there is no need for garda&iacute;, peace commissioners or anyone else to sign the forms. When the draft register comes out in November, one must get the forms signed by an appropriate person. The Senator makes the point that people other than garda&iacute; should be empowered to sign the forms at that stage. We hope we will have the two counties in the constituency well covered by then.</P>
      <P>Senator Coghlan spoke about e-voting. The Taoiseach said clearly that when the independent commission, which is headed up by the eminent judge and of which the Clerk of the Seanad is a member, produces its report, the Government will be guided by it.</P>

	<P>No. Senator MacSharry spoke about the electoral register and about having a national identification card. He said it should be mandatory for people to vote about which I often thought. I do not know if it would mean reluctant voters or joyful ones, although I do not think they would ever by joyful. Voting is mandatory in many other countries.</P>
      <P>Senator Ross called for a debate on social partnership into which we have no input. He is correct that a framework ten-year plan is being sought. I do not know how effective that would be. He also said the salaries of some people in banks had increased, that trade unions only represent one third of workers and that IBEC does not represent all management.</P>
      <P>Senator Leyden called for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to come to the House to outline a national plan for a register of electors. The matter of the electoral register will have to be addressed by way of a national plan. He also called for a debate on accident and emergency which we will have next week.</P>
      <P>Senator Paddy Burke spoke about the electoral register and called for a debate on the BMW region. We could usefully have such a debate as soon as possible. Senator Glynn spoke about the compilation of the electoral register and called for a debate on accident and emergency services, which we will endeavour to have. He also asked for a directive on catering whereby one could get a breakdown of one&rsquo;s bill for lunch or dinner.</P>
      <P>Senator Bannon echoed what Senator Finucane said about the electoral register. Nobody suggested what Senator Finucane has in regard to using students to compile the register. Students, who thankfully are being educated, would be available to compile the register and it would be good for them to be involved. There is no doubt that local authorities have received increased funding. Given that this job is so enor<Col N="806"/>mous and will require such intensity of effort, a national plan will have to be devised.</P>
      <P>Senator Hanafin spoke about the price of oil and called for a debate on energy. I shared Senator Cummins&rsquo;s outrage when I read about the buses. I did not know an order had to be renewed. An order was made when I was Minister whereby all new buses and trains had to be wheelchair accessible. I did not realise another order had to be made, which is what the Minister said. It is a disgrace if &euro;60 million is to be spent on buses around the country that are not wheelchair accessible. We will take up that issue with the Minister. The Senator also raised the issue of Comhairle&rsquo;s new logo and the fact it wants to rebrand itself. Some of us could do with rebranding.</P>
      <P>Senator Kett also spoke about CIE purchasing buses without considering the needs of its users. It breaches the Disability Bill which we debated at length. If it is the case, I think it is illegal. However, I listened to a young woman on the radio and there seems to be a suggestion that it will not get these buses so we will have to find out the exact situation.</P>
      <P>Senator Browne spoke about the cap on VAT on fuel and the Irish Nurses Organisation conference. Senator Kenneally spoke about the need for an energy policy and the fact we are not debating wind energy. I agree with him in that regard. I received the same e-mail from that gentleman in Castlebar about putting a small wind turbine in his garden. There is loads of wind in Castlebar.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 1:</P><Col N="807"/>
      <P LI="1">In page 6, between lines 1 and 2, to insert the following new definition:</P>
      <P LI="1">&ldquo;<?oasys _is0p3- ?>&lsquo;the Agency&rsquo; means the Environmental Protection Agency as established by the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992;&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">This amendment would bring greater clarity to the Bill. There are many bodies involved in the planning process and citizens want clarity when they go through the legislation. Perhaps the Minister will consider accepting the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>These amendments are grouped together because they propose to redefine what can best be described as the actors involved in the planning process, namely, the EPA and prospective applicants, thus resulting in consequential deletions. I do not propose to accept them. I am happy that the Parliamentary Counsel has been very clear in the approach adopted. Much effort was put into the drafting of the Bill and I am confident that it is drafted clearly.</P>
      <P>The term &ldquo;Environmental Protection Agency&rdquo; is just as good and may be clearer than the shortened version proposed by Senator Bannon. However, I accept that he is trying to achieve clarity. If his amendment were adopted, it would be necessary to make a number of amendments to the Act of 2000 to bring the reference in that Act into line with the changed definition. That is a very important point. It seems unnecessary to do what is proposed because, ultimately, it would not add a great deal of value to the legislation.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Prospective applicant&rdquo; is defined where it applies in each case throughout the text. As it is only used regarding applicants or prospective applicants for consent for strategic infrastructure under sections 37A to 37C, its inclusion as a definition in Part 3 of the Act would add no real value in the sense that the Senator clearly intends.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 2 also has a fundamental flaw within it. It proposes to add a section 32 to an Act that already has a section 32. The existing section 32 contains the primary foundation statement of planning law that permission is required to carry out development. It also imposes the primary obligation to obtain planning permission on people who want to carry out development. I am certain the Senator does not want to replace that section or cause confusion in that regard but the proposition in amendment No. 2 would have that inadvertent effect. I do not believe the amendments add any real value. The Parliamentary Counsel has been particularly careful in these sections and reluctantly I do not intend to accept the amendments.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 2 is one of a large number of proposed by the Senator, which in essence would tweak the language of the Bill, rather than to make a substantive change. I fully accept that it <Col N="808"/>is done in the interests of introducing clarity. Laypeople like the Senator and I, looking at the language used by legal draftsmen, often find it rather tortured. I have said as a Senator and a Deputy that if we could find legal language more easily read and assimilated, we would do a great service. While I appreciate that the Senator&rsquo;s intentions are to try to improve the language of the Bill from a layman&rsquo;s point of view, the Government must take the advice of the Office of the Chief Parliamentary Counsel as to the best way to express certain ideas and to make them legally watertight, which is why the language may at times be tortured.</P>
      <P>While we may believe that something can be worded more clearly, we might not appreciate that a loophole is being left or that some confusion is being sowed. The challenge for the Parliamentary Counsel is to find language that most accurately expresses the intentions of the Bill. There is a particular risk of confusion when different language is used in different sections to express the same idea. Much of the language used in the Bill is based on the existing phraseology in the 2000 Act. While I understand the amendments are tabled with the best intentions, I do not propose to accept them for the reasons I have outlined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendment No. 2 would bring about a drafting improvement. The Government has always spoken about being customer friendly. It would improve the interpretation of the Bill for the layman. Including reference to the Environmental Protection Agency is important. The Minister understands that I want to bring greater clarity to the Bill. Amendment No. 11 seeks to delete lines 43 to 45 in page 6, which are unnecessary and only cause confusion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept that the Senator would like to use more commonplace, easily understood language in the Bill but, for the reasons I have outlined, tortuous language is sometimes necessary. I have mentioned already the reference to the EPA, and the language in the Bill is, if anything, more in keeping with common parlance.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>Amendment No. 11 proposes the deletion of lines 43 to 45, which include a reference to &ldquo;prospective applicant&rdquo;. Reference is also made in amendment No. 2, which proposes the insertion of a new section, to &ldquo;prospective applicant&rdquo; but amendment No. 11 will not arise if amendment No. 2 falls. I regret I am not in a position to accept the amendments, although I fully accept the intention is to try to improve readability. The Senator is in line with the Government in wanting to make these things customer friendly. We all want to do that but, for the reasons I have outlined, I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

Is that agreed? Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 6, lines 13 and 14, to delete &ldquo;if the following condition is satisfied&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;subject to subsection (2) of this section&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">This, like many other of the amendments in the group, is a simple technical amendment. Amendment No. 6, for example, simply inserts a comma after &ldquo;applicant&rdquo;, so I am sure that the Minister, Deputy Roche, would have no difficulty with that. Amendment No. 8 would delete &ldquo;situate&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;situated&rdquo; in page six, line 32. There is inconsistency in the Bill, and the word &ldquo;situated&rdquo; would be more appropriate in that case. Amendment No. 12 is a technical amendment, too, which would help to tidy up the Bill, as would amendments Nos. 14 to 19, inclusive, with the exception of amendment No. 17, on which I shall speak later.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Amendments Nos. 21 and 28 contain different definitions and are, again, technical, as are the rest of the amendments, with the exception of amendment No. 53. They would improve the Bill by tidying it up and clarifying the section. Perhaps the Minister, Deputy Roche, has taken those amendments on board. I hope he has, because I have studied the Bill in great detail and I think there are some omissions there. The amendments are very simple and would not alter the meaning of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Again, I commend Senator Bannon on his punctilious observations, particularly on punctuation points. Fowler could not have done better. The 45 amendments tabled by Senator Bannon are of a minor technical nature and are to do with drafting style. Many of these issues have been discussed over the years, but I do not <Col N="810"/>think it would be wise to amend a Bill that is as complex as this one simply on issues of drafting style.  Amendments Nos. 82 and 104 are Government amendments to make minor textual corrections that have no impact on the substance of the Bill but are necessary to correct errors detected since the Bill was published.</P>
      <P Just="Left">
      </P>
      <P>On the points made by Senator Bannon, I appreciate that his intentions are probably to improve the language used in the Bill. However, the Government must take the advice of the Parliamentary Counsel on the best way to express certain ideas and make them legally watertight. For example, in five or six of his amendments, Senator Bannon proposes the insertion of a comma. Quite a number of the amendments insert a comma, and there is nothing wrong with that in so far as when we use language, we often use commas and other punctuation. However, the problem with accepting those amendments would be that it would make some of the sentences legally less watertight than the Parliamentary Counsel would wish, and certainly than we would wish when enacting legislation. We may think that something is more easily understood by putting in punctuation, for example, but we may not appreciate that a loophole is left that could lead to confusion at best, and could in fact lead to legal challenge. With some of the amendments, when commas were inserted, I could understand the logic of it in terms of the spoken language but in terms of making the language legally watertight the advice is, sadly, to dispense with the commas and the other changes. I hope Senator Bannon understands that I am not being difficult but simply taking the advice I have received. I am not in a position to accept the amendments, well intentioned though they are. Obviously, we are hoping that the House will have no difficulty in accepting amendments Nos. 82 and 104, which are Government amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>This just shows the changing times in which we live. I would say that this Bill, like most documents now, was drafted on a computer. With modern technology there has been a change in the use of the comma, full stop and capital letters. In many instances in which they would normally have been used they are no longer used. There were no computers when the Minister and I were in primary school. The wording of the section shows the impact of modern technology on the drafting of Bills. I had hoped the Minister would accept my amendments which I tabled to tidy up and improve the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>Having read &ldquo;Eats, Shoots &amp; Leaves: The Zero Tolerance Approach to Punctuation&rdquo; by Lynne Truss, which is a classic book on punctuation, I have much sympathy for what Senator Bannon said. If the comma after the word &ldquo;Eats&rdquo; in the title was omitted, the title would have a very different meaning. The Minister explained <Col N="811"/>his intentions in respect of the section. In respect of the various amendments, I am happy in so far as we understand what is proposed in the Bill.</P>

      <P LI="1">&ldquo;(7) In this section &lsquo;appropriate planning authority&rsquo; means the appropriate planning authority that would have ordinarily dealt with the application referred to in that subsection, prior to the enactment of section 3 of the<?oasys _jy ?>Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Act 2006.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">This amendment is related to amendment No. 2. Delays in decisions in the planning process by the <Col N="812"/>relevant local authority in the past were often caused by the submission of a poorly-prepared application and environmental impact statement. Acceptance of this amendment would strengthen, tidy and bring greater clarity to this section. The wording of the definition proposed in the amendment, if accepted, would greatly benefit the Bill. Perhaps the Minister will consider accepting this amendment.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 58 is a technical amendment. It proposes:</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Bannon for tabling these amendments. I will not accept amendments for the reason to which I referred, although the Senator&rsquo;s point about the submission of haphazard applications was well made. However, this is not the appropriate Bill in which to express that point because one anticipates that anything that comes under this Bill of that magnitude would not involve &ldquo;back of the envelope&rdquo; calculations. However, the Senator&rsquo;s general point about the haphazard presentation of applications is a good one and one that perhaps should be expressed elsewhere.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I accept the Senator is making a general point to improve planning in the widest sense. My advice from the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel is that the wording of the section is a more watertight way of dealing with this matter. The language used by the draftsman in this paragraph in terms of enactment is the normal phrase used. Given the nature of this Bill and its significance, it is prudent for me to follow the Parliamentary Counsel&rsquo;s advice, notwithstanding that I intuitively agree with the Senator&rsquo;s point about the haphazard or careless presentation of planning applications on occasions. I do not believe that issue will arise in this case and I hope it will not because it would be a costly exercise for those involved. The advice from the Parliamentary Counsel is clear and I intend to stick with it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Mr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>On a point of order, this amendment is grouped with the amendments taken with amendment No. 3.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Bannon asked specifically for amendments Nos. 17 and 53 to be removed from that grouping.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Mr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, I understand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>The insertion of the word &ldquo;either&rdquo; in this subsection would bring greater clarity to it. It is important to insert the word &ldquo;either&rdquo; after the word &ldquo;that&rdquo;, as permission can be refused on the basis of either the application or the environmental impact statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>When the Senator suggested we should take this point aside and examine it, I was interested, but there is not a cogent argument for doing what the Senator proposes. If we were to insert the word &ldquo;either&rdquo; in this subsection, we would have to redraft the text elsewhere in this section and insert another word &ldquo;either&rdquo;, which would not add greatly to the text. If one includes the word &ldquo;either&rdquo; after the word &ldquo;that&rdquo; on line 40 of page 8, as Senator Bannon is proposing, one will subsequently have to insert the same word elsewhere in this section. It is a question of the stylistics of drafting.</P>
      <P>The insertion or omission of the word &ldquo;either&rdquo; would not have a significant impact on the Bill. The proposed section 37E is clear without the inclusion of the word &ldquo;either&rdquo;. If one makes such a change, one will have to examine the consequential text, which would complicate matters unnecessarily. I do not think the inclusion of the word &ldquo;either&rdquo; would bring any additional clarity to the situation. The text, as it stands, is clear enough on the issue of when a board may refuse to deal with an application. The proposed additional word would probably add nothing to the legislation. If I accept the amendment, I will have to consider the need for further redrafting. Therefore, I am not disposed to accepting it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not agree with the Minister. I propose that section 37E should state that &ldquo;the board may refuse to deal with any application made to it under this section where it considers that either the application for permission or the environmental impact statement is inadequate or incomplete, having regard in particular to the permission regulations and any regulations made under section 177 or to any consultations held under section 37B.&rdquo; The inclusion of the word &ldquo;either&rdquo; in that way would make more sense and give greater clarity. It should be emphasised that the board can refuse to deal with an application on the basis of problems with either of the documents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not necessary to insert the word &ldquo;either&rdquo; in this section of the Bill. If the <Col N="814"/>word is omitted, any decision of the board to &ldquo;refuse to deal with any application made to it under this section&rdquo; will be permitted if the board &ldquo;considers that the application for permission or the environmental impact statement is inadequate or incomplete&rdquo;. If one includes the word &ldquo;either&rdquo; in that provision, one will have to introduce it in again later in this section. It would be superfluous in that it would not actually bring any additional clarity to the legislation. The Bill clearly gives the board the power to issue a refusal if any of the circumstances which are mentioned present themselves. I do not think the inclusion of the word &ldquo;either&rdquo; in several parts of the legislation would give it any more clarity.</P>
      <P>Senator Bannon made a good point some time ago about computers, which were not around when parliamentary draftsmen started to hone their innate skills. In modern parlance, we tend to write things down and indent particular points under four or five headings. I am convinced that the insertion of the word &ldquo;either&rdquo; in this instance would not add the clarity that is demanded by Senator Bannon. It would not make any significant change to the meaning of this section. If I accept this amendment, I will be required to consider the follow-on text. I do not think there is a case for the insertion of the word &ldquo;either&rdquo;. I regret that I will have to be negative again as I hate being negative to the Senator, as he knows.</P>

    <P>Amendments Nos. 18 and 19 not moved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>We will now move on to amendment No. 20. As amendment No. 68, the amendment to amendment No. 86 and amendment No. 110 are cognate, and amendment No. 124 is related, we will take the amendments together, by agreement. Is that agreed? Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Mr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 20:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 9, between lines 9 and 10, to insert the following:</P>
      <P LI="2">&ldquo;(ii) specifying the website at which the text of the environmental impact assessment is available free of charge,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I welcome the Minister, Deputy Roche, to the House. I hope his comments about not wishing to be negative, which will be tested by these amendments, are true. The amendments seek to oblige developers to make the details of environmental impact assessments available on the Internet, free of charge. Such a small measure would help to inform public opinion. It is important that information should be communicated to the discerning public free of charge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator McCarthy&rsquo;s amendment, which seeks to improve the services offered to customers. This customer-friendly amendment should be accepted.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="815"/>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>That we are talking about websites in the context of legislation is a sign that we have come a long way. The amendments before the House seek the specific inclusion in the Bill of a provision that would require the publication in a newspaper of the name of a website on which an environmental impact assessment can be downloaded or viewed free of charge.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator McCarthy that it is critical that the planning system should use the Internet as much as possible. I said in another context over the past two days that we should use the Internet more frequently. Section 248 of the legislation already takes account of the possibility of publishing such information on websites.</P>
      <P>The Bill will amend section 146 of the principal Act, which ensures that where the board is required to supply any information, it may do so by electronic means, as long as it notifies the relevant parties that the information will be made available electronically. If such information is posted on a website, it is available free of charge as a matter of course. Therefore, no added value is offered by the specific inclusion of the phrase &ldquo;free of charge&rdquo;, as suggested by Senator McCarthy. I do not propose to accept this amendment for that reason.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The substance of the Senator&rsquo;s amendment, which is his desire that information about these matters be freely available, is dealt with in the body of the Act itself. I share the Senator&rsquo;s view that we should make this information as freely available as possible. That is the effect of the other sections of the Act I have mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Mr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his reply. It is important that he has made a statement about the need for more use of e-technology. That websites are being mentioned in legislation is a reflection of the progress we have made in the information age in recent times, especially as not too long ago, many people did not know what they were used for.</P>
      <P>E-technology needs to be used in the future and the principle I have outlined needs to be applied. I remember the Minister making a statement in the House approximately a year ago about the need to ensure that applications for planning permission can be lodged to local authorities on-line. I do not think there is any difficulty with that. One can tax one&rsquo;s car on-line without any problems at present. The good principle of communicating information free of charge, while encompassing e-technology, needs to be affirmed in legislation.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 21:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 9, to delete lines 10 to 19 and substitute the following:</P>

        &ldquo;(ii) specifying&mdash;&mdash;</P><Col N="816"/>

      <P LI="3">(II) that a copy of the application and the environmental impact statement may be inspected free of charge or purchased on payment of a specified fee (which fee shall not exceed the reasonable cost of making such copy), and&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I am proposing a different definition. I do not think the Minister has clarified this issue. I would like him to tidy up and clarify this section of the Bill.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>As amendments Nos. 22 to 27, inclusive, 70 to 72, inclusive, and 74 form a composite proposal, they may be discussed together, with the agreement of the House. Is that agreed? Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 22:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 9, lines 23 and 24, to delete &ldquo;of the proposed development&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0" Just="Left">This amendment is being taken with amendment No. 23, which proposes the deletion of the same words, and amendments Nos. 24 and 25, which propose the insertion of the words &ldquo;the proposed development were&rdquo;. These technical amendments, particularly amendment No. 25, would give greater clarity to the Bill. Perhaps the Minister will also examine amendment No. 26, which I have tabled to correct a grammatical error. Amendment No. 27 proposes the deletion of the words &ldquo;in relation to a proposed development to the Board&rdquo; in lines 13 and 14 of page 10 of the Bill. Is the Minister considering a report in this regard?</P>
      <P>Again, amendment No. 28 is a technical amendment, proposing on page 10, line 16, to delete &ldquo;the views of the members&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;their views&rdquo;. This would bring greater clarity to the Bill. It is probably just a matter of definitions and perhaps the Minister can take some or all of them on board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Again I thank Senator Bannon. This is really a stylistic issue. He is proposing in the main here to remove the words &ldquo;proposed development&rdquo;. If one goes back to the spoken language the words &ldquo;proposed development&rdquo; would not be used time and again in different sections which are clearly related. We are not talking about the spoken language, however, but a legal text and the advice is to leave those words in.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="817"/>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>It is just complicating matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator is possibly right. It adds significantly to the word count, but if one considers, from a different viewpoint, the possibility of a legal challenge to a particular section it is clear that the section requires the type of self-containment ensured by including the whole set of words. On amendment No. 26, I am not sure that it is grammatically correct to take out &ldquo;from the&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;of&rdquo;. The oracles might need to be consulted on that, but we cannot accept the amendment. Basically, amendments Nos. 22 to 25, inclusive, by deleting the words &ldquo;the proposed development&rdquo;, and in particular by doing it twice in section 37E(3) and 37E(3)(<i>c</i>) &mdash; although the Senator does not propose making a related deletion in paragraph (<i>c</i>) &mdash; would be necessary if the amendment were to be accepted. However, amendments Nos. 70 to 72, inclusive, and amendment No. 74 propose similar changes. As I said, it is more a question of style than substance, particularly in the case of the minor amendments Nos. 26 and 27, which would have no impact on the Bill. It would be better to leave the Bill as it is, although I compliment Senator Bannon on his punctilious observations on grammar.</P>
      <P>The more serious issue is the deletion of the words &ldquo;of the proposed development&rdquo; and it would be unwise to do that for the reasons I have outlined. Although one would not necessarily repeat the same phrase over and over in the spoken word, in the legal text it is necessary, and so regrettably I must again be negative. My heart is with the Senator, however, on the necessity to tidy up and shorten the legal text. In this particular case, in the interests of clarity, it is important to retain the words he has suggested should be deleted. I regret I cannot accept his amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>On amendment No. 27, which proposes the deletion of &ldquo;in relation to a proposed development to the Board&rdquo;, the phrase &ldquo;under subsection (4), submit the report&rdquo; could refer to any report. The Minister has not specified a report, so perhaps he might provide more clarity in that regard. Different interpretations may be taken. It just states &ldquo;submit the report&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The words &ldquo;in relation to a proposed development to the Board&rdquo; have a very specific purpose in that particular sentence, if one reads the entire section. To delete those words would have the exact opposite effect to that being sought. Section 37E(4) reads, &ldquo;...prepare and submit to the Board a report setting out the views of the authority on the effects of the proposed development on the proper planning and sustainable development of the area of the authority, having regard in particular...&rdquo;. The balance of that section would be affected adversely by adopting the Senator&rsquo;s proposal. It would be unwise to do that. It is a complex section but to <Col N="818"/>remove those words would not have the effect the Senator desires.</P>
      <P Just="Left">It goes on to state: &ldquo;The manager of a planning authority shall, before submitting any report in relation to a proposed development to the Board under subsection (4), submit the report to members of the authority and seek the views of the members on the proposed development.&rdquo; I am very anxious, as I am sure is the Senator, that this be crystal clear. In this section of the Bill we want to do something that has not been done since 1963, that is, to provide in law a very specific right to elected representatives in councils to make observations on a planning application on which a decision is in the process of being made. It is important therefore that this particular section is precise and provides the planning authority and council members with a clear view of what is expected. I am conscious that this is breaking new ground. I believe the Senator welcomed it when we discussed it on Second Stage. It is to make it clear that people cannot decide to throw in the kitchen sink and everything else. The phrase, &ldquo;the manager of a planning authority shall, before submitting any report&rdquo;, refers to a report on the specific case under review. It would be unwise to strike the words out because they tie down precisely what powers we are going to give the councillors. It is unique because this has not happened since the mid-1960s when the original planning regulations came in. It is very important that this is drafted with a degree of precision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Mr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>While I support Senator Bannon on this, the Minister is making an important point about giving powers to members of local authorities. We have seen their role undermined somewhat in recent times. The Local Government (No. 2) Bill, for example, removed the decision making ability members of local authorities had as regards setting the cost of waste collection. That gives rise to a greater issue, namely, the role of the elected member and his or her reserved functions. It is very important that management at all times is at least obliged, as the legislation intends, to be accountable to the elected member, who is the agent between the public and the executive of the council. That is an important point that has been made this afternoon. It revisits the heart of local democracy. Senator Bannon, I know, is concerned that matters be clearly outlined and understood and he deserves support, but it is very important to underline that ethos in legislative terms so that the manager of the local authority is obliged by virtue of legislation to issue reports to elected members. There is an element of accountability there and it restores some heart to local government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I, too, support the statement by the Minister as regards strengthening the role of elected members of local authorities. We are all <Col N="819"/>elected representatives in some shape or form and have to deal with local authorities and planning and development applications in our counties. Perhaps the Minister could go even further and name local authorities and also public representatives in this particular area. That would strengthen the legislation and show the respect in which the elected local representative is held. After all, the elected member, in effect, is the voice of the people on the ground. Their views should come first. In no way will they step on the toes or fly in the face of the elected member. It is an important go-between involving the people and Government and due recognition should be extended to local councillors throughout the country. For far too long their role has been diluted and diminished in much of the legislation enacted. They have been bypassed as regards environmental protection legislation and in several other areas. Hopefully the Minister will try to re-establish many of the powers that were taken from local authority members over the years to give them a greater role in functional democracy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CyprianBrady"><NameTxt>Mr. Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is making an important point as regards the clarity of language in particular. Judging by his previous amendments it is clear Senator Bannon is concerned about the precise use of language. We have all had experience, particularly at local authority level, of instances where officials have taken advantage of a lack of clarity in a particular section, be it on planning or any other issue, in regard to elected representatives or with the general public. The more clarity and conciseness that can be brought to a section like this, the better. This is especially the case in this context where it is specified that the report has to be a specific report covered under the previous section. In light of the other amendments we are discussing, particularly about language, it is crucial we have clarity in this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>I support what Senator Brady and the Minister said about clarity of language. I expect all sides of the House would agree on the importance of this issue.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The introduction of preplanning meetings has been very important for public representatives and the public. Local authorities must employ more planners because there is a shortage of planners due to the significant number of applications now being made to each local authority. When we abolished the dual mandate we put in place an arrangement for Oireachtas Members to meet with county managers at least once a year but in many local authorities more frequent meetings take place. In County Galway we try to meet at least twice a year and perhaps we will improve on that in the future. We can also discuss planning issues at those meetings, which is important. As well as the introduction of more clarity, posi<Col N="820"/>tive things are happening in local authorities in regard to planning and planning applications in particular.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I will not accept this amendment and reading through it again and listening to the debate I am conscious that we are <i>ad idem</i> on one thing. Senator McCarthy stated that over the years there has been a haemorrhaging away of authority from elected representatives. Senator Bannon made the same point. In many ways councillors find themselves as rather impotent in a council chamber faced, as they frequently are, by the dominant powers wielded by managers. We have specified those powers which are reserved to councillors and everything which is not reserved to them is, effectively, an executive function. By definition, that means that the executive functions have grown dramatically over the years whereas the reserved functions have only grown where the law has specifically given powers to councillors.</P>
      <P>This section has to be read in conjunction with those sections following it. For the first time I am giving powers to local councillors which they will use judiciously to record their views and to make sure that these views will be noted even where they may be separate, and sometimes on major issues will be separate, to the views of the management team which may be the proposer or closely associated with some of the infrastructure. I want councillors to have a very specific power here, namely that they may comment in this area. While I accept Senator Bannon&rsquo;s general point about the excessive use of words and phrases, it is important to maintain them because if ever there was a section where this was required it is here as it makes the intention clear.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Kitt in that I too find the process frustrating. Senators will be aware from their own experience that planning legislation refers to ministerial guidelines being issued. They are not diktats but they do have a power in law. The word &ldquo;guidelines&rdquo; is sometimes used in a way that would suggest they are desiderata rather than having any compelling element within them. That is sometimes the way it is defined by local authorities.</P>
      <P>In this section I am breaking with all precedent in giving specific powers to councillors. I know that on all sides of both Houses there is an awareness that it is necessary that this is done. I must be very specific in what I am doing here. I do not want to provide an opportunity for people to ramble all over the place, I want precision. This is a case where, with respect, it would be wise to retain the words set out and I propose so doing. For positive reasons I am not accepting Senator Bannon&rsquo;s amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>We are all in agreement that more power should be given to local authority members. As I pointed out in regard to several other items of legislation, powers have been <Col N="821"/>taken away from elected members. What frustrates elected members around the country is that county development plans are prepared and signed off by the elected members but the interpretation of definitions is subsequently taken by county managers when they consider planning applications. The interpretation of managers and elected members frequently differs. This can be most frustrating. The problem most likely has to do with the wording, which councillors sometimes do not fully understand.</P>
      <P>Managers always appear to have a knack of getting around the wording in county development plans to accommodate themselves, which leads to frustration for elected members as they are conscious of cases where young people are trying to get planning permission, for example, on their own farms. This is especially a problem if they are in close proximity to a scenic area even if the area in which they want to build does not come within that designation and would not obstruct a view of the designated scenic area. Common sense does not prevail and this frustrates elected members from time to time.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister will bring some clarity to this matter and try to ensure that planning permission can be given for sites with views over a townsland or section of townsland because currently no development is allowed in areas that are designated as scenic. In some cases where a person farms 50, 60, 70 or 100 acres it is very frustrating if some section of the farm is not considered acceptable for a housing development for the use of the landowner or a family member.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>The last part of Senator Bannon&rsquo;s contribution is not something against which I would argue. He will accept I have already made guidelines on rural planning for which I have been roundly criticised by some quarters but about which I am proud, especially when I drive through the country and see the resurrection of the countryside, the very point Senator Bannon advocated. I do not think the amendment deals with this problem. If Senator Bannon would accept the point I make&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and getting back to the amendment, it is important that we keep the precision as it is drafted. That will be to the advantage of councillors around the country. They will know precisely and specifically on what they may draw up a report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 23 to 32, inclusive, not moved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 33:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 10, between lines 35 and 36, to insert the following:</P><Col N="822"/>
      <P LI="1">&ldquo;(8) Where a reasonable request that the Board consult with an independent health expert on the health implications of any proposed infrastructural development is received by the Board from local residents or other interested local parties, such a request shall be complied with.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">It is essential that this amendment should be made because it proposes the involvement of an independent health expert. It is particularly disappointing that the legislation makes no attempt to equip planning bodies with the necessary health and safety expertise, which would help to restore public confidence in the entire planning system and ensure planing decisions are made with public health as a primary interest. For example, when an incinerator comes up for planning permission, why does the issue of public health barely get a mention? It is important that an independent health expert could be called in to give a view on this issue. Why are representatives of the World Health Organisation never permitted to address planning authorities or the public? I highlighted this issue previously and it is important that the amendment should be taken on board because it would allay public fears.</P>
      <P>The greatest issue people have with incinerators is the lack of research and denial of an opportunity to independent health experts to give their view in the legislation. This is a good amendment, which should be taken on board in the interest of the health and safety of all our citizens. If there are no health implications, there is nothing to fear and, therefore, experts should be brought in, given that people would go along with their views. Protests, anger and annoyance, which result from the failure to obtain the best advice, would be diminished among the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>The Bill does not exclude expert advice. It provides that the board may seek the views of any person or party it feels may have information relevant to the determination of an application. That would include health experts if, in the opinion of the board, that would be appropriate. The Bill also provides for the making of regulations to prescribe bodies for the purpose of consultation on an application. The normal practice was to make reference to the health boards and the specific reference, following the enactment of the legislation, will be to their successor. Health boards have been prescribed authorities &ldquo;where it appears that the development might have a significant effect on public health&rdquo;. Making regulations would be more appropriate to avail of the necessary health expertise and reference would be made to the HSE.</P>
      <P>As the Senator said, health issues are important but they are only one aspect of planning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>They are an important aspect.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="823"/>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, that is why a specific reference can be made in this regard to regulations, as has happened in the past. It is not necessary to amend the legislation because the board may seek the views of any person or party it feels may have information and that would include health experts. The practice was to make regulations to prescribe bodies for the purpose of consultation which, in this case, were the health boards but the reference will be to the HSE and that is the most appropriate method of dealing with a specific issue. I accept the Senator&rsquo;s comment that it is an important issue but it is more appropriate to specify bodies in regulation, which will achieve the same purpose as his amendment, and that is my intention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">It is essential that this amendment should be inserted because reference is not made to health and safety expertise in the legislation. The Minister referred to health boards but they were abolished more than 12 months ago. Their successor, the HSE, is not mentioned. I plead with the Minister to take the amendment on board. It is not too much to ask him to accept it because it will allay the public&rsquo;s fears.</P>
      <P>The Minister and I are politicians for a long time and we have experienced the anger that can be generated by proposals for incinerators in local communities. A few years ago a delegation of local authority representatives visited a number of European countries to examine incinerators. A large delegation visited an incinerator in Germany in the context of preparing the regional waste management plans but it closed three weeks later. That caused a great deal of hassle and the regional plans were not adopted at the time. The former Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Noel Dempsey, then abolished the waste management powers of local authorities.</P>
      <P>However, the local authorities had genuine reasons not to adopt the plans, given that they provided for incineration. We had witnessed what happened in Germany. Health and safety issues resulted in the closure of that facility, which I visited at the time. We were told it was a state-of-the-art facility, which catered for the needs of the area but three weeks after we returned it was closed in a blaze of publicity, not only in Ireland but throughout Europe, on health and safety grounds. This amendment would instill confidence in people that an independent health expert could be called by the board. I would appreciate it if the Minister would take the amendment on board because many people will be angry if he does not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CyprianBrady"><NameTxt>Mr. Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>All of us can pick an example. I visited incinerators in different parts of Europe and I agree with the Senator on the health issue. We recently visited the headquarters of the Environmental Protection Agency and its officials point out that the health implications of <Col N="824"/>incinerators are included in an environmental impact assessment. The agency assesses all issues, including traffic, sewerage, electricity, health and safety and so on. It is open to the EPA to take on whatever expert advice it feels is necessary. The Minister stated the Bill does not exclude consultation with experts and, therefore, local authorities can engage an expert if they need an opinion. We can all outline examples of developments going wrong but the thrust of the Bill is in the interest of the wider good. All of us have dealt with delegations and protests about various issues, including incineration, and that will not change. The public has access to many different mechanisms in this regard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Section 3 deals with permission for strategic infrastructure development. We might have concentrated too much on incineration for the past 20 minutes of the debate, but I agree with what has been said about the health implications. This section refers to proper planning and development, as the Minister rightly pointed out. I hope that is the overriding view. The board can query issues about health.</P>
      <P>Senator Bannon&rsquo;s amendment refers to a reasonable request. What might be reasonable to Senator Bannon might not be reasonable to me or to someone else. Some of the amendments refer to doing things &ldquo;as far as practicable&rdquo;. I worry about that phrase because we need certainty. The Bill is very extensive and it deals with proper planning and development for these major projects. If the board wishes to get a view on health implications, it can do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I gave Senator Bannon&rsquo;s point some thought during the short break between press conferences and other things. I understand his concerns, but the health issue would have to be covered in an EIS. In a project developed under this Bill, an EIS would be part and parcel of the process. The arrangements in the Bill as stated are permissive, that is they allow the local board to call on such expertise as they deem necessary. It would be more appropriate to deal with this specific issue through regulation and this has been the practice in the past, when reference was made in regulation to the former health boards.</P>
      <P>I will give further thought to the matter before Report Stage. A recital will be made of the expertise to which a board can refer and I will determine at that stage whether additional references should be made. I accept the Senator&rsquo;s point that health is important but we must also realise that in drafting this strategic infrastructure legislation, we do not want to provide for estoppel procedures because that would negate the purpose of the Bill. It is important to achieve the proper balance.</P><Col N="825"/>
      <P>The EIS will inevitably address any health implications that arise in the course of infrastructural projects. The Bill as it stands is permissive, so a board can call on expertise where it is considered necessary and this will undoubtedly be done. A precedent has been set with regard to making reference in regulation to the bodies which must be consulted. I will consider the possibility, in the context of a recital of the various issues, of making further reference to the matter. I have a certain sympathy with the points made by the Senator but I cannot accept the amendment as it is written because it clearly provides for estoppel procedures, which would negate the purpose of the legislation. The appropriate health body will be referred to in regulation and the Bill&rsquo;s permissive terms will allow the board access to value-free health expertise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>This Bill provides for the transfer of many of the Minister&rsquo;s powers to An Bord Plean&aacute;la. Senator Kitt referred to discussions on incineration and landfills but we are entitled to debate such issues because the Senator knows as well as I the controversies which arise from them. Concern exists among the public about the health implications of major waste management projects such as incinerators but these concerns have never been clearly addressed. In the past, I have called for the establishment of scientific review committees to deal with those issues and to allay people&rsquo;s fears, yet the Government has not responded. I am pressing this amendment because it is important to the health and safety of our citizens and communities.</P>

    <P>Amendment declared lost.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>It is proposed to discuss amendments Nos. 34, 105, amendment No. 1 to amendment No. 116, and amendments Nos. 117 and 125 together. Is that agreed? Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Mr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 34:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 10, line 38, to delete &ldquo;at its absolute discretion and&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">Lord Acton said absolute power corrupts absolutely. The term &ldquo;absolute discretion&rdquo; as it is used here is outdated and the legislation would be as effective without it.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="826"/>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I tend not to disagree with the Senator on the question of absolute power. This phrase was introduced for good reason in section 16 of the 1976 Act that established An Bord Plean&aacute;la. It was introduced to prohibit interference with the board and to prevent it from being stymied in its right to make a decision on an oral hearing.</P>
      <P>The phrase jumps off the page and causes difficulties for me as well as for the Senator. However the arguments for continuing to use it, which practice commenced in the 1976 Act and was continued in the 2000 Act, are overwhelming. The Senator proposes the removal of absolute discretion being granted to the board on a number of <Col N="827"/>functions, most notably on oral hearings but also to require further information from the applicant or other person, request the revision of the application or hold meetings with the applicant or other person where the board feels that it would be helpful in determining an application. To leave the board open to vexatious challenges, as the removal of the words would do so, would damage the planning process.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>On the issue of oral hearings, I strongly believe that the board must be given absolute discretion to decide when to hold an oral hearing and when not to do so. It would unnecessarily tie the board to leave it open to challenge on each and every occasion. This would run directly counter to the purpose of the Bill, which is to try to create a system that works more efficiently than the present system while also balancing the powers. It would allow the board to re-balance the situation in which increasing numbers of oral hearings are being held on relatively minor CPO cases.</P>
      <P>Let me give an example of this. If the words were removed from the Bill, the board could be challenged time and again on whether there should be an oral hearing on a CPO case. The only people who would gain from this would be legal eagles. One point is certain, it would not serve the public good. While the phrase &ldquo;absolute discretion&rdquo; jars with me, as it does with the Senator, the public interest is the best argument for keeping it in the Bill. If every minor CPO could be subject to legal challenge where it is decided that the board does not want to hold an oral hearing, that would not be in the public interest. The board must have the discretion to use its judgment with regard to the holding of oral hearings. The phrase &ldquo;absolute discretion&rdquo; simply underlines the fact and ensures that the board cannot be challenged where it makes a call on its procedures.</P>
      <P>The phrase is used extensively in the 2000 Act but my understanding is that it first appeared in section 16 of the 1976 Act. It is important not to risk any confusion by using different language in different sections of the Bill to express the same idea. I ask the Senator not to press the amendment. If one considers the arguments which were put forward, obnoxious though the words &ldquo;absolute discretion&rdquo; used in conjunction tend to be, there are cogent reasons we should keep and continue to use the phrase in this case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Mr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate the Minister&rsquo;s reply. There is obvious merit in what he says and the point is well made. If one wants an example of the Minister&rsquo;s point, one need look no further than the incinerator in Cork and the disparity between the inspector&rsquo;s report and the absolute discretion of the board in that case. I may revisit this matter on Report Stage but the fact that this term was introduced in 1976 is at least an indication that we may look at other phraseology that <Col N="828"/>might better address the point the Minister makes. I accept the board needs to have no outside interference to reinforce its independence, which is an aim to which we all aspire. I will withdraw the amendment but I may revisit it on Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I am grateful to the Senator. If one examines the 1976 Act, one will find a reference in the same section to the Minister having certain rights to overrule. That has since been dropped. The Senator is right that it is important that we protect the board&rsquo;s right to make decisions. If he raises the matter on Report Stage, I will address any queries he has.</P>

      <P FLI="0">These amendments are of a technical nature and will provide a clearer interpretation of the Bill. They are self-explanatory and would greatly improve the Bill. The Minister would be wise to accept them and I hope he will consider doing so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator will not be surprised that I believe the amendments do not add value. One thing they achieved was to keep many of my officials up over the weekend. They were saying prayers for the Senator because I said I wanted each individual case dealt with.</P>
      <P>The question is again one of language usage. The inclusion of the words &ldquo;for permission&rdquo; in every phrase could be regarded as somewhat pedantic in the spoken word but here we are referring to the written word in a legal text. The overwhelming advice is to retain the phrase. In fact, there is an irony in that elsewhere the Senator is seeking to add words whereas here he seeks to remove them. It is a question of legal drafting or of legal eagles having slightly different views as to the best way to express the same meaning. I cannot accept the amendments.</P>

      <P FLI="0">This is a technical amendment which would improve the Bill, although the Minister may have a different view. The Minister stated his officials were up late over the weekend. I also burned more than the midnight oil putting the amendments together.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="829"/>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Senator stop? The amendment is a little pedantic. To add the words &ldquo;where applicable&rdquo; is somewhat otiose if one reads the section. The amendment could insert the phrase &ldquo;where applicable&rdquo; in a paragraph permitting the board &ldquo;to indicate that it is considering granting permission, subject to the applicant for permission submitting revised&rdquo; drawings. The amendment is unnecessary because the section itself states that the board has an absolute discretion as to when it would do this.</P>
      <P>The provision is one of the important changes brought by the board to allow it to have greater flexibility in handling major applications. It allows the board to ensure the right development in the right place. The Senator is not in any way querying that, with which I am pleased. However, to add the words &ldquo;where applicable&rdquo; would not in this case bring anything additional to the drafting. It is otiose and excessive wording because the section itself is clear in that it gives these powers to the board to use where applicable.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sorry the Senator had to stay up so late at night. I hope he did not lose too much beauty sleep. Unlike the previous amendments where he wanted to strike out words, these amendments add words. I understand the Senator&rsquo;s point, which is to remove the phrase &ldquo;or for the purposes of an activity for which&rdquo; from subsection (5) and insert a similar phrase later in the Bill, which is a little odd. The phrase used throughout the Planning and Development Act 2000, the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992 and the Waste Management Act 1996 is &ldquo;comprising or for the purposes of an activity&rdquo;. That is sufficiently broad to ensure the EPA is consulted where it is necessary for the board to obtain its views.</P>
      <P>I do not propose to accept the amendment. There is a risk of confusion where different language is used in different sections to express the same idea. Much of the language used in the Bill is based on the existing phraseology of the 2000 <Col N="830"/>Act. That is why I want to keep the language in the two pieces of legislation, which will be read in conjunction with each other, as close as is possible. Senator Bannon stayed up very late that night but I hope it was a pleasant one for him otherwise. I cannot accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I submitted similar amendments on Committee Stage of the Waste Management Bill and the Protection of the Environment Bill. Although the Minister said on Committee Stage he would not take them on board, I noticed he tabled them as Government amendments on Report Stage. I would not be surprised to see some of these amendments on Report Stage. The Minister has probably not studied the Bill fully. Some of these amendments will be tabled as Government ones on Report Stage when I will be able to comment on them further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>All I can say is that the Senator&rsquo;s charms and persuasive powers worked more easily on the less hard-hearted Minister at the time. I do not wish to crush the Senator entirely but in amendment No. 44, he proposes to delete the word &ldquo;a&rdquo; in the phrase &ldquo;an integrated pollution control licence or a waste licence&rdquo; in subsection (5). The phrase is grammatically and legally correct so I cannot accept that amendment either. If I accept some of the amendments on Report Stage, the Senator can say &ldquo;I told you so&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 44 to 46, inclusive, not moved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 47:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 12, line 11, after &ldquo;subsection (5)&rdquo; to insert the following:</P>
      <P LI="1">&ldquo;, and it shall not make such a decision within that period without having either&mdash;</P>
      <P LI="2">(i) considered the observations of the Agency, or</P>
      <P LI="2">(ii) received notification from the Agency that the Agency does not intend to make a submission&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">This is an important amendment which is why the Minister should accept it. If there is no decision from the agency, we should not delay. If consultation has taken place or if there is no need for it, we should not wait a specific period but should move on and allow the development to go ahead. It is important to involve the Environmental Protection Agency. The Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Environment and Local Government received an invitation to visit the agency during Easter week. It is important that all public representatives, particularly directors of services in local authorities dealing with the environment, visit the agency and meet the directors who are doing a good job. They are very open to dis<Col N="831"/>cussions with elected representatives, whether Oireachtas Members or local authority members, and officials of local authorities. That should be encouraged and I mentioned it to Dr. Kelly who said she would take it on board and try to consult the members and chairpersons of environment committees in local authorities. Such consultation and negotiation is important as it would give people greater insight into the work of the agency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CyprianBrady"><NameTxt>Mr. Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Senator Bannon in regard to the EPA and Dr. Kelly. The Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Environment and Local Government visited the EPA recently and we had a very fruitful meeting with the board. It has committed itself to going into communities, particularly where there are issues in regard to major developments which would affect the environment. It is also committed to consultation with various groups, including non-government organisations and elected bodies, on such issues.</P>
      <P>On the amendment, section 3 states that &ldquo;the board may request the Environmental Protection Agency to make observations within such period (which period shall not in any case be less than 3 weeks)&rdquo;. It is possible to extend the period if the agency believes an extension is required. It is essential the State agency vested with protecting our environment is comprehensively consulted when any of these major infrastructural developments takes place. The expertise the agency has to hand and which it has built up over the years will prove essential when these major developments take place. I do not believe the amendment is necessary because the section provides for what is required, particularly in regard to the EPA.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Bannon for his comments on the EPA because it is easy for people to knock statutory agencies which have been established and demand that the Minister of the day interfere with their independence. I will make sure Senator Bannon&rsquo;s positive comments are conveyed to Dr. Kelly who, along with her colleagues, have given some considerable service to the EPA. While I do not always agree with the decisions the agency makes, it is robustly independent. It is good Senator Bannon made those points. The point he made about local authorities establishing a more fruitful relationship with the EPA can only be positive. That we demonise agencies when we do not like their decisions but refer to the same agencies in august terms when they make decisions we like is a little immature. The Senator&rsquo;s point was well made and I am grateful for it.</P>
      <P>Having said those nice things, I cannot accept Senator Bannon&rsquo;s amendment. I will explain why because he deserves an explanation. If I were to accept this amendment, the strategic consent process, which we all agree needs to be put in place <Col N="832"/>and which we are attempting to do in this legislation, would be out of step with the arrangements in place for non-strategic planning cases. That, in itself, would be odd. In principle, it should be noted that the board does not proceed to make decisions without having obtained the views of the EPA. Certainly in significant areas, the board and the EPA have a very fruitful relationship.</P>
      <P>The Senator suggests we should be even more ambitious in terms of getting decisions out of the new board quickly. That is to be commended and there are arguments to be made for that. If this were to go ahead, it would stop that happening and would operate as a blocking process. The planning and the IPPC licensing systems are separate but related processes. There is an interface between the two. The EPA and the board operate well and closely. One of the key features of that interface is the ability of the developer, for example, to choose to pursue planning consent and an IPPC licence separately or contemporaneously.</P>
      <P>I am strongly of the view that it would be better to leave this proposition out because I cannot foresee a situation where the two agencies would be so out of sync. As I said, in the non-strategic planning cases, one would not have this requirement. It could operate to frustrate the purpose of the Bill that we would move major planning decisions on as quickly as possible. There is a sufficiently cogent argument for the Senator to accept generously my points and not press the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 48:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 13, between lines 21 and 22, to insert the following:</P>
      <P LI="1">&ldquo;(3) When making a decision in respect of a proposed development for which an application is made under section 37E, the Board shall, without prejudice to the generality of subsection (1), consult with any relevant planning, local or regional authority, so that it shall be apprised of the opinions of local people and their representatives, and the Board shall&mdash;</P>

      <P FLI="0" el="5">
        <?oasys _is0p10- ?>
        <?oasys _ix ?>save where there is good, justifiable and stated reason not to so do.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0" el="5">This amendment, particularly the term &ldquo;stated reason&rdquo;, is very important. It is about consultation with local authorities, to which the Minister referred. It is important to include my provision at this juncture. We cannot erode democratic participation in vital decision-making that affects every citizen. Local and regional authorities and the various town councils have county develop<Col N="833"/>ment plans, regional plans, town plans and area plans in place. We cannot fly in the face of these and it is very important that their recommendations be taken on board. This is what my amendment is all about.</P>
      <P>Public participation in the planning process is very important, including in respect of controversial projects concerning incineration, landfill sites, electricity pylons, etc. Many of the powers of elected representatives are being transferred to An Bord Plean&aacute;la under this legislation and thus Ministers will not have to take responsibility. It is important to ensure the process operates in a transparent, balanced and fair manner.</P>
      <P>We are all citizens of the State and it is therefore important that we do not remove the input of the public into the planning process for major infrastructural projects. It is vital that citizens continue to have a say. Ireland is our land and I agree that we must pass it on intact. Individuals take decisions that affect people as a whole and politics is all about people. Sometimes people say all politicians are the same and that they, the people, have no regard for politics and no interest therein, but politics is ultimately about people. Councillors, who represent the voice of the people, have a right to be consulted. This amendment will ensure that the people are included and that their views are taken into account.</P>
      <P>We cannot limit full public scrutiny. However, I am afraid this will be done if my amendment is not accepted and I therefore urge the Minister to take it on board. It proposes involving the public and consulting regional and local authorities. The authorities&rsquo; plans exist for a purpose and apply for a specific period. We cannot jeopardise plans that have been put in place by those who represent the voice of the people, namely, the elected representatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I share the Senator&rsquo;s passion for maximum consultation with local communities through their elected representatives. As I have outlined, and as the House welcomed, the Bill is noteworthy in that it provides a specific requirement for such consultation to take place. It provides very specifically that the views of councillors must be submitted in a separate document and not incorporated as an appendage to the views of management. They must be outlined clearly and unequivocally.</P>
      <P>Much of what the Senator&rsquo;s amendment purports to do is already catered for in the Bill. The board is required to consult local authorities. The Senator stated he is very anxious that decisions refer to the stated basis on which they are made. The new section 37H(2) sets out what a decision given under section 37G and the notification of the decision shall state. There is a good deal of precision in this regard. I share and have foreseen the Senator&rsquo;s views on this, as is evident from the Bill.</P>
      <P>There is a specific requirement to have consultation with local authorities in the area in which <Col N="834"/>a proposed development takes place. If this Bill is passed, the manager will have to consult the members before submitting the report to the board. Any recommendations of the members must be attached to the report and highlighted separately. This arrangement is unique and Senators have welcomed it.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Under the new section 37G(2)(<i>b</i>), the board will be required to consider, <i>inter alia</i>, the provisions of any relevant development plan and regional planning guidelines in force. These documents represent the outcome of very substantial consultation with the public and a wide variety of interests in terms of proper planning and sustainable development. The provisions the Senator is anxious to include are explicit in the Bill.</P>
      <P>The Senator did not touch upon the reference in the Bill to section 37E(4). Arising from my examination of the amendment before the House, I am disposed to considering an element in this section on Report Stage. I ask the Senator not to press his amendment because, as it is worded, it does not add to the legislation. All the powers to which it refers are already included in different parts of the Bill.</P>
      <P>I believe something further might be done regarding section 37E(4) in light of the specific reference to the planning authority report in section 37G(2)(<i>a</i>). This is highly technical but I might consider making a further provision in this regard. When one is talking about section 37G(2)(<i>a</i>) in conjunction with 37E(4), one could be forgiven for not having the exact meaning at one&rsquo;s fingertips. I would be prepared to write a note to the Senator indicating my import so he could consider the matter in advance of Report Stage. It would be helpful if I did so and I am always helpful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister said the &ldquo;manager&rdquo; must present the report. My amendment is all about the involvement of elected representatives who, after all, represent the voice of the people. The Minister stated he might examine section 37E. However, my amendment, if taken on board, would deal with this specifically. It is important that my proposal be included in the Bill.</P>
      <P>The Minister is iffy about his intentions and implied that he may take my proposal on board on Report Stage. I ask him to take it on board now because my position is well thought out. I am a former secretary of the Local Authority Members Association and have consulted members of local authorities throughout the country. They feel their powers need to be strengthened in the Bill. They represent the voice of the people and are elected by the people for the people. Accepting my amendment would only strengthen democracy in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>Any measure that would strengthen democracy would be welcome to me but I do not want to go further on this matter <Col N="835"/>than I have gone. The Bill is unique and has been recognised as such by the various local authority representatives and council groups. The Association of County and City Councils, LAMA and the AMAI have all welcomed it to some degree.</P>
      <P>There is no great point in pushing the matter much further. The Senator suggested it would go forward from the county manager. With respect, it is appropriate that it should because the county manager can arrange to have the report typed <Col N="836"/>and sent up rather than putting that onus back on the councillors. It is proper that it should be that way.</P>
      <P>The Senator has triggered some thoughts in my mind regarding section 37E(4). I will consider the subsection between now and Report Stage to see whether anything can be done. I do not believe that the amendment as worded would improve matters significantly and I would ask him to consider not pressing it.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 53:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 14, line 23, to delete &ldquo;situate&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;situated&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">This is a technical amendment. I want to see consistency throughout the Bill and &ldquo;situated&rdquo; is the word that I am used to, so I am asking the Minister to consider deleting &ldquo;situate&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;situated&rdquo;, which would give a little more consistency to the Bill. It is a kind of semi-technical amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>They say that hope springs eternal and that water will finally wear through even the hardest rock. While Senators were voting, I was discussing the words &ldquo;situate&rdquo; and &ldquo;situated&rdquo;, and I discovered they are used interchangeably in other legislation. So I am prepared to accept the Senator&rsquo;s amendment, because he has been so good in pressing so many textual amendments, and it would not do any injury to the Bill to use <Col N="836"/>it. As a tribute to the Senator&rsquo;s perseverance and to the fact that he stayed up all night looking at various thesauruses to find different words, I am prepared to accept the amendment and am pleased to do so.</P>

      <P LI="1">In page 15, line 7, before &ldquo;in&rdquo; where it firstly occurs, to insert &ldquo;to be specified by the Board,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">We must specify the conditions in this section. The amendment would add to the Bill; it would be a stronger reference and give a clearer interpretation. I support the inclusion of this recommendation.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="837"/>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senator for proposing the amendment, which refers to an important new power that has been given to the board to attach a condition to a permission providing for community gain. This condition may take the form of provision of financing in whole or in part of a facility or service for the community hosting the proposed development. I recall Senator Bannon on another occasion making a comment, with which I agreed, that communities hosting developments should be able to see some community gain at the end of the day. That is specifically provided for in the Bill.</P>
      <P>I am hopeful the board will use this flexible new power to ensure local communities gain substantially from accepting nationally or regionally important infrastructure. This is important because if communities are to host a development which benefits the community, it is fair and reasonable that the benefit to the community should be mentioned.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The Senator&rsquo;s amendment proposes the insertion of text to provide that the board must specify what that facility or service will be. It was always my intention that would happen. The Senator would like it to be expressly stated. In that respect, he made a good point because that will enable the people in the community to identify the work achieved as a result of their efforts. I am disposed to accepting this amendment. We might have to consider the wording of it. I believe the words proposed are fine. I cannot envisage there being an argument about them. I will accept this amendment because it is a good one.</P>
      <P>I am also pleased the Senator accepts the general new principle we are bringing into the planning legislation. He simply wants the local community gain to be more openly and expressly stated. That is a good point. I accept the amendment and am pleased to do so.</P>

      <P LI="1">In page 15, to delete lines 11 to 17.</P>
      <P FLI="0">A financial consideration is involved in this amendment. The Minister might consider deleting the lines 11 to 17 in the subsection, which provide &ldquo;A condition attached pursuant to subsection (7)(<i>d</i>) shall not require such an amount of financial resources to be committed for the purposes of the condition being complied with as would substantially deprive the person in whose favour the permission operates of the benefits likely to accrue from the grant of the permission.&rdquo; It involves a financial consideration.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="838"/>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">It does. I understand the sentiment behind the Senator&rsquo;s proposition to delete the proportionality clause. I gave the amendment substantial consideration but I cannot accept it. I will explain my reason because the Senator deserves an explanation.</P>
      <P>A case arose a number of years ago where a council sought contributions which were disproportionate and the case was referred to An Bord Plean&aacute;la. The council ended up with egg all over its face and nothing to show for it.</P>
      <P>It is important we maintain the issue of fairness in the Bill. The reference to community gain in the subsection provides for the community gain being proportionate. If we were not to insert that provision, we would find ourselves in difficulty. I had a discussion on this matter with the Parliamentary Counsel because of my experience in planning. The clause is inserted on foot of discussions with the Parliamentary Counsel to ensure the provision of any condition imposed would not be challenged as unfair. It is important that the issue of fair play is reflected in the Bill.</P>
      <P>As with the previous amendment, I gave some thought to this amendment, but the overwhelming argument is to insert the reference to proportionality. Furthermore, it is perfectly reasonable to ensure a condition to provide community gain is not used as a way of refusing permission by the backdoor, which is another issue.</P>
      <P>While I appreciate the sentiment the Senator wishes to incorporate in this subsection, the inclusion of the proportionality clause is prudent. It would leave the Bill open to challenge as being unfair if we were not to insert it. Overall, the arguments are strongly in favour of leaving in the clause. I ask the Senator not to press his amendment, which I gave a fair amount of consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 58 and 59 not moved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 60.</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 17, line 35, to delete &ldquo;18&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;12&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">The amendment seeks a reduction in the period allowed for a decision to be made. The period allowed of 18 weeks is four and a half months, which is a long time when one is waiting for a decision. Perhaps the Minister could reduce the period allowed to 12 weeks, which is a sufficient period for a decision to be made. It makes sense to reduce the period provided because we are seeking to fast-track the process and move forward quickly. While I sought to clawback in respect of other areas, we should fast-track the process in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I note the point the Senator is making but 18 weeks is probably the shortest feasible time for the board to get all its ducks in a row, <Col N="839"/>all its decisions and the reports concerned. If a decision could be made in a shorter period, I would favour that. We have had some extraordinary cases of delays to work on infrastructure, which have frustrated the general public and caused public harm, and all such delays have done is to escalate prices. In practical terms, 18 weeks is a feasible time within which the board can work. We would all like the decision process to be timely and as efficient as possible &mdash; we all accept that principle. It would not be right to set an unrealistic target. The board has worked hard to meet the targets it has been set, although it is not always possible for it to do so.</P>
      <P>An Bord Plean&aacute;la&rsquo;s performance has improved dramatically in recent times. In 2005 the intake of appeals on infrastructure cases was up 13%. That marked the third successive year of a significant increase, yet the percentage of cases being decided within the 18 weeks statutory period now stands at 78%, which is good, with the average time to dispose of cases being only 15 weeks.</P>
      <P>It would be unfair to the board to reduce the period by one third from 18 weeks to 12 weeks. If we could get major strategic infrastructure decisions through in 18 weeks, we would be doing very well, given the fact that some strategic infrastructure has been delayed for year upon year.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>I commend the objective of being as efficient, timely and effective as possible, but what is feasible in this context is 18 weeks. Referring to one of the Senator&rsquo;s earlier amendments, there is a need for consultation and for the various bodies to produce reports. I do not believe that could be done within the 12-week period proposed. I commend the Senator&rsquo;s ambition in this instance. The upper time limit is 18 weeks and hopefully decisions will come through within that period. It would not be fair to set a target which in my heart of hearts I know would pose difficulties for the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I detect from the Minister&rsquo;s contribution that there will be a staff shortage in An Bord Plean&aacute;la. I have grave concerns about the burdens this legislation will place on the board. The Minister is providing an extra grant of approximately &euro;251,000 to the board, despite the fact that last October the board stated it was finding it difficult to maintain the current position in terms of the time it takes to determine cases that have already been dealt with. When Mr. O&rsquo;Connor from the board spoke to the Oireachtas joint committee he informed us that there were insufficient staff in the board. The Minister spoke of lifting the embargo and providing for the allocation of an additional ten members of staff. In view of this, I can understand the reason for the Minister&rsquo;s proposal to extend the period in which a decision on a planning application is made to 18 weeks, rather than 12 weeks. If An Bord Plean&aacute;la was sufficiently staffed, however, it could ensure that decisions <Col N="840"/>could be made within 12 weeks, beginning on the last day for making submissions or observations in accordance with the notice referred to in section 3. The Minister has proposed to make some minor adjustments to this section. I hope they will be major adjustments which will take my previous amendment on board. The planning reform that is needed cannot be achieved if adequate resources are not put in place. The Minister will have to give due consideration to this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I will commend Senator Bannon&rsquo;s humanity to his colleague in the other House, Deputy Bruton, who continuously excoriates the Government for what he sees as its profligacy in its spending of public funding, for example by recruiting excessive numbers of public servants. The issue of personnel, which has been raised by the Senator, is not immediately germane to the section of the Bill under consideration. I have received the approval of the Department of Finance to increase the number of staff at An Bord Plean&aacute;la by 14, in the context of the board&rsquo;s additional workload and reorganisational requirements, and by a further ten, in the context of the Bill before the House.</P>
      <P>However, it is not easy to find high-quality planning staff because they are not that abundant. There is a resource constraint. I am content that an 18-week timeframe for the making of decisions is appropriate, reasonable and fair. If An Bord Plean&aacute;la is able to make decisions in less than 18 weeks, that is fair and well, but I do not think it would be a good idea to set a lower threshold. I assure the Senator that the decision to provide for an 18-week timeframe, as opposed to a 12-week timeframe, was not taken on the basis of staffing considerations. One would probably be able to justify the recruitment of additional staff on the basis of a cost-benefit analysis if one were to reduce the timeframe in the manner that has been proposed. I do not think such a reduction would be feasible, however. If we want to ensure that the planning authority is able to do its job well, we should give it a reasonable period of time in which to do it. The proposed 18-week timeframe is challenging and ambitious, but a 12-week timeframe would be impossible. I ask the Senator not to pursue the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the decision to agree to the appointment of four staff in addition to the staff which were announced when Mr. O&rsquo;Connor addressed the joint committee. The Minister said that sufficient numbers of staff are available, but Mr. O&rsquo;Connor told the committee that approximately half of the staff who are employed by An Bord Plean&aacute;la on a consultancy basis come from outside the State. Have the staff in question been trained in the State? There are different laws and different forms of legislation in different jurisdictions. I would be concerned if I were to learn that the people in question had not been trained <Col N="841"/>in the State. It is important that they be given the training and supervision they need in the State, so they can understand the reports and legislation which have been prepared here. They should know how to work within the laws of the State.</P>
      <P>We sometimes hear that local authorities have recruited staff from outside the State who have different opinions and views. That can cause hardship for the citizens of our State. The local authorities, which have recruited people from overseas with the best of intentions, have encountered a great deal of bother as a result. Some cases have gone to court, only to be dismissed. The Minister probably knows of such instances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator has made a fair point, although it is not directly related to the Bill. As planning is a culturally specific activity, An Bord Plean&aacute;la and the local authorities have to take care when recruiting staff. Some of the planning staff from outside the State are excellent and very welcome. If they were not available, we would find it difficult to fill vacancies from within the skill pool available to us.</P>
      <P>The general point being made by Senator Bannon, which is not relevant to the Bill, is a good one. It is obvious that the planning system is culturally quite specific. I have said on several occasions, for example when speaking in the third level colleges in which students are prepared for the planning process, that it is important that traditional settlement patterns are observed and that the planning system is sensitive to the cultural traditions and settlement patterns which have been observed in this country. I have often made that point to challenge the argument that there are too many one-off houses in the rural countryside. In fact, there are far fewer one-off houses than there were in years gone by. This country has a specific pattern of settlement. We need to get the balance right.</P>
      <P>We are straying slightly from the amendment, which proposes to reduce to 12 weeks the period of time in which decisions on planning applications have to be made. I hope, for the reasons I outlined earlier, that the Senator will not pursue the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I will explain why I raised the issue of the recruitment of planners from outside the State. I accept that such people may undertake a period of training. While I welcome them on board, it is important that they should read the development plans prepared by the institutions of the State and that they ensure they are <i>au fait</i> with the plans for our counties. I refer to local planning policies, for example. We should not take our eye off the ball when people from other countries come here to work as planners. While they are welcome, it is important that they should be familiar with the plans and legislation, etc., which have been drawn up in this State.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="842"/>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a fair point. The influx of skilled people into this country is welcome because it is a positive thing. If one considers the decisions which have been made at EU level in recent days &mdash; I accept that this is outside the immediate context &mdash; it is likely that countries which have been less progressive will have every reason to regret their decisions. It is not a good idea to close doors. I accept the Senator&rsquo;s point about skills and the need to be sensitive. That point does not just apply to planners who were trained outside the country. Those who were trained inside this country&rsquo;s planning system could be a little more sensitive on certain occasions. On the amendment, I intend to put in place an 18-week timeframe, rather than a 12-week timeframe.</P>

      <P FLI="0">This is a minor technical amendment. If one reads the relevant section of the Bill, it is clear it is necessary to bring a stronger, clearer and more precise interpretation to the Bill. I ask the Minister to consider it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>The amendment puts me in a rather peculiar position as a Minister. The Opposition is proposing that the Minister should be given more power, in effect, but I am not prepared to agree to that. The Senator is proposing to empower the Minister to give a direction to the board to prioritise a particular application. The general point I have been making is that we have put in place a planning system that keeps Ministers out of the decision-making process, as far as is practical. That is a good thing, generally speaking, although it is clear there have to be exceptions from time to time.</P>
      <P>The text of this section as it stands allows the Minister to give directions to the board to prioritise a certain class, or classes, of infrastructure that is of particular importance to the State. We can all think of circumstances in which such a power would be useful. If a certain class of infrastructure is needed at a particular time, it is right that the Minister should be able to prioritise it. It would be inappropriate, however, for the Minister to have a specific power to fast-track a particular application. Such a provision would be fraught with difficulties and would give rise to public suspicion and concern about the autonomy and independence of the planning process.</P>
      <P>The Bill is good, in general, in that it allows the Minister to determine at a certain time that a particular class of infrastructure should be prioritised if it is of pressing need. I am thinking of <Col N="843"/>sewerage works, for example. It would be going too far to allow Senator Bannon&rsquo;s amendment to become law. I suggest the Senator withdraws the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a textual amendment, as suggested by the Parliamentary Counsel. It is simply to delete an unnecessary cross-reference as a proposed development. It is already defined in subsection (1) and does not impact on the substance of the Bill. It is very much like the editing job Senator Bannon wanted to do in so many other areas. I am hopeful this will have the approval of the House.</P>

	<P>The amendment to section 182A(4)(<i>b</i>) provides that an application for the consent and the accompanying environmental impact statement, EIS, for an electricity transmission line will have to be sent to the local authority in an area as well as to prescribed bodies. This refers back to something Senator Bannon was highlighting earlier, namely, the importance of having a cross-reference to ensure that local authorities receive the necessary documentation. It is normal practice that local authorities are sent copies of applications of this type for observation and this will follow in the other consent processes provided for in the Bill. The requirement will help to standardise practice as regards the notification procedures with regard to strategic infra<Col N="844"/>structure applications. It is appropriate that we have a standard process.</P>
      <P>Government amendment No. 111 in section 24 makes the same change in respect of an EIS sought by the board before it considers amending a consent for a strategic infrastructure. What I am proposing in both of these amendments is to ensure that a single system applies in all cases, which is consistent, and in particular that local authorities have sight of significant reports, as Senators Bannon and McCarthy have suggested is necessary. I hope the House will support both amendments.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The amendment to section 182A(5)(<i>a</i>), relating to electricity transmission lines, will allow the board to ask for further information as regards the consequences of proper planning and substantial sustainable development of the area concerned. The current wording allows the board to seek further information only as regards the effects of the proposed development on the environment. This appears to have been an oversight in section 175 of the 2000 Act on which the draft of this section is based. In fact the related amendment, No. 112, proposes to make the same change in section 175.</P>
      <P>It makes sense that the board should be able to seek further information on any aspect of the application of proposed development and this will contribute to a more robust decision making process. The amendment is also necessary to bring the section into line with the other consent procedures being provided for in the Bill, and with the language in the same section.</P>
      <P>Given that I was once threatened by the CEO, then the chief operating officer of the ESB, to be sued and put out of my home for having the temerity as a mere councillor to oppose one of its planning processes, I believe it is a healthy development to have this type of information. I <Col N="845"/>am pleased, therefore, to have tabled the amendment to correct what I believe is an oversight. Again, I ask the House to support both amendments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not believe so. It is appropriate that information such as this should be available to those who want to have a debate or a discussion on it. The Senator is right in suggesting that the energy supply situation is very important. That is why transmission lines are being brought into the Bill and why I am very pleased that the House is so positive about that development. At the same time, however, it is important that there should be consistency across all infrastructure, this included, important as it is. I have had experience of an over-powerful State agency and I want to ensure there is more balance in the planning process. These requirements apply elsewhere. It is fair, reasonable and just that they also apply to the ESB or to any entity involved in the electricity supply or transmission business.</P>

    <P LI="1" el="5">In page 24, to delete lines 20 to 29 and substitute the following:</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>This is an important set of amendments. It is the first time that pipelines will be brought within the planning system. That is an appropriate move. Amendment No. 86 is a major amendment to the Bill which I flagged during my Second Stage speech. It inserts three new sections into the 2000 Act, sections 182C, 182D and 182E. This provides for a new consent procedure for major gas pipelines and related infrastructure and for a pre-application consultation procedure for both electricity transmission lines and for gas pipelines.</P>
      <P>It is, therefore, an important amendment and a significant move forward in terms of having a consistent approach in planning across the entire range of infrastructure. The new consent procedure is based on one already included for electricity transmission lines in sections 182A and 182B derived from that for local authorities&rsquo; own developments requiring EIAs. It is modified to take account of the differences occasioned by the Gas Acts. In particular, it should be noted that the upstream and downstream gas pipelines currently have different consent authorities, namely, the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources for upstream and the Commissioner for Energy Regulation, CER, for downstream. The new consent procedure has to take account of this difference by ensuring that the CER, in particular, is notified in appropriate cases.</P>
      <P>As Senators will be aware, up to now gas pipelines and associated developments have not in any way been subject to the scrutiny of the planning system. They were instead examined by either the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources in the case of upstream pipelines or the CER in the case of downstream pipelines. The Minister or the CER were responsible for examining the EIS submitted with the development and ensuring the development did not unduly affect the environment, so a contract with the ordinary planning system was a requirement to consult the local authority.</P>
      <P>However, the Government felt it was appropriate for the board to be assigned the responsibility of examining land-based gas pipelines from an environmental and planning point of view. That ensures that the existing authorities can con<Col N="847"/>centrate on economic and regulatory issues. These pipelines relate to critical natural resources which must be carefully managed to ensure our future security of energy supply.</P>
      <P>Turning to the new procedure, like the electricity line procedure, section 182C provides that a person intending to carry out a strategic gas infrastructure development, which is defined in amendment No. 97, will have to give public notice of the application as well as notifying the local authority and the prescribed bodies. The application will have to include an EIS. The board is entitled to ask for additional information or for a proposed development to be altered with public notification if the information or change is significant.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Amendment No. 85 will delete a subparagraph in the section relating to the application procedure for electricity transmission lines. The deletion is consequential on the amendment of the pre-application procedures for electricity transmission being proposed in amendment No. 86. The new section being proposed, namely, section 182E, will specifically provide for the statutory undertaker to seek and receive such an opinion from the board making the words being deleted unnecessary.</P>
      <P Just="Left">With regard to flagging Report Stage amendments, it should be noted that my Department continues to consult with colleagues in the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources which is considering two specific issues, namely, any necessary consequential amendments to the Gas Acts and whether section 182A is sufficiently broad to capture all types of major electricity lines, particularly the east-west connector. I may bring forward minor amendments in regard to these issues on Report Stage. As I already mentioned, I am most anxious that a consistent approach be adopted across the system.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 88 to the Seventh Schedule will delete the reference to natural gas pipelines and associated buildings from the Seventh Schedule being inserted into the principal Act. Essentially, this will mean that all development comprising, for the purposes of, or associated with, strategic gas pipelines will go through the new consent procedure being proposed under sections 182C and 182D. This has the merit of providing consistency across the various infrastructure types, which is necessary to ensure that there is total clarity between the consent procedure being applied to gas pipelines and associated developments. It will also ensure that strategic gas infrastructure developments are dealt with in an holistic way as one complete project, as opposed to a number of smaller projects. The amendment will also add clarity to, and improve the efficiency of, the planning process in regard to strategic gas infrastructure.</P><Col N="848"/>
      <P>Given that I propose the deletion of the section referred to in the Senator&rsquo;s amendment, I do not propose to accept amendment No. 89.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome this amendment which brings greater clarity to the Bill. The deletion of lines 20 to 29 and the substitution of this by three lines has tidied up this section of the legislation. There is much to be welcomed in the Bill and the list of projects to be fast-tracked is most impressive. Projects relating to transport infrastructure and the road network must be advanced. The Minister referred to electricity pylons, gas pipelines, etc. This important infrastructure is vital to towns across the midlands, especially in my local town of Longford. We were hard done by in the past when a plan was in place to bring the gas pipeline via Longford but some ministerial interference brought it in a different direction, via Clara in County Offaly. While I will not name the Minister I have done so in the past at public meetings in my own county.</P>
      <P>The Bill allows for the streamlining of the planning process for key infrastructural projects such as those for the harnessing of wind power for energy production in wind farms. Farmers have been encouraged to diversify into this area. Provision has been made in the Bill to fast-track the installation of proposed development of more than 50 turbines, or spinners as we call them locally. I have tabled an amendment to reduce this figure because not everyone may be able to afford to develop a wind farm of the dimensions outlined.</P>

	<P>I am not enthusiastic about the Government amendments to the Bill which have caused some confusion. A significant number of Government amendments have been tabled since Second Stage was discussed here six weeks ago. It is important that the legislation assures our continued economic success and the development of the country in a sustainable manner. It is also important that the Bill will ensure we get the required infrastructure for the modern society in which we live. The infrastructure in some parts of the country is equivalent to that which we had in the 19th century in terms of the quality of roads, etc. It is important that the infrastructure in all areas in the country outside Dublin is brought up to an acceptable standard because far too many areas are lagging behind, especially in the BMW region from where I come.</P>
      <P>The BMW plan provided for the spending of a significant amount of money in this area in the period of the plan but there has been a great underspend and infrastructural development lags behind the rest of the country. The Minister will have a pivotal role in ensuring it is brought up to a reasonable standard. I would like to see us being able to spend 95% of our funding in the <Col N="849"/>period for which it was allocated, not the 46% that is the current rate. This is crucially important for the development of the area.</P>

I very much welcome the amendments, which clarify a number of high profile issues that have been raised recently. I am also pleased safeguards are built into the section regarding consultation, advertising and the various conditions put on the applicants. The Opposition has been calling for a long time for improvements in competitiveness and the modernisation of our infrastructure and this is provided for in the legislation. Major infrastructural projects must be dealt with to modernise and keep up with other economies. A process must be in place whereby a fair, open and accountable hearing of what is proposed is held and conditions are imposed that protect the public. I welcome the section because it provides a great deal of clarity. For example, the Corrib gas pipeline is an issue but the use of natural gas as a resource will increase, given the increasing price of oil. We must prepare and look forward and the amendment is in keeping with that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>This amends the reference in the Seventh Schedule to electricity transmission lines to exclude any development to be considered under the section 182A consent process. This is necessary to ensure it is clear which consent procedure will apply to specific types of development and will prevent a perception of the use of two different consent processes for such lines. I would like consistency and clarity between all systems and it is a welcome amendment. I would be grateful if the House would support it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>The Seventh Schedule contains a list of projects related to petroleum, natural gas pipelines or crude oil refinery. However, the media reported earlier on the possibility of nuclear energy being brought to the State via a pipeline from the continent. Will the Minister give an assurance that such power is excluded under the Seventh Schedule? I hope there is no way this can be done through a back door and I am concerned about this. A Fianna F&aacute;il Member informed me about this news report. Will the Minister update the House on the development of a nuclear energy pipeline?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I am sure everything the Senator heard from the Fianna F&aacute;il Member must be correct. However, few Members in either House have an aversion to nuclear power that exceeds my own. I was a little late when we resumed the debate because I met the man who chaired the Chernobyl forum. I am more convinced, as each day passes, of the utter economic lunacy of nuclear power. All parties and groupings did some service to the nation when we made it illegal to generate electricity using nuclear power in 1999. I have tried, and will continue to try, to expose the fallacy of the nuclear debate. My revulsion at the notion of a nuclear power station in this State is at least as strong as the Senator&rsquo;s.</P>

      <P FLI="0">This amendment relates to wind farms. The legislation provides for the streamlining of the planning process for key infrastructural projects such as wind farms and installations for the harnessing of wind power for energy production with more than 50 turbines or a total output greater than 100 MW. The threshold should be reduced. People do not like wind farms in certain areas but it is an important and clean energy resource. People flock to tourist resorts in Gran Canaria and elsewhere where wind farms are clearly visible. They are, therefore, not obtrusive. Everyone is encouraging farmers to diversify</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>We should move in this direction and a provision should be made in this regard. I ask the Minister to reduce the number of turbines from 50 to ten. If the Minister does not accept the amendment, I expect he will introduce legislation within the next two years to provide for smaller installations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senator. The amendments propose a reduction in the thresholds for a number of categories mentioned in the Seventh Schedule, which largely reflect the EIA thresholds. They were, therefore, not selected on a whim. The thresholds were also carefully chosen to reflect what is considered to represent strategic infrastructural development and to ensure the board does not become overwhelmed with cases, which could happen if the thresholds were set too low. It is important that the new system should bed down with an appropriate threshold. For example, the Senator&rsquo;s proposed change to the threshold for harbour developments in amendment No. 95 could mean that private marina developers could apply to have their applications fast-tracked. That would not be a good idea. They could not be considered to be of more than local importance. They do not contribute towards the national infrastructure and the Bill only deals with such infrastructure.</P>
      <P>It is important to allow a period of implementation for the wide range of categories and associated thresholds in the Seventh Schedule. We can then reflect on that experience and review the thresholds if necessary. However, I am not currently disposed to accepting these amendments as it is important that this review of the strategic planning process be allowed to bed down. In the case of harbours and so on, there could be unforeseen and negative consequences. The <Col N="859"/>thresholds are roughly equivalent to the current EIA thresholds and that is a good cut-off point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad the Minister has adopted a Fine Gael policy, which is to fast-track the development of wind farms. We would like to see the figure of 50 reduced to a compromise of 30 and allow for&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>There could be a bidding process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash; the fast-tracking of wind farm construction to help Ireland increase its electricity generation. The wind farm is often referred to as the oil well in the sky. It is clean, generally acceptable to the public and we should make more use of it. It is vital that we increase our output of electricity from renewable resources. Wind power is part of that and Fine Gael is committed to promoting its use.</P>
      <P>We first flagged the issue a number or years ago, but it did not catch on until recently. It is important that electricity is generated in Ireland from renewable resources in the next 20 years. Diesel and petrol prices have risen by 20 or 30 cent per litre in the past two weeks so we should tap into new sources of energy.</P>
      <P>The Minister will have to come back to this issue. The figure cited is very high and only big business will get involved in it. We would get more communities involved if the figure was reduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator seems to have made a career of tilting at windmills. There are a couple of other allusions to Don Quixote which I will leave to one side. He is right when he states that we need to look at generating electricity by wind farms. I am currently completing the planning guidelines for wind farms and I hope to publish these in the next few weeks. However, this Bill only deals with nationally or regionally important issues that need to be fast-tracked. I do not think it a good idea to fast-track every local issue. I intend to introduce guidelines to deal with wind-turbine generators that hopefully will produce more certainty. I have been a fan of windmills for a long time.</P>

      <P LI="1">In page 40, line 10, after &ldquo;Board&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;, provided that a public representative who makes submissions or requests an oral hearing on a planning application or appeal shall not be liable for any fee&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">It is reasonable to exempt public representatives from paying fees for making observations. I do not need to preach to the Minister about people who make representations to politicians. If a fee had to be paid every time we wrote to an organ of the State on behalf of a constituent, we would need the support of the Central Bank.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>While Senator McCarthy is correct, a cogent reason exists for not accepting the amendment, tempted as I am to do so. At present, An Bord Plean&aacute;la only requires the payment of a fee where a public representative acts to make a submission or appeal in his or her own right. If the representative is simply supporting someone else&rsquo;s case, a fee is not required under the current system.</P>
      <P>This amendment would result in the majority of objections being made through public representatives. I am aware Senator McCarthy does not intend that consequence from his amendment. A number of years ago, I wrote a scathing article about the British ombudsman system, which effectively requires people to make submissions through public representatives. While that is not the intention of the Senator&rsquo;s amendment, it would be the effect. The Senator&rsquo;s intention is simply to ensure that public representatives do not go broke by doing their jobs but the amendment plays into a gombeen mentality which we should have left behind.</P><Col N="865"/>
      <P>By requiring a fee only in circumstances where representatives are acting in their own right, An Bord Plean&aacute;la is more progressive than some local authorities which have used this device to prevent local councillors from making reasonable submissions and comments. Many of my fellow elected representatives would prefer not to pay the fee under any circumstances but the current system of public engagement would be distorted if it was excluded in its totality. I have given some consideration to this amendment but am not disposed to accept it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Mr. McCarthy</NameTxt>

	<P>These amendments make a number of small changes to section 21 of the Bill, which amends section 135 of the principal Act. The main amendment is amendment No. 108, the purpose of which is to enable a person holding an oral hearing to require any officer of the local authority, as opposed to a planning authority, to give information to the hearing. This is necessary to ensure that the person conducting an oral hearing has the necessary powers to carry out the tasks required in all types of oral hearings that the board may hold. Senators will be aware that not all local authorities are planning authorities and, in addition, the board is now holding hearings in broad areas and will need the attendance of officials capable of dealing with a range of local authority functions.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendment No. 116 is also related. These amendments are linked to the strategic gas infrastructure consents, which we have already discussed. The amendments will transfer the power to decide on CPOs for major gas pipelines from the current consent body to the board. This is in line with similar changes to the 2000 Act on local authority CPOs in motorways. The Government&rsquo;s view is that the board is best <Col N="868"/>placed to determine these matters when it is also charged with deciding whether a project is to obtain planning permission. The compulsory purchase functions are currently attached under the Gas Act to a number of people or bodies, in particular the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources for upstream and the Commission for Energy Regulation for any CPO necessary for downstream pipeline developments. These amendments provide that where the board is given the function on determining the planning consent for strategic gas infrastructure project and a related CPO is submitted, the board will take the decision on the compulsory acquisition.</P>
      <P>The text of amendment No. 113 is based on the equivalent wording of section 215 of the 2000 Act, which deals with transferring CPO powers on major roads. It inserts a new section, section 215A, in the relevant part of the 2000 Act. All the existing powers that accrue to the Minister or the CER transfer as they are, including powers on substrata land, rights of way and deviation limits. The one exception relates to the fees payable to the Minister under Article 5 of the second Schedule to the Gas Act. As the board is given the power to recover its costs, this provision is not necessary and subsection (3) of the amendment states that it will not apply.</P>
      <P>The other amendments are consequential to this amendment being included in the 2000 Act. They add section 215A to the relevant sections of part 14 of the 2000 Act, including those already being amended by the Bill and make other necessary changes to the wording.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party&rsquo;s amendment to the Government amendment No. 115 would delete the paragraph allowing for oral hearings to be discretionary in the case of CPOs and in respect of strategic infrastructure projects. Oral hearings are not mandatory in planning cases. The change will extend any rule to all matters coming before the board. I have already stated my view that the board should not be required to hold oral hearings in all CPOs. Many of the approximately 60 oral hearings held by the board annually are into CPOs objected to by one landowner or by a small number of people. They could more sensibly and cost-effectively for all be settled through written agreements. There is no legal reason why public hearings must be held on a CPO. They are time-consuming and expensive and the only gainers are lawyers and experts recruited by people to argue their cases. The board will be&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P FLI="0" el="5" Just="Left">I am pleased to be able to speak on this issue, although I do not count myself as an expert in finance or the National Pensions Reserve Fund. We must acknowledge the foresight of then Minister for Finance, Mr. Charlie McCreevy, in establishing the fund under the National Pension Reserves Act 2000, with effect from 2 April 2001. He thought about the rainy day, realised the serious challenge that faces us from a pension point of view and decided to do something different and smart. We have known for many years that the Celtic tiger would not have occurred without the successful baby boom of the 1970s, which created a large workforce, and through the management of the economy and the economic growth we have seen. We have a buoyant economy with many people at work but they will continue to work only for a period of time. At some point we will all have to look to our pensions and wonder how we will provide for ourselves when <Col N="870"/>we get older and are not working as much as we used to or when we come to an age when we are not able to work. It makes great sense to make provision for these contingencies.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The Minister for Social and Family Affairs has been before the House here several times to speak on pensions and the challenges that face the Exchequer in terms of the future cost of social welfare and public service pensions. The National Pensions Reserve Fund was established to meet the cost to the Exchequer by providing for the payment into the fund of a minimum of 1% of GNP every year from 2001 to at least 2055. The fund is controlled by the National Pensions Reserve Fund Commission, which has absolute discretion to control, manage and invest the assets. It is managed by the NTMA for the first ten years and publishes annual reports, which is a statutory requirement, and quarterly statements. On 31 March the value of the fund was &euro;16.6 billion.</P>
      <P>The Minister will forgive me if I focus on the operational side of a pension, what it means and what I think we can do, because I am not a financial expert. The Pensions Board, with this treasury fund behind it, is doing a reasonable job in getting the message across and I acknowledge the new leaflet that is being distributed. I do not know how, but recently I received a box of them in the post. It focuses the responsibility of individuals to start making pension provision. It is well laid out and makes it clear that the State social welfare pension is &euro;193.30 per week, or &euro;10,051 per annum. We must get this message to young people aged 25 to 27 years and who are starting to work. They must understand that one should begin providing for a pension at that age. If one begins when one is 25 or 26, it will not cost a significant sum and one will not be reliant only on the State pension. People believe, as I did when I was 25, that they do not need to worry about a pension because they will get one from the State. The message must be got across that the State will not be in a position to provide the levels of earnings and lifestyle that we now enjoy. No matter how strong the National Pensions Reserve Fund and the PRSI and social welfare funds are, we cannot provide for all pensions.</P>
      <P>The public do not realise that if one were to contribute &euro;100 of one&rsquo;s salary into a pension, that sum would be invested tax free and in full whereas if one was to keep it as salary, the net benefit might be as little as &euro;58 when tax and PRSI were deducted. The Government is backing savings. To consider SSIAs, which were to encourage people to begin saving, for every &euro;4 invested, the State invested a further 25%, so the total investment was worth &euro;5. We should point out the similar position with regard to pensions. It will not cost the State more as we are currently spending the money in any case, but how we present this position to the public is important. If the public realises that the net cost would be just &euro;60 when the tax and PRSI benefit is included, <Col N="871"/>whereas the total invested would be &euro;100, it will make them more inclined to provide for their own future. We need to get that message across.</P>
      <P>Higher earners are making sound financial use of pension funds. However, those on the 20% tax rate and the lower paid, who are more dependent on their pensions, do not fully understand or appreciate the benefit. The challenge for the Pensions Board and the Government is to get this message across so that they understand.</P>
      <P>There is a responsibility on Government, which it is fulfilling, but there is also a responsibility on the individual to invest in his or her own pension fund and to provide for his or her own pension while in a position to do so. The responsibility is on individuals and on the organisations they work for in terms of promoting the various schemes, whether a contributory pension or PRSAs. Employers must get the information across and must encourage employees to undertake a PRSA and begin saving in that way. We are not getting the message across.</P>
      <P>Some 76,000 employers have set up PRSA schemes but only 27,000 employees have taken them up. There is a fundamental problem with regard to the message, which is a challenge. As well as providing and managing the fund, and making sure we are getting the proper growth and treasury management, which we will leave to the experts, we must make sure that the public &mdash; me, you and everybody &mdash; provide properly for their pensions.</P>
      <P>Another challenge which makes the National Pensions Reserve Fund more important as we move forward is the arrival of the new migrant workers who have come to Ireland since May 2004, when the EU expanded. These migrants are important to our economy. They are working and are entitled to the benefits of the State. This development has created a new group for whom we need to provide. We will not achieve this if we do not invest in the fund and manage it properly, and if the fund does not experience appropriate growth. The fund has outperformed its benchmark by 10% since its inception in 2001. There is good fiscal management of the fund but it is important that we continue to manage it and show a commitment to investing in it, particularly as we realise the challenges of the future, to some of which I referred.</P>
      <P>While I understand it is not the Minister for Finance&rsquo;s brief, when the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Brennan, goes to Cabinet, an issue arises in terms of pensions and the entitlements of women. I congratulate the Minister, Deputy Cowen, with regard to the tax breaks put in place for child care workers. The acknowledgement that they can pay their own PRSI contributions reflects the fact they are doing important work and providing for their own pensions, while constantly focusing on the importance of the role of women or the full-time carer <Col N="872"/>in doing work which is not paid for by an organisation or company.</P>
      <P>Perhaps we can expand that scheme to other sectors and to other individuals such as those being paid carer&rsquo;s allowance, who would not mind paying a contribution towards their pension. We are making a start with the child care payment and the disregard to &euro;10,000 but allowing people to make a PRSI contribution is an important step and a clear reflection of the commitment of the Government, the Department of Finance and the Department of Social and Family Affairs to the recognition of the important role of women in the area of unpaid caring work in the home or in other people&rsquo;s homes. I compliment the Minister on this.</P>
      <P>The real challenge is twofold. First, we must manage the resources we need to pay out in the future to cover State pensions of public servants. Second, we must ensure that we get the message across so that people understand pensions are their responsibility. We are continually examining the area of pensions with a view to deciding whether we should make them mandatory. In terms of managing our economic competitiveness, Ireland has a low rate of corporate tax and personal tax. If we are to introduce any mandatory measure that is a tax on employment, it will work against us in the global competitive market. So long as it is a matter of choice and organisations have the choice to invest money in a tax efficient manner, that is to be welcomed. However, the moment we make pensions mandatory and insist that every employer must pay X% into a pension scheme, we will have difficulties that affect our global competitiveness on a daily basis.</P>
      <P>While I do not claim to be an expert, we are suffering from this challenge. We have a buoyant economy but much of the development is generated internally from the building industry, the turnover of land, stamp duty and other positive developments in the economy. However, the level of exports is falling daily. If we are to have sustainable development that will allow us to maintain the economy, we must be careful not to put increased tax on employment. We must ensure we continue to work in a system that provides for the future, reflects the good fiscal management of the Government in terms of managing its pension fund and also allows flexibility for organisations to introduce the type of solutions that work for them and their employees.</P>
      <P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on the motion and look forward to the contributions from all sides of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Mr. Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the motion and welcome the Minister to the House. The National Pensions Reserve Fund is not a particularly political issue. However, I remember the quotes from the year when the fund did not perform to standard. The Opposition spokesperson stated that the &ldquo;discovery that &euro;1 billion of the &euro;8 billion invested in the <Col N="873"/>National Pensions Reserve Fund over the past two years, has been wiped-out raises serious questions&rdquo; and that &ldquo;the Minister has preferred speculating on overseas stock markets to investing in our own economy&rdquo;. The spokesperson stated:</P>
      <P LI="1">It is not enough for the Minister to wash his hands and say that he has left the management of these monies to independent fund managers. The Government must take responsibility for investing taxpayers&rsquo; money in a beneficial way. Fund managers are acting within the narrow limitations that the Government has set. . .</P>
      <P FLI="0">If these are the criteria, we should be patting ourselves on the back and telling ourselves we have done a great job as a Government. However, this is not the time or place to do so because this is a national strategic fund which belongs to the whole nation. I take pride in knowing it was a Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government which put the fund in place. I take pride in the fact it was the prudent use of money from the flotation of Eircom, &euro;6.1 billion, which set up this fund that will ensure our futures.</P>
      <P>The investments have performed extraordinarily well &mdash; over 5% in the first quarter and over 19% last year. With any strategically managed fund, the mandate has been to manage it on a commercial basis. That responsibility has been given to the National Treasury Management Agency by the Government and it deserves our commendation. However, as with any fund, we should be prepared to accept the ups and downs which will come. We have done extraordinarily well this year and last year, and long may that continue. There is a policy of looking at the possibility of changing and moving the fund, as necessary.</P>
      <P>At present &euro;11 billion is in the large capitalised markets with equities at 73%. The intention is to move that strategic allocation to 63% by the end of 2009. There is &euro;540 million in the small capitalised markets &mdash; 3.5%, which will increase to 4% by 2009. There is 2% in the emerging markets, which is a prudent use of the moneys. We have 0.1% in private equity, which will increase to<?oasys _jy ?>8%. Property will increase from 0.8% to 8%. That would seem to be strategic and prudent management, particularly as equities may not continue to perform as they have done in recent years. We could not, or should not, expect them to perform as they have because nothing has exponential growth. As one commentator said recently &ldquo;no tree grows to the sky&rdquo;. We also have investment planned for commodities, forestry and for sovereign, government and corporate bonds, which is very prudent.</P>
      <P>Having said that, we should also look at the general pension situation. One of the most important policy challenges facing this country and this generation is the urgent need to reform our pension system so that it lays the foundations for future retirement, in security and with dignity, <Col N="874"/>for all the people. There are no quick fix, magic wand solutions to the fact that almost half the country&rsquo;s workforce of 2 million people do not have personal pensions. Ireland is not unique in having a looming pensions problem. Throughout the world, governments and societies are grappling with the impending crisis of a lopsided population structure in which older people far outnumber younger workers. Ireland&rsquo;s response to the challenges and opportunities posed by this rapid social, economic and demographic change will influence the future shape of our society for decades to come. In that context, I again commend the benefits our young immigrants are bringing to our economy.</P>
      <P>At present 900,000 people &mdash; almost half the country&rsquo;s entire workforce &mdash; do not have any private pensions and, as of now, are facing into a retirement in which their main source of income will be the State welfare pension. At least half of these are women. While there have been substantial improvements in welfare pensions in recent years, the reality is that many of those relying exclusively on these pensions will continue to have a high risk of poverty. The number of people aged over 65 years will more than treble from the current level of approximately 464,000 to 1.5 million by 2056. At present in excess of four workers contribute to the support of each pensioner. This will fall to 2.7 in 2026 and to fewer than 1.5 workers per pensioner in 50 years time. The cost of our social welfare and State pension system will increase in the same period from over 4.3% of GNP to 13.8%. This forecast of spiralling costs is far ahead of any estimates to date and will come as a major surprise to those who have played down the challenges faced.</P>
      <P>Just over 43% of self-employed people have a supplementary pension against 54% of employees. Indeed, when one takes out the public sector, it emerges that 43% of private sector workers have personal pensions. Only 33% of existing pensioners have income from an occupational or private pension. At present the pension system replaces 51% of pre-retirement income for couples and 43% for single pensioners. Some 40% of occupational pension schemes which reported to the Pensions Board last year failed to meet the funding standard required by legislation. These figures pose serious questions for our society.</P>
      <P>The decisions we make at this time will impact on almost everyone, whether they are pensioners or starting work. Our choices are limited and at times stark. We can reduce benefits, increase taxation, work longer or increase the advance provisions we make through the National Pensions Reserve Fund or through personal savings. The National Pensions Reserve Fund has stood us very well in terms of the perception of where we will be, as a nation, in 30 or 40 years time and what we will have achieved through it and the security of having it as the demographics change.</P><Col N="875"/>
      <P>We have opportunities ahead. The SSIAs will mature and I hope we will be able to present to the public an opportunity to use moneys normally expended on SSIAs to benefit from the changes introduced by this Government to allow those on the lower tax rate to benefit as well as those who already benefit at the higher tax rate. That will ensure we continue to thrive as we have done and look to the future comfortably and confidently.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P LI="1">To delete all words after &ldquo;Seanad &Eacute;ireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P FLI="0" el="5"><?oasys _is1p8- ?>&mdash;<?oasys _is0p2- ?><?oasys _ix ?>supports all efforts to ensure adequate provision for pension and social welfare entitlements in the future;</P>
      <P FLI="0" el="5"><?oasys _is1p8- ?>&mdash;<?oasys _is0p2- ?><?oasys _ix ?>welcomes the increase in the value of the National Pensions Reserve Fund;</P>
      <P FLI="0" el="5"><?oasys _is1p8- ?>&mdash;<?oasys _is0p2- ?><?oasys _ix ?>expresses concern that growth in the fund in the last full year was behind the average achieved by private sector fund managers in this country last year;</P>
      <P FLI="0" el="5"><?oasys _is1p8- ?>&mdash;<?oasys _is0p2- ?><?oasys _ix ?>condemns the Government on its failure to make the system of public private partnerships work, leaving the NPRF management unable to invest in vitally important infrastructure;</P>
      <P LI="1" el="5">and</P>
      <P FLI="0" el="5"><?oasys _is1p8- ?>&mdash;<?oasys _is0p2- ?><?oasys _ix ?>calls on the Government to do more to improve private pension cover, which remains low.</P>
      <P FLI="0" el="5">I welcome the Minister. We welcome the National Pensions Reserve Fund and the fact it is doing well. We recognise that in 2000 and 2003, it did not do so well and serious questions were asked of Government at the time. I accept that is the nature of this fund and that it will have highs and lows but it is still behind in terms of what private fund managers have been able to achieve in the past year. I hope it will improve because it will be required in the future.</P>
      <P>I welcome the fact the Government is addressing the future needs of pensioners. Those pensioners include retired civil servants and those on State pensions. With an increasing and an aging population and with civil servants in receipt of decent pensions, there will be a great need for funding to meet the requirements of future pensioners.</P>
      <P>I wish to raise a number of issues in regard to the fund. Why are we investing so much of this money abroad when there is such a need for investment in infrastructural projects in this country? Many people would agree some of that money should be invested here. If we are to prepare for the future and meet the needs of future pensioners, the best legacy we can have is to leave the country in a good state. While we have the resources, we should put in all the necessary <Col N="876"/>infrastructure to give the next generation the tools to enable the country meet the needs of the pensioners of the future. One of the best ways we can prepare for the future is to build up our country. It is the same as asking how best one can secure the future of a young child. One provides him or her with the best education possible and ensures the child is independent when that day comes. In the same way, we must ensure that this country will be able to provide for the future. Money from the fund should be used today.</P>
      <P>The chairman of the National Pensions Reserve Fund Commission, Mr. Carty, has expressed a wish that we would invest some of the fund in public private partnerships. Some &euro;200 million was designated for these, &euro;20 million of which was to be spent on upgrading the M50. However, this did not go ahead for various reasons and the work has again been, or is about to be, put to tender. I ask that we reconsider this matter to see how best we can deal with it. Public private partnerships comprise a very good mechanism through which the fund could be used.</P>
      <P>The fund is invested in some unethical companies, including tobacco and arms companies, with which I and many taxpayers have difficulties. There are many ethical companies that would yield very good returns. The National Pensions Reserve Fund Commission is obliged, by legislation, to get the best return it can from the fund but there should be certain restrictions on the types of companies in which the money can be invested. I ask the Minister to consider this.</P>
      <P>The other part of my amendment deals with the future provision of pensions. Since this is National Pensions Awareness Week, there is much media commentary on future pension provision and much talk from the Pensions Board encouraging people to invest in pensions. We have debated this issue in the House on many occasions. However, I have not received an adequate answer as to why people are slow to contribute to pension schemes or why the take-up of PRSAs is so bad. Owing to the disappointment of pensioners and those who are about to become pensioners over the performance of pension schemes into which they have paid, their sons and daughters have learned that paying into a pension scheme does not deliver.</P>
      <P>Our legislation is such that we have made it easy for companies to change from defined benefit schemes, which would guarantee a pension for people, to defined contribution schemes, which give no guarantee regarding what sum they will ultimately receive. People have no faith in the pensions industry and the Government is doing nothing to restore faith through ensuring people will a have a pension if they pay into a fund. Until we can tell people they will receive a certain amount by paying into a pension scheme, we will be wasting our time. People are voting with their feet and investing in property rather than pension schemes because they feel they will get a better return.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister and the opportunity to debate this issue. It is not very long since it was debated in the House. I have no problem congratulating the Government on its foresight in setting up the National Pensions Reserve Fund and congratulating those responsible for its good results. However, as we congratulate ourselves on this success, there is a real danger that we will lose sight of the wider picture. The National Pensions Reserve Fund cannot and will never provide a pension for everyone in the country who needs one.</P>
      <P>Some months ago, the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Brennan, had the courage to fly a kite in the House by suggesting the time may have come to make it compulsory for every employee to provide for his or her own pension. This kite was promptly shot down, which I was sorry to see. When I spoke on the conclusion of the Bill in question, I made an effort to determine whether we could patch up the kite so it would fly again, and today I would like to make another effort to keep it in the air.</P>
      <P>Senator Cox referred to the difficulty of making pensions compulsory and to the dangers associated with our competitiveness. I understand her point but believe people will never obtain pension cover voluntarily. Young people will not provide for their pensions until they have to do so. The only way to solve the pension problem we face is to make it compulsory for everybody at work to contribute to his or her own pension. One could say we do so at present by paying PRSI, which may be correct, but if people are to have decent pensions to provide for themselves in their retirement, they must pay out more than they do at present. If they expect that some future Government will play fairy godmother for them on this question, they are incorrect. We have more than enough experience of the voluntary approach to know it simply will not work.</P>
      <P>I know the difficulties the Minister will face and that addressing them will not be easy. If people put aside money for pensions throughout their working careers, they will make it possible to get a decent pension at a cost that is reasonable. This will not happen if they wait until they are in their 40s.</P>
      <P>A recent survey, conducted by the Pensions Board since I last spoke on this matter, indicated that two thirds of respondents said it should be compulsory to provide for one&rsquo;s pension. Nearly half said they would be willing to pay PRSI at a higher rate to achieve this. What people are saying has not been heard before. The kite of mandatory pension contributions is still in the air. <Col N="878"/>The next step is up to the Government and I hope it will listen to what the people are saying on this very important matter. While we usually dislike things that are compulsory, evidence now suggests that a majority of people want to be compelled in the case of pension provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>After the NTMA was set up, its chief executive, Mr. Michael Somers, and the Minister for Finance used to hold annual press conferences. The Minister used to sit and glory in the performance of the agency and he attracted a great deal of press publicity because there was nothing else to cover on 31 December. Every year he and the chief executive stated how wonderfully the agency had performed in reducing the national debt. It did a wonderful job because it set its own benchmark &mdash; it was unique in this regard. It always congratulated itself on reducing the national debt but never had any standard to set it against. The media, politicians and public believed it when it said it had done very well. Even when the national debt increased, it said it had surpassed its target, which was a very liberal benchmark set by itself every year.</P>
      <P>When I see press releases such as that issued some weeks ago on the performance of the National Pensions Reserve Fund and when I read the Government motion today, I believe history is repeating itself. The National Pensions Reserve Fund says it has achieved a return of 5.4% in the first quarter and that this is very good. It is not very good at all &mdash; the truth is that it is abysmal. A return of 5.4% is nice in that if one multiplies it by four, one gets a return of between 21% and 22% in the year, but if one notes where the fund is invested, examines the performance of competitors and measures it against any other standard, one will conclude that its performance is dreadful. The fund underperforms in comparison with those of private sector fund managers &mdash; the Fine Gael amendment covers this fairly well. We find that the National Pensions Reserve Fund has been inexplicably bad in the past year and a quarter. In the three months referred to, it is very difficult to understand how it only increased by 5.4%. The majority of its investments are in the stock market. Stocks in the Pacific Basin increased by 5.7%; stocks in Japan increased by 6.8%; stocks in the rest of Europe increased by 8.5%; stocks in the eurozone increased by<?oasys _jy ?>10.4%; stocks in North America increased by 4.5% &mdash; so the fund beat them by almost 1%; stocks in the UK increased by 7.6%; and stocks in Ireland increased by 10.2%. The fund is second from the bottom when measured against those geographic sections.</P>
      <P>I apologise to the House for not having had time to investigate this. I do not understand how it has done so badly. If it is invested in an average of all those markets, its performance would be at least 2% or 3% better. While it has issued a report stating it has increased by 5.4%, it is measuring itself against absolute zero; it does not have <Col N="879"/>a benchmark. When measured against a world index, it has done badly. When measured against bonds, it has probably done well. When measured against property, it has obviously done pretty disastrously. While I cannot remember, I presume that at the end of last year it congratulated itself on a magnificent performance in increasing by 19.6%.</P>
      <P>When its performance is measured against that of other fund managers, including private pension fund managers, who made 21.6%, it was beaten by 2%. I wonder what these guys are up to and how they manage to do quite so badly. A blind donkey would have made money in the equity markets in the past two years. A monkey throwing darts at the equity market would have made huge amounts of money. However, this fund seems to have done very badly. As the Minister will know, in bad years it did badly and lost money. However, the problem is with underperformance. Underperforming against fund managers is quite serious as the National Pensions Reserve Fund is managed by fund managers who compete with the fund managers I quoted. I do not understand all the patting on the back. While the headline figure of 5.4% looks pretty good, it is not very good when compared with anybody else or any other markets in the world. It is good against cash and bonds. However, it is not very good against anything else against which it should measure itself.</P>
      <P>There is a danger in politicians of all sides using this fund of &euro;16.6 billion for other purposes and the Government is to be congratulated on not having done so. It would be easy to make a political decision to invest this fund in infrastructure and it certainly would be open to immense temptation and abuse. We could build, roads, hospitals, etc., which would not give a return for pensioners. Financial discipline requires that this money remains and is retained purely for pension purposes, otherwise it will be abused willy-nilly by politicians of all parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome this motion, as it gives me an opportunity to reaffirm the Government&rsquo;s continuing support for the purpose for which the National Pensions Reserve Fund was established and to set out, without ambiguity, the Government&rsquo;s commitment to the future of the fund.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Population ageing, and the profound issues it gives rise to, is emerging in the developed world as one of the major public policy concerns of this century. Due to the twin effects of a lower birth rate and population ageing, the percentage of the population in the labour force is set to fall in developed economies with serious implications for the financial sustainability of pensions, health and long-term care systems. We, in Ireland, also face these issues although our population, which is younger than the European average, gives us some time to prepare for them. I note some com<Col N="880"/>ment in recent years that, due to increased immigration, the issues we face may have eased although such an analysis ignores that immigrants to the country now will be retiring at the same time and with the same pension entitlements as our own baby boom generation of the 1970s and 1980s.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Any complacency anybody might have harboured in this regard should have been rudely blown away by the projections contained in the national pensions review recently published by the pensions board. The board projects that annual social welfare pension costs will rise from their current level of 3% of GNP to 10.1% of GNP by mid-century with public service pension costs projected to climb from 1.3% of GNP to 3.7% over the same period. Even when the Pensions Board adjusts its projections and uses a higher immigration rate, the mid-century costs of social welfare pensions fall by only 1% to 9.1% of GNP. In other words, immigration in no way eliminates the effects of population ageing.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I recognise that projections are only as strong on the assumptions on which they are based and cannot accurately predict the future. Nobody knows for certain whether the public pension&rsquo;s bill in mid-century will be 12%, 14% or 16% of GNP. However, we it will be a great deal higher than it is now and that the only question is the severity of the issue. Sensible governments make prudent provision for the future based on the most likely scenario, which is exactly what the Government has done with the establishment of the National Pensions Reserve Fund.</P>
      <P>Before coming to the fund itself, I would like to dwell briefly on the key role of the social welfare pension in our pension system. The national pensions review, to which I have already referred, has made a large number of recommendations regarding how our pension system might be improved. Many of these recommendations are concerned with occupational and private pensions and are beyond the scope of this debate. However, in its overview it makes a point crucial to any consideration of our pension system, which is that Ireland already has a good level of pensions provision and a sound pension base.</P>
      <P>The social welfare pension is the bedrock of our pension system. For those with little or no supplementary provision, it provides the only source of regular income in their retirement. For those in a position to make their own supplementary pension arrangements, it provides a basic level of income on which they can build. It also means that not all of their retirement income is dependent on the performance of their pension investments, which is an increasingly important consideration as private and occupational pensions are increasingly provided on a defined contribution basis.</P>
      <P>The Government is acutely conscious of the key role of the social welfare pension in ensuring that people can maintain an acceptable standard of living in their retirement and as a foundation <Col N="881"/>on which occupational and private pensions can be built. Since coming into office, the Government has made significant improvements in the real level of benefits and is committed to increasing pensions to &euro;200 per week by 2007. However, there is little point in increasing pension levels if such increases are not sustainable in the long term. Securing the State pension system in an environment where the burden on the taxpayer is rising dramatically is one of the central challenges we face as a society and the Government established the National Pensions Reserve Fund in order to meet that challenge.</P>
      <P>The Government established the National Pensions Reserve Fund in 2001 to meet in part the increased costs of social welfare and public service pensions from 2025 onwards. The fund is essentially a demographic equalisation mechanism, involving the statutory investment by the Government of 1% of GNP annually &mdash; a sum equivalent to over &euro;1.4 billion this year. The fund entails setting aside some of the revenues generated now while the bulk of our population is in the labour force and contributing to economic growth, investing in those funds and drawing them down in the future when growth rates are likely to be slower and the age dependency burden very much increased.</P>
      <P>Establishment of the fund before the fiscal issues caused by population ageing begin to bite means that relatively modest contributions can have a significant effect. It is projected that the fund will be equivalent to &euro;140 billion, 40% of GNP, in 2025 &mdash; the first year of drawdown.</P>
      <P>The national pensions review projects, using conservative return assumptions, that payments from the fund could reduce the impact of pension payments on the Exchequer by 3.5% of GNP annually by mid-century, which is a quarter of the total cost. The fund smooths the Exchequer costs arising from Ireland&rsquo;s pension commitments over a lengthy period, thus contributing to the long-term sustainability of the pensions system. To the extent that the fund defrays future pension costs, the need for less palatable and indeed less equitable means of addressing the issue, such as reducing the real value of pensions, significantly increasing taxation or increasing the retirement age, can be allayed.</P>
      <P>The establishment of the National Pensions Reserve Fund has placed Ireland at the forefront of countries preparing for the issues caused by population ageing, and France and New Zealand have since established very similar funds. It is a testament to the vision of my predecessor,<?oasys _jy ?>Charlie McCreevy, that specific and innovative aspects of the National Pensions Reserve Fund Act 2000 have now come to be seen as international best practice in this area. In this regard, I refer particularly to the fact that the fund is managed by an expert commission, which is independent of Government in the exercise of its functions. Indeed, the commission is in a very similar position to the trustees of private pension <Col N="882"/>funds, and it controls and manages the fund with discretionary authority to determine and implement its investment strategy. This has given the commission the freedom to develop, outside of the political process, a long-term investment strategy primarily based on a diversified portfolio of real assets, including quoted and private equity, property and commodities, outside of the political process. Indeed, a long-term State fund with no need for liquidity or to match liabilities on a yearly basis has some clear advantages in seeking to maximise long-term investment returns. The commission is to be congratulated on recognising those opportunities and on taking steps to profit from them.</P>
      <P>The legislation also requires that the fund&rsquo;s investment strategy must be on commercial lines, subject to prudent risk management. This means that the commission cannot make investments for any purposes other than maximising the fund&rsquo;s contribution to Ireland&rsquo;s future pension costs. This represents a very clear-sighted approach and one which will bear rich dividends through a focused and disciplined investment strategy. From time to time, there are calls for the fund to be used for specific purposes, particularly in our infrastructural programme. Any decision in this regard is one for the commission, and the commission has stated that it is keen to make such investments, subject to its receiving a commercial rate of return. While I am on this subject, I also note that lack of capital is not an issue with Ireland&rsquo;s PPP programme, and the success or otherwise of the programme is not in any way dependent on investment by the fund.</P>
      <P>A third noteworthy feature of the National Pensions Reserve Fund Act is the mandatory nature of the 1% of GNP contribution. The Government made the contribution mandatory because we recognised that if we left discretion in the level of the minimum contribution, future Administrations could come under pressure not to make the contribution when faced with other competing, more short-term priorities. It was this Government&rsquo;s opinion then, and it remains our opinion now, that any short-term difficulties that the payment may cause the Exchequer are more than offset by the long-term gain. We see the 1% of GNP contribution as a prudent and sustainable annual commitment. Indeed, it is worth noting that, in aggregate, the Government has not engaged in borrowing to make contributions to the National Pensions Reserve Fund since it began setting aside money for pensions prefunding after the Eircom flotation in 1999. In the seven years of contributions, the Government has run budget surpluses in five of those years, and the total budget surplus over the period is just under &euro;4 billion. Moreover, payments into the fund do not count as Government expenditure for the purposes of calculating the general Government balance under the Maastricht rules.</P>
      <P>It is no secret that the fund was established in very difficult market circumstances, with the <Col N="883"/>bursting of the stock market bubble of the late 1990s and the subsequent bear market of 2000 to 2002. However, the commission coped with these circumstances extremely well through a phased market entry strategy which enabled it to invest at attractive valuations and to profit as the market recovery took hold from early 2003. In 2005, the fund earned a return of 19.6%, or &euro;2.4 billion. In the first quarter of this year, it has earned a further 5.4% or &euro;830 million, bringing its total value to &euro;16.6 billion. Overall, since its inception to the end of March this year, the fund has earned &euro;4.1 billion in excess of contributions from the Exchequer equivalent to a compound annual return of 6.2%. Compared with an alternative use of paying down the national debt, the State is better off by &euro;2.1 billion from the establishment of the fund.</P>
      <P>In its annual review in 2005, the commission pointed out that equity markets were volatile and returns of last year&rsquo;s magnitude should not be regarded as the norm. However, as a long-term investor, it is prepared to accept this volatility. It goes on to state that the biggest risk it could run would be to take an overly cautious investment approach and thus reduce the fund&rsquo;s potential contribution to Ireland&rsquo;s increasing pension costs. I believe that is a crucial point. I am aware, and I accept, that the appropriate investment strategy for a long-term fund with no drawdowns for 20 years can lead to short-term volatility. There were those who did not accept this point when the fund experienced negative returns in 2002 and criticised both the Government for establishing the fund and the commission for its investment strategy. I would hope that such critics would take a more long-term and rational perspective in future.</P>
      <P>The commission has also been innovative and to the forefront of best practice in other areas. Last week, it joined a group of the world&rsquo;s largest institutional investment funds in signing the principles for responsible investment at their launch at the New York Stock Exchange by the UN Secretary General, Kofi Annan. The principles are based on the premise that environmental, social and governance factors can materially affect investment performance, but that large institutional investors have lacked a framework for the systematic integration of those environmental, social and governance issues into investment decision-making and ownership practices. The commission has said the launch of these principles is the beginning of a process which will see the fund taking account of environmental, social and governance factors in its investment strategies and becoming a more engaged shareholder in the companies in which it invests. As Minister for Finance, I fully endorse the principles and believe they represent a significant step towards bringing consideration of those issues into the investment mainstream. Their application should lead not only to better long-term financial returns <Col N="884"/>but to a closer alignment between the objectives of institutional investors and those of society at large.</P>
      <P>On Senator Ross&rsquo;s point about investment returns, I can only say that we did not set up the pensions reserve fund as some sort of investment competition to measure investment returns. Realistically, one must look at the performance over the medium to long term. It will always be possible to find some three-month period when some other fund performed better. I am happy that we will be able to look back, when the pensions crunch inevitably comes, and be satisfied that the modest contributions we are currently making to the pensions reserve fund will have been well worthwhile.</P>
      <P>Senator Terry asked why we have not sought to invest to assist the Irish economy. The recent ESRI reports, and others, show that we have sufficient funds for investment, and capital investment particularly. We have to avoid issues that arose in the past, when we saw value-for-money issues come into play over the rising costs, particularly in the construction industry, where we saw what happened with inflation. We can spend more money, but we may not get the outputs that we need. With Transport 21 and the investment strategy we are proposing there, some economists would claim &mdash; Members can seek them out for different opinions &mdash; that we are trying to do too much too fast. Try to tell that to someone stuck in traffic gridlock. John Kenneth Galbraith unfortunately departed this world last week, but I read an acerbic comment he made once about economic forecasting. He said that the reason we had economic forecasting was to make astrology look good. Although that might have been an over-emphasis on his part, his stature allows us at least to repeat the comment, if not to stack it up.</P>
      <P>Finally, the independence of the fund must be respected. We do not want to politicise the fund; we want to ensure that it has a commercial mandate. The development we saw in the New York Stock Exchange last week helps to assuage some adverse comment that I know has been raised in the finance committee, when people from the fund were before it, including the chairman and the chief executive.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>It would be remiss of me not to pay tribute to the fund&rsquo;s first chairman, Mr. Donal Geaney, who unfortunately passed away last October. Working with his fellow commissioners and the NTMA, Donal did a superb job in developing what was effectively a &euro;6.5 billion cash holding on its establishment five years ago and what has become the diversified internationally regarded fund we have today. I know from the commission and the NTMA how Donal continued to give of his time to the fund even as he fought his last illness. I know that also from personal knowledge. We are fortunate that people such as Donal are willing to give of their talents to the public service.</P><Col N="885"/>
      <P>The establishment of the National Pensions Reserve Fund will not, on its own, solve the pensions issue or all of the problems posed by population ageing, as Senator Quinn pointed out. However, it considerably assists in putting our public pension system on a sustainable basis. It is a real and lasting achievement by this generation and represents an equitable sharing of the burden of future pension provision and the fruits of our current economic prosperity.</P>
      <P>In that sense, it is an extraordinary responsible initiative and, politically, it demonstrates considerable foresight and maturity in our society and politics such that we were able to bring forward this proposal, enact it, and see it professionally managed to the extent that we have seen thus far, despite the volatility in the various markets. It was an important strategic decision, as Senator Hanafin said, and one that, if it is to have a strategic impact, must be allowed to continue with the integrity of the framework to protect and enhance it.</P>

	<P>Will the Minister comment on the use of the fund for investment purposes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. P. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister for Finance to the House. He is a great person for coming into this House, often at short notice, to deal with various issues.</P>
      <P>I wish to respond to a number of points he made. The independence of the fund must be respected by everybody. That is only right. The Minister said that the establishment of the National Pensions Reserve Fund will not, on its own, solve the pensions issue. Everybody will agree with that point. That is the reason I agree with the amendment to the motion put forward by my colleague, Senator Terry, outlining that the Government can and should do more to provide pension cover for everybody concerned.</P>
      <P>I compliment the former Minister for Finance, Charlie McCreevy, who is now a Commissioner, on setting up this fund. He was far-sighted in doing so. As pointed out by the Minister, it is a model for other European countries.</P>
      <P>The CSO came up with interesting figures in the not too distant past when it indicated that around half the workforce do not have a pension scheme. Figures from the Irish Association of Pension Funds show the average contribution to pension schemes is 10%, however, in order to maintain an adequate income in retirement the figure should be around 15% to 25%.</P>
      <P>The CSO also estimates that the number of people aged over 65 will rise to 858,800 by 2031, which will represent almost one in five people in the State. The average age will also rise from 34 years to 42 years. The CSO also said that in the mid-east region, comprising Kildare, Meath and Wicklow, the number of people over the age of the 65 will rise by 211% and by 140% in the Dublin area. It is thought that by the 2050 there will be only two working people for every pen<Col N="886"/>sioner in the State. In light of those figures, the Government can do more to provide pension cover for our people.</P>
      <P>Senator Ross presented interesting figures on how the National Pensions Reserve Fund has performed during the past three months. The growth rates in all the stock markets, which is where it has invested most of its funds, have beaten the growth rate of the fund. The growth rate of the UK market, the Irish market and the European zone have passed out the National Pensions Reserve Fund growth of 5.4% over the first three months of this year.</P>
      <P>This brings me to Senator Terry&rsquo;s point, as to the reason moneys in the National Pensions Reserve Fund cannot be used to invest in infrastructural projects. Moneys from the fund could be invested in many areas including roads, water and sewerage schemes, the rail network and airports.</P>
      <P>The new 40 k.m. motorway which opened recently bypassing Kinnegad, Enfield and other towns, did not require the investment of a significant amount of money, yet its growth in terms of a return is high. People would accept the tolling of roads more easily if they knew that the return on such investment in road projects was being used to provide a pension not only for themselves but for future generations. Moneys from the fund could be invested in hospitals, schools and road projects. The fund should examine investment in such projects. The Minister for Finance said there is no problem with capital funding for such projects, which I can understand. There is a queue to invest in such projects because there is a high return on such investment. I cannot understand the reason the National Pensions Reserve Fund has not got in on the act.</P>
      <P>Several speakers alluded to the problem of the provision of pensions for future generations. Some former Telecom employees retired on what they thought was a good pension. They had paid into the pension fund but subsequently realised their pension was not much more than the old age pension. In many cases, there was no increase in their pension over the years. We must provide for pensions that increase in line with inflation. There is an onus on this and future Governments to index link all pensions, regardless of the individuals concerned and when they retire.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. P. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>That has not happened in the past. Some people have paid into public or private pension funds, the expected value of which has not materialised. The pension they receive is not much more than the old age pension. It is terrible that some people have paid into pension funds throughout their working life yet there has been no increase in their pension benefit. I stress what happened in the case of former Telecom employees, some of whom <Col N="887"/>advised me that their pension is not much more than the old age pension.</P>
      <P>The Government has set the target in the provision of pensions. There is a greater awareness by employers of the need to provide pension cover and a greater onus on them to put in place pension plans for their employees.</P>
      <P>Local authority members who pay PAYE are not entitled to a pension. I am not sure whether such provision would pose a problem for the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Social and Family Affairs or the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. Surely somebody is responsible for local authority members. In some cases their council work constitutes their full-time employment. The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government said he does not intend to provide a pension for them. As an employer, I am required to put a pension plan in place for my employees. I have to put a plan in place, although there is no onus on me to pay into it. There is an onus on the Government or the local authorities to put in place a pension plan for local authority members. In some cases their council work constitutes their only means of income or wage packet. The Government and the local authorities are not doing anything to provide pensions for them. Somebody has made a mistake in this regard. The State is wide open to a legal challenge. There could be another scandal in the years to come, like the scandal involving retired people in nursing homes, this time involving members of local authorities who were not given pension plans. The Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, should raise this matter with the Ministers for Finance and Social and Family Affairs. The Government has raised the bar in respect of pensions, but no pension plans have been put in place to cater for the public servants to whom I refer. They cannot contribute to pension schemes. I hope the Minister of State will speak to the Minister for Finance about this issue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, to the House. I would like to pick up on the comments which were made by Senator Paddy Burke. The Fianna F&aacute;il Senators are extremely concerned about the lack of pension opportunities for elected members of local authorities. It is absolutely wrong that such people are being deprived of the opportunity to avail of the provisions of the Local Government (Superannuation) Act 1980 and the 1998 local government superannuation consolidation scheme. All other employees of local authorities are availing of the systems which are in place, as they are entitled to do.</P>
<?oasys _ic0- ?>
      <P>Although we are advocating pensions for all &mdash; one of the Government&rsquo;s policies is to encourage people to take out private pensions when State schemes are not available to them &mdash; councillors who are elected by the people to represent them <Col N="888"/>are unable to participate in the schemes I have mentioned. Not all councillors would wish to avail of a pension scheme, but the option of contributing 5% of their representative allowance to a fund should be open to those who wish to do so. I know we will hear more about this because my colleagues on both sides of the House are very supportive of the case I am making. I know that Senator Burke&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

	<P>I appreciate that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>If he speaks about this issue, other Senators might be inclined to do the same.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I know this issue is close to the Cathaoirleach&rsquo;s heart.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I think we should stick to the matter under debate.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>He gave a clear commitment in this regard on behalf of the leader of the Fine Gael Party. I am not sure whether his commitment that pension schemes will be made available to all councillors if Fine Gael returns to power had been authorised.</P>
      <P Just="Left">
        
        I again welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, to the House. I am delighted that the Minister, Deputy Cowen, was in attendance earlier in this debate. The National Pensions Reserve Fund was established as part of the long-term strategy that is being pursued by the intelligent Government of Fianna F&aacute;il and the Progressive Democrats.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State is doing well in this speech.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government is planning for the future. It has made plans for 2025. I am sure the Minister of State will agree there needs to be a clear commitment to the fund on the part of all parties. The Government is committed to the retention of a fund that is independent of the Government. The annual allocation of 1% of GNP to the fund now comes to &euro;1.4 billion per annum. All parties which are contesting the next general election will have to state clearly that they will not dip into the fund to offer some goodies to the electorate before the election. I call on the leaders of all the parties which are contesting the election to confirm that the fund cannot and will not be touched.</P>
      <P>There is &euro;16.6 billion in the fund at present. If I recall correctly, the Fine Gael Party stated dur<Col N="889"/>ing the last general election campaign that it was prepared to take funds from the National Pensions Reserve Fund to finance current and, in particular, capital expenditure. I am open to correction in that regard &mdash; perhaps that was never the policy of the Fine Gael Party. It is important that the fund should be retained and preserved. It had a return of 5.4% during the first quarter of 2006 and it has grown to &euro;16.6 billion, which is very impressive.</P>
      <P>I would like to express my appreciation of the efforts of Dr. Michael Somers in managing the National Pensions Reserve Fund on behalf of the State. I join the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, in complimenting the work that was done by the late Mr. Donal Geaney, who was the first chairman of the National Pensions Reserve Fund. Mr. Geaney was also a former chief executive of Elan Corporation, which provides over 500 jobs at the Monksland industrial estate in south Roscommon. The company is emerging from its recession and has a bright future. I understand that the National Pensions Reserve Fund has made some investment in this regard.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The motion submitted by the Fianna F&aacute;il Party proposes that this House &ldquo;notes the ongoing commitment of the parties in government to the National Pensions Reserve Fund which is helping to ensure future generations of the elderly will be properly provided for&rdquo;, &ldquo;congratulates the Government for maintaining the National Pensions Reserve Fund and the payment of 1% of GNP per annum into the fund&rdquo; and &ldquo;welcomes the fact that in the first quarter of this year the fund earned &euro;830 million or some 5.4% bringing its total value to &euro;16.6 billion&rdquo;. I do not see any reason this good motion should be amended during this debate. I recommend that the motion, as tabled, should be accepted by Members on all sides of the House.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The amendment to the motion &ldquo;condemns the Government on its failure to make the system of public private partnerships work, leaving the NPRF management unable to invest in vitally important infrastructure&rdquo;. The Minister made it clear that the fund has had no effect on public private partnerships.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government made a commitment to invest some of the fund&rsquo;s moneys in public private partnerships.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Leyden, without interruption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>If the managers of this independent fund believe they will get a return from investing in public private partnerships, nothing will prevent them from making such investments. The Minister would not object to such investments. It is an independent fund. I strongly recommend that the fund should invest in Aer Lingus, for instance. If we are prepared to ask the public to invest its funds in a public-private <Col N="890"/>company like Aer Lingus, we should not be surprised if the fund has the confidence to invest in Aer Lingus as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>That is all we are saying. I am glad the Senator agrees with us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept Senator Paddy Burke&rsquo;s point about investing in toll roads if there is a good return on them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>We are not discussing toll roads now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>We are talking about the portfolio of investments being made by the National Pensions Reserve Fund. The fund&rsquo;s decision to invest in companies like Imperial Tobacco, Royal Dutch Shell and BP has been criticised. Given that the price of crude oil has increased to $78 a barrel, I think the fund made a wise decision when it decided to invest in Royal Dutch Shell, BP and ExxonMobil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator has just one minute remaining.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sorry that my time has almost come to an end because I had much more to say &mdash; a lot done, more to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator has to hand out some more congratulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>When one reads the details of the investments made by the fund in companies like Coca-Cola; Fox Entertainment, which is a very good one; BSkyB, in which it has invested &euro;8.2 million; and Microsoft, in which it has invested &euro;47 million, it is clear that it has made some very good investments. There might be questions about the fund&rsquo;s decision to invest in certain companies, like Imperial Tobacco, but it should be borne in mind that the fund is independently managed. The fund has to make the right decisions. If one examines some of the investments made by the churches &mdash; I do not refer to the Roman Catholic Church &mdash; one will find they are also investing in some dodgy operations as they try to raise funds.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Minister, Deputy Cowen, and the Government on their handling of this fund. I compliment the work of Dr. Michael Somers and everyone else involved in the organisation of this fund on doing their work so well. I hope the House will endorse the motion that has been placed before it by the Fianna F&aacute;il Senators.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">
        I want to support a couple of points which have already been made. The National Pensions Reserve Fund has indicated its willingness to invest moneys in infrastructure in Ireland. An amount of money has been suggested in that regard, but that offer has not been taken up by any Department to date. We know the fund has <Col N="891"/>invested money in projects throughout the world, but it should invest money in the State, especially at a time when investment in infrastructure is needed.</P>
      <P>Given that various proposals have been made for projects in which private sector investment is required, it seems ideal for the fund to invest its money in infrastructural projects in Ireland. Certain types of projects, including roads projects, have already been mentioned. There is no doubt that there are projects in this country which would benefit from investment by the fund.</P>
      <P>Another issue raised by Senators is the need for ethical considerations to be taken into account when investment decisions are being taken by the fund. I support calls for something to be done in that regard.</P>
      <P>Last week I also raised the issue of pensions for councillors. I was at the Local Authority Managers Association, LAMA, conference and the argument was made that councillors were being paid a representational payment, in effect a salary because tax and PRSI are deducted. I looked at the definition of employment recently, regardless of whether somebody is self-employed or working for somebody else. Going through the different criteria listed in a leaflet published by the Revenue Commissioners, I concluded that the courts would determine that councillors were actually employees.</P>
      <P>For all those reasons, if councillors were to take a legal challenge they probably would be vindicated in asserting that they are employees and, as such, are entitled to pensions. It is not as if they are just expecting a pension. What is being proposed is that they should pay their contributions. The money involved would not be much more than the gratuity they receive at present. The argument that they are not employees is greatly undermined by the fact that if a councillor is involved in other employment he or she gets very little as regards the so-called representational payment, because so much of this is paid in tax. I thought this debate might provide a good opportunity to raise this issue and perhaps the Minister of State might relay these sentiments to the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn"><NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share my time with Senator White.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senators will have four minutes each. Is that agreed? Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn"><NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
	<P>T&aacute; seanfhocal ann, agus s&eacute;ard a deireann s&eacute; n&aacute;: n&iacute; h&eacute; l&aacute; na gaoithe l&aacute; na scolb. Is f&iacute;or &eacute; sin a r&aacute;. The old adage is that the day of the wind is not the day of the scollops. Hence, this Government&rsquo;s measure as regards the National Pensions Reserve Fund was proactive and clearly took into account a number of factors, namely, family numbers are decreasing and people are living longer. At yesterday&rsquo;s meeting <Col N="892"/>of the Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs, some important statistics were presented pertaining to the number of people living beyond a certain age, in contrast to what the situation was some years ago.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Another development was that people should be allowed to work longer after the age of 65. I believe that one of the greatest causes of the brain drain was people leaving certain services. This argument does not pertain to all services. A person can be old at 45, while someone who is 70 can be young in terms of their respective mental and physical capabilities. We must take into account people who have had to leave the public sector workforce, especially women. I am speaking specifically about women who had to leave the public service because of the marriage bar. I am not sure that this particular situation has been addressed and I ask the Minister of State to do so.</P>
      <P>I strongly support the comments made by Senators Leyden, Tuffy and others pertaining to the pension for councillors. I will give the Minister of State an example of, say, Joe and Pat, who were the same age on 1 July 1966. One became a member of Westmeath County Council and the other became a carpenter. On 30 June 2006 they will retire. The carpenter will leave with his pension and gratuity, and rightly so. The councillor will leave with a few bob from some time in May 2000 and not a cent of a pension.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I joined the local authority in 1979 and can assert that the activities and commitment that must be given today are greatly different to that which obtained then. It is a totally different ballgame, a full-time job. I am not specifically talking about county councillors. I am referring to city, borough, urban councillors and town commissioners as well, who should all be taken into the loop and the appropriate mechanism found to award them pensions. Senator Leyden is correct. I am not going to parrot what he said, but I support it, because it is the truth.</P>
      <P>As regards the investment of the pensions reserve fund, it would be remiss of this or any Government in preparing for the future not to endeavour to make the money work for it. As the Minister of State said in his concluding remarks, it is not the entire panacea that will resolve this difficulty, but only part of it. He said the establishment of the reserve fund would not of itself solve the pensions issue or all the problems posed by population ageing. It assists considerably, however, he said, in putting the public pensions system onto a sustainable basis.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Leyden that there should not be an amendment to this motion. Politics aside, this has been one of the most proactive measures taken by any Government in my lifetime in ensuring that the people who built this State and those who are building it, will have a future in terms of pension rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Ms White</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State. I saw him on &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; the other night and <Col N="893"/>he batted brilliantly. He looked the part as well. Having seen him in his IFA days, he is playing a different role now, and is dressed for this one, as a politician. I am just being straight.</P>
      <P>As Senator Glynn said, I do not want to parrot what other Members of the House have said for the last hour and a half. However, in a couple of weeks I shall be launching a document, A New Approach to Ageing and Ageism. One of its propositions is that mandatory retirement for all public service employees and obligatory retirement in the private sector should be abolished immediately. Continued employment should be subject to the same assessment criteria, competency, ability and good health, that are used by employers in the case of employees of all ages.</P>
      <P Just="Left">It is discrimination if a person has to retire at 65. In many cases women, including myself, had to retire when they got married in 1969. Many women of 65 have been discriminated against, twice. I have had many public meetings in developing my document, and people have been coming practically in tears who are having to retire this year although they do not wish to. For many people a job is not just about money. The social aspect is important as well. A quarter of those who retire every year would prefer to remain at work.</P>
      <P>I am proposing there should be phased retirement. At the moment no measures are in place to aid the smooth transition between employment and retirement. People who choose to retire often find the abrupt transition from full-time employment difficult to cope with. Some 70% of people would prefer a process of phased retirement. This concept is supported by the Equality Authority in its 2002 document, Equality for Older People. I propose we introduce phased retirement options to allow workers to gradually retire and offset the impact of a sudden cessation of working life. The ability to phase retirement would begin at the employee&rsquo;s minimum retirement age, in agreement with the employer. Part-time work options should also be introduced to allow older people to supplement pension shortfalls &mdash; in order to delay the drawing down of pensions pending higher returns. That is putting it in a nutshell. I will launch an extensive document at the end of May on my new approach to ageing and ageism. I hope it will have the same impact as my document on a new approach to child care which was produced a year and a half ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a timely motion. I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, to the House. On a number of occasions I have supported fundamentally &mdash; as I did in another life &mdash; the establishment of the National Pensions Reserve Fund. It was probably the finest moment of the former Minister, Mr. McCreevy&rsquo;s, tenure. I supported it then against many odds and when many groups in society were opposed to it. It is the essence of good politics to take a decision that will not bear fruit for more than 20 years because <Col N="894"/>it means there is nothing in it for the person taking the decision. I also believe that the Government since then has been right to ensure that nobody could get their fingers into the trough of the National Pensions Reserve Fund.</P>
      <P>I fundamentally disagree with the view offered by Senator Ross earlier in which he referred to the fact that a blind donkey could do better in terms of earning more money. If he can find that blind donkey I will be a customer of it anytime. To subvert that often heard phrase, &ldquo;Live donkey and you will get grass.&rdquo; I will feed that donkey with grass as long as it keeps producing these kind of results.</P>
      <P>It is worthwhile reminding ourselves what exactly has emerged from the National Pensions Reserve Fund. During the first quarter of this year it showed a return of 5.4%. More importantly, it showed a return last year of 20%, which is great. It is also important to recognise that in 2002-03 when equities fared badly and the fund did not do well that politicians from all sides, including Senator Ross, were the first to say that this was not astute management. I welcome the opportunity of putting on the record that the kind of management that has taken place under the aegis of the National Pensions Reserve Fund has been very good in terms of its objective, which is to have 9% in small cap equities and in private equity over the next four or five years. This is most shrewd.</P>
      <P>The National Pensions Reserve Fund must be complimented on the fact that it has resisted what the blind donkeys have done all over Europe, namely, put our money into hedge funds. I would not sleep soundly at night if I thought my pension fund manager was putting money into hedge funds. The Minister for Finance did not make the point that in comparing issues we must compare like with like.</P>
      <P>Senator Ross referred to far higher returns than the National Pensions Reserve Fund has achieved but it would be helpful if he made the comparison with pension fund management as opposed to equity fund management and the kind of approach that must be taken. The fact that the National Pensions Reserve Fund people have managed to get a 6% compound increase over the past four or five years is something on which it should be complimented.</P>
      <P>It is also a fact that in terms of the outlay, it is appropriate that almost 20% of the investment is in bonds and cash. The funds that were referenced by the blind donkey were funds that have no money in bonds or cash because these are parts of the safe investment that has to be done in any maturely invested and managed pension fund. I welcome that.</P>
      <P>I do not know if the point was made earlier that the National Pensions Reserve Fund cannot be invested in Government bonds. It is precluded by law from doing so for very sound reasons. If we are looking after our future we do not need <Col N="895"/>to invest in our future to secure it. That would be like chasing our own tail.</P>
      <P Just="Left">It is appropriate that instead of investing in hedge funds the National Pensions Reserve Fund has managed to put 2% or 3% of the total fund into emerging markets. Overall, we should say to people that this money is wisely, shrewdly and properly invested and that it does look to our future. That is something about which we can be proud.</P>
      <P>Another point that has not been made is that when this fund was established in the first place there was a concern about the problem of paying for our pensions from the year 2020 onwards and that because there would be so few people working to support those people who would no longer be working this would cause a major problem for the future. One significant thing has happened since then, that is, thankfully, that there has been a huge influx of immigrants to this country in order to ensure the growth of our economy and to pay our pensions in the future. Every time we hear it said in debate that people are coming to this country and supposedly taking Irish people&rsquo;s jobs, even though they are jobs Irish people do not want to do, we should point out that this is how our pension will be paid. What is happening is that this is securing our future.</P>
      <P>The other thing we need to say which is not something the Department of Finance is inclined to say, but it is worth saying, is that even in 2000 or 2001 when we established this fund and when we were worried about our exposure and liability in the future we had a lesser <i>pro rata</i> exposure than, for instance, Italy or Germany and they have not taken anything like these measures. We have been far more astute in dealing with that problem and at the same time our problem has eased so it is fair to say we have made significant progress.</P>
      <P>The point the Minister made in his contribution is one which we need to examine and which is not understood by too many people &mdash; that people paying their stamps will have their basic social welfare pension and when we talk about having an obligatory pension &mdash; my colleague Senator Quinn and I have been saying this for many years &mdash; that it is building on top of that. We should say to people that by paying their PRSI, people will develop an entitlement to the social welfare fund but that will not be enough to look after them. If one wants the level of comfort to which one is used, one must also make a commitment to a private investment. That is the future.</P>
      <P>One thing about which I worry &mdash; I heard somebody say it on the radio during the week &mdash; is that pension funds are not the best approach. They might not be the best approach but perhaps no one way is the best. The same man said one would be better off investing in property. I will say two things about that. First, over the past 30 years, property has not done as well as equities. We should keep reminding ourselves of that. <Col N="896"/>Over the past ten or 12 years property prices have escalated in this country but over the past 30 or 40 years they would not even touch what equities have done. Second, properly invested pension funds will also include an investment of some kind in property. For instance, about 5% of the National Pensions Reserve Fund is invested in property.</P>
      <P>We should put some simple facts to the public when we talk about this matter in future. First, our investment is a good idea and that it is properly and responsibly managed. Second, when we ask people to invest in pensions in future we should stress that it is to give them a level of comfort which they will not otherwise have. They are doing it for themselves. Third, it does not take from the social welfare pension which would still be available. Fourth, that putting all one&rsquo;s eggs in one basket is what one does if one invests in property instead of in a pension fund. That is exactly what is wrong with it. In the meantime we will keep an eye out for the mad donkey and if the Minister of State can find him, he and I will pay for its upkeep over the winter and see what it will do for us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MargaretCox"><NameTxt>Ms Cox</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank all Senators who have spoken in this debate. It is interesting that there is a great communality between the views that have been expressed and a clear focus in regard to the problem that we are working towards solving in the future. I reiterate the point regularly made by Senator Terry when we debate the pensions issue in this House. It is appropriate for us to examine the National Pensions Reserve Fund, ask the questions and look for the answers. A significant amount is invested on an annual basis but the most important issue is how the money will be put to work and how important it is to the people who will be dependent on the fund for their statutory pension when they retire. We live in a changing world with people living longer, families becoming smaller, separation and divorce occurring more frequently and contract and part-time work becoming more prevalent. These issues must be put in context for future pension provision.</P>
      <P>I refer to the difference between men and women. Women often earn less than men and have a broken career pattern. Reference was made to the importance of the social welfare system, which accepts PRSI payments from people looking after children and provides an income disregard for child care payments. Women also live longer than men, according to the recent Pensions Board report, which was issued as part of National Pensions Awareness Week. Men retiring at 65 years can expect to live until 81 while women who retire at the same age can expect to live to 84. There will be many sad widows throughout the State. However, we are all living longer and we must prepare for that. A total of 58.6% of the adult workforce is aged over 30 while less than 16% work in the agriculture, <Col N="897"/>catering and tourism industries or are engaged in part-time or seasonal work. They do not have private pensions, which is a major problem.</P>
      <P>The consensus is that the fund is a good concept and it is performing well. It needs to be scrutinised on an annual basis and it must have clear objectives, given the large amount involved but it represents the future of pensions. As Senator <Col N="898"/>O&rsquo;Toole stated, the fund is only one solution to the pensions problem and a range of solutions is needed. There must be choice and flexibility and, without the fund, we would not experience choice when we reach retirement age. I thank all those who contributed and I commend the motion to the House.</P>

	<P>This is a technical amendment to section 34, which replaces sections 37 to 47, inclusive, of the Transport (Railway Infrastructure) Act 2001. The amendment simply clarifies that the amendment is to that Act, as amended by the Railway Safety Act 2005. The 2005 Act amended the period of public consultation as set out in section 40 of the 2001 Act from 14 to 30 days. The Bill replaces this section and changes the time period to six weeks, bringing the process into line with the other consultation periods set out for strategic infrastructure in the Bill and creating a consistent approach across all forms of strategic infrastructure.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>The amendment seeks to require the Railway Procurement Agency or CIE to engage in bona fide reasonable efforts to acquire land by agreement before seeking a compulsory order. I do not propose to accept the amendment because, even if it was possible to determine with precision what is meant in practice by &ldquo;bona fide reasonable efforts&rdquo;, we are not placing this requirement on any other body involved in the compulsory acquisition of land and it would be inappropriate to do so in the case of railway authorities trying to buy land to extend our public transport network. It would throw a legal landmine into the process and could work against the standardisation of procedures we are trying achieve in the Bill, as well as raising the danger of vexatious challenges. A different and more onerous requirement in terms of compulsory purchase orders would apply in the area of public transport. It would not, therefore, be wise to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P FLI="0">The eight-week period should not start until notice has been served. This minor amendment would allow for more transparency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not quite that simple. The board must publicise the making of a railway order as early as possible upon making the order. That will facilitate wide notification of the making of the order and as a consequence it is appropriate that the eight-week period start on the date of the making of the railway order. As the Senators know, it is critical that any challenges are taken as quickly as possible after a decision so that the railway operator can be certain how to progress. That is why we have the eight-week limit and we cannot extend it potentially indefinitely, as the amendment proposes.</P>
      <P>The Senator&rsquo;s amendment could also introduce a degree of confusion as there may be some difficulty with serving a notice. If we want to continue within the timeframe of the Bill, the eight-week period we have set is the best way forward. The amendment proposes that the eight-week period for making an application for leave would begin on the date the order is made. There is certainty in doing it in the way proposed while there is a degree of uncertainty and potential for confusion in the way proposed by this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not suggest extending the period as the Minister said, but that the eight-week period should not begin until the notice is served.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I made the point that there could be difficulties with serving the notice and this could cause confusion. If there is a court challenge in the normal course of events and it is felt that there is a deficiency in the notice, or that the notice has not been sufficient to allow a person to seek the legal redress under discussion here, it would be a matter for the discretion of the courts to allow the person that additional latitude. If we were to take this route and open a question as to when the clock starts ticking we would have difficulties. By the board publicising the making of the railway order as early as possible, giving it due publicity and beginning the eight-week period from that date, everybody knows what is the period. If there is an issue with deficiency, if a person has a bona fide reason, for reasons we cannot foresee, to say he or she did not get enough notice, the court would take that matter on board in the event of a legal challenge. I would not be in favour of opening the door to legal challenges that may be vexatious.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="904"/>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>When a notice is served, any notice, even a summons, the date is specified, and it would be specified in this case. It would not open the door to legal challenges. I am asking that the eight weeks do not begin until the notice has been served. The date on which the notice was served would be confirmed on the notice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I return to my point that there is not always the certainty that one can find the person on whom to appropriately serve the notice. If there is a deficiency in the amount of time and some bona fide reason why a court should hear a case after the eight weeks, the court would have that discretion. It would be unwise to open the gates and allow prevarication on this. I can see difficulties. I am content that the arrangements as they are would not impose any unjust requirement on people or deny them a reasonable opportunity to go to court if there was some deficiency in the notice. It is better to have certainty, that the board would publicise the making of the order and that as soon as the publication is made the eight-week period begins. It would be unwise to take the other route, therefore, reluctantly, I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

	<P>I thank the Leas-Chathaoirleach and the Cathaoirleach for allowing me to raise this issue and the Minister of State at the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Govern<Col N="905"/>ment, Deputy Noel Ahern, for coming to the House. In the past I have raised the question of the sewerage scheme for Glenamaddy, County Galway. Glenamaddy is famous in song as the town that has the four roads. While many towns have four roads this one is famous because it made one of the great songs of the past. The people of Glenamaddy are anxious to see development in the town. They have a new community school sanctioned, the Department has in the past sanctioned money for water schemes in the area and it was recently announced that the CL&Aacute;R programme area has been extended to include Glenamaddy. Above all there is a need for industry, extra housing and development in the town and this cannot be done without an upgraded sewerage scheme.</P>
        <P>The Minister has a programme from Galway County Council for the period 2005-07. It is an ambitious programme. Glenamaddy is on that list. Obviously, I would like to get a report from the Department given that there has been some development. In the past I was told that documentation was requested from Galway County Council by the Department. I tried to follow that up with the council but was told that the last queries made by the Department were answered by the council.</P>
        <P>I thank the Minister for taking an interest. I hope he will take a further interest in upgrading the scheme and delivering good news for the people of Glenamaddy and the hinterland of north-east Galway.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senator for raising this issue. The Department&rsquo;s Water Services Investment Programme 2005-07, published in December 2005, includes some 60 major water and sewerage schemes for Galway, with a value of over &euro;450 million. I am pleased to confirm that the Glenamaddy sewerage scheme is included in the investment programme as a scheme approved to start construction in 2007. The necessary funding has been allocated for it and it will be able to go to construction once all the necessary planning and procurement procedures have been completed.</P>
        <P>My Department is committed to delegating more responsibilities and functions to local authorities whenever possible in order to strengthen local government and, where water services infrastructure is concerned, to also speed up and improve the efficiency of approval and procurement procedures. Previously, once the preliminary report for a project costing up to &euro;2.5 million had been approved under the Department&rsquo;s water services investment programme, the local authority could usually proceed to construction without further reference to the Department. The Minister, Deputy Roche, has recently further extended this devolution of functions.</P><Col N="906"/>
        <P>The position now is that for every project in the water services investment programme costing less than &euro;5 million, local authorities are entitled, after they have received preliminary approval, to proceed right through to construction without further reference to the Department. This means that the local authority does not have to come back to the Department to get approval for contract documents or to place a contract after the tender process has been completed. I am optimistic that, as well as increasing local autonomy, this measure will have a positive effect in accelerating progress on smaller schemes in the water services investment programme.</P>
        <P>The estimated cost of the Glenamaddy sewerage scheme is under &euro;4 million and this should allow it to benefit from the streamlined procurement procedures for smaller projects. A revised preliminary report for the scheme has been submitted by Galway County Council and is being examined in the Department. However, additional information has had to be sought from the council to allow the preliminary report to be cleared. Once this additional information comes to hand, the Department will finalise its examination of the preliminary report as quickly as possible. When it is approved the council will then be free to proceed right through to construction. I hope the remaining queries can shortly be sorted out and that construction can begin on the Glenamaddy sewerage scheme next year as planned.</P>

With an increase in the recent past of up to 30% in student enrolment at the school, it is now catering for 264 students and the number is rising rapidly. The intake in the next couple of years will reflect the increasing local population and will probably increase to close to 300 students. In addition, the school must cater for 23 students with a wide range of disabilities and special needs. Included in that are moderate and mild learning difficulties, cerebral palsy, Down&rsquo;s syndrome, profound deafness and physical handicap.</P>
        <P>The resources and facilities within the school do not do justice to the needs of students, particularly the 23 with special needs. Over the years the school has expanded the curriculum. For example, art is now taken to leaving certificate level, having begun in the past couple of years, and this necessitates additional space and resources. Likewise, woodwork is accommodated in a converted shed in the school premises. The <Col N="907"/>size of the staff room, which caters for 25 teachers and special needs assistants, would have to be seen to be believed. In addition, PLC courses and all other courses for the surrounding community are provided in prefabs or previously vacated national school premises.</P>
        <P>The board of management, school management and staff were told that the school would be included by March 2006 in the allocation for funding. It currently has band 2 rating, the essential stage, and it was hoped it would be included in the March allocation of 2006. However, to the dismay of management and staff, they were recently told the school should be included between 2007 and 2010. That set the alarm bells ringing with regard to what can be done to provide adequate accommodation for the school enrolment.</P>
        <P>The school has developed from being a small, stand-alone school serving a wide rural population. It has grown in strength and its record of academic achievement for its students is second to none nationally. In light of the commitments given under the Disability Act 2005 and the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004, there is an onus on the Department of Education and Science to respond positively and to indicate to the board of management, school management and staff, as well as the parents, that there will be good news for them in the near future so they can plan for their future, rather than having to reduce the curriculum or shed students to surrounding schools. This would cause great difficulty for parents because they would then be faced with the need to avail of school transport.</P>
        <P>It should not happen. The school should serve the catchment area for which it was intended. It cannot continue in its present accommodation due to the lack of space. I urge the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, to impress on the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Hanafin, the urgency of this matter, particularly as the school provides for 23 special needs children with no extra facilities other than mainstream facilities, which is a credit to the management and staff, who are dealing with a very difficult situation and providing a good standard of education. The Minister of State should impress on the Minister that she should allow the project to proceed rapidly because it is required.</P>

	<P>I thank the Senator for raising the matter as it affords me the opportunity to outline to the House the strategy of the Department of Education and Science for capital investment in education projects and also to outline the position regarding the development of education provision in Mercy College secondary school, Woodford, County Galway. Modernising facilities in our 3,200 primary and 750 post-primary schools is not an easy task given the legacy of decades of under-investment in this area as well as the need <Col N="908"/>to respond to emerging needs in areas of rapid population growth. Nonetheless, since taking office, the Government has shown its determination to improve the condition of our school buildings and to ensure that the appropriate facilities are in place to enable the implementation of a broad and balanced curriculum.</P>
        <P>As evidence of this commitment, there will be approximately 1,300 building and modernisation projects active in our primary and post primary schools this year. Over &euro;490 million is being spent on the primary and post primary projects throughout the country. I am sure the House will agree this record level of investment is a positive testament to the high priority the Government attaches to this sector.</P>
        <P>The Mercy College secondary school, Woodford, is a co-educational post primary school with a current enrolment of 264 pupils. Enrolment has increased slightly in recent years, from 218 pupils in 2001 to 264 this year. The school authority has an application with the Department of Education and Science for an extension. The long-term projected enrolment, on which the school&rsquo;s long term accommodation needs will be based, has been agreed with the school at 225 pupils.</P>
        <P>Schedules of accommodation for the proposed extension were drawn up some time ago, presumably before the school population increased. Officials in the Department of Education and Science are currently re-examining these schedules to ensure that the level of accommodation being proposed will meet the long-term needs of the school. When these are confirmed, progression of the project will be considered in the context of the school building and modernisation programme 2006-10.</P>
        <P>I thank the Senator for raising the matter and I will convey what he said to the Minister. It might well be that the long-term needs were agreed at 225 pupils a few years ago. The number of pupils in the school has increased and the long-term projection must be right before the project goes ahead.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for taking this Adjournment matter on the important issue of funding for Legan neighbourhood watch. I cannot stress enough the need for him to give an update regarding essential funding for Legan neighbourhood watch and community alert under the programme of grants for locally-based community and voluntary organisation as this group provides an invaluable service to the local community and urgently needs funding. The key point is volunteerism, something about which the Minister of State and the Taoiseach have spoken in the past. It is not only a catch-phrase but an <Col N="909"/>expression of the hard work and voluntary effort by groups such as the Legan community and neighbourhood watch and other community-based organisations throughout the country.</P>
        <P>It is an indictment of the State and the Minister of State&rsquo;s Department that such groups, which work tirelessly in remote rural areas, lack adequate funding and that funding is not put in place to assist and promote their endeavours. Every member of this organisation gives his or her time without pay or, in many cases, without recognition and do so for the benefit and good of their community. They do not want recognition anyway. All they ask is that the Government recognises their contribution and back it accordingly with funding.</P>
        <P>The group applied under the Department&rsquo;s programme of grants for locally-based and voluntary organisations in 2005. Having been turned down for funding, I ask the Minister of State what steps he intends to take to ensure such a valuable community service is not left without adequate funding to promote its endeavours. If the voluntary groups in this country, which are neglected and left carrying the can, were to fold up their tents and walk away, the onus on the State would be considerable as the already crisis level of urban and, indeed, rural crime would escalate even further.</P>
        <P>The sense of community in areas such as Legan, an area from where I come, with a small population of under 1,000 people is amazing. The Minister of State should recognise this, hold out a helping hand, give this group the funding to which it is entitled and keep the spirit of community and volunteerism alive, which is very important. Groups, such as the Legan group, provide a valuable service in the community and they also provide assistance to Government. Therefore, the Government must provide assistance to groups such as this one.</P>
        <P>When the group received the letter rejecting its request in January, I appealed the decision. All the group was told was to apply again. Where there is so much volunteering, people deserve more than that. These people have much to do with their time but they are very generous with it in respect of elderly people who live in the neighbourhood. It is time a group such as the Legan one is prioritised. We can throw as much money as we like at setting up committees, groups, task forces, etc., but the real work is done on the ground and it is important it is recognised by way of financial contribution. Perhaps the Minister of State has the goodies for us and I await his response with bated breath.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The programme of grants for locally-based community and voluntary organisations which the Senator mentioned is funded by my Department and supports the activities of local voluntary and community groups addressing disadvantage in their community. The programme transferred to my Department from the <Col N="910"/>Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs in 2002. Since then, and in its previous format, the programme has benefited thousands of locally-based community and voluntary organisations throughout the country.</P>
        <P>Last year I announced funding in excess of &euro;5.5million under the programme for over 500 groups throughout the country. This represented an increase of approximately &euro;2million over the 2004 figure. The organisations funded represent a broad cross-section of local voluntary and community activity but especially those addressing disadvantage in their communities. The groups which received funding under the programme are published on the Department&rsquo;s website.</P>
        <P>The programme consists of three schemes. One makes funds available for small-scale refurbishment of premises such as community halls. Grants of up to &euro;40,000 are available for refurbishment purposes. This is complemented by a second scheme to provide for the purchase of essential equipment, including IT equipment. The maximum grant for equipment is &euro;10,000. The third scheme is aimed at enhancing the capacity of local communities and grants of up to &euro;10,000 are available towards education, training and research proposals. Grants towards wages or salaries or other running costs are not available under this scheme.</P>
        <P>The programme is advertised widely in the national and regional newspapers every year. Last year in response to invitations for applications, we got almost 1,500 applications. They were assessed for the Department by reference to the criteria set out in the published guidelines and scored accordingly. Priority under the programme is given to disadvantaged communities with a greater priority accorded to self-help initiatives by disadvantaged groups and communities. In addition to the general application requirements, the applications are assessed by reference to a number of criteria. Last year all the eligible applications were scored against these criteria and the grants were based on the results.</P>
        <P>An application for funding was received by the Department under the 2005 programme from the Legan neighbourhood watch in Longford. The application from the organisation in question failed to achieve a sufficiently high score to enable it to be considered for funding. The application from the organisation in question failed to achieve a sufficiently high score to enable it to be considered for funding on this occasion. A request for a review of the original assessment of the application was received by my Department in January. The result was that the application submitted was for the provision of security equipment for older people in the local community and was therefore outside the scope of the programme of grants for locally based community and voluntary organisations. The group basically applied under the wrong scheme.</P>
        <P>The Department operates a separate scheme, the scheme of community supports for older <Col N="911"/>people, which addresses such needs directly. There is no shortage of funding whatsoever under this scheme. Today we celebrated the scheme&rsquo;s tenth anniversary and the event will probably be reported in the media, including the regional papers, over the coming days. We have arranged for the Department to forward a copy of the application form and the guidelines for the scheme to the group in question.</P>
        <P>I totally agree with the Senator&rsquo;s points on voluntary effort and volunteerism. I do not know if there were people from Longford at the celebrations in the hotel today but I know that a couple of hundred people from different groups from all over the country attended. They seemed to be highly motivated and energised and were quite favourably disposed to the amendments I made to the scheme.</P>
        <P>The group applied under the wrong scheme. If it applies under the correct scheme, fills in the application form sent to it correctly and submits it as early as it can, we will certainly see to it that the grant is made. There is no shortage of funding for security measures for elderly people.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>My brother, Councillor Larry Bannon, raised this issue with me. He is very active in the local community and is a member of the committee. Can the organisation apply for the two grants at the one time? I have no doubt that it will be submitting another application. I have given the Minister the reference number and perhaps he will consider the application sympathetically this time around.</P>
        <P>The organisation is doing considerable work for disadvantaged people as well as enhancing the security of elderly people. In some rural areas, elderly people have to board themselves into their homes from 4 p.m. They need company and it is important that they be looked after and that they have friends who will sit with them, talk to <Col N="912"/>them and provide for their needs if requested to do so.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>There would be no problem. The organisation will have to apply again because the application submitted was for last year. It is seeking security measures for the elderly, including alarm pendants, locks and bolts for doors and windows, security lights that come on automatically when one approaches and non-electrified fire alarms. These are granted through the scheme of community supports for older people. We were launching this year&rsquo;s version of the scheme today and it will be advertised tomorrow and over the next couple of days.</P>
        <P>The scheme under which the organisation applied last year is more for refurbishing community halls, equipment for community halls, including IT equipment, and research and training. One could certainly apply under the three headings of this scheme or apply under the scheme of community supports for older people. One could apply under both but unfortunately the group applied under the wrong scheme last year. Maybe this is a simple error and the Department may&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>It covered the two areas.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>We have so many good schemes giving out so much good money that I can well understand how a voluntary group could send in the wrong form. Unfortunately, the application was assessed under the criteria of the scheme to which it pertained and the system does not allow for its transfer to the other scheme. The Department proceeds on the basis of what one puts down in writing. I have no doubt but that if the group submits a proper application this year, we will see to it.</P>
