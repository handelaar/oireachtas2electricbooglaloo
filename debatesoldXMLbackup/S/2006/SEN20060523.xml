    <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to consider an application for the provision of two prefabs for St. Mark&rsquo;s junior school, Springfield, Tallaght, given that there are currently only 24 classrooms in the school to accommodate 30 staff members.</P>

   <Title>Death of Staff Member: Expressions of Sympathy.</Title>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to remember one of our reporters, Breda Courtney, who died suddenly last week. Breda worked in &Aacute;ras an Uachtar&aacute;in before joining us in Leinster House in 1978. She became a parliamentary reporter in 1996 and worked here in the Chamber in the week of her death. I wish to extend my sincere sympathy to her family, friends and colleagues, particularly her colleagues in the Debates Office.</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="1390"/>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>As Leader of the House, I join the Cathaoirleach in expressing our sympathy to the family of Breda Courtney who died so suddenly. I often think of the people who come here and do their work so assiduously every day. I am pleased her colleagues are here with us this afternoon. Their job must sometimes be very boring and never-ending. Speaking for myself, they hear drivel in both Houses from time to time, and yet they must keep their equilibrium and steadily work on. Breda Courtney was a parliamentary reporter since 1996 and was in this House on many occasions.</P>
    <P>Under the Cathaoirleach&rsquo;s aegis and that of his predecessors, we have always expressed sympathy when former Senators or people who graced this Chamber pass away. We are glad to do so because we regard them as our former comrades. Those who work in this Chamber are also comrades, particularly among their colleagues and close friends. I am sure they swap stories and have many interesting conversations together.</P>
    <P>Be that as it may, Breda passed away so terrifyingly quickly, being in the House one day and gone the next, that it struck fear into our hearts when we heard it. While we may not have known her full name, we all knew Breda when she came into the Chamber as unassuming, studious and assiduous, all of the qualities one expects in a person of that calling. On behalf of my party and as Leader of the House, I join with the Cathaoirleach in voicing our sympathy to her family.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>On behalf of the Fine Gael group in the House, I join with the Cathaoirleach and the Leader in offering our sympathy to the family of Ms Breda Courtney, who was well known to many people in this House and the D&aacute;il for her work as a parliamentary reporter over many years.</P>
    <P>As well as expressing sympathy to her family, I sympathise with her work colleagues, who are with us today. The parliamentary reporters in the Debates Office do an essential job in our parliamentary democracy, translating our various mutterings into plain English. They do a terrific job, about which the public needs to know. The debates in this House, the D&aacute;il and at committees are reported quickly so the public can see exactly what goes on in these Houses. Ms Courtney was an essential cog in the wheel, someone who was much loved in this House and who played her part in its workings.</P>
    <P>We extend to her family and her work colleagues our deepest sympathy at this very difficult time.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>On behalf of those on the Independent benches, I would like to be associated with the previous comments and offer our condolences to Breda&rsquo;s colleagues, her circle of friends and her family. We may not have known Ms Courtney that well but we would exchange a <Col N="1391"/>half smile and a friendly nod whenever she passed by. She was courteous at all times.</P>
    <P>The part that she played and her colleagues continue to play in keeping the Irish parliamentary website as one of the most up to date and progressive in all of Europe, as far as I can see from looking at other examples, is something she can share in our thanks for. I do not know if anybody has compared closely what we say and what is produced, or examined how people like Breda can listen, <i>ad nauseam</i>, as we go on with elliptical sentences, half-formed paragraphs, doubtful grammar and general incoherence. This would be transcribed and edited into sentences with perfect grammar and English usage. We are grateful to her for her work in this respect.</P>
    <P Just="Left">I would like her family to know of the part she played in continuing a tradition going back generations to Hansard in the House of Commons. It is an important role and a crucial piece of reference and record. In thanking Ms Courtney, we offer our condolences to her friends and her colleagues especially. They must be shocked at the suddenness of someone who was working here a couple of weeks ago dying so quickly. We also extend sympathy to her family. Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a anam.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to join in the words of sympathy to the family, friends and colleagues of Ms Breda Courtney, who died so suddenly. It has been mentioned that a sudden death like hers leaves a gaping hole and is such a loss for family and friends. We in the House would have been aware of Breda coming and going, and of her extraordinary work and that of her colleagues. She was part of an amazing team supporting the work of this House and playing a valuable role in our democracy, ensuring that the public has quick and easy access to the pronouncements in this House.</P>
    <P>On behalf of the Labour Party I thank Breda Courtney and her family for her long years of service, as have been mentioned by the Cathaoirleach and the Leader. She served here for a considerable number of years and I thank her for such assiduous service, and for being an extraordinary member of a great team.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnMinihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Minihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I join with previous speakers in extending the sympathy of the Progressive Democrats to Breda Courtney&rsquo;s family and her work colleagues on her sudden death. A sudden death is a shock for everyone, but particularly for her family and those who worked closely with her. We all acknowledge the tremendous work done silently and efficiently by the parliamentary reporters in maintaining the records of what is debated in this House for the years ahead. The efficiency with which the parliamentary reporters work is acknowledged by everyone. I extend the <Col N="1392"/>sincere sympathy of our party to her family and work colleagues.</P>

No. 1, statements on proposals for supporting lone parents, to be taken on conclusion of the Order of Business and to conclude not later than 5 p.m., with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed ten minutes and those of other Senators not to exceed six minutes, and the Minister is to be called upon to reply not later than five minutes before the conclusion of the statements; and No. 2, Road Safety Authority Bill 2004  &mdash; Committee Stage, to be taken at 6.30 p.m. and to conclude not later than 9 p.m. There will be a sos from 5 p.m. to 6.30 p.m.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>The House should register its thanks to members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, to the staff and clergy of St. Patrick&rsquo;s Cathedral in Dublin and to all those involved in averting a potential disaster in the cathedral last week. I refer to the hunger and thirst strike by a number of Afghan refugees. There were ugly scenes outside that great cathedral involving demonstrators of various descriptions, none of whom helped to resolve the situation.</P>
    <P Just="Left">Lessons must be learned from the episode. It is utterly wrong that people in all four corners of this country have still not, after many years, received a determination as to their status. We must also review how transparent the refugee appeals system is because there is evidence that very few succeed. The House should debate whether, in this day and age, it is right and proper from the point of view of refugee protection for the appeals system to be based in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Both sides of the House have concerns on this issue, because we are talking about desperate people in desperate circumstances. While there must be an independent system to resolve an application for asylum we can, nevertheless, do better. If there is one lesson to be learned from the episode last week it is that there needs to be put in place a much more accountable system for dealing with refugee appeals in this country.</P>
    <P Just="Left">When will this House debate the Government&rsquo;s plans for Aer Lingus? My party has been quite supportive of the Government&rsquo;s attempts to introduce part-privatisation of the airline but we must be realistic and sensible about it. Given the recent downturn in equity markets the question must be asked as to what the benefits of privatisation will be in the short to medium term. Given the Taoiseach&rsquo;s ability to speak out of both sides of his mouth in recent days, the Minister must come to the House to give a clear statement of the Government&rsquo;s intent over Aer Lingus. It may not now be the right time to proceed with the sale <Col N="1393"/>because it may not ensure the maximum return to the Irish taxpayer. This House has a role to play in debating this important matter.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not ten years since the House discussed the future of Telecom &Eacute;ireann in a debate which revolved around issues such as privatisation, nationalisation and state ownership. We should look back and learn from that debate. I recall Senators using arguments about having to wait for months to get a landline and the need for investment to ensure broadband was available throughout the country, as reasons to sell off Telecom &Eacute;ireann. What was the result of the privatisation of the company? It created a couple of dozen more millionaires and allowed Eircom to be used as a vessel and plaything for asset strippers. We have now returned to the position of having to wait months for a landline and 80% of the country does not have access to broadband. A debate on this issue is needed.</P>
    <P>Senator Brian Hayes raised an important point in this regard. We must forget the old ideas of nationalisation, privatisation and state ownership and instead examine whether we need to hold, let go of or use differently the assets still in State hands and determine whether our priority is nationalisation, privatisation or competition. I believe it is the third of these considerations. Senators should state honestly whether they believe that those who will buy Aer Lingus will do so with a view to investing in Ireland&rsquo;s airports and services for its citizens. I do not want to hear their views on whether the State should own assets or long philosophical discourses on privatisation and nationalisation. Senators, without resorting to jargon, should state what they envisage will happen if we choose to privatise Aer Lingus.</P>
    <P>The Prime Minister of Australia will address a joint sitting of the Houses today. His presence offers Members a useful opportunity to express in a parliamentary fashion our views on the war in Iraq and Australia&rsquo;s involvement in it.</P>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Members have expressed their views during a number of visits by important dignitaries from the United States. They may be our guests but this does not mean we must agree with everything they do. They should hear our views on their approach and policies. Such a discussion would be useful.</P>
    <P>I support Senator Brian Hayes&rsquo;s call for a debate on the future plans for Aer Lingus and request a debate on the Iraq war, including Australia&rsquo;s involvement in it.</P>

   <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>

   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Senator to speak on the Order of Business.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>
	<P>I add my voice to calls for a debate on the future of Aer Lingus. People have asked what the future of the company will be in the event that privatisation proceeds. We do not know the answer to this valid question just as we did not know what would happen to Telecom &Eacute;ireann following privatisation. It is now too late to roll back that privatisation. The question which then arises is whether we are willing to take a similar risk with Aer Lingus. We cannot afford to do so because the sale of the national airline puts the national interest at stake. While I sense the Taoiseach has doubts about the value of privatisation, I also sense that certain forces are determined to proceed with it. It is important, therefore, to debate the future of Aer Lingus.</P>
    <P>I share the relief of other Senators at the outcome of events in St. Patrick&rsquo;s Cathedral at the weekend and, like Senator Brian Hayes, believe it is important that an urgent review of the refugee appeals system is carried out. The recent actions of refugees were clearly not taken lightly and we must listen to their pleas.</P>
    <P>On a matter I have raised previously and on which the Leader is probably working, what is the position with regard to the review of the regulations governing the operation of cr&egrave;ches? When one considers that the welfare of thousands of children is dependent on the operation of these regulations, one would expect the review to be urgent. We are still waiting for news of the proposals by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on a press council. I ask the Leader to let us know when that is likely to happen.</P>

   <Speaker pid="JohnMinihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Minihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I join with Senator Brian Hayes in congratulating the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on the stance taken last week in difficult circumstances. The situation could have turned bad in a short period. Clear leadership and direction must be given in such situations in order to achieve a successful outcome. We should also acknowledge that our system for dealing with appeals and granting refugee status is held up as a role model by the international community.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>No.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnMinihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Minihan</NameTxt>
	<P>It should also be acknowledged how much we have improved in processing such applications. There is always room for improvement, however, and if there are lessons to be learned from what occurred last week, then mechanisms should be put in place to ameliorate the situation.</P>
    <P>We are quick to condemn actions by various groups but we should congratulate the 60,000 Irish ambassadors who visited Cardiff last week to support Munster.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not think that is appropriate.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnMinihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Minihan</NameTxt>
	<P>They were ambassadors in their own right.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>There are ambassadors coming and going every day, so we could be congratulating them every morning but we must stick to the Order of Business.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnMinihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Minihan</NameTxt>
	<P>It was a unique occasion.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnMinihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Minihan</NameTxt>
	<P>There were lessons to be learned from that occasion as regards community policing and crowd control when we saw how the civic authorities in Cardiff worked and the Munster supporters behaved themselves.</P>

    <P>I join with Senator O&rsquo;Toole in welcoming the fact that the Australian Prime Minister, Mr. Howard, is here today.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not think he welcomed him.</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="1396"/>
   <Speaker pid="JohnMinihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Minihan</NameTxt>
	<P>He welcomed the fact that Mr. Howard is here today. We should engage in the parliamentary process. Regardless of one&rsquo;s views on any particular individual, the Office of the Australian Prime Minister must be acknowledged together with the great associations between our country and Australia, and the many Irish people who have settled there.</P>

   <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>During the year, everyone here welcomed the fact that the Minister for Education and Science and the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children indicated collectively that the intake for medical schools would be increased, or doubled, in future. They said that, starting in October this year, there would be an additional intake of approximately 70 students. However, certain suggestions being made by vested interests are worrying to say the least. They are saying that in addition to achieving a minimum of 450 points in the leaving certificate, there will also be an aptitude test. Changing the points system specifically for entry to various medical degree and diploma courses downgrades the leaving certificate results. Aptitude tests would also create a wider interpretation of entry requirements than currently exists.</P>
    <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Over the years, the Minister for Education and Science has supported increased opportunities for those from disadvantaged backgrounds. I do not know how a mechanism can be found to level the playing pitch for all students seeking entry to medical schools if aptitude tests are to be introduced and there is no recognition of people from disadvantaged backgrounds. I ask that we would have clarification from the Minister for Education and Science and-or the T&aacute;naiste with regard to the acceptance of the findings of the report of the special group recently put together.</P>
      </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the call that the House would commend the Garda Commissioner on the excellent handling of the siege in St. Patrick&rsquo;s Cathedral. I compliment the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Taoiseach and the Government for holding firm and showing strong Government. If we yielded to that type of blackmail, there would no control on immigrants or Afghans coming here. I would like to find out how they entered the country in the first instance because traffickers were involved in this situation who had no regard for health conditions or otherwise.</P>
    <P>We should put on record that we have an excellent Garda Commissioner and Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and commend the members of the force for their dedication and commitment to their job. It is right that this House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Has the Senator a question?</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="1397"/>
   <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose &mdash; I am sure support will be unanimous &mdash; that we send our best wishes to the Garda Commissioner and thank the Garda for its handling of this crisis.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the sale of Eircom.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>That was a few years ago.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>He is talking about Aer Lingus.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I am talking about the resale of Eircom. It will not improve current services. There has already been a reduction in services but this will be far worse. This sale is moving the package from one company to another. They have already stolen many of the assets, they have ripped off the company and now they intend to rip it off again.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>In the comments on the situation in St. Patrick&rsquo;s Cathedral, although the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Garda Commissioner have been widely congratulated, there has been no mention of the dean and staff of the cathedral. I compliment them on the sensitive and Christian way in which they behaved. I regret that they were fairly strongly sidelined at a particular point, which is clear from a statement in which they stated they were instructed by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to withdraw their negotiator. They felt they had reached a set of fair and equitable proposals but were told to get out of the situation by the Garda. Nevertheless, I recognise garda&iacute; behaved extremely well and that no harm was caused to any of the people involved.</P>
    <P Just="Left">I am also glad &mdash; I am sure the Cathaoirleach will also be glad &mdash; that the institution of the guardian<i> ad litem</i> was called into play to help the younger people in this situation. The Cathaoirleach will probably recall that this was an amendment to the Children Bill introduced by Senator Ryan and me. No mention of that appeared in the media at the time, although it took nearly a month for us to argue the toss. This shows the way in which the work of the Seanad is sometimes ignored in the media.</P>
    <P>Some of those involved seem to have a rather mixed background, if it is true that one of them gave as his reasons for seeking asylum the fact that he had raped and murdered four women while a member of the Taliban. It does not seem a particularly good reason for getting asylum in this country. However, they are a mixed group.</P>
    <P>It is wrong to suggest we have a wonderful asylum appeals system. We do not. There is a case before the High Court at present in this regard. There is no publication&mdash;&mdash;</P>

   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>If the Senator seeks a debate, we will discuss all the issues.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>In that case, I will take the Cathaoirleach&rsquo;s good advice and seek a debate where we can make such points and also point out that, unusually, there is no publication of these decisions or the reasons for them.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator has elaborated sufficiently.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Senator O&rsquo;Toole that those of us who have consistently opposed the war in Iraq should find some dignified way of making this clear to Mr. Howard, who apparently has learned nothing from the lessons his Government should have learned from its disgraceful and immoral involvement in the disfoliation of the defenceless country of East Timor. Of course, that will not cause any inconvenience to this Government because it also seems to lack a sense of morality, as evidenced by the fact it can be so easily bought &mdash; bought by the Americans over Shannon and by the Chinese for financial rewards.</P>
    <P>I call for a debate on the motion on China and Tibet, listed in our names on the Order Paper, because it is important that the House discusses the question of whether it is fashionable to have ethics in foreign policy. We have a situation where the Chinese are apparently harvesting organs from live people in concentration camps.</P>

   <Speaker pid="TomMorrissey"><NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
	<P>On my way to the House today I witnessed a traffic jam stretching a mile from Clonee to Dublin Airport via the M50. That was not at peak time, morning or evening, but at 1 p.m. I mention this in the context of the opening of the Dublin Port tunnel and the ban on heavy goods vehicles being imposed within the city. I also mention it in the context of competitiveness.</P>
    <P>While much has been said about our competitiveness, nothing impinges on it more than our transport system. I would like a debate on the vexed question of what will happen to the M50 when the Dublin Port tunnel opens. Until recently no discussions had taken place between <Col N="1399"/>the NRA and the Department on what measures might be put in place for heavy goods vehicles on the M50. We are facing gridlock.</P>
    <P>Like other Members I would welcome a debate on Aer Lingus, including the practicality of what has happened and what will happen. Long before Eddie Hobbs mentioned the word &ldquo;rip-off&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</P>

   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I would prefer if the Senator did not refer to people who&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TomMorrissey"><NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;the previous chief executive said publicly that Aer Lingus had ripped-off its customers for decades. During his tenure he reduced the average fare by &euro;30 per passenger, a total of &euro;560 million in a space of two years.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>We cannot have a debate on that matter at this stage.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TomMorrissey"><NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
	<P>On his departure he said the same would have to be achieved. Are we really asking to return to that model, given that the State system ripped-off its customers, could not look after its pensioners and left a pension deficit, even at those exorbitant prices? How are the pensioners of that airline to be treated in the future?</P>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TomMorrissey"><NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>

   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not know if I should have done so before now but I ask Senators to be brief from now on.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am always brief. I agree with Senator Brian Hayes on the ending of the hunger and thirst strike at St. Patrick&rsquo;s Cathedral and, in particular, his remarks on the refugee appeals board. Obviously the system is in need of urgent examination. Allegedly, one member of the refugee appeals board has not allowed a single appeal, although my colleague, Senator Browne, informs me that has been corrected. Whether it has, there is a need for more transparency in the system and it must be seen to operate on the one set of criteria. I look forward to hearing the Leader&rsquo;s views on that issue.</P>
    <P>Senators Brian Hayes, O&rsquo;Toole and O&rsquo;Meara referred to the sale of Aer Lingus, and it is time for a debate on what is best in the national interest. The Great Southern Hotels group is a case in point. It has been decided to sell the hotels. They have had expressions of interest. There is an advertised sale date by which tenders must be submitted for lots or the entirety of the Great Southern Hotels group.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Has the Senator a question?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>How can the State&rsquo;s interest be best protected where there has been an <Col N="1400"/>expression of interest and where, presumably, there are tenders from other institutions of the State with adjacent land, as in the case of CIE in Galway and in Killarney? There will be other cases in regard to the airport authority. I look forward to hearing the Leader&rsquo;s views on that issue.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator has made his point.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I call for a debate with the relevant Minister.</P>

   <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to be wearing red today.</P>
    <P Just="Left">I support Senator Brian Hayes in his call for a debate on asylum application processing. What we saw last week sent out very mixed messages to the public as to the background of those involved and why it all happened. I congratulate the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on his strong stand from the outset. He gave direction and leadership and it was clear no blackmailing would be tolerated. We need that kind of leadership at such moments. It was important. I am particularly keen that we debate the important issue of asylum. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is keen to upgrade and provide clarity to the processes in the future.</P>
    <P>I know that the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Hanafin, came to this House to discuss the reform of the entry points system for third level education, particularly with regard to extending the number of medical school applicants. I have mixed feelings on how that should be approached and differ a little from the Minister. Applicants should have the basic points but we should also consider aptitude tests and interviews. The Minister might attend for another debate on this. Although she spoke in the House on the matter quite recently, there is still confusion.</P>

   <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">While the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is getting the benefit of the praise for resolving the situation in St. Patrick&rsquo;s Cathedral last week, controversy remains regarding the Garda reserve. I understand the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will shortly attend the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights with proposals on how he hopes to resolve the controversy. Without diminishing in any way that the principle of the Garda reserve seems attractive, we need a solution to allow the Garda to be enthusiastic about it. In business, if one plans to introduce a new service or product, one does so on a trial basis. I understand there are 24 Garda divisions and six Garda regions. It seems logical that if the Garda reserve is to be tested, it would be tested in one of those for a period of time to see if it works. The Minister might consider that.</P><Col N="1401"/>
    <P>We had a very good debate last week on energy. The Leader might consider a debate on our failure once again to reach the 13% greenhouse gas emissions targets of the Kyoto Agreement. It was interesting to see figures published in Britain yesterday to show how each town is achieving its targets on a per household basis. Some are double the rate of others in their carbon dioxide emissions. This is in the hands of the individuals who live in those towns, and shows the success that is possible. This would be a useful debate. It is a question of personal responsibility, a little like tidy towns competitions. There is a little bit of shame involved and a little bit of honour if one achieves what one sets out to achieve. It would be useful for us to consider the example in Britain.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I share the concerns of Senator O&rsquo;Toole and of Senator Ross, who I understand indicated he would be making a contribution along the lines of comments he wrote last week in his capacity as business editor of the <i>Sunday Independent</i>. He made the point that whenever there is any wobble in the equity markets, representatives of one of the major stockbrokers in this country, which in effect is working on behalf of many of the major companies, are trotted out onto the national airwaves and media to express what is conveyed as an independent, non-partisan opinion about the state of the stock market. In the context of calling for a debate on this area, Senator Ross made the valid point with regard to Eircom that it was wrong &mdash; I do not want to misquote him &mdash; that such people should be brought onto the national airwaves to influence the direction of purchasing of shares. I quibble with his assertion that not many people in Ireland would be exercised by this matter, because a significant number of people in Ireland own Vodafone shares as the result of the first sale of Eircom. I support the call for a debate on this in the context of how the markets are working and what financial regulations are in place to ensure proper information is given to the general public.</P>
    <P>Like others, I have raised the issue of the undocumented Irish. This week, the US Senate will hopefully pass meaningful reform legislation which we trust will resolve this issue from an Irish perspective. Many Members will agree it does not help the situation to read in the media that the New York hurling team allegedly has several undocumented Irish players who might not be able to come to this country to complete the hurling championship.</P>
    <P>The organisation in question receives substantial amounts of taxpayers&rsquo; money so it is a political issue. It is time the Minister commented in this regard. It does not help the undocumented Irish in America when stories are published which allege that undocumented people are playing in a high profile hurling game and will not be able to come to this country because they will be unable to return. Surely the organisation in ques<Col N="1402"/>tion should have established before the championship started whether the status of these people was legal.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a matter for the organisation.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>Eircom has been bought for the fifth time. While it is a good deal for the management and employees, is it a good deal for the customer? Babcock &amp; Brown has taken on a considerable debt. How will the company manage that debt and will it impact on the delivery of broadband and the telephone service? I doubt it can get any worse. If one wishes to have an Eircom telegraph pole moved, the quickest way to do it is to knock it down and telephone Eircom afterwards. That is what happens. The company cut my telephone off a week early when I was moving office and told me it would take ten days to reconnect it. It is important to have a debate on Eircom, especially from the consumer&rsquo;s viewpoint.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Leader will join me in congratulating one of her constituents, Michael O&rsquo;Leary, on the success of Ryanair, which was established 20 years ago today.</P>

	<P>Have you a question for the Leader?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>On the issue of Aer Lingus, which was raised by other speakers, 20 years ago it cost &euro;750 to fly to London. This shows what can happen with privatisation. The difficulty is that when the aviation industry goes through a slump, as sometimes happens, the Government cannot invest in Aer Lingus. There must be a decision on Aer Lingus. The Government has made a mess of it.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>I share Senator Ulick Burke&rsquo;s concern about the extra hurdle students who wish to study medicine might have to jump if an aptitude test is introduced. Why is it not introduced for other professions such as pharmacy, veterinary medicine, physiotherapy, radiography, engineering, teaching and so forth? Will the Leader arrange a debate on the concept of having aptitude tests for students who are going for the professional schools? It would be most unfair if medical students were singled out and this hurdle were put in their way when other people going for similarly high points courses would not have to jump it.</P>

   <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>I join my colleagues in commending the church authorities, the Garda and the Government on successfully handling a difficult situation with the requisite combination of sensitivity and fairness. It was a little misleading to talk about there being a deal between the Church of Ireland and the refugees. Obviously, no church can commit the Government to actions that fall within the Government&rsquo;s remit. However, I am sure it was done with the best of intentions. I agree the demonstrations and counter-demonstrations did not help. There is no country where asylum and immigration policy is not handled by either the interior or justice ministries.</P>
    <P>I welcome Prime Minister Howard&rsquo;s visit to this country. He represents a country with which we have close and friendly relations. It was the change of policy by his Government that paved the way for the independence of East Timor.</P>

	<P>I wish to join with Members who have requested a debate on the future of Aer Lingus. I welcome the remarks of Members from the Progressive Democrats who have distanced themselves from the Taoiseach&rsquo;s comments in the other House last Wednesday. I hope the Taoiseach will use the opportunity afforded to him today to offer a more appropriate appraisal than the one he offered last Wednesday. He abused his position and parliamentary privilege through the comments he made about the former chief executive officer of Aer Lingus. I think he will correct the record today. I note the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children and Fianna F&aacute;il Members offered several explanations on what the Taoiseach had meant to say. I am sure he will correct it today.</P>

   <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Leader for a debate on the future of Aer Lingus and whether we should proceed with its part-privatisation. Although I am in favour of part-privatisation, it is opportune to reflect on what the best course of action would be for the national airline.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Australian Prime Minister&rsquo;s visit to Leinster House. Australia is a country with which we have many cultural and historical links and many thousands of Australians claim Irish ancestry.</P>

	<P>Last Friday in Westport, County Mayo, I presented a paper on local authority financing and its future. A serious deficit has arisen in local authority funding. In turn, local authorities make a disproportionate charge on businesses through development charges. These are making small and medium-sized businesses uncompetitive and, therefore, they find it more difficult to survive. This month, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin, published a report entitled, Report of the Small Business Forum.</P>

    <P Just="Left">Last week I asked for the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children to come into the House to address the serious issue of transport services being withdrawn from elderly people attending dialysis and oncology treatment. Unfortunately, in the last week the service has deteriorated even further. One lady from Clifden in Galway has written to me to try to ensure she has transport available. She is 50 miles from the treatment centre, living on her own and on a medical card yet her transport has been withdrawn for hospital appointments. This is causing her serious distress. The chief executive of the Irish Kidney Association was so upset by this situation that he faxed Professor Drumm on 26 April. He only received an acknowledgement of his fax yesterday, three weeks later. This issue must be dealt with so I ask the Leader to ask the T&aacute;naiste to come into the House immediately to address it.</P>

	<P>Would the Leader consider making time available to discuss No. 14 on the Order Paper, the Genealogy and Heraldry Bill 2006 put forward by Senator Ryan? Although the subject matter is not of interest to many people, the Bill is both timely and necessary and I would welcome a debate on it.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Senator Brian Hayes asked that we publicly register our thanks to the garda&iacute;, the dean of St. Patrick&rsquo;s Cathedral and his staff for the way the hunger strikers&rsquo; protest in the cathedral was successfully brought to a conclusion. He also raised the refugee appeals system, calling for greater transparency and asking if the system should remain within the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform or if it should be located elsewhere. I have always felt that the refugee appeals system should be more transparent. The Senator also called for the Minister for Transport to attend a debate on Aer Lingus in this House. We will try to arrange that.</P>
    <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole supported the call for a debate on Aer Lingus, including the service the consumer would get if privatisation took place. He also called for a debate on Iraq without it impinging on our welcome to Prime Minister Howard.</P>
    <P>Senator O&rsquo;Meara asked for debates on Aer Lingus and the events in St. Patrick&rsquo;s Cathedral, particularly with regard to the child care regulations. The Senator regularly asks about those regulations and I am following up on her requests. She also asked about the press council. The Bill will be published this term, although whether it will be debated is another matter.</P>
    <P>Senator Minihan correctly complimented the clear leadership and direction of the Minister during the protest in St. Patrick&rsquo;s Cathedral. If one of the hunger strikers had inflicted serious harm on himself, we would be in a different situation today. We would all be very upset and would be pointing the finger of blame at certain quarters. A clear head was required to deal with the issue and there is no doubt that the required direction and leadership was given.</P>
    <P>The human situation was one with which we all had sympathy because the men were very upset and traumatised. However, we know quite well that if the authorities had given in, there is no <Col N="1407"/>knowing where it would all end. The Senator also praised the 60,000 Irish ambassadors, but I will go no further on that.</P>
    <P>Senator Ulick Burke raised the matter of the intake of students to medical schools. I am also worried about that issue because the leaving certificate, and the points system that emerges from it, has served the country well in terms of determining entry to various disciplines. If we make one particular discipline subject to different criteria, that opens the way for personal intervention by those who may wish to use their influence. The leaving certificate is difficult, although the Minister is working on reducing the length of some of the exams, but it is the best system for guiding entry to different disciplines. Many students work very hard and make a real effort to use the system properly to obtain their points. I will invite the Minister to the House to discuss the matter.</P>
    <P Just="Left">Senator Leyden commended the garda&iacute; and the Garda Commissioner and also referred to Aer Lingus. Senator Norris praised the dean of the St. Patrick&rsquo;s Cathedral but it must be pointed out that Senator Brian Hayes also included him in his commendations. Senator Norris also referred to the Children Bill and the <i>ad litem</i> provision. Did Senator Norris insert that into the Bill?</P>

    <P>Senator Morrissey spoke about the opening of the port tunnel and the effect it will have on the M50, as well as the gridlock he experienced today. He also called for a debate on Aer Lingus. He referred to the former CEO of the company and how effective he was and asked if we wanted to return to the previous model. He asked about the situation of the pensioners now and how it is to be resolved.</P>
    <P>Senator Coghlan spoke about the refugee appeals board. He also called for a debate on the Great Southern Hotels, to address the advertised sale date and how we can best safeguard the land adjoining the hotels. Senator Ormonde spoke about asylum processing. She argued that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform gave direction and leadership. She also expressed concern about the entry criteria for medical schools.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn raised the matter of the Garda reserve. He argued that if one was selling a new product in a shop, one would endeavour to excite the consumers and bring them along with one. In that context, he asked if the reserve should be a pilot arrangement initially, which is an interesting suggestion. He also spoke about the Kyoto Proto<Col N="1408"/>col and carbon emissions and noted that in the United Kingdom, towns were picked out and details supplied of how they were fulfilling their Kyoto Protocol obligations. He asked if the same could be done here.</P>
    <P>Senator Mooney spoke about those who influence share buying and argued that the public should be told about them. He also referred to the undocumented Irish and the US Senate debate on the reformed legislation. He also referred to the New York hurling team and wondered whether they will be able to return to Ireland for the Ulster championship final.</P>

In that context, the Seanad will suspend between 5 p.m. to 6.30 p.m. for those who wish to hear Mr. Howard&rsquo;s address to the D&aacute;il.</P>

However, the Senator&rsquo;s former leader, Mr. Michael Noonan, made a statement and had to withdraw it under legal redress from me. He was forced to do so and I have the correspondence to prove it. If I said a word that upset Senator Bannon, then my goodness, he is very delicate today. He often says words which upset all of us but we put up with it in the interests of the wider democracy. Senator Bannon also called for a debate on Aer Lingus and on Mr. Howard.</P>
    <P>Senator Feighan raised the matter of cancer sufferers. He also did so last week and we endeavoured, on that occasion, to persuade the T&aacute;naiste to come in to discuss the matter. Per<Col N="1409"/>haps we should organise a wider debate on cancer, which could include Senator Feighan&rsquo;s concerns about ambulance services for cancer sufferers. The lady to whom the Senator referred is from Clifden, which is very far from the treatment centre, but her ambulance service has been discontinued. I suggest that Senator Feighan raise the matter on the Adjournment of the House. However, I will invite the T&aacute;naiste to discuss the matter here.</P>
    <P Just="Left">Senator Lydon called for a debate on the Genealogy and Heraldry Bill, as proposed by Senator Ryan. Senator Ryan introduced the Bill in this House last week and I will organise for Second Stage to be held soon.</P>

	<P>Item No. 1 is statements on proposals for supporting lone parents. Party spokespersons have ten minutes and all other Senators have six minutes. I welcome the Minister for Social and Family Affairs to the House.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Seanad for providing me with the opportunity to speak about the proposed reforms to the support arrangements for lone parents and low-income families.</P>
    <P>These proposals are the culmination of a year-long, comprehensive analysis and consultation process on the levels of social exclusion and risk of poverty faced by many lone parents and their children. They have been set out in a major Government discussion paper which was published recently, entitled Proposals for Supporting Lone Parents. The paper was discussed at Cabinet and has been the subject of extensive discussion and debate, both here and abroad since it was published.</P>
    <P>The report puts forward a range of proposals, some complex and others radical, for the reform of restrictive social policies in the area of lone parents and low-income families generally. In essence, the report searches for solutions to the problems confronting lone parents, their children and other families on low incomes day in and day out in areas such as access to employment, education and training, income supports, child care, child maintenance payments, cohabitation rules and grossly unfair stereotyping.</P>
    <P>This analysis of the obstacles to lone parents in achieving a better life for themselves and their children was commissioned by the Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion as part of the Ending Child Poverty initiative under Sustaining Progress. As Members are aware, tackling child poverty is a key objective under Sustaining Progress, the national action plan against poverty and social exclusion and the national children&rsquo;s strategy.</P><Col N="1410"/>
    <P>This is the most comprehensive review on the support arrangements for lone parents for several years. Research has shown that children of lone parents are one of the major groups at risk of poverty. The discussion paper presents a review of the issues facing lone parents; sets out the supports in place and the barriers to achieving economic independence; and seeks to tackle the relatively high risk of poverty and social exclusion faced by many such families and their children. The document also points the way towards solutions, new opportunities, greater fulfilment for lone parents and better lives and prospects for their children.</P>
    <P>There are currently some 80,000 lone parents in the State, with 130,000 children, in receipt of one-parent family payments from my Department. Most are women but there are some men who run one-parent families. The annual cost of that payment is up to almost &euro;800 million, which is a considerable investment by the taxpayer. When other supports and entitlements are taken into account, including child benefit, rent supplement and family income supplement, total expenditure in the area of lone parents comes to &euro;1.3 billion this year. That is considerable investment coming from taxpayers.</P>
    <P>As we are aware, there has been unprecedented growth in the Irish economy over the past decade. In recent years spending on social welfare entitlements has seen a doubling of investment in supports. The spending is now &euro;14 billion this year. That has doubled in approximately six or seven years. Despite that spending and the enormous increase, the fact remains that lone parents continue to be one of the groups who are particularly vulnerable to poverty, and especially child poverty, which does not have any place in 21st century Ireland.</P>
    <P>I state clearly that the reforms being progressed are not about achieving savings for the Exchequer. In fact, the reforms, if introduced, would require increased funding in the short and medium term before better policy bringing in savings in the long term. The reforms are about introducing more enlightened social policies that directly target and benefit the lives of tens of thousands of people, especially children, who are for the most part caught in restrictive poverty traps.</P>
    <P>I have said it before and I repeat it in the Seanad this afternoon. I consider lone parents to be a valuable resource for this country. They are not a problem; they are a resource. Behind the statistics are very real lives, people with day-to-day pressures, lives given to providing the best for their children and lives searching for greater fulfilment. Lone parents have the added responsibility of providing care for their children, as well as often being the only breadwinner.</P>
    <P>Up to 60% of lone parents are working, but as Members are aware, most of that work is for low pay and generally does not have any major career enhancing prospects. We have a responsibility, <Col N="1411"/>therefore, to use the income support system and wider welfare supports to address the problems behind those income needs. We also have a responsibility to confront the social issues and pressures that blunt fulfilment and curb aspirations.</P>
    <P Just="Left">All the research shows that movement into employment is the best route out of poverty and it is a transition that can transform people&rsquo;s lives, but that transition is not always smooth. Obstacles can emerge along the way. The reforms I am working towards are to tackle those obstacles and replace them with incentives and activation measures designed to meet people&rsquo;s needs and abilities. These reforms are about making every possible effort to ensure that no individual&rsquo;s talents or contributions are overlooked or neglected, whoever he or she is in society or from wherever he or she comes. Whether people want to work, upskill through training, return to education or wish to remain at home, there must be a system that provides an income that is adequate and child care support, which is critical but allows for flexibility.</P>
    <P>The reforms recommended make clear the need to recognise parental choice when it comes to the care of young children, while at the same time expecting that parents will not remain out of employment indefinitely. The reforms are also about ending the cohabitation rule, which does not have any part to play in the 21st century. It is a rule that says the parents of a child or children cannot live together as a family, free from the current restrictive arrangement that has State inspectors checking on them. That is dreadful social policy for any state to pursue at this time in our history.</P>
    <P>Reforms must also be about re-examining our attitudes to some fathers and their role in the family, and issues such as easier access to their children. Reforms must also examine better and more direct ways of ensuring that fathers contribute through maintenance child support payments to the raising of their children. Members may have seen some statistics in that regard recently which indicate that this simply cannot go on. It is not acceptable that a large number of fathers are either not required to make a contribution or are not making a contribution. The figures, if one looks at them closely, are alarming in that regard.</P>
    <P>Overall, the conclusion of the Government report is that while income support remains crucial and must be adequate to meet needs, passive income support alone is not sufficient. It is certainly not sufficient if poverty, particularly child poverty, and social exclusion are to be comprehensively addressed and people are to have financial independence and reach their potential.</P>
    <P Just="Left">I have said previously in this House that the supports provided to lone parents to date, while substantial as regards Exchequer funding, have been largely passive in nature. There has been no active or systematic support in assisting the per<Col N="1412"/>son to take up education, training or employment opportunities. We must reverse that. In addition, the education level achieved by many lone parents is well below the rest of the population generally. That is all the more reason to ensure we get them back to education, training and employment as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The reality is that a person currently in receipt of a one-parent family payment can continue to have that payment paid until the child is 18, or 22 if in full-time education, with no direct intervention by the State. No one picks up the phone to see if we can help him or her back to education, training or employment and that is the case from the time the child is born until the age of 22. It is not fair to lone parents to leave them stranded in that way. None of us here today consider that this long-term welfare dependency is in the best interests of the lone parent, their children or society in general.</P>
    <P>The proposals that have emerged from the report are for reforms that are significant and, in some cases, radical. They propose the expanded availability and range of education and training opportunities for lone parents, the extension of the national employment action plan to focus on lone parents, focused provision of child care, improved information services for lone parents and the introduction of a new parental allowance instead of the lone parent&rsquo;s allowance for low-income families with young children. That is all low-income families, not just lone parents who will be included in it.</P>
    <P>I am proposing the introduction of a new support structure for lone parents and all parents on low income. This new means tested payment, which I am calling the parental allowance, will be paid to any parent whether married, cohabiting or single, who has a child. As I have already stated and as is accepted generally, the best route out of poverty and social exclusion is through employment. That is the reason I am introducing an element of positive activation into my proposals. For example, when their youngest child is aged five, recipients of the parental allowance will engage with a facilitator who will provide information, support and advice on the various options available in further education, training or employment. Such intervention does not take place at present and most lone parents are stranded and left to their own devices in this regard. These supports are designed to ensure that by the time the parental allowance ceases recipients will be in a position to achieve financial independence. Although the report suggests the supports should cease when the child is aged eight, I have an open mind on it.</P>
    <P>It is important to note that the activation expectation is positive and not simply focused on moving people into employment or harassing them into low paid jobs. I am not interested in that. I am interested in helping people to achieve satisfying employment of their choice through education and training, and to help, advise and <Col N="1413"/>support them through that process, rather than abandon them as the present system does. The aim is to facilitate, support and encourage people to gain the skills to enable them to achieve financial independence. While conditions must be placed on receipt of payment, supports are offered in a structured and systematic manner to the persons concerned.</P>
    <P>The Government asked the senior officials group to draw up an implementation plan to progress the non-income aspects of the proposals including those related to child care which, I have been told so often in the House, including by Senators present today, is at the centre of this issue. Education, training and activation measures are also included and work on this issue is already under way.</P>
    <P>The proposals have already been the subject of some debate. I recently called together a public consultation forum, which met in Farmleigh, with representatives from lone parent organisations, the unemployed and State agencies. We held an excellent meeting with all of the groups and had an excellent discussion on the proposals we are discussing here today. I was also pleased to invite members of the Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs, some of whom were able to attend. At this public forum, I heard first-hand the views of the groups, their concerns for the proposals and, most important, their wish to work with the Government to advance the proposals further.</P>
    <P Just="Left">I should also acknowledge the open-minded nature of the Opposition. It has taken a constructive role in studying the proposals and seeking to help us achieve a better position while, as I fully understand, reserving its right to oppose aspects of it or even the legislation in its entirety if it wishes. One cannot make these types of reforms in the face of serious opposition stirred up on the ground and fears being fanned. We know the fate of reforms when that happens. I am pleased that we have reached this stage. We have had at least 12 months of intensive discussions on these reforms with a fair amount of constructive debate and discussion.</P>
    <P Just="Left">I want to stress that I have an open mind on how we will bring this to a conclusion, and what the final shape of legislation will be. I would welcome the honest and considered views of Senators on the proposals. They amount to new social policy, and include a new parental allowance, new conditions for receipt of payments, ending cohabitation rules, which is not necessary in my view, and improving maintenance payment methods. They place major focus on supporting low-income families because they are low-income families and not because they happen to be a lone parent or another type of family unit. That is the test, not the category in which they fall. With one child in every three now born to a single parent, it is not sensible to categorise people. It is better that we focus on low-income families and not establish categories in an almost judgmental <Col N="1414"/>mode, as we tended to do in the past, although perhaps with good reason.</P>
    <P Just="Left">I look forward to a good discussion. I was pleased to introduce in the 2006 budget some changes to start on the road. We increased the upper earnings limit for the one-parent family payment to &euro;375 a week, increased welfare rates and substantially improved the family income supplement. We recently ran a television campaign to encourage more people to take it up. I am pleased to tell the House, which asked me to do this, that as a result of the television campaign, we had a substantial increase in the number of families applying for the family income supplement.</P>
    <P>We already started this process and I hope this is the next stage. Child poverty is most prevalent in lone parenthood. No one in this House or in the country would regard child poverty in the 21st century as being in any way acceptable in modern Ireland. These reforms are essential. I have an open mind on the details. I am prepared to engage with the Opposition on how we will finally mould them.</P>
    <P>I trust the reforms will not become a political issue. I do not intend to make them one because they affect the lives of so many people. Approximately 80,000 families depend on us making these improvements. It is critical that we make them properly and sensibly and that we get them through. They should not fall foul of a lack of constructive discussion, of which I know we will have a great deal. I thank the Cathaoirleach for giving me a hearing. I look forward to a good discussion.</P>
    <P>I welcome the visitors from Galway in the Visitors Gallery. It is not the Minister&rsquo;s duty to do so, it is the Cathaoirleach&rsquo;s, but as a Galway man I cannot miss the opportunity.</P>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House. I also welcome the discussion paper and the opportunity to address a number of the proposals it contains. The report is comprehensive on the welfare of lone parents and presents a review of the issues they face. As the Minister stated, research has identified the children of lone parents as one of the groups at major risk of child poverty.</P>
    <P>It is essential that we review our social policies on the issue of lone parents, so they more accurately reflect our society today. We urgently need to find better and more up-to-date ways of tackling child poverty and removing barriers to training, education and employment for lone parents. Our social policies have made many people dependent on long-term welfare. Such dependence has ideologically been perceived by many theorists as a weakness of the welfare system, which often eliminates self reliance and initiative. Welfare provision has influenced living arrange<Col N="1415"/>ments, increased dependency and kept people within the poverty trap.</P>
    <P Just="Left">Charles Murray&rsquo;s verdict on anti-poverty policy in the United States is a classic statement on the ineffectiveness of some welfare state policies. In <i>Losing Ground</i> published in 1984 he wrote:</P>
    <P LI="1">We tried to provide more for the poor and produced more poor instead. We tried to remove the barriers to escape from poverty and inadvertently built a trap.</P>
    <P FLI="0" Just="Left">We are constantly told that the best route out of poverty is through employment. However, 60% of lone parents work in low-paid jobs and 15% are on incomes so low as to put them at risk of poverty. I believe the best route out of poverty is through education. Today, children leave primary school unable to read or write. More than 1,000 children do not even make the transition from primary to secondary school. Approximately 12% of those aged between 18 and 24 years left school early. We have an epidemic of young people with drug and drink addictions. These young people may be parents in the next ten years and the cycle will start all over again. Early Start programmes have not been expanded in more than ten years. The National Educational Welfare Board continues to be underfunded. That is where the commitment to tackle poverty should be.</P>
   <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
    <P>Accessing education, training or employment has not been possible for many lone parents for a number of reasons. The most common reasons given include difficulty in finding affordable and accessible child care. The Minister has mentioned that this has been spoken of on many occasions in this House. Other reasons include lack of flexible or part-time working conditions. For example, most F&Aacute;S-run courses begin at 8.30 a.m., too early for lone parents. Another difficulty for lone parents is access to transport and time spent in commuting.</P>
    <P>Putting the support services in place is the challenge for the Government and the Minister. It is also the challenge for employers and other agencies. What is needed is a co-ordination of services and the provision of resources to make that happen. I agree with the Minister in that this cannot happen overnight, and it may require a five or ten-year timeframe to put an effective implementation plan in place. We need creative thinking and I accept that not all families are the same. One size will not fit all in this area.</P>
    <P>Lone parents include widows, separated and divorced people and teens living in urban and rural areas. Fathers made up 2% to 3% of lone parents in 2004. According to a policy document, Equality for All Families, to be published by the Irish Council for Civil Liberties today, unmarried couples, same-sex couples, lone parents and children experience serious inequalities and major difficulties because of the State&rsquo;s failure to recognise their relationships and families. It contends <Col N="1416"/>that the privileged position of the married family in the Constitution should be ended to prevent discrimination against unmarried couples and children. It is also calling for the removal of the ban on same-sex marriage and support for the introduction of a new optional partnership registration system for all couples.</P>
    <P>In order to fulfil Ireland&rsquo;s obligations under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, the ICCL report also calls for the guarantee of children&rsquo;s rights and a gender-neutral provision which would recognise the work of carers in the home to replace the current outdated reference to women&rsquo;s &ldquo;domestic duties&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I want to express my concern about removing the right to stay at home after the youngest child in a family reaches eight years of age. Essentially, choice is being removed from poorer families. Having a stay-at-home parent will become the preserve of the well-off. Are we going to create a two-tier society? I have to question whether it is constitutional to compel parents to work. Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann places a woman firmly in the home but gives special recognition to her role.</P>
    <P>Updating to current policy, a woman can be prevented from taking up employment, participating in education or training or becoming politically involved because of the prevailing social policy which results in a lack of affordable, freely available child care. However, a new model is that women are now obliged to work, like their male counterparts, as citizen workers rather than citizen carers or mothers. We must be very careful in how we deal with this.</P>
    <P>We must support parents by providing family-friendly work arrangements and good quality affordable child care facilities, including after-school care, elderly care, more training places and a decent joined up public transport system. The OECD noted in 2003 that the employment rates of lone parents in Ireland are low despite ten years of unprecedented employment growth. It made certain recommendations to encourage greater participation in the workforce. One of those recommendations was for the development of a system of mutual obligations between State and lone parents. Forcing parents out to work without the supporting infrastructure is not quite in keeping with the spirit of that recommendation.</P>
    <P>The elimination of the cohabitation rule is to be welcomed. This was a degrading rule and actively discouraged family formations. Joint parenting must be supported. I welcome the recognition of the right of each individual to receive his or her social welfare entitlement independently, and the financial independence that this can provide. In effect, this will do away with the present qualified adult system, which is inequitable and discriminates against women. We see no reason that this could not be implemented in early course or immediately.</P>
    <P>A number of organisations have expressed concerns about the practical implications of the pro<Col N="1417"/>posed social welfare reforms. For example, the withdrawal of the parental allowance could create serious poverty traps unless significant reform of other elements of the social welfare and tax systems is implemented. These poverty traps are primarily the result of the re-application of the limitation rule when the parental allowance finishes and more stringent means assessment, which applies to unemployment payments.</P>
    <P>Unless there is a comprehensive interdepartmental and interagency approach, properly planned and resourced, we will not succeed in combating the poverty being experienced by lone parents and their children. I do not have much confidence in this Government delivering the appropriate supports for parents in the coming years.</P>
    <P>The 2001 NESF report on lone parents developed a series of recommendations on how training, education and employment programmes could be made more accessible to lone parents, focusing particularly on the courses and programmes that achieve high rates of progression into better-quality jobs. These offer opportunities for career development. Five years later, lone parents are still waiting for these recommendations to be acted upon. Furthermore, the research strand of the equality for women measure has described the challenges faced by working parents and the negative implications for the women involved and it has identified recommendations to address the issue. Most of these have not been implemented.</P>
    <P>I welcome the public debate on these proposals and I hope it will compel action. Many of the proposals are not new and should be implemented immediately to create a positive impact on the lives of lone parents. We have no intention of making a political football of discussing these reforms. We will be involved in constructive debate at all times in this issue. We hope to see more action, rather than policies, at this stage.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MargaretCox"><NameTxt>Ms Cox</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister to the House, and I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on this issue. I congratulate the Minister on addressing the matter. It can be sensitive at times, and no matter what is said, comments can sometimes be interpreted the wrong way. The way the Minister has acted &mdash; with an open, transparent, involved and inclusive method &mdash; has created the type of environment which is allowing us to discuss the issues which cause challenges and difficulties on a daily basis to those families with lone parents. It has been said that the majority of lone parents are mothers but many are fathers. What matters is that a person is a lone parent, rather than whether they are the mother or the father.</P>
    <P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s recent undertaking to address the issue of responsibility. Every child born in this country has two parents, because it takes two people to make a child. If we continue to allow fathers to ignore their responsibility we fail the children of this State. We should do what<Col N="1418"/>ever is necessary to ensure people face up to their responsibilities and fathers, in particular, must be forced to pay adequate attention to their children, as well as provide financial maintenance. It is not acceptable for fathers to say children are not their problem. An education programme should be provided in schools, aimed particularly at young men but also at young women. Young men at an age when they are able to father a child must be told they cannot do so without taking at least some responsibility for bringing it up because it is not exclusively the responsibility of the State. It is not just a question of money but support and recognition. Every child is entitled to have two parents so he or she does not grow up feeling different from other children, whose mother and father live together. There should continue to be a focus on parental responsibility, in particular that of the father.</P>
    <P>One of the key elements of this report stresses the need to reduce poverty. It asks what we can do for lone parents to help them escape the poverty trap. Some 60% of lone parents work, and I will focus on them. The problem is that they are often in low-paid employment. How can they afford to pay for child care? How do they afford transport to and from work? They are continually struggling to escape the poverty trap. All of us who have children know how difficult it can be to work while rearing them but it is even more difficult without the necessary resources to pay for child care and other supports in the home, such as those that release a mother from homemaker duties. We must enable the 60% of lone parents who work to progress from low-paid to better-paid employment. We must ask what supports we should give employers and parents themselves in the form of training grants. The CDP programme administered by F&Aacute;S, which develops the skills of people in certain sectors, could be rolled out to lone parents not covered by the scheme at the moment. A dedicated grant should be available to them to enable them to graduate from jobs paying no more than &euro;10 per hour to those paying up to &euro;20 per hour. That would mean they would be paid enough to make it worth getting up in the morning and would be rewarded for the effort they put in. It is difficult enough when there are two parents, with one doing the school run in the morning and the other in the afternoon, but it is very difficult alone. I call for focused, specifically directed schemes for the education of lone parents in low-paid employment.</P>
    <P>We must ask why 40% of lone parents do not work. In the run-up to the last election I held a forum every month with different groups of people. Two groups stick in my mind, namely, widows and lone parents. At one meeting I asked a group of 15 young girls what they most wanted to do. Most of all they wanted to get out of the house, to be able to leave their children at a cr&egrave;che or somewhere they knew they would be looked after, and go to work. They wanted to finish at 1 p.m. and maybe collect the child from the <Col N="1419"/>cr&egrave;che or from school. They wanted to make a contribution rather than remain hangers-on, which is the stereotype that attaches to them.</P>
    <P>People still ask lone parents why they did not know better than to get themselves into such a situation. Why did they not use contraception, given that it is available in chemists, pubs and vending machines? The girl is always blamed in these cases. Whether they became lone parents by choice or by accident, they are entitled to live their lives with dignity, instead of being subjected to a vicious cycle of poverty, deprivation and an absence of role models. What do children who grow up in houses without a working parent learn? What kind of a role model or mentor does that create? Our challenge is to bring about a joined-up policy of education, training and child care.</P>
    <P Just="Left">The Minister increased the amount a lone parent could earn and still qualify for the one-parent family payment to &euro;375 per week. Does he realise that as soon as a person earns more than &euro;60 per week, his or her rent allowance is reduced? It is ridiculous for the Minister to allow a person to earn up to &euro;375 but to reduce rent allowance once &euro;60 is exceeded. All parents want is a roof over their head and food on the table for their children. Worries over a temporary job not lasting or the loss of rent allowance, necessitating a visit to the Department of Social and Family Affairs, are barriers for people who are already at a disadvantage. They fight the same battles families with two parents fight every day and then have to fight more battles to earn the right to go out to work.</P>
    <P>We could put in place simple measures to make a huge difference to the lives of lone parents. It is all very well to make child care available and there are many community cr&egrave;ches. The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is very focused on the issue. However, community cr&egrave;ches close at 6 p.m. so a person cannot pursue a night course or even go out one night a week. Everyone is entitled to some social life but where can these people get a babysitter? We could put in place supporting networks, where one parent supported another, or a scheme involving transition year students, creating a support network enabling people to lead normal lives. If lone parents can attend an evening class they are happier, more fulfilled and better parents as a consequence. By helping people progress from poverty into a situation where they can provide for themselves and their children and be mentors and role models for them, we will alleviate the problems of lone parenthood and create happy family homes. Thus will we avoid the creation of ghettoes in the future.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that social reform was part of his vision but social reform starts at a basic level. It does not start with big, eye-catching measures but with education, training and development and better work opportunities. It <Col N="1420"/>requires support for employers to encourage them to employ lone parents, the adoption of flexible working hours and grants and schemes encouraging people to hire lone parents. We are not afraid of addressing other groups in society so should not be afraid of addressing lone parents. If we are to provide a parental allowance and engage with children aged seven, eight or 12 years, we must establish support structures. As Senator Cummins noted, one size does not fit all and, therefore, we must not rely on a single support structure.</P>
    <P>Sex education and promoting the message among young people that bringing a child into the world, particularly as a lone parent, is hard work should be the responsibility of the Department of Social and Family Affairs. In addition to making life better for those who have children, we should encourage young people not to engage in sex until they are ready to do so and have started out on life. Young girls aged 16, 17 or 18 years should be advised to avoid circumstances in which they are left carrying the baby while some young fellow is running around the streets and discos getting as drunk as he likes and taking no responsibility. Addressing this problem must be a joint effort on the part of the education and social welfare systems.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to have been afforded this opportunity to speak on this issue and welcome the Minister&rsquo;s decision to examine it with a view to introducing radical, meaningful changes. I extend my best wishes to him in his work.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House and the publication by his Department of an interdepartmental group study. I particularly welcome his speech as I never believed I would ever hear a Minister state that he considers &ldquo;lone parents a valuable resource&rdquo; for the country. He must have had in mind the trouble poor President Putin is having persuading the Russian population to have children. Perhaps the Minister should send him a copy of his speech.</P>
    <P>I have been involved with Cherish, an organisation set up about 30 years ago by single mothers for single mothers, since it was founded. Now known as One Family, it focuses on the problems experienced by lone parents. I will definitely bring a copy of the Minister&rsquo;s speech to a reunion for the founders of the organisation which will be held early next month because some of them will be astonished by its contents.</P>
    <P>The report contains much useful information. All of us want lone parents to participate more in the life of the country and we must try to remove hurdles preventing them from doing so. Senator Cox, for example, expressed the hope that it would be possible to organise networks to enable lone parents to get a night out. This would be an important step because we know that what is best for the lone parent is also best for the child.</P>
    <P>This is a useful report. Given that one must not consider a group of 80,000 people a homogenous <Col N="1421"/>group, I was pleased to read on page 78 the suggestion that individualisation of the social welfare system is important. We should first address the problems faced by a small group of lone parents, namely, men and older women, many of whom are widowed or divorced. Some men I know who are in receipt of lone parent&rsquo;s allowance left the workforce because they believed the trauma suffered by their children at the time of the death or departure of their mother was so serious that their best option was to stay at home and prioritise the needs of the family. This is the reason I am slightly concerned about proposals to introduce arbitrary age thresholds for youngest children. I hope a flexible approach will be taken to this matter because those who decide to stay at home may have good reason to do so. We do not know the circumstances of the family disturbance in individual cases. The social welfare service, which is earning much more praise than it used to for its approach to individuals, should determine the reason people who may have had good jobs decide to stay at home. It is important that this small group of lone parents be considered first.</P>
    <P>Teenage lone parents make up a separate, relatively small group. Despite the stereotype of lone parents as being 15 year old girls who are pregnant for the second or third time, the number of teenage lone parents is small and is declining. Five years ago, teenagers gave birth to approximately 3,000 children, a figure that has fallen to approximately 2,500.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>Births to teenagers make up 3% of the total.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, the figure is small. It is important not to underestimate, however, that perinatal statistics indicate that this group encounters particular difficulties from the maternity point of view. The teen parent support programme which presented its report yesterday stressed the importance of keeping teenagers in education during pregnancy and while the baby is at a young age. Supports for this group are vital because not all of them have supportive families and they face additional problems if they drop out of education. I was taken by the phrase used by a speaker yesterday that there is a strong correlation between early exit from education and teenage pregnancy and one should note the importance of cause and consequence. If teenage girls fall out of education, they are more likely to become pregnant and if they become pregnant they are more likely to fall out of education. Measures must be taken to address the needs of this group because failure to do so could create a lifetime of problems for many young teenagers. I urge, therefore, that this group be dealt with separately.</P>
    <P>On the proposal to provide facilitators when the youngest child of a lone parent is five years old, why must a person who wants help wait until <Col N="1422"/>his or her child is five years old? The Minister is correct to state that active supports are more important than passive supports. While considerable sums of money are being spent on lone parents, active supports are required because a large number of the lone parents I have met are demoralised. For example, as Senator Cox noted, a lone parent may not be able to go out or may not have a friend to go out with or someone to give them support. With extended families not as geographically close to each other as in the past, a lone parent may have few family supports nearby and it is important, therefore, that active supports are provided to address this problem.</P>
    <P>The Minister correctly pointed out that 60% of lone parents are in employment. While this is good, it is not so good that most of them are in low-paid jobs. Neither long-term dependency on benefits nor long-term low-paid employment is in the interests of either parents or children. Given that lone parents at work have already managed to get themselves into a position in which they get up in the morning, bring their children to cr&egrave;che or school and go out to do a job, it would be easier to deal with them than the 40% of lone parents who are not in employment.</P>
    <P>While I have not found many lone parents who are bone idle, I have found that many of those without work have additional problems. For example, a lone parent may be providing care for a disabled parent or grandparent. Frequently, grandmothers aged in their 40s or 50s go to work, while their children try to care for older people at home. This can be demoralising for the younger person who may wish to work outside the home. Illness, including mental illness and depression, are also important factors. Life is difficult enough &mdash; 25% of the population suffer from depression at some point in their lives &mdash; without additional problems such as an absent father who does not provide support. When one is left, as Senator Cox stated, holding the baby it is not surprising that exogenous depression sometimes occurs. We must examine the reasons 40% of lone parents are not in paid employment. Lack of child care, an issue ably addressed by Senators Cummins and Cox, is an important factor in this regard because it is impossible to work outside the home if one&rsquo;s child is not cared for adequately.</P>
    <P>A further factor which militates against lone parents entering the workforce is the prospect of losing one&rsquo;s medical card. The Minister must ensure that the implementing Departments, notably the Departments of Health and Children and Education and Science, come on board when he introduces new measures. The prospect of losing one&rsquo;s medical card is even more terrifying than the prospect of losing rent allowance. With 60% of lone parents having only one child and 25% having two children, addressing this problem will clearly not be an insurmountable task.</P>
    <P>We need to get the child care strategy involved. In particular, care for school children must be addressed because it is very poor. Given that the <Col N="1423"/>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is about to introduce ASBOs, we do not want children returning to an empty house thus becoming another group in danger of receiving anti-social behaviour orders because there is no one there to keep them indoors when things are getting a bit riotous outside. Therefore, the child care issue must be addressed, including school-age child care which is in probably the worst situation. School activities are becoming more organised, including homework clubs which are starting up in school premises and community centres. Support for such activities is most important.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister has tackled the issue of cohabitation which was a terrible waste of inspectors&rsquo; time. They were running around the countryside looking in front windows while the man was running out the back. It was a pretty hopeless situation. It is much better if one can have both parents trying to bring up the child, rather than one parent doing so alone.</P>
    <P>The situation regarding child maintenance support is a difficult one with approximately 2% of fathers paying up, which is shockingly low. Unfortunately, this is also the problem internationally. In the United Kingdom, they ended up spending more money trying to enforce such payments than was received in support. I do not know how one makes people take on their responsibilities, which they should do, but it is an international problem and not restricted to Ireland.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on bringing forward these proposals. The implementing Departments need to come on board as quickly as possible. The phrase &ldquo;individualisation of the recipients of social welfare&rdquo; is important because they are not all the same kind of people and do not all have the same problems. If we separate them out we will find it much easier to implement the report than if it is done on a one size suits all basis, which I am sure will not happen.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House and congratulate him on his impressive proposals. Up to now I had little knowledge of how the social welfare system worked in this regard. Lately, however, I am beginning to have an interest in it. As the Minister said, he is trying to bring the system into the 21st century by modernising it and seeing how best we can deal with the obstacles currently facing lone parents. It is difficult to grasp the various incomes coming into lone-parent households. They include the lone-parent allowance, child benefit, rent supplement and family income. All that money comes to approximately &euro;1.35 billion. It is a huge amount which appears to be given out without any backup as to how it should be handled by lone parents.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s idea that we need to undertake a brain-storming exercise. We will have a consultative forum which will reflect all interested viewpoints. That process must include <Col N="1424"/>the Department of Education and Science, local authorities, the Department of Social and Family Affairs, and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, which deals with F&Aacute;S. That combination of people can brainstorm to find how best we can examine the restrictive measures in place that prevent such people from accessing employment, education or training.</P>
    <P>The Minister&rsquo;s proposals are to be welcomed and if he goes about it that way he will ultimately have a success story. The Department of the Taoiseach has taken this matter on board together with the Minister and further discussions will be held at the Cabinet table. If the Minister continues to approach the matter in this way, he will prompt another constructive debate when the proposals return to this House. We must examine how we can bring forward programmes and ideas to help those who perhaps cannot help themselves, although many lone parents are trying to do so.</P>
    <P>I dealt with many of these issues in my professional environment. Some young people had no idea how to behave in the real world. They thought that becoming pregnant was the way forward and would give them an interest in life. They knew they would get money and that it would be enough to keep them going but those attitudes have to change in the 21st century.</P>
    <P Just="Left">We must examine how best our schools can progress. Primary schoolteachers are a great guide to what is going on in their community. They know who are the lone parents and other vulnerable people. I am not asking teachers to become social workers but they can become involved through school-home links and the start-up programme. Such liaison can get to the root of social problems. Lone parents have low self esteem and lack confidence so it is important for the community to work together on such matters. The correct social infrastructure and networking can improve things in this regard. Schools have a role to play and their input would be welcome but they cannot do it alone; they require the backup of social workers in the community.</P>
    <P>Senator Cox said that if lone parents re-enter the workforce they may lose their rent supplement allowance. We need to involve local authorities in this area, particularly regarding housing schemes and how best they can accommodate people to help them over such hurdles. I would like to see that area being the subject of a brain-storming exercise.</P>
    <P Just="Left">The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment deals with education, training and back to work programmes. What is the best way to get such people back to work without them losing their income to date? There is always that fear. Although I am not clear on this issue, I note that when children reach a certain age their parents may lose the allowance.</P>

   </Speaker><Col N="1425"/>
   <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">We need to change all that woolly thinking. We should clarify exactly what we mean by that. Children are one thing but luring parents back to the workplace is another issue. They need confidence but they lack the required self esteem to re-enter the working community. They want to make a contribution, so good back to work programmes should be introduced to make it easy for them. The only way night courses can be encouraged, for example, is by providing child care facilities.</P>
    <P Just="Left">I would like to be at the forefront of that brain-storming exercise from which many good ideas can emerge to bring the social welfare system into the 21st century. We need real ideas to lure vulnerable young people caught in the poverty trap, including lone parents, back to work. We will get them back with no bother if we go about it in the manner planned by the Minister. Interested groups in the community must be involved, however, so that nobody will misunderstand the Minister&rsquo;s radical reforms.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share my time with Senator Tuffy.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>Is that agreed? Agreed.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>
	<P>I also welcome the Minister to the House. I welcome in particular his commitment to reform this area, which is certainly needed, together with his initiative in bringing forward proposals and engaging in a wide-ranging discussion about them. Today&rsquo;s debate is useful in that regard. Much of what I wanted to say has already been discussed so, given that my time is limited, I will touch upon one or two specific points. One such point relates to the proposals contained in the document, which is designed to support lone parents. I do not accept that making it compulsory is necessarily to support the lone parent. In fact, I was astonished that there would be a level of compulsory engagement with the system for the lone parent. I do not believe that would work because the system must be voluntary. It is suggested that when the youngest child is five, the lone parent engages with the system. At present there are people who would want to get their child into education and training long before he or she is five and perhaps when the child is one or two, but that is not happening.</P>
    <P Just="Left">I ask the Minister to seriously reconsider this matter because the other result of making it compulsory is to effectively stigmatise lone parents and feed into this stereotype that they are somehow feeding off the State and do not want to work and, therefore, must be made to work or enter training. There needs to be encouragement to enter training. Many Members receive visits to our clinics from lone parents on housing or other issues. While the children may be four, five or six years old now, I always ask young mothers what they will do in ten or 15 years when they are still <Col N="1426"/>young and the children are grown. I ask them to think about being in education or in a well-paid job.</P>
    <P>The Minister should ensure there is no sense of compulsion around this issue. It must be voluntary and done in an empowering way. I support the notion of facilitators encouraging people to be in the system. One of the difficulties faced by lone parents is that being out of education, training or a job for a number of years leads to an undermining of confidence in themselves and their ability to be at work, as we know from the experience of the long-term unemployed. Support is needed but not a one-size-fits-all approach. Creating a compulsory system is not the way forward and would send the wrong message.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s proposal on cohabitation, as have others. The cohabitation rule has created a situation where fathers and male role models are simply not present in households, which is not good for children. It also has the crazy effect of discouraging women from being in solid relationships which would be good for them and would, particularly in the long term, support them. I support the Minister&rsquo;s initiative.</P>
    <P>Members referred to child care, which is critical for lone parents. In supporting them to be in training, education or work, it is vital that accessible and affordable child care is available. In many cases community-based child care facilities must charge high fees to lone parents due to the underfunding by the Government, so there must be targeted initiatives designed specifically to support lone parents.</P>
    <P>Overall, I welcome the proposals. Reform is necessary and I support the Minister&rsquo;s approach, although I ask him to reconsider the compulsory nature of the framework.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to refer to Senator Cummins&rsquo;s point on the proposal by the Irish Council for Civil Liberties. I am a member of the All-Party Committee on the Constitution, the majority report of which proposed that the protection of women in the home would be extended to parents. I support the idea that it should also be extended to carers. The Women in the Home group, when it addressed the committee during the hearings, was also supportive of the idea and proposed a wording in that regard. It was of the belief that the existing protection was there to stay but that it would be a good idea to extend it.</P>
    <P>I draw attention to two current campaigns, one by the group Treoir and the other by the Teen Parents Support Programme, which was reported in <i>The Irish Times </i>today. National co-ordinator Margaret Morris is reported as stating &ldquo;it is in the best interest of children to be in touch with both parents&rdquo;, which ties in with the campaign by Treoir, which has a similar belief. That is an important issue with regard to the rights of the child. I firmly believe that, where at all possible, we should support the idea of both parents having <Col N="1427"/>contact with their children. The report in <i>The Irish Times</i> today noted that only 51% of fathers are in contact with the mother of their child.</P>
    <P>The Minister commissioned a report, Strengthening Families Through Fathers, by Fergus Hogan of the Waterford Institute of Technology. The report found that in many respects fathers are excluded, often on the basis of their appearance, by child care and family support workers. It particularly singled out younger marginalised men who became fathers as being most at risk and yet the most invisible category. The report stated:</P>
    <P LI="1">At its worst, the underlying assumption seems to be that families are better off without such fathers because they are invariably irresponsible and uninterested...marginalised men are officially written out of the script of family life.</P>
    <P FLI="0">The report made a number of recommendations, which I support, on the need to include fathers in our culture and the way they are dealt with through the social welfare system.</P>
    <P>Senator Cox referred to the need for fathers to take up their responsibilities yet we do not give them their rights and they are discriminated against within our legal system. Some 30% of births are to unmarried parents but most of the fathers will not have guardianship rights to their children. Other legal codes, such as that in Scotland, refer to rights and responsibilities. We must do more in this regard because our legal system is pushing fathers away. We need to extend guardianship rights to unmarried fathers, a measure that is being considered in other jurisdictions. Even the North of Ireland has extended guardianship rights for fathers much further than we have.</P>
    <P>The system is pushing fathers away and does not value them as part of the child&rsquo;s family life. One way to change this is to change our laws and systems. The report commissioned by the Minister focused on changing the social welfare system, social work system and family support system to include fathers. We also need to change our laws. I called for this last week in the Seanad and I emphasise that it needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency. If the law was challenged in the courts, it might be found to be discriminatory and in need of change.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnMinihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Minihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister and thank him for his address to the House. It is noteworthy that many of today&rsquo;s policy debates correctly place the emphasis on the target or beneficiary of the policy. Child-centred child care policies or patient-centred health care policies are two of the obvious examples. This debate focuses on the proposals for supporting lone parents. The real focus is the child and what is for the best. I welcome the fact that we have been careful not to engage in stereotyping because it would not serve <Col N="1428"/>us well. There may be a tendency to use the phrase &ldquo;lone parent&rdquo; and automatically picture somebody in a distressed state. We have to acknowledge there are many lone parents and single parents who are in happy family-type units and are working well and provide a good family structure.</P>
    <P>In 1987 one in four children experienced the type of poverty referred to in previous reports. That the position has improved needs to be acknowledged. In 2001, according to the living in Ireland survey, one in 15 children were living in households considered to be consistently poor. Of course, one is one too many. We need to remain vigilant in working towards reducing the numbers.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister and the Government on its previous initiatives and on the new initiative proposed by the Minister. He has pointed out that lone parents and their children are at particular risk of social exclusion and poverty which are closely linked. It is essential that organisations representing lone parents and anti-poverty groups, national children&rsquo;s support organisations, men&rsquo;s support groups and family support groups, are not excluded from the discussions on the Government&rsquo;s discussion paper &mdash; Proposals for Supporting Lone Parents &mdash; which the Minister brought forward in March.</P>
    <P>The convening of the national consultative forum is an important and welcome step in this regard as are today&rsquo;s statements. The interests of the child must be at the heart of our discussions. They are at the heart of the proposals for legislation made by the Government, including the targeting of child poverty, delivering new opportunities and raising the standard of living for lone parents and all low-income families. Poverty creates distress, particularly for children. That is the reason the Government is working hard to tackle this problem.</P>
    <P>Previous speakers referred to the fear factor experienced by lone parents. The key to removing fear is the reform of the cohabitation rules. For many reasons, which are not instantly obvious, the parents of a child or children should be able to live together as a family. In the study to which I have referred, people surveyed were found to be living in fear. One element of fear that can be removed is that of the inspector knocking on the door. I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s leadership in this regard and the fact that he is committed to examining and changing the position.</P>
    <P>The Minister also proposes to assess the resources available to the family and the child rather than mechanically paying lone parents allowance. He is committed to assessing income levels and where the levels are low, to use the current high levels of income support to target improvements, and use wider welfare supports to tackle the problem behind the income need.</P>
    <?oasys _cl11.5- ?><P>The poverty trap must be removed. Employment is probably the best way out of poverty but <Col N="1429"/>the system can put obstacles in the path of people. I commend the Minister for focusing on ways not only of removing the obstacles but on incentivising entry into employment in a way that is genuinely cognisant of the reality of people&rsquo;s lives. The reform will be based on active rather than passive support, to assist people to take up education, which is so important, training or employment opportunities.</P>
    <P>Support for lone parents that prevents long-term dependence on social welfare and promotes real financial independence, employment, education and training is the key to removing poverty traps. This report is heading in the right direction. It is a welcome change to a policy that could have continued. By taking this initiative we are serving the long-term interests of society well and addressing the real needs of the child who is caught in those traps.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senators for a short but comprehensive debate. Most of the issues were raised on the floor of the House. I appreciate hearing them and will take them on board. Having had this debate there may be an opportunity for a similar debate in the D&aacute;il. Following our forum, I propose to keep in touch with the lone parent associations as we develop legislation. During the course of the year I hope I can introduce legislation to give effect to the type of reforms contained in the report.</P>
    <P>Senators have stressed the need for child care, education and training, and the importance of not stereotyping the role of fathers. Those issues are referred to in the report. The legislation which I hope to introduce, pending Cabinet approval, will tackle most of these issues. The role of fathers is a difficult area. Senator Tuffy is correct, and there are rights and responsibilities. Access is a major issue for fathers. Fathers&rsquo; organisations say that is a major issue for them. I am not in favour of access being a <i>quid pro quo,</i> but I do not think the Senator has suggested that. Access is an issue that must be sorted because the child is entitled to have access to both parents, not the other way around. While that is not negotiable it is not the case in many relationships.</P>
    <P>There is also the issue of child support coming from the father. Approximately 2,500 to 3,000 lone fathers make payments through the Department&rsquo;s system. That means that up to 60,000 do not make such payments. Frequently, it is not that they do not make payments but that we do not require them to do so. That is a subject for another debate. Some 30,000 lone fathers are working but are not making any payment. We do not require them to make a payment because their incomes are low. In other jurisdictions, even if the income is extremely low, some token is paid in order to make a social connection with the <Col N="1430"/>child. That is a topic for debate but I will not go into it now.</P>
    <P>I thank Senators for a thoughtful contribution. On the matter of compulsory or voluntary engagement, I reassure Senator O&rsquo;Meara that the reforms will encourage parents to engage before the child is aged five. That is voluntary. When the child is aged five, lone parents will be required to engage with facilitators, that is, to be available for discussion-information, and advice and counselling but they will not be required to work. When the youngest child is aged eight, the proposals envisage a full reform of activation but even that will be on a phased basis. Return to work will be on a phased basis and any drop-off in payment will be on a phased basis as the person re-engages with the workplace. It is compulsion with a small &ldquo;c&rdquo; at that stage. We shall progress these issues in the weeks and months ahead and I look forward to returning with legislation on this subject in the not too distant future.</P>

   <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The purpose of the Bill is to establish the road safety authority and to amend section 9 of the Road Traffic Act 2002, which relates specifically to the implementation of the European Commission convention on mutual recognition of driving disqualifications. I respectfully suggest to Senator Burke that it is not appropriate that this Bill be used as a means to amend the Road Traffic Acts which constitute a legal framework for the regulation of traffic vehicles and drivers.</P>
    <P>The road traffic Bill is in the course of preparation, and the heads have been cleared by the Government some time ago. I know we will get the co-operation of all sides of the House, and I am anxious that we get the Bill through by the summer if at all possible because it will refer to speed cameras, mandatory breath testing and <Col N="1431"/>revision of licence procedures. I suppose I should not have gone into all that but I am just pointing out that would be a more appropriate time for Senator Burke to raise the issues he noted in his amendments. It is not appropriate to include them in this Bill.</P>

   <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. P. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
    <P LI="1">In page 6, before section 4, to insert the following new section:</P>
    <P LI="1">&ldquo;4.&mdash;The Minister shall, notwithstanding the status of the Authority, remain politically accountable to the Houses of the Oireachtas for all matters that fall under the aegis of the Authority, and nothing in this Act shall be used to diminish the level of that responsibility or his or her accountability in that regard.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P FLI="0">I feel strongly about this amendment, as does my colleague in the D&aacute;il, Deputy Olivia Mitchell. While I appreciate she put forward this amendment in the D&aacute;il, we should debate it fully in this House. I hope the Minister of State will accept it in the Seanad. It is about accountability. The road safety authority is not answerable to the Houses of the Oireachtas and it should be, through the Minister. That is a fundamental of our democracy. Otherwise we will have a road safety authority which will be like the HSE. Members of the Oireachtas and MEPs will write to the Minister, the Minister will wash his hands of matters, as will the Department, and the only avenue left open to the elected representative will be to write to the chairman of the road safety authority, Mr. Gay Byrne. One may get a reply in perhaps three or six months, and that is not good enough in our democracy today.</P>
    <P>To have this amendment included would be a small price to pay. We have recently celebrated the 90th anniversary of the 1916 uprising, and the people involved died for democracy, for freedom. A fundamental part of it is that the people involved would be accountable to the Houses of the Oireachtas through the Minister. We feel strongly on this matter and urge the Minister of State to accept the amendment.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>As the House knows, the chief executive officer of the road safety authority will be accountable to the D&aacute;il for its operation under sections 17(15) and (17) of the Bill. He or she will be accountable to committees of the Oireachtas with regard to performance of the authority&rsquo;s functions. Section 9 of the Bill gives power with <Col N="1432"/>regard to the general policy and the Minister will have responsibility for giving direction to the road safety authority in that regard. He or she would also retain overall responsibility for road safety. The Bill provides that the road safety authority may make recommendations for improving driving standards and requires the authority to submit road safety programmes to the Minister. In the circumstances, this amendment is unnecessary.</P>
    <P>We are not setting a precedent in the Bill. This is a long-established practice. There are many other such authorities and boards which have autonomy but the Minister of the day in the lead Department has responsibility for policy. If the Minister of the day was given the same authority as the chief executive officer to deal with the micro-management of the authority, there would be criticism of that as well. This practice is nothing new and it conforms with the practice that has been in place over the years. Successive Governments have established authorities and boards of which the chief executive officers are accountable to the D&aacute;il and the committees of the D&aacute;il. In this case it is the transport committee.</P>
    <P>The Minister will have power to give general policy direction to the road safety authority. There is a template in existence and, while it does not follow that we should have to adopt it, over the years such boards and authorities have served us well. They have been accountable to the relevant committees of the House. There is no reason to change that now. Road safety is a top priority for myself, the Minister and the Taoiseach. There is a committee of Ministers, chaired by the Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen, of which I am a member which deals with road safety policy. The other Ministers on the committee are the Ministers for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Health and Children, Education and Science and the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. The Department will have responsibility for policy direction and will work closely with the road safety authority.</P>
    <P>It would be wrong to get involved in the micro-management of this body. We will ensure that recommendations on improving standards which will require the road safety authority to submit programmes to the Minister will be dealt with.</P>

	<P>All parties and Oireachtas Members wish to promote and seek the highest standards in road safety. One life lost or one person injured on our roads is one too many. The Minister can say what he likes about this issue but, ultimately, when an Oireachtas Member asks him or his senior colleague a question about the road safety authority, he can wash his hands of it. That is the reality. The Minister has not given me any joy on this amendment, nor did he do so to my colleague in the Lower House. However, I appeal to him to accept it. It is a fair amendment. <Col N="1433"/>It is a fundamental part of our democracy that agencies should be answerable to the Houses of the Oireachtas through the Minister of the day.</P>

  <P>Amendment declared lost.</P>
  <P Just="Center">SECTION 4.</P>
   <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. P. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
    <P LI="1">In page 6, between lines 46 and 47, to insert the following new subsection:</P>
    <P LI="1">&ldquo;(5) Without prejudice to any other subsection in this section, the Authority shall further have amongst its responsibilities, the following:</P>
    <P LI="2">(<i>a</i>) the registration of vehicles and retention of data pertaining to the ownership of vehicles;</P>
    <P LI="2">(<i>b</i>) driver testing;</P>
    <P LI="2">(<i>c</i>) registration of qualified driving instructors;</P>
    <P LI="2">(<i>d</i>) maintenance of the national driver file;</P>
    <P LI="2">(<i>e</i>) education of drivers, and promotion of educational and information campaigns for safe and responsible driving;</P>
    <P LI="2">(<i>f</i>) maintenance, management and revision, as appropriate, of the Rules of the Road;</P>
    <P LI="2">(<i>g</i>) maintenance of road signage and markings;</P>
    <P LI="2">(<i>h</i>) policy advice to the Minister and certain other bodies as prescribed by this Act; and</P>
    <P LI="2">(<i>i</i>) such other matters as the Minister may prescribe from time to time.&rdquo;.</P><Col N="1434"/>
    <P FLI="0">Four different agencies, the Garda, the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Transport, and the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, cover the matters listed in the amendment. The amendment proposes to bring the various matters under one umbrella organisation. It is a simple amendment to pull these strands together and make the road safety authority responsible for co-ordinating these issues. I hope the Minister of State will give serious consideration to the amendment.</P>
   </Speaker>
   
   <TimeSt down="5" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">While considering the amendment, which was also tabled in the D&aacute;il, one must remember that driver testing, the registration of qualified driving instructors, the education of drivers, the promotion of educational and information campaigns, and maintenance, management and revision of the Rules of the Road have been included in the Bill. As we speak, we are revising the Rules of the Road which will be ready prior to the enactment of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Senator Paddy Burke is correct that the registration of vehicles is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners and responsibility for the maintenance of the national driver file rests with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. Even if we were to decide it will be the responsibility of the road safety authority, it might improve administration but not road safety. I would have no difficulty in doing anything that might save a life but the national driver file is held by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and <Col N="1435"/>available to the Department of Transport, as it will be to the road safety authority.</P>
    <P>From a practical point of view, how could a road safety authority without a budget for the maintenance of road signage and markings be responsible for it? Senator Paddy Burke was a member of a local authority and knows this is a matter for the National Roads Authority on national and secondary roads and for the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government on regional and county roads. Changing that for the sake of it would not be practical.</P>
    <P Just="Left">We have access to the national drivers file. If we changed that, new software would be needed and other practical difficulties would arise. Of course, if the law suggested that the Department of Transport or the road safety authority did not have access to it, I would consider the amendment but that is not the case.</P>
    <P Just="Left">Section 4 provides for the transfer of functions to the road safety authority. It covers the driving test, the registration of driving instructors, driver education and the promotion of road safety. We have tried to ensure that the powers and functions being vested in the authority are not presented in the legislation as an exhaustive or prescriptive list. For that reason we are giving the authority responsibility for the production and maintenance of the Rules of the Road through the exercise of the general powers available to the Minister under the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 10 gives the Minister general powers to transfer functions to the Department. We may in the future decide that powers should be transferred and I would prefer to come back to the Houses then. These general powers exist in all legislation. The Senator is serious about improving road safety but his amendment is covered, the Department will have access to the national driver file. We should not fix what is not broken.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State answered a number of points Senator Paddy Burke has raised, particularly on driver testing. If the Minister of State had lost the last vote or accepted the amendment, I might have been willing to go this way. I would like to hold the Minister responsible but because the last amendment was not accepted, we would have difficulty holding the Minister responsible for some of these areas.</P>
    <P>I do not support the amendment, although I understand the worthy intention behind it, because I do not want the road safety authority to be distracted in any way from the focus on road safety. Some of the areas being added, such as the registration of vehicles and retention of data pertaining to the ownership of vehicles, are not road safety issues. Maintenance of the national driver file is not pertinent solely to road safety. The maintenance of road signage and markings is an important area of road safety but it should not be the responsibility of this body. The <Col N="1436"/>Senator&rsquo;s heart is in the right place but I would prefer to see the road safety authority focused on road safety and not distracted by anything else.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. P. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate what the Minister of State and Senator Quinn have said but this is about getting information. The road safety authority must have information because otherwise it will be at nothing. Driver testing is a major issue. The way it is being operated calls out for something to be done.</P>
    <P>I was a member of a local authority for many years and all councillors can recite the dangerous stretches of road in their areas off the tops of their heads. Local authorities have a role but is there not a role for the road safety authority in areas where crashes, fatal or otherwise, are commonplace? Will the road safety authority get its information from the local authorities, depending on them to send data on bad stretches of road, or will it make recommendations on roads that should be improved or must we wait for more fatalities? The road safety authority should control such issues otherwise it will be at a disadvantage as it waits for information from local authority or the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.</P>
    <P>How will this process be drawn together? I know bad stretches of road throughout the country. The Bill does not specify how the road safety authority will have any input in road improvements.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>Section 8 gives the road safety authority power to collect information and statistics. If we go into the detail of it, and Senator Quinn summed it up well, if the road safety authority is not responsible for road signage and markings, that is a matter for the National Roads Authority and the councils.</P>
    <P>Legislation will come before the House before the summer recess to deal with speed cameras. It will not be a matter for the Department to decide where the cameras will be located or if they will be permanent, it will be a decision for the company and the Garda, which will have responsibility for enforcement. Hopefully, that will deal with the issue in the short term.</P>
    <P Just="Left">Of course, in the long term, we must aspire to remove all accident black spots, but that cannot be done immediately. We must live in the real world. In the short term, signs or cameras should be erected at such locations so that those driving on our roads, whether national primary, secondary, regional or county roads, know of the dangers. Signs are on our roads for a good reason, to alert drivers to the fact that certain stretches of road are dangerous.</P>
    <P Just="Left">I expect that the road safety authority will liaise with the local authorities in each county and the National Roads Authority, which has responsibility for primary and secondary national roads. I am not being political when I say that over the last nine years, the budget of the National Roads <Col N="1437"/>Authority has increased five-fold, from approximately &euro;350 million to &euro;1.5 billion. That is the level of funding being provided now. In County Donegal, for example, the National Roads Authority and the county council have employed a road safety engineer who will make proposals to the local authority and, if necessary, to the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.</P>
    <P>As public representatives, we are all familiar with the low-cost safety improvement works, for which funding is provided to the local authorities separately from their mainstream funding. Even though such works apply to county or regional roads, the National Roads Authority has an input in that process. Work is prioritised on the basis of the number of accidents on particular roads and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is also involved in the process.</P>
    <P>The National Roads Authority will work closely with the road safety authority. The chief executive of the NRA appeared before the Joint Committee on Transport, made a presentation and answered numerous questions raised by committee members. It is important that the response to road safety is cross-cutting, that the road safety authority listens to the local authorities and the National Roads Authority and <i>vice versa</i>.</P>
    <P>The amendment proposes changes for the sake of change and would not be in the best interests of road safety. It is not necessary to give the authority the proposed additional powers. It has sufficient powers to deal with the issues.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. P. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister must have been a formidable footballer in his time because he has side-stepped every question I posed. Members of the Joint Committee on Transport visited the state of Victoria in Australia. That state has a body in place which is not dissimilar to the proposed road safety authority. The Victorian authority pools information from across the various sectors that deal with road safety, makes recommendations and enforces them. It effectively calls the tune.</P>
    <P>Fundamental to road safety is the maintenance of road signage and markings but the Minister has not explained how he sees the authority working in this regard. The road safety authority must be able to make some recommendations on such matters, but to whom? Will it make recommendations to the National Roads Authority, the local authorities, the Minister for Transport or to the Joint Committee on Transport? It will not be making recommendations to Members of the Oireachtas because, following the first vote this evening, we will not be able to hold anybody accountable.</P>
    <P>I hope the road safety authority will not be a talking shop. It must be given teeth. It must be able to make recommendations and have a free hand in many areas. If the authority makes recommendations, it should be given funding to ensure that the required safety measures are put <Col N="1438"/>in place to deal with accident black spots and dangerous stretches of road. On what basis will the authority receive information to carry out such tasks?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister for Transport gave an absolute assurance to the road safety authority at its inaugural meeting in the Department several weeks ago that it may work through the Department. If it has recommendations to make, it should make them. Recommendations should be made to the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government regarding county and regional roads and to the National Roads Authority regarding primary roads, black spots and so forth. If the authority has recommendations to make to the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government or the NRA, the Department of Transport will make the necessary representations. I am sure the road safety authority will make recommendations and I expect that briefings will be held with the relevant Departments or agencies.</P>
    <P>The traffic sign manual, with which we are all familiar, will be the responsibility of the road safety authority. However, the various proposals in the Senator&rsquo;s amendment are unnecessary.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I support what the Minister of State is saying in this instance. In the past, the making of recommendations has not been strong enough. However, if the road safety authority, under its new chairman, makes a recommendation, the Department will ignore it at its peril. That is why I believe the choice of chairman was inspired. He is the type of person who will not brook any effort to ignore him. From that perspective, I hope Senator Paddy Burke understands why I am satisfied, in this instance, that his amendment is not necessary. I believe that recommendations will be very strong and will have power behind them. The Department will ignore them at its peril.</P>

    <P LI="6">(<i>b</i>) seek a court order for the forfeiture of that licence under this Act.&rdquo;.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P FLI="0">This amendment, inserting a new section, refers to the 2002 Act, which governs the penalty points system. A situation could arise whereby a person drives the length of the country, passes a number of speed cameras and unknowingly accrues 12 penalty points. Such a person must surrender his or her driving licence for endorsement, but to whom? The legislation does not clearly state to whom a driving licence should be surrendered. This amendment deals with that issue and places the responsibility on the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to ensure licences are surrendered and endorsed, as penalty points accrue. I ask the Minister of State to accept it.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>The short reply to the Senator&rsquo;s question is the local authority. However, I wish to give a comprehensive response to the House regarding this amendment.</P>
    <P>The development of the support system for the penalty points system involved significant and ongoing consultation with all agencies including the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Courts Service, the vehicle registration unit of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government <Col N="1441"/>and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The system involved the establishment of data linkages between the national driver file and the relevant IT systems in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Courts Service.</P>
    <P>An intrinsic part of the system is that all endorsements of penalty points on a licence record and all disqualifications are recorded on the national driver file. As I said earlier on another amendment, while that information is with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, we have access to it, as will the road safety authority.</P>
    <P>There were further allegations recently of loopholes in the penalty points system and some inaccurate statements reported in the media, although I am not accusing Senator Paddy Burke of that, about the operation of the system. I want to clarify the position on the penalty points disqualification procedure. A driver who accumulates 12 penalty points is disqualified for a period of six months under section 3 of the Road Traffic Act 2002. In accordance with section 5 of that Act, a driver is automatically notified by the vehicle registration unit of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, on behalf of the Department of Transport, that he or she has reached 12 penalty points and disqualification will be effective 28 days from the date of that notice.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset and to answer the question, the notification will also direct the person to surrender his or her licence to the appropriate licensing authority within 14 days of the date of the disqualification. It is an offence, therefore, under section 5 of the Road Traffic Act 2002, not to surrender a driving licence to a licensing authority. At the same time the disqualification notice is sent to the Garda Commissioner, the authorised officer of the relevant motor tax office and the Department of Transport. I understand details of such disqualifications are entered on the PULSE system. Upon expiry of the period allowed for the surrender of the driving licence, a notice is issued by the vehicle registration unit to the Garda informing it whether the licence has been surrendered.</P>
    <P>It is an offence under section 38 of the Road Traffic Act 1961 to drive without a driving licence. To suggest, therefore, that a person can continue to drive while disqualified because the Garda does not know he or she is disqualified is not tenable given the notification procedure in place. Notification of payment of a fixed charge from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or a conviction from the Courts Service in respect of any penalty points offence to the vehicle registration unit results in points being recorded on the licence record on the national driver file and the automatic notification of penalty points incurred and the total number of penalty points on a person&rsquo;s record.</P>
    <P Just="Left">To give the Senator some statistics, at 28 April, 36 drivers had already served a disqualification period of six months, 20 licence holders were dis<Col N="1442"/>qualified and a further three drivers are in the process of being disqualified and will be required to surrender their licence to the relevant authority within 14 days of the disqualification becoming active.</P>
    <P>I hope that clarifies the position for the Members present and the wider public. I would point out, however, that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was never involved in either the surrender of driving licences or the endorsement of licences. Where a person is disqualified by the courts, driving licences were always surrendered through the courts to licensing authorities and the disqualification noted on the driver record. To suggest, therefore, that drivers go to Garda stations to have their licence endorsed is a fundamental departure from the current system of recording disqualifications and would place an intolerable and unnecessary administrative burden on the Garda. We all want to ensure that garda&iacute; are on the beat and we should use the resources we have rather than have them involved in further administrative duties. In the circumstances, and on the basis of the response I have given, I hope Senator Burke will consider withdrawing the amendment.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a doubt in my mind as to the best system. The current system is very involved and Senator Burke has put forward a proposal that is worthy of consideration, although I have the same concern about the road safety authority being encumbered with other details such as those outlined.</P>
    <P>When will penalty points apply on an all-Ireland basis? Is there any talk of applying them on a European basis? Will the Minister consider taking into account at some point, if not in this Bill, the procedure in Finland, which is to relate the penalties to the income of the individual? A man who was caught speeding on his motorbike in Finland recently had a very high income and was fined &euro;200,000 for that offence. It got such attention from the media the public will be aware that it is highly unlikely to take place again.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. P. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>When a person who has accrued 12 or more penalty points is stopped by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, does it show up on the PULSE system that he or she is disqualified? Will it indicate on the PULSE system that the person is in breach of the law or over the limit in terms of penalty points?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DiarmuidWilson"><NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I agree with Senator Quinn&rsquo;s point on the harmonisation of the penalty points system, especially between North and South. The most immediate problem facing us is that the penalty points system here does not apply to drivers in Northern Ireland and <i>vice versa</i>. The Minister of State will be aware as I am, coming from a Border area, that Northern registered vehicles have no regard for the laws of the State or the Rules of the Road. The sooner the systems North and South are harmonised, the better.</P><Col N="1443"/>
    <P>I understand the current position is that if somebody incurs two penalty points he or she is notified by letter, accompanied by a photograph of the individual committing the offence, but the letter is not registered; it is sent by ordinary post. Those letters should be registered because in some cases the first the person has heard about having incurred two penalty points is when the garda arrives at the door with a summons to appear in court. Such people then automatically incur four penalty points when the case goes to the District Court. They did not receive the letter in the post but they had no way of proving that. The Garda, on the other hand, had no way of proving the letter was sent. Hundreds of cases are being dismissed in the District Court for that reason. It would be worthwhile examining that issue.</P>
   </Speaker>

	<P>To answer Senator Burke&rsquo;s question, it will show up on the PULSE system. He will appreciate, however, that if a person who has ten points incurs an additional two points, the garda will not know that immediately because he or she will have to go back to the station and put it into the system. It will be recognised as soon as he or she puts it into the system but it does not mean that the person loses his or her licence on that day. There is a period of 28 days before the notice comes out and it is a number of days after that before the person loses his or her licence. The answer to the question is &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn&rsquo;s other question is one which has been raised on numerous occasions, namely, the issue of all-Ireland recognition. We are in discussions with the Northern authorities on introducing harmonisation. Ironically, there is no harmonisation between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Senator Wilson is correct that we recognise this, particularly in Border counties, and we are anxious to make progress.</P>
    <P>A directive on the mutual recognition of fines is being considered in Europe. Senators are aware that at one of the last European meetings I attended, we made some progress on a European driving licence. It will not happen overnight, as it will have a lead-in period. It will be extremely helpful when that licence is in place. The 25 member states of the EU must decide what information should be held on the microchip. We are making progress but it will take a number of years. The most pertinent issue is what we can do regarding North and South. We recognise that and will try to make progress.</P>

   <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. P. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
    <P LI="1">In page 7, before section 5, to insert the following new section:</P>
    <P LI="1">&rdquo;5.&mdash;(1) The Authority shall have a policy role in&mdash;</P>
    <P LI="2">(<i>a</i>) making general road safety policy recommendations to the Minister,</P>
    <P LI="2">(<i>b</i>) advising the Minister on any review of speed limits,</P>
    <P LI="2">(<i>c</i>) advising local authorities on general road safety policy,</P>
    <P LI="2">(<i>d</i>) liaising between any itself and any one or more of the following bodies:</P>
    <P LI="3">(i) an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na;</P>
    <P LI="3">(ii) the National Roads Authority;</P>
    <P LI="3">(iii) local authorities and municipal authorities;</P>
    <P LI="3">(iv) the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government;</P>
    <P LI="3">(v) the Department of Transport; or</P>
    <P LI="3">(vi) such other bodies as the Minister may prescribe from time to time.</P>
    <P LI="1">(2) The Authority shall have consultative and advisory roles in any review or reform of road categories, or in terms of their route letter and number.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P FLI="0">The purpose of amendment No. 5 is to give a more defined policy role to the road safety authority. It is not clearly defined where the authority can give a policy recommendation to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the National Roads Authority, the Departments of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and Transport or the Ministers with those responsibilities.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 16 and 17 are concerned with reviews and reports. They state that the road safety authority would publish an annual review, benchmark itself and monitor its successes or failures. Road safety issues must have some form of benchmarking. The annual report it will publish should include benchmarks. The authority should monitor itself.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>I refer Senators to section 7 of the Bill, which provides a clear legislative basis to ensure the road safety authority has a lead role in the development of strategies and measures to advance our road safety agenda. The issue of road safety comes under the remit of various Departments and agencies. When one considers its extremely extensive remit, the road safety authority will be in a position to engage with all contributory bodies to develop and monitor the delivery of a comprehensive road safety prog<Col N="1445"/>ramme. This also deals with an earlier question on liaison and co-ordination with other Departments. The authority will play a major role in the development of future road safety strategies and will submit this programme to the Minister.</P>
    <P Just="Left">It is envisaged that the programme will form the basis of the Government&rsquo;s road safety strategy in the future. I also envisage that the authority will compile reports which address policy recommendations across a range of road safety measures. The authority will also have a role in overseeing the implementation of the programme the Government will adopt on road safety strategies. It will report regularly to the Cabinet sub-committee which the Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen, chairs and which, as I stated earlier, I attend. The Taoiseach attended our last meeting and I expect he will attend meetings from time to time.</P>
    <P>It is not wise to set a timeframe on road safety strategy in legislation. Policy initiatives contained in the strategy may require varying timeframes. Including an extremely prescriptive requirement on the determination of annual targets and reviews could potentially have a negative influence on the pursuit of strategic objectives, which, by their nature may need to be based on the delivery of measures over a longer timeframe.</P>
    <P>The focus of the amendments proposed by Senator Paddy Burke essentially will be addressed by the thrust of the proposals contained in the Bill. There is no great difference between what the Senator proposes and what is incorporated and catered for in the Bill. It is not necessary to be too prescriptive on timeframes. A degree of flexibility is important. I have no difficulty with the principle of the suggestion. However, some flexibility is required and what is suggested in incorporated in the Bill.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I liked the element of Senator Paddy Burke&rsquo;s amendment No. 17 which states that no later than three months after the end of each calendar year the authority will report. The Bill provides a timeframe of six months. Will the Minister of State reconsider whether three months is better than six months? Unless matters have an urgency nothing happens. Three months at the end of the year gives the authority time to produce a report and lay it before the Houses. Speed is of the essence if we are to move on these issues.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DiarmuidWilson"><NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
	<P>The fact that six months is enshrined in the legislation is a major help. As we are all aware, in this House we see some annual reports coming in two years after the end of the year. Six months is adequate time. The Bill states the report will be made not later than six months after the end of the year. It is helpful that a timeframe is included. The history of some reporting bodies is not good.</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="1446"/>
   <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. P. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>As Senator Quinn stated, three months is a reasonable time within which to report. However, an annual report is not much good. The benchmarking I outlined should also be included. The road safety authority should monitor itself on its failures and successes. Hopefully, it will be successful. Surely the road safety authority should have a role to play in advising local authorities on speed limits.</P>
    <P>The National Roads Authority is building a number of roads throughout the country. In some parts, two lane carriageways are built. However, in some countries, such as South Africa and Australia, great use is made of roads where two lanes go in one direction and one lane goes in the other. A couple of miles down the road, two lanes go the other way. Such a system gives the traffic in each direction a reasonable chance to pass out vehicles.</P>
    <P>If the road safety authority recommends that a new stretch of road being built should be a two plus one traffic lane system for the most part, if it is perhaps 18 km or 20 km in length, should it advise the National Roads Authority, the local authority or the Minister? How does that process work? A report may come in six months afterwards, and as Senator Quinn has mentioned, this is a considerable length of time. In many cases, time is of the essence for planning purposes.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister of State will accept the three month period, as it is a reasonable amendment. There are sections which could be accepted on Report Stage.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The period could well be three or four months. It can be no later than six months, which is a major advance. We are all aware of reports coming before the House which could be some years afterwards. We must take into consideration the practicalities, as any reports will be comprehensive. I would prefer to have a report within a six-month period rather than pressurise the authority to report in a three month period. That is very sensible.</P>
    <P>With regard to engagement, I stated that the authority would have a very extensive remit, and it would be in a position to engage with all of the contributory bodies, so it can monitor and develop a comprehensive road safety programme. There will be communication with others, such as the National Roads Authority. I appreciate the point made about the two plus one traffic lane systems. That is a new concept in this country which is being developed.</P>
    <P>I have announced the commencement of a compulsory purchase order for a &euro;90 million bypass in my own county and constituency for Ballybofey Stranorlar. It will be 15.5 km long and form part of the Atlantic corridor, and it will operate the two plus one traffic lane system. The concept is being developed. I am sure there will be views within the road safety authority, and it can, while engaging with other contributory bodies which I have described, make its views <Col N="1447"/>well known. I have no doubt that the two plus one traffic lane system will contribute positively, and I am sure the National Roads Authority will give such views serious consideration.</P>

   <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. P. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
    <P LI="1">In page 7, before section 5, to insert the following new section:</P>
    <P LI="1">&ldquo;5.&mdash;(1) The Authority shall have responsibility for the management and standards of driver testing in Ireland.</P>

    <P LI="1">(3) The Authority may put such pre-conditions in place as it deems necessary, for candidates who wish to take the driving test. Such pre-conditions may include, but are not limited to, a requirement that candidates undergo a prescribed number of driving lessons before being allowed to sit the driving test.</P>

    <P FLI="0" el="5">There may be hope that the Minister of State might accept some of the ideas in amendments Nos. 6 or 7.</P>
    <P>Much work must be done in the area of driver testing, the education of driving testers and the process of applying for the driving test. If a person sits and fails a driving test, for example, it should be the duty of the tester to point out to the individual the points on which the person failed and what was done incorrectly. I do not believe this is the case currently. It should be obligatory for the tester to point out the mistakes to the person who has gone through the motions of taking lessons, etc.</P>
    <P>There should also be controls in place relating to education of testers. Currently, a person giving lessons can set up a business in the morning without even a car. I am not even sure if a driving licence is required, although I presume one would need it. It is a very loose arrangement, and the area should be considered. There should also be a provision for the Irish language.</P>
    <P Just="Left">This amendment covers the issue of physical disability and driver testers, among other things. We must do much work in this regard. The amendments speak for themselves. The Rules of the Road cannot be obtained in the Irish language. It should be printed in Irish and available for the people in the Gaeltacht or anybody who wants it in the Irish language.</P>
    <P>There should be a register of driving testers. The amendment I have tabled covers that area, as well as the area of driving instructors. I would like to hear the Minister of State&rsquo;s views on some of those issues. There could be vast improvement in these areas, which would greatly improve the education of some of our drivers also.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DiarmuidWilson"><NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
	<P>In some schools and Youthreach training centres in Cavan, the driver theory test is a compulsory part of the curriculum. It should be compulsory in every second-level school and training institution in the country. It is the first step towards obtaining a driving licence in this country, and it is important to educate our young people in particular.</P><Col N="1449"/>
    <?oasys _cl11.4- ?><P>With regard to driving instructors, I welcome the Minister of State&rsquo;s statement on Second Stage that existing driving instructors would be allowed to continue operating until a register comes into existence. I take into account what Senator Paddy Burke said with regard to driving schools. It is wrong that any person can set up such a business at the moment, although I am not sure that person would do any business if he or she did not have a car. It is addressed in the Bill, and I welcome that the vast majority of good driving instructors will be allowed to continue operating until the new system comes into operation.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the amendments, and I will specifically refer to the driving test. If a person has passed or failed, and made errors, the tester should be in a position at that stage to inform the person being tested of the errors made, why the person has failed and what should be done in the future. This should all be part of the process. It is an issue which many people who have sat the test have raised with me on several occasions. The information should be made available.</P>
    <P Just="Left">We discussed the issue of road safety in the House, and the Minister of State was present. I agree with the sentiments expressed with regard to driver testing. There should be a register of all driving instructors, and the Bill is dealing with that issue. It is a very important part of the Bill and action should come about. It is a shame that anybody can set up a driving school. I know that is addressed in the Bill, which I welcome. I support the amendments proposed by Senator Paddy Burke.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>I will deal with specific aspects of the Bill and will then respond to questions arising from amendments Nos. 6 and 7. Instructors are the subject of amendment No. 8.</P>
    <P Just="Left">The driver testing service operates under the provisions of section 33 of the Road Traffic Act 1961, and in accordance with regulations made under that Act. The driving test is also governed by EU directives which stipulate the manoeuvres to be tested, and is set down in regulations under section 42 of the Road Traffic Act 1961. As the regulatory and legislative framework of the driving testing service are contained in the Road Traffic Acts it would not be appropriate to include the amendments in this Bill. The road safety authority will be responsible for the operation of the driver testing service in accordance with the regulations and will also be responsible for the operation of the driver theory test service. Our intention is for the service level agreement, to be drawn up in accordance with section 26 of the Bill, to specify performance standards for the delivery of services by the road safety authority which will take account of the matters raised in the amendments proposed by Senator Paddy Burke.</P><Col N="1450"/>
    <P>Preconditions on candidates for driving tests would have to be set out in regulations and would require amendments to section 42 of the Act. I am considering tabling amendments to that section in the road traffic amendment Bill that it is hoped will be introduced in the D&aacute;il shortly. It would not be appropriate to do so in this Bill. As part of the operation of the driver testing service the road safety authority will be responsible for ensuring a uniform standard of driving test and that training is given to testers to ensure adequate standards. In light of the authority&rsquo;s general duty under section 6 of the Bill to promote better driving standards, the amendment is not necessary.</P>
    <P>One would get the impression from the contribution of Senator Cummins that a person is simply told after a test that he or she has passed or failed but that is not the case. Maybe I misunderstand the Senator but a detailed report is made after each test, which is as it should be. The testers undergo a comprehensive training programme and disabilities are catered for in the test.</P>
    <P>I am aware that Senator Burke is committed to the Irish language at leaving certificate but his party is not. This is not the time for a debate on that issue.</P>

   <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. P. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
    <P LI="1">In page 7, before section 5, to insert the following new section:</P>
    <P LI="1">&ldquo;5.&mdash;(1) The Authority shall, in the exercise of its functions as prescribed by <i>section 4(1)</i> of this Act, be responsible for setting training standards and ensuring quality control of driving instructors.</P>
    <P LI="1">(2) Without prejudice to <i>subsection (3)</i> of this section, the Authority shall assume such functions in respect of driving instructors as are conferred on the Minister by, and in accordance with, the Road Traffic Acts 1961 to 2004.</P>
    <P LI="1">(3) The Authority shall put in place such structures as it deems necessary to regulate driving instruction and driving schools, and shall maintain a register of those who are qualified to give certifiable driving lessons.</P>
    <P LI="1">(4) Driving instructors shall be obliged to undergo regular quality control testing and retraining at such intervals as may be prescribed by the Authority.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P FLI="0">We have fully discussed amendment No. 8. There is a lot of room for improvement in the registration of driving instructors and something should be done urgently.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>I held my response until the Senator moved amendment No. 8. I do not disagree with him but we are dealing with the issue. The authority will be designated an approved body to issue instruction certificates envisaged under section 18 of the Road Traffic Act 1968, as amended by section 19 of the Road Traffic Act 2002. In accordance with regulations made under these provisions, which will provide for the matters referred to in the proposed amendment, other than the regulation of driving schools and the retraining of instructors, section 4(1) states the road safety authority will have functions in respect of the registration of instructors which will be designated in regulations made under the Road Traffic Acts. The authority will be an approved body that can issue instruction certificates for the purpose of regulating driving instructors.</P><Col N="1452"/>
    <P>There is no power in the Road Traffic Acts to regulate driving schools. This should not be a matter for the road safety authority because it can be dealt with under company law. As I pointed out to Senator Wilson, I explained on Second Stage that there would be a short period for a derogation. If we were to introduce it immediately there would be no opportunity for learner drivers to take instruction. When this is in place it will not be a matter of instructors qualifying and being issued with a certificate. They will be check tested at regular intervals and, if found not to meet the required standard, will be removed from the register. Instructors will have to take appropriate steps to bring the quality of their instruction up the required standard. The principle of what Senator Burke proposes in amendment No. 8 is enshrined in the Bill, apart from the regulation of driving schools which is dealt with under company law and other Acts.</P>

  <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
   <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. P. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 9:</P>
    <P LI="1">In page 7, before section 5, to insert the following new section:</P>
    <P LI="1">&ldquo;5.&mdash;(1) On the establishment day, the Authority shall assume all responsibility for driver licensing, including, but not limited to:</P>
    <P LI="2">(<i>a</i>) issuing and re-issuing of licences, including duplicate and replacement licences and requests for changes of address;</P>
    <P LI="2">(<i>b</i>) imposition of endorsements and penalty points;</P>
    <P LI="2">(<i>c</i>) revocation of licences; and</P>
    <P LI="2">(<i>d</i>) shape, design, ergonomics and colour of licences.</P>
    <P LI="1">(2) As soon as is practicable after the establishment day, the Authority shall move to introduce a physical driving licence format:</P>
    <P LI="2">(<i>a</i>) that is practicable;</P>
    <P LI="2">(<i>b</i>) that is more easily portable;</P>
    <P LI="2">(<i>c</i>) that is in line with international best practice; and</P>
    <P LI="2">(<i>d</i>) which retains driver information electronically.</P>
    <P LI="1">(3) The Authority shall have jurisdiction to modify and/or vary restrictions on categories of licence holder, whether provisional or otherwise.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P FLI="0">The Minister of State should seriously consider this amendment. It would allow the creation of a credit card-type driving licence. The road safety authority would be responsible for the co-ordination of the driving licence. The local authorities would co-ordinate the application form. The amendment provides for the introduction of cre<Col N="1453"/>dit card-type licences, a measure advocated by the previous Minister for Transport. This type of licence is required to give the road safety authority teeth as electronic licences will hold all relevant information on drivers.</P>
   <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">8 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
    <P>The Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen, recently announced his intention to introduce a zero alcohol limit for new drivers. How would one record information on those who broke such a limit, if not on a credit card-type driving licence? An electronic licence would record all relevant information about the holder, including whether he or she has incurred penalty points, has been disqualified from driving certain vehicles, holds a provisional, full or HGV licence and so forth. Such a system should be introduced immediately and responsibility for its operation should be vested in the road safety authority which must be able to impose penalties on drivers. An electronic driving licence is the best method of doing this.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>The code of legislation which governs the driving licence system is contained in Part 3 of the Road Traffic Act 1961, as amended by subsequent Road Traffic Acts and regulations made thereunder. Under this code, licensing authorities operating in their functional areas process applications for licences and issue licences. They also keep records of endorsements and disqualifications in the national driver file which they hold jointly with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. Information from this file will be available to the Department of Transport and the road safety authority. Changing the current position would create many practical difficulties and <Col N="1454"/>would not improve road safety, as the Government is anxious to do.</P>
    <P>The driving licence is also governed by EU directives on driving licences. These specify the format of a driving licence and the content of the driving and theory tests which must be successfully completed before a licence is granted. To transfer the licensing functions from the local authorities to the road safety authority would require a substantial redrafting of the driver licensing provision of the Road Traffic Acts.</P>
    <P>The proposed amendment is outside the scope of the Bill and would have to be introduced as an amendment to the Road Traffic Acts. Even if I were disposed to make such a change, I would not be able to do so. Nevertheless, I have no difficulty with the Senator&rsquo;s proposal to introduce an electronic driving licence. I attended an informal meeting in Austria as part of a recent Council of Transport Ministers at which it was agreed in principle to introduce such a licence. I am told it will take 18 months to meet the specifications required to guarantee the security of the microchip that would be inserted in electronic driving licences. Therefore, even if we wished to introduce such a licence, a long lead-in time would be necessary.</P>
    <P>EU Transport Ministers are anxious to introduce electronic driving licences as soon as possible but it will take some years. The principle of Senator Paddy Burke&rsquo;s amendment will be acted on, albeit not immediately given the period of 18 months required to meet specifications and guarantee security for electronic driving licences. Eventually, however, a standard driving licence will be introduced throughout the European Union.</P>

   <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendment No. 10 is out of order as it involves a potential charge on the Revenue.</P>
    </Speaker><P>Amendment No. 10 not moved.</P>
   
  <P>Sections 5 to 7, inclusive, agreed to.</P>
  <P Just="Center">SECTION 8.</P>
   <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 11:</P>
    <P LI="1">In page 8, subsection (1), line 47, after &ldquo;statistics&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;to international standards&rdquo;.</P>
    <P FLI="0">I move this amendment on behalf of Senator Henry who is unable to be here. She has done a lot of work on this amendment, which is worthy of consideration by the Minister of State. The amendment is a simple one which seeks to insert &ldquo;to international standards&rdquo; after the word &ldquo;statistics&rdquo; in line 47. It sounds too normal to be important and did not seem to me as if it would be very exciting.</P>
    <P>When statistics are considered with what are they compared? They are not of interest unless they are compared with other information. They can be compared with previous years, which will show whether we are doing better or worse, but the real comparison is with international standards, which would show how others are doing.</P>
    <P>I will take an example, although I accept statistics can be very boring. In the United States, half of all vehicle sales are light trucks, including sports utility vehicles, SUVs. Of what interest to anybody is that, we may ask. To answer, I will bore the House with statistics from the evidence given at the National Highway Traffic Administration. This suggests that half of all new vehicle sales are now light trucks and there are 76 million light trucks in the United States, which constitutes approximately 35% of all registered vehicles.</P>
    <P>While that might be of no interest, light trucks are dangerous to passenger cars. There are six passenger car fatalities per driver killed in vans or pick-ups when the two types of vehicle collide. The ratio is even worse for side impacts. There are 26 fatalities among passenger drivers when their cars are hit nearside by a pick-up truck and 16 when hit by an SUV. Roll-overs are a threat to light truck occupants. There are approximately 10,000 fatalities in the United States in roll-over crashes each year. Roll-overs account for 3% of all collisions but 32% of all occupant fatalities. SUVs and pick-ups are three times more likely than passenger cars to roll-over.</P>
    <P Just="Left">This gives an idea of what international standard statistics can mean. We might read statistics for Ireland but not realise what they mean until we have a chance to compare them with other information. For example, further information from the American Academy of Pediatrics was <Col N="1456"/>presented to me by Senator Henry. It suggests that despite the greater vehicle weight of SUVs, the risk of injury to children in SUVs is similar to that for children in passenger cars. The potential advantage offered by heavier SUVs seems to be offset by other factors, including an increased tendency to roll over. More details are provided in these statistics, such as the importance of age appropriate child restraints and rear seat positioning.</P>
    <P Just="Left">We would not know of these issues unless we had comparisons with other statistics. The Bill may contain provision for statistics but that is irrelevant unless they are compared with international standards. An interesting statistic from Australia concerns driveway motor vehicle injuries in children. Typically the injury involved a parent or relative reversing a motor vehicle in the home driveway over a toddler or preschool age child in the late afternoon or early evening. Four-wheel drive or light commercial vehicles were involved in 42% of all injuries although they account for just 30% of registered vehicles in New South Wales. It is stated that this suggests a link between a fatal outcome, the age of the child and the size and weight of the vehicle involved.</P>
    <P>It is interesting that information on driveway injuries in New South Wales is not collected because they occur on private land. Therefore, this information was collected on a separate basis and included information from New Zealand and the United States.</P>
    <P>Until recently we in Ireland did not forensically investigate fatal road collisions &mdash; they no longer call them accidents because it is said there is no such thing as an accident. However, the Americans have been carrying out such investigations since the 1950s, so it is possible to make comparisons. Statistics are only of interest when they are compared with statistics based on international standards.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry proposed this amendment because she emphatically believes that if we just show statistics without comparing them to international statistics, we will not benefit from them. That is why I urge the Minister of State to accept this simple amendment. It seems unimportant but it is of major importance. It will help to save lives in the future.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I support what is a good amendment. It was Oscar Wilde who said there are lies, damned lies and statistics. However, we should have a measurement of international standards and best practice. The amendment is not in any way contentious and would improve the Bill. We must have some form of measurement. I commend Senator Henry for putting forward this important amendment, which I support. I hope the Minister will accept it.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. P. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I support the amendment and thank Senator Henry for proposing it. As I have said in the context of other amendments, the road <Col N="1457"/>safety authority is all about statistics and the compiling of information, as noted by Senator Quinn with regard to this simple amendment. It would ensure the authority compared its statistics with international statistics. The Senator made the point well with regard to SUVs, which in Australia have been found to cause more fatalities and more serious injuries than smaller cars due to the solidity of the impact on collision. I support the amendment.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no question of my being difficult for the sake of it in not accepting amendments. However, when I explain precisely what is involved it will be clear we are not setting up the authority to a lower standard than international standards. The road safety authority will have responsibility for accident statistics and road safety research. In order to fulfil this responsibility, a research and statistics unit will be established within the authority which will compile and analyse data on accidents in Ireland and will also contribute to Irish and European research projects. It will enable research to be undertaken on various safety initiatives and will stimulate and manage research on road safety matters within the academic and wider community.</P>
    <P>A statistician with specialist qualifications and experience in this area has been engaged &mdash; we are not awaiting enactment of the Bill for this &mdash; who has commenced work on particular projects. As Members know, the chief executive officer <i>pro tem</i> and staff are already in place. It is also planned to recruit two researchers in the near future who will require specialist qualifications and experience in the area of research. The work carried out in this unit will meet appropriate and high standards in each of the respective disciplines.</P>
    <P>It is not a question of having standards that are appropriate to Ireland only. This unit will be of the highest standard. We are constantly benchmarking against the European road safety action plan. In the context of our ambition within the European Union and the wider world, I attended a meeting in Dublin last week, chaired by the Minister, Deputy Cullen, of the European conference of Ministers of Transport, which comprised Ministers from 50 countries. The meeting took a decision to extend the programme and it is open to other countries to join us.</P>
    <P>Within the Department of Transport, at European level and at the wider international level, we have spent considerable time considering how to improve road safety issues. All of us at the wider international level agree that drink driving, which can be linked to drugs, speeding and the non-wearing of seat belts contribute greatly to the many fatalities in Ireland and Europe generally. Our aim which is an ambitious and realistic one is to reduce road fatalities by 50% by 2012. All countries have bought into this aim of the high level working group within the EU. We are benchmarking all the time against the European <Col N="1458"/>road safety action plan. The information and statistics that will be available will be of a high standard. In view of that it is not necessary after &ldquo;statistics&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;to international standards&rdquo; as that is clearly implied.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I am disappointed the Minister of State will not accept this amendment. I know it is difficult for him to accept amendments. It is the only one that, perhaps, he would consider accepting because his heart is in the right place. I am fully aware of the commitment of the Minister of State and that of the Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen, to road safety. I am fully aware also of the commitment of the new chairman of the road safety authority. I have no problem in that area whatsoever. The Minister of State mentioned benchmarking. Following a new regime, we all have experience some years later of perhaps the Department or the road safety authority trying to pull the wool over our eyes by saying the position is getting better without disclosing how we compare with international standards. I ask the Minister of State to consider this amendment seriously. I will not push it tonight because it might be reconsidered on Report Stage. It is a minor amendment but is of the utmost importance; it would permit us to display how well we are doing against international standards. The target of reducing road fatalities by 50% by 2012 is a worthy one. In the past others were not as committed to what was intended in the legislation. I urge the Minister of State to rethink this amendment.</P>

   <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. P. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 12:</P>
    <P LI="1">In page 11, lines 16 to 18, to delete subsection (5).</P>
    <P FLI="0" Just="Left">Subsection (5) provides that a member of the board cannot serve more than two terms. In some cases a person who would have much experience should be allowed to remain on the board if he or she so wishes. For that reason I propose the deletion of that subsection. This would allow for a person with vast experience who has served more than two terms to remain on the board.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I can see where Senator Burke is coming from. There may be persons with exceptional knowledge who can make a major contribution. It would have the effect of allowing a board member to be reappointed indefinitely in perpetuity. The provision allows a board member to service a maximum continuous term of ten years. It does not necessarily specify that a member can only serve ten years. There could <Col N="1459"/>well be a break and the member could serve a further period. It is in the interests of good corporate governance to ensure board members are changed to facilitate the development of new programmes by bringing in new people and new ideas to the board. That would generate new approaches and new thinking which would move forward the road safety agenda. If there is a person with exceptional qualities I believe he or she will make that contribution within a ten-year period. I am anxious to ensure good corporate governance. The legislation clearly provides that a continuous term of ten years does not deprive one of serving a further period at some time in the future.</P>

   <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. P. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 13:</P>
    <P LI="1">In page 17, lines 33 to 42, to delete subsection (1).</P>
    <P FLI="0">A number of Members said on Second Stage that members of local authorities, Members of the Oireachtas, whether Senators or Deputies, and Members of the European Parliament should not be precluded from membership of the board. Local authority members, in particular, have vast knowledge of road safety and issues surrounding it and would have a major contribution to make to road safety. It would be a grave injustice to somebody who has much to offer if he or she were to be precluded from membership of the board of the road safety authority. I ask the Minister of State to seriously consider the deletion of subsection (1). We all know local authority members, Members of either House of the Oireachtas or of the European Parliament who have much to offer in this area. They have accumulated vast experience from their travels to various parts of the world and could make a major contribution to improving road safety. As legislators it would be wrong of us to prohibit such persons from membership of the board. If the amendment is accepted they would not be prohibited from membership of the board. It is wrong also that a member of the board on becoming a member of a local authority would be <Col N="1460"/>prohibited from membership of the board. I ask the Minister of State to consider the amendment seriously.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DiarmuidWilson"><NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Senator Burke&rsquo;s amendment. It concerns an issue I addressed on Second Stage as did my colleagues, Senators Feeney, Paddy Burke and O&rsquo;Toole.</P>
    <P>Senator Burke has outlined the reasons and I agree with them. Members of local authorities have a vast amount of experience, particularly with regard to road safety issues, which they deal with daily, and on which they lobby to get better conditions for the people they represent. While Members of the Oireachtas and MEPs are also prohibited, I do not agree with that but can see the sense in it because they are legislators. However, I cannot see the sense in prohibiting members of local authorities from being members of the road safety authority, nor does it make sense that if someone is a member of the authority and is doing a good job, and successfully stands in a local or general election, he or she is then obliged to immediately resign from the authority. This is ludicrous. It has crept into other legislation and there is no sense in it. Senator Paddy Burke said it is not compulsory to appoint someone from the Houses of the Oireachtas or from local government to the authority, but such people should not be prohibited from being members of the authority. I urge the Minister of State to consider this issue again.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the group of amendments. We encounter this issue regularly in this House. I have spoken to many Ministers on this issue who said they never noticed it until they came into this House. Nobody takes any notice of it in the D&aacute;il. It is most irritating. It is demeaning of public representatives. In effect it says we cannot trust them. On certain occasions it would be inappropriate to have Members of the Oireachtas on a board answerable directly to the Oireachtas for particular areas. We accept that, but this is not the point.</P>
    <P>I have discussed this issue many times with Senator Paddy Burke and with Senator Wilson and have chased the matter up on three occasions. What is infuriating is that this did not arise at the suggestion of a Minister, a Department head or an Accounting Officer. It is inserted by the draftsperson, who inserts it each time as a matter of rote.</P>
    <P>When I hear the same answer given every time this question is raised, I cannot believe it. It becomes literally incredible. If on this occasion or in this legislation there is a specific reason whereby it would be entirely wrong to have a member of a local authority involved, we would have to listen to the argument made by the Minister of State. As an elected Member of the Oireachtas, does the Minister of State find this demeaning? It suggests we cannot be trusted, that we are &ldquo;only politicians&rdquo;.</P><Col N="1461"/>
    <P Just="Left">We need to be more accountable in all sorts of ways and give ourselves benchmarks for ethical standards, and we do that as well as we can. We should not be debarred from holding office above any other group in the country. There might have been a case for this when this was a centrally run country, when there was no other group other than a Department of State, but there are now numerous checks and balances. It is all wrong.</P>
    <P Just="Left">I checked recently why certain people were not considered for membership of the Garda reserve. I thought initially there was no sense in debarring auctioneers and so on, and that it was ridiculous, yet realised there was a good reason for debarring certain people, because auctioneers and publicans and so on have to apply to the court, and local garda&iacute; have to say whether those people are entitled to have their licences renewed, and so on, so clearly a conflict of interest could occur. One might disagree with that, but it is a logical position to take. I can understand it and must accept the political view, though it seems a little unlikely. However, if one wants to be cleaner than clean it makes sense. I have tried to apply that kind of test when this issue arose on recent occasions in this House, and it does not apply.</P>
    <P>On three occasions this has been conceded in this House by Ministers. It was conceded by the former Minister of State, Deputy Jacob, and was conceded twice by the current T&aacute;naiste in legislation in this House. She removed that offensive item as it related to various different boards. On those occasions, an argument was made and the matter was discussed.</P>
    <P>This is not a cross-party issue or a matter of great political moment. It is a matter on which all elected politicians in the Houses can take a common view. I ask the Minister of State to accept these arguments, or at least return to the issue with a view to making changes.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the proposed amendment and agree the section is demeaning to representatives elected by the people. The section is an affront to democracy. Whatever about excluding Oireachtas Members, with which I do not agree, it makes no sense to exclude the people on the ground, local representatives who have so many responsibilities in the area of road safety, be it speed limits or whatever. I ask the Minister of State to accept the amendment. It is sensible, and there is no sense in debarring local authority members from boards.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>This is an interesting debate on an issue which has been previously discussed. When I first became a Senator some 13 or 14 years ago, I was stunned to discover that as I was a Member of the Seanad I had to resign from a couple of areas. I could not understand that. It seemed demeaning and suggested I could not be trusted.</P>
    <P>I have now come to a different conclusion. It is political parties which cannot be trusted. There is a danger that if one allowed Seanad and D&aacute;il <Col N="1462"/>Members to go onto various boards &mdash; it is not that they could not be trusted, and it is not demeaning to them, but the criticism is of the political parties &mdash; there is little doubt that if one party appointed a couple of its members on one occasion, another party would feel obliged to create a balance in another way. That applied to Members of the Oireachtas, and probably to MEPs too. However, to exclude the 900 local authority members as well is using a huge hammer to swat a fly. I have a difficulty with that. I know the vast majority of them are political appointees and there is a danger involved, but I am sure it can be overcome.</P>
    <P Just="Left">The amendment is a little sweeping because it includes all boards, but there is a balance involved, and I urge the Minister of State to listen to what Senator O&rsquo;Toole said and see if there is a way around the problem. It is something which has been conceded before, as Senator O&rsquo;Toole has noted. This could be the occasion on which the Minister of State could consider the matter again and return on Report Stage to say that local authority members can be included.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>I will not dwell on the amendment. It states clearly in the legislation that Members of the Oireachtas or the European Parliament and local authority members cannot serve on the road safety authority. I served on a local authority for 12 years and wanted to continue serving, but 1991 legislation precluded Ministers of State from serving on local authorities. I have had long experience working with local authorities since then, particularly when I served in the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, and I cannot disagree that there are fine local authority members who have a specific interest in road safety.</P>
    <P>However, this legislation provides that the road safety authority can consult widely on all aspects of road safety. There are no parameters to that. In addition, the authority can establish advisory committees that would encompass all the expertise available to it, including that of members of local authorities. The authority would not be precluded from inviting local authority members to serve as members of the advisory committees.</P>
    <P>I understand the Senators&rsquo; motivation. There is a cross-party approach to this. There could be justifiable reasons for this applying to Members of the Oireachtas or Members of the European Parliament but I ask Senators to give me an opportunity to think overnight about this and its application to members of local authorities and if we can differentiate between Members of the Oireachtas, Members of the European Parliament and members of local authorities. I accept the point that there would be no question of prescribing that the Minister had to appoint a member of a local authority or somebody recommended by the General Council of County Councils, the municipal authorities or LAMA, <Col N="1463"/>that it would be a matter for the Minister of the day and that it would not be compulsory.</P>
    <P>I want to think about this. I am aware of the strength of feeling on the issue. The Senators have made a strong point. It is not a question of them serving their electorate because local authority members are not part of the electorate of two of the Senators at this stage of their mandate. I am not trying to differentiate between the Senators; they are making a serious point and are reflecting a cross-party view in the House. I ask the House to give me an opportunity to think about the local authority members aspect and I will come back to it on Report Stage.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State&rsquo;s approach and I am happy to go along with it. I appreciate his thoughtful response. My first working involvement in politics was as a member of the road safety committee of Dublin County Council. I was wearing an educational hat. It was my introduction to sitting in a room and working with politicians. I was a young teacher at the time. I was impressed by their commitment and interest. That was 25 to 30 years ago and they were discussing new ideas such as cycle lanes and all sorts of other developments that have come into being since then.</P>
    <P>I accept the Minister of State&rsquo;s point about Members of the Oireachtas. I do not agree with him on it but I am prepared to let it pass. I will be happy if he deals with the other issue. All the members of the board are appointed by the Minister. This is a particular type of board but there are other boards to which the Minister appoints two people and other people are on the board by virtue either of their office or of being nominated by a body. It might be inappropriate to allow the ministerial nominees to be Members of the Oireachtas. That would be asking for trouble. However, what if a Member were put forward by another body by virtue of some other qualification, for example, if a person was nominated to the road safety authority by the medical profession and that person happened to be a Member of the Houses of the Oireachtas? That is the type of occurrence we should examine.</P>
    <P Just="Left">I accept that we do not want to invite a situation where boards are filled with ministerial appointees who happen to be Members of the Houses. That was never the argument. We are arguing that Members might become members of a board by virtue of wearing another hat, being from another place or having an expertise. It is the denial of expertise to the board because a member is an elected representative that is unacceptable. I appreciate the Minister of State&rsquo;s comments.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. P. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The point has been well made by Senators Cummins, Wilson, Quinn and O&rsquo;Toole. It is a cross-party issue. The Minister of State is probably genuine in saying he will give <Col N="1464"/>it serious consideration overnight. Amendments Nos. 13, 14 and 15 are intertwined. If I put the amendment to a vote, I will be unable to resubmit it on Report Stage. In view of that, I hope the Minister of State gives an honest commitment to examine this seriously. I agree with Senator O&rsquo;Toole. I accept the point with regard to Members of the Oireachtas but local authority members are central to this issue. There is no reason that they should be precluded from being on the board. They have vast experience. They might never be on the board but we, as legislators, should not bar them from it. If the Minister of State gives me that commitment, I will not press the amendments tonight but will resubmit them for Report Stage.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <TimeSt down="5" idown="4">9 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><Speaker pid="DiarmuidWilson"><NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his commitment. Senator Burke wondered if he is genuine but I have known the Minister of State for a long time. He is a genuine person and if he takes on something, he does so in good faith. He might not be able to achieve what we want but I thank him for taking time to reconsider the situation. I also thank the other Senators for their contributions on this important matter. One hears the phrase about turkeys voting for Christmas and I do not wish to do that.</P>

   <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for selecting this matter for the Adjournment. I have been asked on behalf of the board of management, the management and the staff of St. Mark&rsquo;s junior school in Springfield in Tallaght to raise an issue concerning its accommodation. Recently, the school made an application to the Department of Education and Science for two prefabs. Before Easter, to the astonishment of the school, the request for the additional accommodation was turned down.</P>
    <P>This is a growing school with 28 teachers, two speech and language therapists, a total of 30 full-time teachers, but only 24 classrooms. These are the circumstances that teachers and pupils must face every day. In the past five years, there has been a growth of 30 to 50 extra new pupils attending the school each year. Six of the 24 classrooms have been divided into two to create further accommodation. As a result, the school has lost its library because of the need to double-up on classroom space.</P>
    <P>The two existing prefabs in the school are 20 years old. They have been deemed derelict and unfit for habitation by the environmental health officer. The provision of accommodation for the breakfast and after-school clubs has been put at risk as a result of the Department&rsquo;s failure to provide this temporary accommodation. Without prefabs next year, the school will likely lose its PE hall. The Minister of State will appreciate this is essential infrastructure in a modern educational set-up. The school is situated close to a rapidly expanding area. New apartment blocks in the vicinity of the school have put additional pressure for school places. Will the Minister re-examine the school&rsquo;s request for the two prefab buildings? They are only temporary and will not solve the problem in the long term. However, their provision would give some respite to the management and staff who provide an excellent education facility for children in the area.</P>

   <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senator for raising this matter as it provides me, on behalf of the Minister for Education and Science, with an opportunity to outline the position of the Department with regard to primary school places in the Tallaght area and the position of an application for funding from St. Mark&rsquo;s junior school for additional accommodation.</P>
    <P Just="Left">At the end of last year the Department outlined its spending plans for primary and post-primary schools for 2006. With &euro;500 million to be spent on school buildings, over 1,300 projects will be active in schools. This significant investment <Col N="1466"/>will allow the Department to continue to progress its major programme of school building and modernisation which includes improving equipment needed for new technologies and ICT.</P>
    <P>St. Mark&rsquo;s junior school submitted an application to the Department of Education and Science for capital funding under the 2006 additional accommodation scheme. Following an examination of the application, a decision was taken not to approve funding for the accommodation requested because there is ample availability of vacant accommodation in schools within a reasonable distance of St. Mark&rsquo;s. The Department requires these to be fully used before it can consider providing extra accommodation in the area.</P>
    <P Just="Left">The Department&rsquo;s main responsibility is to ensure schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking school places. While this may result in pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice, the approach ensures the use of existing accommodation is maximised. The Department cannot justify unwarranted expenditure while vacant accommodation exists. It cannot justify the continued development of one school over and above others in the same area when all are funded by the State to provide a particular service between them.</P>
    <P>The Department of Education and Science is aware of significant developments planned for the Tallaght area. The school planning section is liaising with South Dublin County Council regarding future school requirements. If the school wishes, it can submit an application for capital funding for permanent accommodation. This application would be considered in the context of a strategic overview of long-term requirements for the area. The Department will be factoring in the extent of long-term provision required to be provided by St. Mark&rsquo;s junior school as it reviews ongoing developments in the area.</P>
    <P>I thank the Senator once again for raising the matter and affording the opportunity to explain why the application from St. Mark&rsquo;s junior school was refused. The long-term accommodation requirements of the school will be factored into future plans for the Tallaght area. The school was notified in March that its application would not be approved. No response has been received by the school planning section since then.</P>

   <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House this evening to take this motion. On numerous occasions I have raised the issue of Lanesboro Community College, County Longford, and the need for the Minister for Education and Science to provide an urgent and detailed update on her specific commitment to the refurbishment work at the college in light of the inordinate delay in bringing the built environment of this school to an acceptable standard in the interests of the safety of pupils and staff and to facilitate the advancement of the educational process.</P><Col N="1467"/>
    <P>This is the third time I have raised the matter of Lanesboro Community College on the Adjournment. The previous Minister for Education and Science assured me that Lanesboro would be included in the school building programme for 2005 but this did not happen.</P>
    <P>The built environment in Lanesboro Community College is appalling. The principal, staff, pupils and board of management have worked together in conditions that most of us would regard with horror. Not only have they worked in substandard conditions for years but they have done so while providing outstanding educational opportunities for their pupils. How long does the Minister expect them to continue to perform miracles?</P>
    <P Just="Left">The educational process is assisted by the built environment and lack of facilities in this day and age could seriously impede pupil progress. The students at Lanesboro deserve more, as do the hard working principal, staff and board of management. There is growing discontent among parents that the refurbishment of the college has taken so long to come to fruition and because the project has not been progressed to its final stage. There is also grave concern for the safety of all concerned as some of the building is in a dangerously substandard condition.</P>
    <P>Thankfully, in the interests of health and safety, the electrical installations were replaced last year under the summer works scheme. Despite this work, &euro;900,000 is still required, as per the Department of Education and Science&rsquo;s estimate, to bring the school to an acceptable standard.</P>
    <P>Since I raised this issue, there has been a further grant increase by the Department but to quote an old truism, actions speak louder than words and no one is more aware of the empty words of this Government than those in the education sector who have been forced to work in appalling conditions with nothing but empty promises to sustain them. Several times each year we have been called by the board of management to meetings highlighting the inadequacies at the school.</P>
    <P>The Minister should forget the empty words and promises and deliver a genuine commitment to action here this evening for Lanesboro Community College. There has been an increase in funding but it is still not enough to create a safe environment for the children and staff in the building.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I could give the short version of the answer to this matter but I should give the longer version because we must defend ourselves from suggestions that this Government has made empty promises. There have been unprecedented levels of investment by this Government over the past nine years.</P>
    <P>Dealing specifically with Lanesboro Community College, I thank the Senator for raising this matter because it affords me the opportunity <Col N="1468"/>to outline to the Seanad the proposals of the Department of Education and Science on the proposed refurbishment project at Lanesboro Community College.</P>
    <P>Modernising facilities in our 3,200 primary and 750 post-primary schools is not an easy task given the legacy of decades of underinvestment in this area, as well as the need to respond to emerging needs in areas of rapid population growth. Nonetheless, since taking office in 1997, this Government has shown a sincere determination to improve the condition of our school buildings and to ensure that the appropriate facilities are in place to enable the implementation of a broad and balanced curriculum.</P>
    <P Just="Left">In this regard this Government has invested in the largest school building programme in the history of the State. Between 1998 and the end of 2004, almost &euro;2 billion was invested in school buildings and in the region of 7,500 large and small projects were completed in schools, including 130 brand new schools and 510 large-scale refurbishments and extensions. Indeed, funding for school building and renovation projects has increased five-fold since 1997. In 2006, &euro;491 million will be spent on school building projects, compared with just &euro;92 million in 1997. The 2006 allocation is, in its own right, an increase of over 9% in real terms on the 2005 allocation.</P>
    <P>At the end of last year the Minister for Education and Science outlined the spending plans of the Department for primary and post-primary schools for 2006. With &euro;491 million to be spent on school buildings, there will be over 1,300 projects active in schools all over the country. This significant investment will allow the Department to continue the major programme of school buildings and modernisation, which includes improving equipment needed in the new technologies and ICT.</P>
    <P Just="Left">I took this opportunity to give the long answer. The short answer is specific to the issue of Lanesboro Community College. I can inform the Senator &mdash; and I would have thought he was aware of the announcement two weeks ago &mdash; that this school is among 19 post-primary school projects for which the Minister for Education and Science gave approval to proceed under the most recent capital programme roll-out announcement last week. I appreciate the Senator is looking after his own area but funding has been approved.</P>
    <P>The additional funding, totalling &euro;13.6 million, secured for the school building and modernisation programme in the Revised Estimates will allow schools, including Lanesboro, to press ahead with their refurbishment and modernisation projects immediately. In each of the schools concerned the CEO, including the CEO of Longford VEC, will be contacted directly by the building section of the Department of Education and Science shortly with details of how to proceed with their projects.</P>
    <P Just="Left">I thank the Senator again for giving me the opportunity to outline the major capital prog<Col N="1469"/>ramme that is in place and the unprecedented levels of investment in recent years. I hope that Lanesboro Community College can move forward at the earliest opportunity.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State did not give the exact figure announced two weeks ago. I am referring to the Department of Education and Science estimates for the funding necessary to bring the school up to an acceptable standard of building and there is still a shortfall in funding for Lanesboro Community College. The Minister of State might look at this to ensure funding is put in place to provide a safe environment for the children of the area. Parents and the board of management have contacted me and other public representatives from Longford to secure adequate funding to provide the necessary facilities for the safety of their children.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>I will relate that view to the Minister but I know Senator Bannon is glad that the decision has been taken and that progress will be made.</P>

    <Title>Human Trafficking</Title>
   <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Ms White</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for taking this matter on the Adjournment. I am asking the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to outline his plans for specific legislation to outlaw the abhorrent trafficking of women for sex, as recommended in the report of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na working group on trafficking in human beings, published on 5 May 2006.</P>
    <P>The trafficking of human beings for sexual exploitation is not a new phenomenon, but in recent times it has become a problem for Ireland on a scale never seen before. I understand that the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is in the process of preparing legislation to bring Ireland into compliance with EU directives and that legislation to make human trafficking for sexual exploitation a specific offence is forthcoming. I wish to underline the seriousness of the problem and to implore the Minister to introduce legislation. We have slipped up in not implementing the EU directives before now. We need legislation that will not only punish those responsible but will also facilitate the prevention and reporting of this appalling crime.</P>
    <P>As immigration becomes a normal feature of Irish life, we must be careful that we do not create a culture where immigrants who have been brought into this country illegally are afraid to come forward to report that they are being abused and exploited. We must not allow our immigration policy to prevent us from ensuring that the human rights of every person in our jurisdiction are protected to the maximum extent possible. This is never more important than when considering the plight faced by young women brought into this country illegally to work in the sex trade. We must combat the misconception <Col N="1470"/>that this trade is one that women enter into of their own free will.</P>
    <P>Often, young women are taken from their homes and families in eastern Europe, seduced by the promise of a better life, only to be reduced to slavery by evil people. The young women are told that members of their family will be killed if they try to escape and they are fed lies about what the Irish authorities will do if they go to them for help.</P>
    <P>We must ensure that everyone in Ireland knows that their rights are absolute and that they will be treated with compassion and respect by the authorities. Creating such an environment necessitates acknowledging that the trafficking of human beings for sex is an issue in Ireland, alerting all Irish people to the problem, explaining the seriousness of the situation and the appalling abuse of women and children that the sex trade entails and encouraging people to report any suspicions they may have.</P>
    <P>I implore the Minister to do everything in his power to create a situation where victims of sex trafficking are treated as victims and not criminals. We must stamp out the sex trade in Ireland immediately.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator White for raising this important issue and for giving me the opportunity to respond on behalf of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform who could not be here tonight, for which he sends his apologies to the House and to Senator White.</P>
    <P>I wish to make clear to the House the Government&rsquo;s commitment to dealing with trafficking in human beings. Human trafficking is a form of modern-day slavery. It is a growing international crime which has become a major global business for organised crime groups and networks.</P>
    <P>I assure the House that action is being taken to combat this crime, which is being taken very seriously by my Department and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is very proactive in this area and from its intelligence gathering, surveillance and investigations to date, it reports that there is no evidence to suggest that trafficking of persons into Ireland for the purposes of sexual exploitation is widespread. To date, Garda operations have uncovered a small number of trafficking cases.</P>
    <P Just="Left">The international evidence also supports this view. In the recently published United Nations report, Trafficking in Persons: Global Patterns, Ireland ranks at the low end of destination or transit countries in western Europe. However, we are still at risk. While the incidence of trafficking in Ireland to date is limited, we face the same threats as those faced by many other countries worldwide.</P>
    <P>Garda&iacute; take a proactive approach and are ever vigilant to ensure that any allegations relating to the trafficking of women for sexual exploitation are vigorously investigated. While evidence of the involvement of criminal gangs in the trafficking or smuggling of non-nationals into the State is <Col N="1471"/>scarce, a number of specific operations have been put in place with a view to the prevention and detection of any such activity. These operations are ongoing.</P>
    <P Just="Left">On 5 May I published the report, to which Senator White referred, of the working group on human trafficking comprising representatives of my Department and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. It is very informative with regard to the situation in Ireland and the State&rsquo;s response to this issue on a number of fronts, including immigration controls, law enforcement activity, protection of victims and legislation. The report is clear evidence that my Department and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are committed to tackling trafficking in human beings at a national level and to working with our European Union and other colleagues to tackle it internationally.</P>
    <P>The Minister recently launched a poster campaign to assist in addressing the trafficking issue. This campaign, which is facilitated by Crimestoppers, will help raise awareness of trafficking among the general public. It will also provide an important point of contact for those who may be victims of, or vulnerable to, this insidious crime. The posters are being displayed at airports, ports, bus and railway stations, among other places. Anyone who phones the free telephone number, 1800 25 00 25, can be assured that the call is anonymous, safe and free of charge. Victims of trafficking, or anyone with knowledge of trafficking activities, should not be afraid to contact the authorities for assistance. In this campaign, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Department and the International Organisation for Migration are available to provide whatever assistance is necessary to victims who come to their attention.</P>
    <P>Members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na attend relevant international meetings to facilitate the exchange of information on best practice between EU member states, Europol and Interpol and to devise strategies capable of combating immigration-related criminality, including trafficking in human beings. The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has also built up a network of bilateral contacts and participates in operations to combat trafficking activity.</P>
    <P>Members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na also participate in the Interpol working group on trafficking in women and children. This group has developed a best practice manual which provides practical guidelines for investigators. The manual is laid <Col N="1472"/>out in a structured way to assist the investigator in identifying and locating advice on specific issues. Meetings of the working group are attended by members of Garda specialist units.</P>
    <P>A training programme has been prepared for delivery to key Garda personnel throughout the State. The programme has been designed to enable members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to identify victims of trafficking who they may encounter in the course of their duties and fully understand the complexity of the phenomenon. It is also designed to ensure that victims receive appropriate assistance from all the relevant agencies.</P>
    <P>Legislation creating an offence of trafficking in persons for the specific purpose of sexual or labour exploitation is contained in the draft Criminal Justice (Trafficking in Persons and Sexual Offences) Bill. This Bill will comply with the EU framework decision on combating trafficking in persons for the purpose of their sexual or labour exploitation and will also fulfil the criminal law requirements of two other international trafficking instruments, including the 2005 Council of Europe convention on action against trafficking in human beings.</P>
    <P Just="Left">The Minister circulated the general scheme of the Bill to the Attorney General&rsquo;s office and interested Departments last week for their views. He intends to seek Government approval to its drafting within the next two weeks. He expects to publish the Bill later this year.</P>
    <P>There can be no doubt about the Government&rsquo;s commitment to deal with this issue. While we are taking steps to improve our response to it, we have considerable scope for dealing with the issue of trafficking within the current legislative framework. The Minister, the Department and the Garda will continue to work vigorously to prevent trafficking, prosecute traffickers and protect victims.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Ms White</NameTxt>
	<P>I would not have known about this serious issue but for the fact that it was raised on the television programme &ldquo;Prime Time Investigates&rdquo; two weeks ago, which showed a young girl in tears saying she was raped. The programme named and showed the apartments in Dublin 4 where that was happening. I said in the House a week ago and repeat now that I am ashamed of the Irish men who treat women in that manner. I thank the Minister of State for the sincere way in which he has dealt with this issue.</P>
