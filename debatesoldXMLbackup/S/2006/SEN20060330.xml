	<P>I have received notice from Senator Norris that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to establish an independent telephone line for relatives of missing persons after the vacuum created by the demise of the joint service offered in tandem with Victim Support.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Bradford of the following matter:</P>
      <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to provide additional accommodation at Presentation secondary school, Mitchelstown, County Cork.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

	<P>Some time ago the issue was raised in the House of a clinic in County Clare involved in unorthodox practices in the treatment of cancer patients. Subsequently, the clinic was closed down. One must be concerned at recent developments in stem cell treatment offered in the Cork area. Patients with multiple sclerosis, MS, are attending a clinic in County Cork and paying over &euro;20,000 for three hours treatment using a technology developed in Switzerland.</P>
      <P>The Multiple Sclerosis Society of Ireland and the Irish Institute of Clinical Neuroscience have complained about the treatment. The condition of MS can have periods of remission. People availing of this technology may feel they have <Col N="454"/>benefited as a result when it is actually the normal sequence of the illness. I welcome the news that the Medical Council will investigate the treatment. The research into the technology has not been fully explored.</P>
      <P>The chief executive of the Health Service Executive is today appearing before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children. There is no doubt that many questions will be asked of the situation concerning accident and emergency wards. It is worrying that the Irish Nurses Organisation stated over 400 people were waiting on trolleys in accident and emergency wards yesterday. Last year at the Progressive Democrats&rsquo; conference, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children said she would end the queues for accident and emergency departments the same as she did for the dole queues. So far it has been a total failure.</P>
      <P>It is admitted that more GPs working after-hours are needed as well as X-ray and other services. We need to change the logistical approach to health service provision. I am amazed that a T&aacute;naiste who has been a part of the Government for nine years can attribute the upsurge in patients at accident and emergency wards to a winter flu epidemic and the winter vomiting bug. It was the same last year. We must be able to handle the logistics to cater for these events. Although it is laudable that extra beds will be provided in accident and emergency departments, where will they go if the wards are clogged up? Will new structures be built?</P>
      <P>Discussions must take place with the trade unions if changes are going to be introduced. However, no discussions have taken place. It is a horrible critique that we are a cash-rich society yet our quality of life has suffered as a result. When will we get to grips with the accident and emergency situation? On her appointment as Minister for Health and Children, the T&aacute;naiste drew up a ten-point plan and appeared on television and radio claiming it was a new dawn for the health service. Unfortunately, we now have a worse situation. It is time the Government got to grips with it by way of a more logical approach.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>This morning, I received a copy of the annual report of an Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga. F&aacute;ilt&iacute;m roimh an tuairisc. T&aacute; s&eacute; thar a bheith t&aacute;bhachtach go mbeadh d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht againn ar an m&eacute;id sin. Ba mhaith liom iachall a chur ar an Leader. D&rsquo;iarras uirthi an mh&iacute; seo caite go mbeadh d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht againn. I would like to have a full debate on the report which contains an interesting description of the placenames order, which could lead to a bit of fun. We should examine it.</P>
      <P Just="Left">On a related matter, the Leader will recall that during her time as Minister for Education there were various difficulties in terms of teaching Irish and Irish language resources. As Minister, she established a group to examine those matters, which issued its conclusions during the period of <Col N="455"/>office of one of her successors as Minister, Deputy Martin.</P>
      <P>It was decided to establish a special centre in Baile Bhuirne in west Cork to provide Irish language teaching to support Gaeltacht schools, gaelscoileanna and ordinary schools teaching aspects of their curriculum through Irish. The idea was to use these most up-to-date methods and creative approaches, including information technology. That decision was taken by the Government in 1999 and money was made available for it.</P>
      <P>The sod was turned by the following Minister for Education, Deputy Woods. It was also supported by the succeeding Minister, Deputy Noel Dempesy, as well as the current Minister, Deputy Hanafin. Nothing has happened, however, and I have been wondering why. I would like the Minister for Education and Science to attend the House to explain this to us. I have become aware that people within the Department of Education and Science are trying to block this project, as are people within the Irish language association, despite the fact that it has the full support of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta. It even has the full support of my friend the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, as well as the various Irish language bodies established on an all-Ireland basis.</P>
      <P Just="Left">This project is not happening because some people think that Baile Bhuirne is too far from Dublin and that nothing could happen that far away from the capital that could be any good. This is the most important thing that could happen to the Irish language but I believe there is uisce faoi thalamh here. Somebody is undermining a Government decision and I would like to know why. I have become aware that a submission made to the Department in the last month from An Chomhairle um Oideachais Gaeltachta agus Gaelscola&iacute;ochta does not reflect the views of 80% of the people who sit on the board of that particular group, which advises the Department. There is something going on which we must examine. I would like the Minister to outline all the facts concerning this case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Cuirfidh s&eacute; seo d&iacute;om&aacute; ar an Teach. M&aacute;s g&aacute; le duine d&eacute;ile&aacute;il leis an chuid den Roinn Oideachais agus Eola&iacute;ochta a l&aacute;imhse&aacute;lann scol&aacute;ireachta&iacute; do dhaoine &oacute;ga &oacute; ghaelscoileanna agus &oacute; na Gaeltachta&iacute;, faigheann s&eacute; comhfhreagras uathu as Gaoluinn amh&aacute;in. Nuair a ghlaonn duine ar an ionad ina nd&eacute;antar an obair sin, &aacute;fach, is &eacute; an ch&eacute;ad rud d&aacute; dtarla&iacute;onn n&aacute; go ndeireann duine &eacute;igin, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, I would prefer to do this with you through English. My Irish isn&rsquo;t that good&rdquo;. T&aacute; comhfhreagras &aacute; chur amach &oacute;n Roinn Oideachais agus Eola&iacute;ochta i nGaoluinn amh&aacute;in in ainneoin nach mb&iacute;onn daoine &aacute;balta comhr&aacute; a bheith acu sa teanga. Is &eacute; an t-aon fh&aacute;th go bhfuaireas &eacute; sin amach n&aacute; gur cheapas gur ch&oacute;ir dom d&eacute;ile&aacute;il leo as Gaoluinn. I thought I should speak to these people through Irish since <Col N="456"/>they wrote to me in Irish but they said they were sorry and could not do their business through Irish. N&iacute;l ach tr&iacute; f&aacute;n gc&eacute;ad de na daoine at&aacute; ag obair sa Roinn Oideachais agus Eola&iacute;ochta &aacute;balta gn&oacute; a dheanamh tr&iacute; Ghaeilge.</P>
      <P>Let us make up our minds. Senator O&rsquo;Toole and I disagree occasionally about details on this subject. The use of resources to support our language is entirely lacking in any sense of strategy or priority. It should be automatic that if one telephones the Department of Education and Science to deal with anything to do with the Irish language or supports for it, those on the receiving end of such calls should be able to do business through Irish. Otherwise, it is an exercise in the most extraordinary, institutionalised hypocrisy, although I am reluctant to use such a term. Such supports are long overdue.</P>
      <P>A report by a study group appeared in yesterday&rsquo;s newspapers to the effect that 70% of all poultry used in the catering industry comes from outside Ireland and outside the European Union. The report was not too precise as to how much of it emanates from outside the EU but the statistic is an extraordinary one. This has nothing to do with economic nationalism but how can people have any confidence in the quality and safety of such a universal food product if it is coming from outside the EU in particular? It is an extraordinary situation. Yesterday, we had a good debate on the future of agriculture and related matters. If, by dint of poor standards, protection or labelling, we are allowing people to be fed in large quantities with poultry from outside the country without any indication to the consumer, we might as well forget about what we are supposed to be doing.</P>
      <P>I ask the Leader to arrange for a debate on the Middle East where the most extraordinary things are happening. This morning, I read a statement from Hamas which is a long way from the rhetoric of that organisation six months ago in terms of what it wishes to do. It would be a great tragedy if the changes that have occurred in Israel, including the changes in the occupied territories, were to be allowed to turn into a stalemate in which chaos developed.</P>
      <P Just="Left">If the West abandons Hamas, others will provide the resources to sustain it. It will not simply collapse because other people will happily come in to sustain it. I want to hear our Government&rsquo;s views on the situation. I hope those views will be more far-sighted than those of the European Union because we need to develop some subtlety in this respect. The simple-minded repetition of phrases such as &ldquo;recognise Israel and abandon violence&rdquo; is too simplistic in a complicated situation where Hamas sees the Israelis as aggressors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMinihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Minihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I join with Senator Finucane in highlighting the issue of stem cell treatment in Cork being administered by a GP practice. I welcome the fact that the Irish Medicines Board is <Col N="457"/>investigating the matter. Senator Finucane highlighted what has happened in County Clare and I am sure all Members of the House will join in supporting his remarks.</P>
      <P>With regard to the accident and emergency situation, we can plan logistics but we are dependent on people implementing those plans. At times, from this side of the House, one would feel&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>Who is the Senator blaming now?</P>
    </Speaker>

    <P Italics="Y">(Interruptions).</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMinihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Minihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The sickness of family members and constituents is not confined to the Opposition benches. If we felt for one moment that continuing to throw money at the health service would bring about the necessary reforms, we would do so. It has been proven in the past, however, that it does not work. We will hold our nerve on this issue and bring about a proper health service through the necessary reforms.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMinihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Minihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to highlight the area of funding for post-leaving certificate courses. I ask the Leader to organise a debate on funding and support for such courses. I am somewhat fearful that this educational sector is falling between the cracks. In the run up to the Estimates later this year, we should have a general debate on that issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Leader inform us when it is intended to publish the judicial council Bill, which I understand exists in draft form and is meant to deal with sentencing guidelines? As we know, the judicial system has a complete lack of uniformity. The Bill will also deal with disciplinary procedures, where necessary, for judges, <Col N="458"/>the education and training of judges and a judicial council. Will it be a Seanad Bill?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>The Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Affairs has taken a lead role in advancing the concept of a European day, to be held on 10 May. Initially, the proposal was that only the Lower House would be involved in this event. Yesterday, it again came up for discussion at the joint committee and, as I informed the Cathaoirleach, I objected to a European day unless it reflects both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid=""><NameTxt>Senators</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>I want the support of this House on this matter, of which the Cathaoirleach is aware. The Leader should take a lead. The exercise is to raise awareness of European issues at national level, and we may get RTE coverage to do so. This event on 10 May would provide an opportunity to link European affairs with everyday issues. We discuss directives such as the nitrates directive and the services directive. However, when I read the newspapers I do not see anything to indicate what is happening in Europe. It is important that both Houses of the Oireachtas are represented on European day on 10 May. This issue must be debated with the Whips. This is a once-off trial and if it is a success we will have a European day every year. I want this House to endorse the position that we do not progress unless both Houses are involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to add my voice to that of Senator Ormonde. She did a great job yesterday in arguing the case regarding European day, 10 May. There was a danger, which I believe has now passed, that this House would have been excluded. There is a great need to sell the benefits of Europe. Too often we hear criticism of Europe while we do not hear the benefits. European day will give us an opportunity to do so. I congratulate Senator Ormonde on the strength with which she expressed that yesterday.</P>
      <P>Last week we congratulated the Minister for Education and Science on investment in science and technology. If science, particularly technology, is to advance it must show its use to customers. This Government does not appear to use the technology available to it from throughout the world. I will give three examples of such technology. Cameras are now available to identify and read number plates of cars. This is a major advance in the area of crime and stolen cars. I have seen these cameras working. They are used elsewhere to deal with speeding and are capable of being used to identify cars starting a journey which can be caught at the end of that journey. This technology has not been used. The Government should invest in it.</P>
      <P>I saw on television a measure in Britain on which the first court cases were heard this week. Police there regularly carry a camera called a <Col N="459"/>&ldquo;head camera&rdquo;. An amount of behaviour changes when people see the police have these head cameras. It is extremely modern technology which has just been introduced and I believe it can now be used as evidence in court in Britain. We have spoken about electronic tagging for years but have not introduced it. It is a marvellous way of reducing the number of people in prison. They can go about their lives and yet be under control. This Government should identify modern technology capable of being used to benefit the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>In 1991, Ireland was in the middle of a local election campaign. As we know, local elections are the bedrock of our democracy. At 1 a.m. on May 25 that year, democracy was dealt a severe blow when a member of Donegal County Council and a candidate in the elections was brutally murdered. I refer to Councillor Eddie Fullerton, who was home with his wife Dinah at the time. A group of men burst into the house and took his life. His son, Albert, who was leading the campaign for justice for his father, died in recent months in a car accident.</P>
      <P>Last year, Donegal County Council unanimously passed a resolution calling for an independent inquiry and asked the Irish Government to get the British authorities to co-operate. The reason I raise this matter is the perception abroad that because Councillor Fullerton was a republican activist, he is not high on the priority list for investigation. I would like Members to state that this House should support Donegal County Council when it seeks justice for one of its members. As we asked the British authorities in the past, we should now seek an independent inquiry and show the Fullerton family and all public representatives that democracy is well served by this State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with the acting leader of the Opposition, Senator Finucane, that the health service in this country is in total chaos. Senator Minihan had a drowning man&rsquo;s grip on the PDs and the T&aacute;naiste when he spoke on this issue. The system is still top-heavy with administrators. We have too few doctors, nurses and beds in our hospitals. That is the bottom line and where the problem lies.</P>
      <P>The Government abolished the health boards, stating at the time that they were the problem, and established the Health Service Executive. The problem persists and the Government has failed to address the situation. People throughout the country feel let down by the manner in which the T&aacute;naiste manages the Department of Health and Children. They are waiting in the long grass to make a statement at the next general election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Senator asking a question?</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="460"/>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>On another issue, crime is out of control throughout the country. The Leader knows it is a serious problem in the midlands in particular. What people must put up with in terms of crime in rural Ireland is highlighted daily in national and local newspapers, local radio stations and, yesterday, on national radio stations. Break-ins are an everyday occurrence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>People are fed up. We were promised 2,000 extra garda&iacute; in the run up to the last election. This has not happened and is why law and order is out of control in rural Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Senator have a question? Statements cannot be made on the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>The way this Government handles the crime issue is a shame and an indictment on the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMinihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Minihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator&rsquo;s numbers are not correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Minihan should not discuss getting numbers right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government is wrong and creates untruth about this issue day in and day out. The Government has no answers and it should be ashamed of itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>It would have served Senator Bannon to have attended this morning&rsquo;s meeting of the Joint Committee on Health and Children and heard the T&aacute;naiste and Professor Drumm explain the situation. What is happening is eye-opening and the Senator is fearful of a solution to the issue because it is his biggest&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>That is outrageous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator should withdraw that remark.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the proposal by Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; on the Eddie Fullerton case. An elected public representative was assassinated in collaboration with forces in Northern Ireland. This must be fully exposed and a full public inquiry must take place into his assassination. He deserves no less and we, as Members of the Oireachtas, are entitled to put forward that proposal. I fully support it and it should be a unanimous decision of this House.</P>
      <P>I also support Senator Ryan&rsquo;s request to the Leader of the House that No. 13, statements on the current situation in the Middle East, be resumed after the Easter recess because of the developing situation in Israel and Palestine. Israel has a new government and Palestine has a Hamas-led government. Hamas must recognise <Col N="461"/>the right of the Israeli people to exist and have their own country. A Hamas lawmaker repeated Hamas&rsquo;s slogan yesterday that the Koran is its constitution, jihad is its way and death for the sake of God is its highest aspiration. That rhetoric must stop. We have a role to play in inviting all sides in the Middle East to come to Ireland. This would be the place for a solution to come about between Palestine and Israel. We should provide the facilities for such a peace conference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I call Senator Norris. Is Senator Norris offering to speak?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Allow Senator Norris to speak without interruption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator brought that one on himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Can we have some respect for the Cathaoirleach please?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Thank you, Senator Norris. Allow Senator Norris to speak without interruption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>A report appeared in the newspapers on Tuesday to the effect that the Taoiseach is considering giving a walk-over election to a representative of emigrant groups, and apparently a candidate has put himself forward. I would welcome such representation but I wonder why the Taoiseach did not use his power of nomination if he is so concerned about representation of this important group. He has 11 nominees.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>It is a pity the real election should be subverted in this way but it highlights the fact that the majority of seats in this House are in the grip of the principal political parties. I recall a time in this House when candidates from various parties were brought into a room and sat over to ensure they voted in the way their parties dictated. It is time we considered the method of election here.</P>
      <P>I agree strongly with Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; about the case of Mr. Fullerton. It is said he was a republican activist. I do not know what exactly that covers but that does not matter. If people engage in activities on the fringes of the law it is up to us to examine them. I do not know whether he engaged in such activities but he was an elected public representative. There is no more sinister or dangerous attack on democracy than the murder of an elected public representative. There should be an inquiry into this matter, wherever that may lead. It is not helpful for Senator Leyden to conclude already that this was an instance of collusion with the British army. Those matters should be left for a full and proper independent inquiry to determine. If it leads in <Col N="462"/>that direction that is very sinister but it is much better to have it out in the open, whoever is responsible.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Minihan that it is important for the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children to hold her nerve. I will support her in so doing. She chose this job, very courageously, 18 months ago. I have not heard any satisfactory immediate solution proposed on any side. This is a tough situation with systemic disorder in the health service which needs to be studied radically but there are no instant solutions.</P>
      <P>The situation in accident and emergency units is regrettable, awful and tragic in some circumstances because people have died in corridors and so on. As a society we do not accept that. I accept, however, that the Minister is attempting to address this situation and we should encourage and support her. If there are real ideas on this side of the House to improve the health facilities provided for citizens we should make them available in a proper discussion and see where we can go with them. Playing political football with people&rsquo;s health does not assist anybody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>We could make many suggestions if there was a willingness to carry them out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrMauriceHayes"><NameTxt>Dr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I strongly support Senator Ormonde&rsquo;s request for a debate recognising Europe day. It is unimaginable that the Oireachtas would have a Europe day in which the Seanad is not involved. I agree too that we should not discuss esoteric matters such as the constitution but the real impact the EU makes on the lives of ordinary citizens.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Like Senator Minihan, I am concerned by the unregulated use of stem cell treatment. Can the Leader ascertain whether the Department of Health and Children was to bring forward guidelines on stem cell treatment and research?</P>
      <P>I support Senator Norris&rsquo;s point that the health administration is an extremely complex structure and we do not make life easier for ourselves or anybody else by trying to oversimplify it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFeighan"><NameTxt>Mr. Feighan</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like the Leader to invite the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to outline the measures he intends to take to stop the growth of pyramid schemes. Yesterday, we heard that a pyramid scheme with over 1,000 investors has collapsed. The same issues arose in Cork over two months ago.</P>
      <P>It is a serious situation because there are many naive people, including maybe politicians, who think they can make a quick buck through these schemes. Large sums of money are being lost. These people have been subjected to aggressive on-line salesmanship. It is a widespread problem and many middle-income earners in suburbia are losing large sums of money. Perhaps a hotline could be set up which people could telephone to check out a scheme, not to check its bona fides <Col N="463"/>because there probably are none. At least people could satisfy themselves that they will not go deeply into debt. Three people in my constituency invested in the Meath scheme and lost money. There must be many embarrassed people around the country who will not come forward. Maybe now is the time to stop these schemes.</P>

	<P>Does the Senator have a question for the Leader?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, I was about to invite the Leader to comment on the headlines in the national newspapers this morning which prove beyond doubt that Ireland enjoys the lowest tax regime in the world. Even the editorial in the <i>Irish Independent</i> somewhat grudgingly acknowledged that we have got it right. It might be useful to hear such constructive comments in this House, as well as criticism of the Government.</P>
      <P>I wish to endorse Senator Ryan&rsquo;s comments on the importation of chickens. This is a serious health and safety issue. The newspaper report states that it is mainly sandwich bars and takeaways, and other unconventional retail outlets which import these chickens. They come from countries that have no regulatory regime.</P>
      <P>We are familiar with the comments of Senator Quinn in this regard. He is to be complimented on being one of those who in another context introduced traceability for meat. The consumer has responded positively to that initiative. The Leader could invite the relevant Minister into the House to explain Government policy on this issue, particularly in regard to avian flu. This is a serious health and safety issue. I do not suggest that people stop going to sandwich bars and takeaways or stop eating the chicken served there but this issue raises questions about the importation of this form of poultry.</P>

	<P>I thank Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; for raising the issue of Councillor Eddie Fullerton, a matter we raised here last year. When the family was here, Albert Fullerton, the man who died three weeks ago, said that if his father or the family had been big shots they would not have been ignored and there would have been an inquiry into the death. For too long we have been oblivious to the sensibilities of the Nationalist and republican community. It would be great if all <Col N="464"/>Members of this House supported Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; and call for a full public inquiry into the death of Councillor Eddie Fullerton.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>Senators O&rsquo;Toole and Ryan raised issues regarding the attitude and competence of the Department of Education and Science in dealing with customers through Irish. I have a vague recollection of what Senator O&rsquo;Toole is referring to, the Ballyvourney initiative taken some years ago, of which I have no knowledge other than that. However, I would like it explored in the Seanad Chamber or in committee. I have no idea what happened subsequent to the launching of that initiative but I remember it.</P>
      <P>Senator Ryan spoke of the lack of competence of staff in the Department of Education and Science in dealing with customers through Irish. I am not familiar with the evidence for that but the allegation should not go unchallenged.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald"><NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
	<P>I believe the Seanad would welcome the opportunity to have the Minister for Education and Science in the Chamber to deal with the issue and with the related issue referred to by Senator O&rsquo;Toole. The matter could also be raised at committee level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Finucane, acting leader of the Opposition, raised the matter of the private stem cell research clinic in Cork and said the technology used there to treat various diseases such as multiple sclerosis was not necessarily effective. An unregulated system currently operates there. As Senator Minihan said, the Irish Medicines Board has taken up the matter.</P>
      <P>Senator Minihan also spoke of the accident and emergency crisis. We will deal with that later as varying views were expressed. I understand that the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, and Professor Drumm, have been attending the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children this morning from 9.30 a.m. and taking questions. I trust there will be a positive outcome from that.</P>
      <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole spoke, not for the first time, about Ballyvourney. Nothing has happened since the sod was turned on the facility there to assist the teaching of Irish, in whatever grade of school in which it is being taught, and that seems extraordinary. No aids for teachers of Irish have resulted from Ballyvourney, and Senator O&rsquo;Toole would like the Minister for Education and Science to discuss the matter in this House. The Senator asked if Ballyvourney was being neglected because of being too far from Dublin, and if administrators believed that anything good for education could come only from within the<?oasys _jy ?>Pale.</P>
      <P>Senator Ryan supported Senator O&rsquo;Toole and also spoke of the inability of some civil servants to carry out business through Irish, particularly <Col N="465"/>in the Department of Education and Science, in regard to queries relating to Irish. I understand that Senator Ryan himself tried to carry out business in Irish with a civil servant and was unsuccessful. I suppose we can praise the honesty of the civil servant admitting to being unable to do business through Irish, but that does not take from the Senator&rsquo;s valid point.</P>
      <P>Senator Ryan also noted that 70% of poultry sold in Irish shops comes from outside the country. That is fearsome. A well-known Irish supermarket chain currently has advertisements saying all its fowl are Irish, and it can provide documentation to prove that. I asked the young manager in my local store what was meant by that and he said the poultry farmers suppling the store can provide customers with the documentation, and the store can put the customer through to any of its poultry suppliers to get authentication. I said that was very positive and worth following up.</P>
      <P>Regarding the Middle East debate, Senator Ryan said that if the West abandons Hamas, others will step in, which they will. Senator Minihan said we would hold our nerve on health issues and he is right in principle, but it is difficult if someone has a person dear to them being discommoded or seriously inconvenienced, as are some people.</P>
      <P>Senator Minihan also raised the issue of funding for post leaving certificate courses. A debate on youth affairs, requested by Senator MacSharry, will take place next week and one could raise that issue then because the Minister of State, Deputy de Valera, is in charge of the PLC area of the Department of Education and Science.</P>
      <P>Senator Coghlan will be waiting some time for the judicial council Bill as it is on the C list and will be published later this year, not immediately. We are endeavouring to get it as a Seanad Bill.</P>
      <P>Well done to Senator Ormonde for standing up for the joint committee on which she sits. It was ridiculous for someone to propose that only the Lower House would be involved in the Europe day, and Senator Ormonde was backed up by Senator Quinn who said she made a strong case. The Seanad was the Chamber which brought in MEPs to address it, so we might consider that again for the Europe day.</P>
<?oasys _dc14- ?>
      <P>I agree discussions should not all be about the EU constitution and matters which are not of everyday relevance to ordinary folk. We might discuss, for example, how directives are prepared and at what stage elected representatives take part in the debate and in what committees they partake. This House led the way with the Standing Order to allow MEPs to attend, and they have given us great value. I thank Senator Ormonde for ensuring this House will have a proper Europe day debate on 10 May. The Senator also referred to the issue of research and development.</P>
<?oasys _dc0- ?>
      <P>Senator Quinn spoke of what is termed &ldquo;head cameras&rdquo; used by police in Britain. Such cameras <Col N="466"/>would be very offputting to people inclined to wreak damage of one kind or another. The Senator also spoke of electronic tagging, a matter on which people might have different views.</P>
      <P>Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; spoke of the murder in 1991 of Councillor Eddie Fullerton, whom I knew. He was a fine elected representative. The Senator said the Seanad should give firm direction to an independent inquiry into his death.</P>
      <P>Senator Bannon said the health system was top-heavy with administrators. He also mentioned the Garda numbers. By the time the general election is called, the number of garda&iacute; referred to in the programme for Government will have been reached, so Senator Bannon will not have that as a plank in Longford-Westmeath.</P>

	<P>Senator Leyden would like to invite members of all sides of the Middle East conflict to come to Ireland for a peace conference. That is a good idea. Senator Norris asked about a seat in the Seanad for an emigrants&rsquo; representative. He knows as much about it as I do. The Taoiseach did not talk to me about it. I made an inquiry in his office and there appears to be no movement on it. We know only what we read in <i>The Irish Times,</i> so we need not hold our breath.</P>
      <P>Senator Norris spoke of the late Councillor Eddie Fullerton, an elected representative. He agreed with Senator Minihan that the T&aacute;naiste should hold her nerve as there is no immediate solution to the health problems.</P>
      <P>Senator Maurice Hayes was greatly in favour of a Europe day. He spoke too about the unregulated use of stem cell research, the issue raised by Senator Finucane. The Senator supports Senator Norris in a constructive Opposition approach to health issues.</P>
      <P>Senator Feighan raised the issue of the pyramid schemes in County Meath. He said a hot line should be set up which people could ring to check out a scheme, not to check the bona fides because there probably is none. Everyone should be aware of <i>caveat emptor</i>.</P>
      <P>Senator Mooney said Ireland enjoys the lowest tax regime in the world. One will not hear that praise from the Opposition. I thank the Senator for raising the issue. It is the main headline in today&rsquo;s national newspapers. If the main headline was that we had the worst tax regime in the world, the Opposition would be jumping up and down.</P>
      <P>Senator Ryan and others raised the issue of the importation of poultry. It is an important industry issue to which I have already referred.</P><Col N="467"/>
      <P>Senator White supported the call for a public inquiry into the death of Councillor Eddie Fullerton and said that if he or his family were what had been termed &ldquo;big shots&rdquo;&mdash; we all understand the term &mdash; there would be a move to do something on the case.</P>
      <P>Senator Fitzgerald raised the issue of the lack of competence to deal with queries through Irish in the Department of Education and Science. That is a mater we should raise with the Minister.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 2 seeks to correct the wording of section 3 in order that the meaning is fully clear.

      <P LI="1">In page 16, subsection (1)(<i>b</i>)(II), lines 8 and 9, after &ldquo;torture&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">The definition of &ldquo;torture&rdquo; in Irish law is fairly narrow and the Minister is proposing to narrow it even further in the Criminal Justice (Mutual Assistance) Bill. His proposed amendment to the definition is not appropriate and I ask him to reconsider it. The purpose of this amendment is to broaden the definition of &ldquo;torture&rdquo; in the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The intention of Senator Tuffy&rsquo;s amendment is to add to the grounds on which mutual legal assistance would be refused. The amendment proposes that mutual legal assistance would be refused if there were reasonable grounds for believing that such assistance might result in the person being subjected to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, in addition to him or her being subjected to torture.</P>
      <P>The amendment is unnecessary given that section 3(2) defines torture as used in this section by reference to the meaning given it by the 2002 Act. The Criminal Justice Act 2000 gives effect to the convention against torture and other cruel, inhumane and degrading treatment or punishment. Article 1.2 of the convention defines torture.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Bill refers at section 3(1)(ii)(III) to assistance not being provided if it would otherwise contravene the European Convention on Human Rights and provides for assistance to be refused if providing it would contravene that convention. The European Convention on Human Rights provides at Article 3 that nobody should be subjected to torture or to inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment. The matter is already covered, therefore, by the terms of the European Convention on Human Rights.</P>

	<P>The Senator is referring to anticipated amendments in the Criminal Justice Bill which is before the other House and in that context I do not want to anticipate the debate in that House.

    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendment No. 4 is a Government amendment. Amendments Nos. 4, 5, 7 to 11, inclusive, and 14 are related and may be discussed together by agreement. Is that agreed? Agreed. There is a printing error in amendment No. 7; a comma is missing.</P>
      <P el="5">Government amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P LI="1" el="5">In page 19, subsection (1)(<i>c</i>), lines 23 to 25, to delete &ldquo;and in relation to which the information requested can be provided by the financial institution concerned within a reasonable time,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">The amendments proposed are being put forward following further discussions with the Irish Bankers Federation and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na since the Bill was published. The majority are technical amendments intended to clarify the meaning of the provisions in the Bill and to facilitate full compliance by financial institutions with the terms of the 2001 protocol between member states of the European Union.</P>
      <P>The references to &ldquo;reasonable time&rdquo; in section 11(1)(<i>c</i>) and in the definition of &ldquo;account information order&rdquo; are being deleted. Amendments Nos. 4 and 7 deal with that issue. A new section 11(2) is being included instead to deal with the issue of timescales for compliance. Amendment No. 11 deals with that. The Irish Bankers Federation expressed concern about the term &ldquo;reasonable time&rdquo;. What might be a reasonable time for compliance to financial institutions might be unreasonable for those who are investigating crime and for that reason it is now being proposed at section 11(2) that the timescale for compliance with account information will be a time within which a financial institution can reasonably be expected to provide the information sought and where difficulties are encountered, this timescale can be extended by the applicant for the order or in a further notice in writing following consultation with the financial institution concerned.</P>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 5 and 10 deal with the question of different versions of persons&rsquo; names. The Irish Bankers Federation advised my Department that a financial institution would not know variations of a name unless any such variations are specified in the order. In other words, financial institutions cannot be expected to look at similar names if these variations are not brought to their attention. A financial institution would not have the capacity to identify accounts on which a person is authorised to sign in a manner which could be identified at system level. Accordingly, I propose amendments Nos. 9 and 10 concerning the definition of &ldquo;account information&rdquo; and &ldquo;account monitoring order&rdquo;, which provides that a different version of a person&rsquo;s name will be specified in the order.</P><Col N="470"/>
      <P>Amendment No. 9 also provides that a financial institution shall state if it has become aware of any other accounts on which the listed person is authorised to operate. These amendments are intended to facilitate compliance with the financial transaction provisions of the Bill to the greatest possible extent and also to give full extent to the provisions in Article 1 of the 2001 protocol.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 14 is introduced in view of the concerns expressed by the Irish Bankers Federation that section 12 as currently drafted is very wide-ranging and would be difficult to apply in practice. The type of information which would fall within the terms of the section as currently drafted could be interpreted to include transactions to and from the specified accounts such as payment of bank loans and utility bills. While it may not always be initially clear what information may be required for the purpose of a criminal investigation, I accept there may be a need to allow for a narrowing of the scope of a request to avoid an unwieldy and unnecessary burden on the financial institution concerned.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 14 allows for a notice to be made and for account information or an account monitoring order to be modified by narrowing the information sought from all transactions on the account, which may initially be sought, to those found at a later stage to clearly apply to the scope of the criminal investigation under way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>It makes eminent sense that we get the views of the Irish Bankers Federation on items such as this one. There is little use having legislation in theory that will not operate in practice. I agree with the amendments as proposed by the Government.</P>

	<P>I am very grateful to Senator Tuffy for moving this amendment and to <Col N="471"/>her colleagues for tabling it.

I ask Senator Tuffy to give me more time to examine the wording she has proposed, in conjunction with Parliamentary Counsel, and the opportunity to consult with the Garda and the banks on its implications from a practical and operational point of view.

	<P>Amendments Nos. 13 and 18 would have the effect of deleting the provision <Col N="473"/>that an account information or account monitoring order made with regard to criminal investigations in the State or in a member state of the European Union would have effect as if they were orders of the District Court. The effect of the acceptance of amendment No. 26 would be to delete the reference to an order made for the freezing of evidence to have effect as if it were an order of the High Court. I am consulting the Attorney General on this issue but it appears unlikely that I will be able to accept the proposed amendments. A judge making orders of the nature referred to will need the backing of the court to deal with issues relating to contempt of court and so forth. If, following consideration by the Attorney General, the amendments are necessary, whether along the lines of the Senator&rsquo;s amendments or with other changes, I will table them on Report Stage.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The amendment seeks to permit account information or account monitoring orders to be made relating to financial institutions in the European Union outside Ireland and to financial institutions in Ireland which are not in the district of the District Court to which the judge is assigned. Under section 12(2), applications for account information and account monitoring orders may relate to financial institutions in the State or in an EU member state. It follows that orders made on foot of such applications will relate to such institutions. The amendment, therefore, is unnecessary given the provision in section 12(2). The advice given to me is technically correct. Otherwise, we would give district court judges a type of universal jurisdiction, which is not what is contemplated.</P>

      <P LI="1">In page 30, lines 24 to 29, to delete paragraph (4).</P>
      <P FLI="0">We believe the provision as it stands is of dubious constitutionality. It allows the Minister to change the law by the executive act of making a declaration. The Minister should provide for a more constitutional way of achieving his objective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I will seek further advice from the Attorney General on that point. The purpose of the provision is to give effect to Articles 18.6 and 18.7 of the convention of 2000 and the provision is included to give Ireland the option of making a notification to the European Union at the time of ratification that we are unable to provide for immediate interception and transmission of telecommunications to EU member states. In that event, Ireland would be obliged to intercept, record and transmit a recording of the telecommunications to the requesting member state if we would make an interception in a similar domestic context. This will be done when the information provided in Articles 18.3 and 18.4 of the convention is provided by the requesting state.</P>
      <P>The information relates to issues such as from whom the request is received, the conduct being investigated, the desired duration of the intercep<Col N="475"/>tion and so forth. The possibility of making the declaration is provided for in Article 18.7. That is a safeguard and it enables Ireland to review the capacity of the telecommunications systems we have in operation prior to ratification.</P>
      <P>The Senator is making a different point, which is that by making provision for that option in paragraph (4), we are in some sense allowing the law to be changed by the executive arm of the State in an unconstitutional way. I do not wish to respond to that issue off the top of my head. I will consider the matter between now and Report Stage.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 20:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 32, between lines 21 and 22, to insert the following new subsection:</P>
      <P LI="1">&ldquo;(10) All documentation comprising the notification to member states of interception shall be treated as official documents relating to an authorisation, or the application therefor, for the purposes of the Act of 1993, and the provisions of section 8 of the Act of 1993 shall apply.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">One of the main areas of concern highlighted on Second Stage, and by the media, is the interception of communications of Irish citizens living in Ireland by governments of other EU countries. This is covered in Part 3 of the Bill. It allows the Government to request interception in other member states, and other member states to request interception here. This law was previously contained in the Interception of Postal Packets and Telecommunications Messages (Regulations) Act 1993. Section 2 of the Act allows the Minister to authorise an interception provided the criteria set out in section 3 of the Act are satisfied.</P>
      <P>An important safeguard is included in the Act in that section 8 allows a designated judge of the High Court to investigate authorisations and to inspect any official documents relating to an authorisation or the application thereof. The judge is to report to the Taoiseach at intervals of not more than 12 months in regard to the general operation of the Act and matters he considered should be reported. This report is to be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas, together with a statement on whether any matter has been excluded therefrom on the grounds that it would be prejudicial to the detection of crime or the security of the State. I have not been able to find <Col N="476"/>a record of any of these reports being laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas. Nevertheless, it is important to have some form of judicial scrutiny, particularly as the judge can tell the Minister that the authorisation should be cancelled and not extended.</P>
      <P>The Bill appears to envisage that the authorisations of requests for interceptions under sections 22 to 24 are authorisations pursuant to section 2 of the Interception of Postal Packets and Telecommunications Message (Regulation) Act 1993. These requests require technical assistance from other member states and from this State. Section 24(8) allows the provision of the 1993 Act to apply to these provisions.</P>
      <P>However, there is a second tier of requests whereby if this State does not require technical assistance from another member state, or it does not need technical assistance from this State, it is less clear from the Bill whether this tier will be subject to a report by a designated judge. If a Minister makes an authorisation of an interception under section 2 of the 1993 Act, and then notifies a member state pursuant to section 25 of this Bill, it is important that the documentation sent to the member state after the making of the authorisation is also available for review by the designated judge. Furthermore, a member state can notify the Minister of an interception pursuant to section 26(3) of the Bill if an authorisation would be given under section 2 of the 1993 Act in similar circumstances and in such circumstances the Minister shall allow the interception to be carried out or continued.</P>
      <P>Allowing for the interception to be carried out or continued should be treated in the same manner as an authorisation pursuant to section 2 of the 1993 Act and, therefore, may be investigated by a designated judge. As this is not clear from the section, it should be clarified with an amendment. The Minister may require that an interception not be carried out or terminated and give the reasons for so requiring in writing. Again, it should be ensured that the documentation is available for review by the designated judge.</P>
      <P>My amendments seek to clarify the situation and bring the Bill into line with the provisions of the Acts. They provide an extra layer of scrutiny and protection to people who may be subject to phone tapping or the interception of telecommunications. We do not have a great history in this regard about which we have spoken on different occasions in the past. It is of paramount importance to deal with this matter in a fully correct manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>I have similar concerns to Senator Cummins. While my amendments are slightly different, they propose to address the same issues. On Second Stage, I raised my concerns about these sections which I propose to amend.</P>
      <P>On amendment No. 22, I believe the section is flawed in that it does not limit the purposes for which the information can be used pending the <Col N="477"/>Minister&rsquo;s decision. As I pointed out previously, another country can decide to access material pending consent from our Minister. The section allows that country to use material in the meantime, even though the Minister might subsequently not give his consent to the request. While I am restricted in what I can do in terms of the legislation, I am trying to at least make the section as restrictive as the convention, which the section is supposed to be implementing. This is the reason for the wording in amendment No. 22.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 24 relates to my concerns about the obligations of companies under section 27. I raised my concerns on Second Stage about a company not getting co-operation from the corresponding company in the other country, which would mean they could not live up to their obligations under the section. I am trying to provide them with a small and restricted defence if they were in difficulty and needed to defend themselves in legal proceedings.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>Under the convention, we are limited in what we can do in terms of amending the legislation. However, the Minister should examine issues relating to people&rsquo;s rights, particularly in regard to another country coming here, getting material, accessing data and so on. Ireland has the Data Protection Act which provides accountability and some protection for people. We need to consider introducing measures that would provide this type of protection on an intercountry basis. Does the Minister have any plans in this regard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>On the last point, section 85(3) applies the Data Protection Act to this material, therefore, the issue is covered.</P>
      <P>What the Senators are asking me to do from two different perspectives is to establish a set of safeguards in Irish domestic law, which we apply to Irish domestic circumstances and which are intended to ensure there is scrutiny and oversight of how this is operated. I am generally sympathetic to the notion that there should be oversight and protections and I intend to examine the issues raised by the Senators before Report Stage. However, in general in the European Union, we have gone down the road of mutual recognition of judicial and court orders and a fundamental strategic decision has been made in this regard. Ireland is very hot on this choice. We have decided not to go down the road of ensuring every member state&rsquo;s law should be the same but all states should recognise each other&rsquo;s legal system as valid and attempt to give effect thereto. That fundamental choice was made a number of years ago on judicial co-operation in Europe and it is based on the pillar of mutual recognition and not on the basis of approximating our laws to have the same laws throughout Europe</P>
      <P>If, for example, an Irish judge were to perform in regard to a foreign request for an intercept the same function I carry out in a domestic context, he or she would exercise juridical supervisory <Col N="478"/>control over decisions made by foreign courts or foreign prosecuting magistrates. A number of issues would, therefore, arise. First, is it consistent with the convention for Ireland to establish that additional hurdle for others? I would have to consider that point of European law. Second, how could an Irish judge, apart from seeing that the documentation appeared to be in order, work out whether the basic justification was present? Will he summon officials from France, Luxembourg, Germany or the Czech Republic or wherever to ask them to stand up the application for an intercept and outline in retrospect whether it is correct? This raises an issue of practicality. Would the judge attempt to apply Irish domestic protections to an application that might be based on a different legal system? How practical is it for Ireland to provide its own safeguards, which permit it to erect additional obstacles to mutual legal assistance based on its constitutional jurisprudence, legal system and concept of what is right and wrong? This is not a novel issue, as it also arose in the context of the European arrest warrant.</P>
      <P>One must reflect on a number of issues. Before we get to the policy issue, are we entitled to do this or is it desirable? Would it be open to Ireland under the convention to put these safeguards in place? The judicial oversight involved in the interception of telephone calls and postal packages is exercised in retrospect in almost all cases. If, for example, procedures are followed and a designated official in the Department brings to the Minister a request from the Garda Commissioner for the interception of a particular telephone line and I sign the warrant, having examined the file, it is not returned to the judge that day for him or her to countersign it or whatever. He or she is required on an annual basis at the very least to scrutinise what I have been up to in retrospect. The issue is what effect that scrutiny would have if I could not stand up the merits of the transaction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>A number of the Minister&rsquo;s predecessors could not stand over their transactions and that is what we are trying to protect against.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
	<P>That was then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>That was then and I am not sure whether the late Jim Mitchell or Deputy Noonan introduced the current regime relating to the interception of telecommunications. However, it works well and there is no possibility of a Minister doing this off his or her own bat. A triple lock is in place because a security agency is required to make an independent request, which must then be considered by a designated official in the Department and a decision made to bring it to the Minister. There is no way the Minister can initiate the interception and get people to <Col N="479"/>come to him with the paperwork ready for ministerial enterprises in interception.</P>
      <P>I would like to consider this further between now and Report Stage, on the basis of the line of attack taken by the Senators&rsquo; amendments, whether something can be done to make sure somebody in Ireland can ask if domestic interceptions will be circumvented by getting somebody outside the country to do something that would not happen in the country. If one could get around the legislation by asking a foreign person to make an application for which there was no oversight at the time or in retrospect, there could be a danger. I will examine what can be done having regard to our obligations under the convention and I do not wish to sound negative or positive on this. I recognise there are issues and the amendments have been tabled for good reason. However, I do not want to be in breach of our obligation and I do not wish to do something worthless because asking an Irish judge to work out whether an Austrian prosecutor was justified could be a wholly fruitless activity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s comments and I appreciate the difficulties involved. We do not wish to obstruct mutual assistance in any way but safeguards should be incorporated, if possible, within the legislation. I look forward to the Minister&rsquo;s proposal in this regard on Report Stage, although I do not know whether that will be possible. Hopefully, something can be done to address the amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>I also thank the Minister for agreeing to examine the issues raised before Report Stage. He is protective of our legal system in other fora and my concern is that powers will be provided to other states that may apply a different set of standards than Ireland in dealing with legal issues. This legislation could give them scope to do that.</P>
      <P>I am all in favour of co-operation with other countries, particularly member states of the EU but Ireland is one of the few countries with a constitution. We have a particular regime of rights and so on while other countries have acted wrongly in the past legally and otherwise. Perhaps, in addition to the Minister examining the issue in the context of the legislation, as a Parliament, we need to examine the way we are headed with such legislation and adopt a clear-cut position on issues such as data protection and collection and the use of such data. This would inform us when participating in future conventions, therefore, I urge the Minister to take this on board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I will look at it again and do my best to accommodate some safeguard to deal with the genuine point raised by Senators Cummins and Tuffy.</P>

      <P FLI="0">We put down this amendment because it is not clear why a proceeds of crime order is not included in the definition of a freezing order. This amendment corrects that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>When I saw this amendment I had sympathy with the view expressed as the same question occurred to me. My Department considered this originally when the Bill was being drafted. The strong advice from the Attorney General and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was to the effect that they did not want the proceeds of crime orders to be put into a criminal context. The reason for this is that the philosophical underpinnings for our CAB procedures operate very much on the basis that a criminal conviction or process is not part and parcel of the confiscation of the proceeds of crime in Ireland.</P>
      <P Just="Left">There are confiscation orders in many European countries which follow from criminal convictions. However, what is unique about the Irish model is that the Supreme Court has held that a conviction is not a necessary precondition for these kind of orders or proof of criminal activity to a criminal standard of proof is unnecessary because, in effect, somebody in the possession of the proceeds of crime is a person who does not have lawful possession of them or have property rights to them. Therefore, to deprive them of control of those assets is not to punish them in any way. This philosophical distinction is crucial to the constitutional integrity of what the Criminal Assets Bureau does.</P>
      <P>The Department had the same thought on the issue as did Senator Tuffy and her colleagues, but we were warned away from it by the Attorney General and the Garda, who did not want the two concepts mixed together.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree this proposal is of value. Section 24 of the Criminal Justice Act 1997 deals with the making of restraint orders. A number of the sections of that Act, as listed in section 84(<i>a</i>) of the Bill also deal with restraint orders. Section 84(<i>a</i>) deals with the relevant provisions in the 1994 Act by changing the name to &ldquo;freezing order&rdquo;. The section to which the Senator refers deals with the making of freezing co-operation orders and the provisions allowing for such orders to have effect as though they were freezing orders made under the provisions of the 1994 Act.

      <P FLI="0">The powers in section 42(6) could relate to money. Therefore, we believe there is no reason to provide that they do not apply to money. What is the reasoning behind providing for the confiscation of property &ldquo;other than money&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Section 42 differentiates between property that is money and property that is not money. Subsection (5) deals specifically with the confiscation co-operation order relating to a sum of money. It provides that such an order will act as a confiscation order requiring the person to pay the relevant sum of money. Subsection (6) is designed to cater for a confiscation co-operation order, with the confiscation to take effect with regard to property that is specifically not <Col N="482"/>money. In the main, the section is a re-enactment of the provisions in section 20 of the Criminal Justice Act 1994 dealing with the realisation of property.</P>
      <P Just="Left">If we were to delete the phrase &ldquo;other than money&rdquo;, it would not make sense. Money is, after all, a property in its own right and has been dealt with in subsection (5). The specific purpose of this section is to deal with property which is not money. The inclusion of the phrase &ldquo;other than money&rdquo; is, therefore, necessary to the provision here.

      <P FLI="0">This section purports to make all statements admissible and the court can simply take into account whether cross-examination was allowed.

	<P>I think the Senator is trying to provoke me by using the phrase &ldquo;constitutionally illiterate&rdquo;. I do not accept that the thought process behind subsection (8) falls into that category.

      <P FLI="0">From that point of view, there is a clear preservation of the Irish courts&rsquo; right to uphold a person&rsquo;s right not to have uncontroverted evidence used against his or her wishes in circumstances in which it would be unconstitutional to do so. Therefore, in defence of my officials and the Parliamentary Counsel, I enthusiastically repudiate the charge of constitutional illiteracy.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>I have a question for the Minister. I can see what he is saying about subsection (10) but the section refers to &ldquo;without further proof&rdquo;. The court can consider the evidence but the section does not allow for there being further proof. Can the Minister address that issue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>This has been carefully examined. The phrase &ldquo;without further proof&rdquo; does not mean that it is unassailable. It simply means that there is no requirement to prove further the origins or authenticity of the evidence, apart from what is provided for in the section.</P>
      <P>With regard to amendments Nos. 32 and 33, it is correct that a judge should be satisfied that the section applies to a request from another state for evidence rather than that it should appear to the judge that the request relates to this section. However, a judge cannot be satisfied before issuing a warrant for evidence that a warrant is necessary for entry or that the occupier has not consented or is unlikely to consent to entry. That is not the way things happen.</P><Col N="484"/>
      <P>If a sergeant goes to the District Court and asserts his belief that there is stolen property in Mr. Michael McDowell&rsquo;s house, the judge does not ask if he or she is absolutely sure that Mr. McDowell would not simply open the door and let the sergeant enter the premises and take the property, without a warrant. That is not the way warrant procedures work. It is a power given to courts.</P>
      <P>It may well be that I would politely open the door and show the sergeant the stolen property in my house and ask him or her to take it away, but the procedure is that where one secures a warrant, one does not have to satisfy a court that the person in respect of whom it will be executed is not likely to co-operate on a voluntary basis. That is not the basis on which warrant business is done.</P>

While I am sympathetic to the notion that people are given a decent amount of notice, I do not think it would be prudent or correct of us to impose rigid timescales on other member states.</P>
      <P>The onus is on other member states to serve documents in good time if they require a person to attend there but some flexibility is also important. For example, if a person from this jurisdiction is required, under this regime, to attend a court case urgently in Newry and that person is in County Louth, is it reasonable to assert that he or she cannot be required to do so, that is, to travel 20 miles, unless given 14 days notice, particularly if one considers that a person would be liable to be brought to Drogheda District Court from Northern Ireland at a moment&rsquo;s notice? We need some flexibility in this regard, but I take the point that good notice should be given. The 14-day provision is unnecessarily inflexible. It is slightly over the top if an individual in County Donegal is required to go to Derry under this provision but cannot because two weeks notice was not given to him or her.</P>

      <P FLI="0">The Labour Party believes subsection (4) is meaningless. The subsection is designed to discourage judges from operating the section and we suggest it is deleted. What is the purpose of section 83 if subsection (4) is left in it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I admit it is an odd-looking provision at first sight. The Parliamentary Counsel, however, regards it as important because it permits the courts to refuse to grant measures where they do not have jurisdiction, apart from this section, and where they think it would be inexpedient having regard to that matter to make the order in question. The provision has featured previously in other legislation dealing with orders. The same wording can be found in the civil proceedings context in section 13(2) of the Jurisdiction of Courts and Enforcement of Judgments Act 1998.</P>
      <P>The provision must be read carefully. Although it may not be an elegantly phrased piece of draftsmanship, it follows precedent. Subsection (4) states:</P>
      <P LI="1">The Court may refuse to grant the measures sought if, in its opinion, the fact that it has not jurisdiction, apart from this section, in relation to the subject matter of the proceedings con<Col N="486"/>cerned makes it inexpedient for it to grant such measures.</P>
      <P FLI="0">It could be phrased more eloquently. I will consider clarifying its meaning between now and Report Stage. It introduces a discretion for the court to refuse to make an order in circumstances where if it did not have the jurisdiction under this section, it would regard this as an inexpedient order to make. It directs the court to have regard as to whether the order being sought by virtue of the jurisdiction it has is a reasonable order to make.</P>

	<P>The amendment proposes to ensure any order made under the Criminal Justice Act 1994 prior to the commencement of section 84 is not nullified by amendments made under section 84. Under normal rules of construction, such a provision is not necessary as legislation is generally not retrospective and any order made lawfully under the Act prior to the commencement of the section cannot be altered because it is a court order.</P>
      <P>In addition, the provisions of the section amending the 1994 Act do not refer to orders. Most of the proposed amendments deal with terminology and clarification of terms. Subsection (<i>h</i>) clarifies that empowerment under this section of a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to have access to or to take away a document is to be construed as an authorisation to do so. Subsection (<i>e</i>) clarifies that orders under the section may relate to property in an EU member state.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I have tabled the amendment on the advice of the Attorney General following recent judgments in two Supreme Court Cases, Browne <i>v</i>. Attorney General &amp; anor and Kennedy <i>v</i>. Attorney General &amp; anor. To date, there have been two domestic legal bases under which regulations have been made to give effect to the European Communities directives and regulations. These are regulations made under section 3 of the European Communities Act 1972 and the regulation-making power in a parent Act for domestic purposes with the same subject matter as the particular directive or regulation.</P>
      <P>Two recent decisions of the Supreme Court found that regulations giving effect to European Community law and policy obligations are <i>ultra vires</i> of the parent Act. In those cases, regulations were under a standard regulation-making provision in the parent Act. It was not a European-oriented regulation-making power. The Supreme Court found that a general regulation-making provision in an Act that does not specifically provide for regulations giving effect to EU law cannot be used for the purposes of implementing EU law. The domestic regulations giving effect to EU law may only be made pursuant to a power expressly providing for such a purpose.</P>
      <P>While it is the intention that all regulations now considered to be <i>ultra vires</i> will be remade together in a specific vehicle, I have been advised by the Attorney General, that I should amend section 86 to expressly incorporate a regulation-<Col N="488"/>making power for international instruments. As the Bill gives effect to seven international instruments, it is important that the regulation-making power provision encompasses power to give effect to international and EU law.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I am glad the Minister is attending the House personally. He has taken a concerned and humane interest in this matter &mdash; the establishment of a dedicated phone line for the families of missing persons in this State. Initially, the Minister was impressed by this heartbreaking situation for many people and made a grant available to establish a helpline in conjunction with Victim Support. The latter group, however, folded its tent and moved away and since then nothing much has happened. There was an offer of &euro;25,000 to the group that is involved in this matter. I wish to pay tribute in particular to the work of Mr. Tom Brown whose sister has been missing for some time. That offer appears to have fizzled out, however.</P>
      <P>In a reply to questions in the D&aacute;il, the Minister indicated that a report had been commissioned at the end of 2003 from the department of social sciences at the Dublin Institute of Technology. He pointed out that only 100 phone calls were received and suggested that this tends to influence the view of his Department that, despite this great human tragedy, a stand-alone phone service is perhaps not the most efficient way of doing things. I disagree with that view, however, and would draw the Minister&rsquo;s attention to the <Col N="489"/>report&rsquo;s administrative summary. The distinguished authors state:</P>
      <P LI="1">The single most disappointing aspect of the helpline has been the small number of calls that it has received. Of these calls, only a very small proportion &mdash; 13 out of 100 &mdash; were generated by the garda&iacute; giving out the brochure, which was initially intended as the main form of generating calls to the helpline. A significant failed objective of the project to date, therefore, has been the delay in distributing the helpline number to Garda stations nationally. At the present time, the majority of Garda sergeants have heard of the national missing persons&rsquo; helpline. However, of a sample of 20 stations contacted nationwide, only 65% had the national missing persons&rsquo; brochure on public display.</P>
      <P FLI="0">The business of letting people know about the service is the first significant phase, as the report indicated. Therefore, the figure of 100 phone calls may be an unrealistic figure.</P>
      <P>The report&rsquo;s first principal recommendation is that the helpline funding should be continued, although this has not happened. I ask the Minister to reconsider the situation and perhaps open negotiations between himself or his officials and Mr. Brown, who is an extremely decent man and knows about the situation from the inside. Mr. Brown has spent a lot of his own money on this project. He gave out his own telephone number and was deluged with calls because he managed to have it announced on the radio.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The group recommended that an advertising budget be identified for the helpline because that information must be provided. It is considering purchasing newspaper and television slots. A budget of &euro;25,000 would be completely unrealistic for such a purpose, so a sum would have to be negotiated between the parties involved. The range of services for missing persons should be extended to include counselling and a support network. Another recommendation is that the helpline should be operated as a free-call service as opposed to a lo-call one. In that way people, who quite often are in difficult circumstances, would not have to pay for such calls.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Another recommendation is that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na be actively and vigorously encouraged to promote this helpline. Under the Minister&rsquo;s regime, we have some good outreach services for the immigrant and gay communities. It is a remarkable initiative which is beginning to work. We should put some muscle behind this helpline and actively encourage the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to advertise it. A specific budget should be provided for the helpline instead of leaving it to people like Mr. Tom Brown who have suffered in this respect while working on a small budget. It is important for us to provide such assistance.</P>
      <P>I wish to quote a couple of responses to the helpline which were published in the report. One response stated, &ldquo;The helpline is a great service <Col N="490"/>as it is difficult for us to talk to families when we have decided not to prioritise a case, even though every case is a priority for the family directly affected&rdquo;. Another response stated, &ldquo;Up until now, there has been nothing for these families, unlike Victim Support, for example&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to take action on this helpline in light of the serious situation concerning missing persons. A significant number of people are affected, some of them well known. Recently, there was a case of a young student who disappeared. He was a bank employee and had gone out for the night. He was caught on CCTV cameras but then nothing further was heard of him. The young man&rsquo;s family agonised over his disappearance and put up posters all over central Dublin with his photograph and the family&rsquo;s contact details. There were other well known cases such as that of Ms Jo-Jo Dollard.</P>
      <P>Such families need support because they have had no closure. If they were able to talk to people who identified with and understood the situation, they would be able to obtain some degree of resolution. At the moment, however, they are dependent on the United Kingdom&rsquo;s missing persons&rsquo; helpline. Admittedly, the matter affects only a small number of people but it is a significant number nonetheless. It is a real pity that, yet again, when faced with a critical human situation, we must depend on a service offered in the neighbouring island.</P>
      <P>Given the Minister&rsquo;s goodwill in this regard, would he be prepared to revisit this situation and adopt some of the report&rsquo;s recommendations for establishing a consistent service? At the moment there is nothing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Norris for raising this matter. I assure him that I share his concern, and that of many members of the public, about missing persons.</P>
      <P>The national missing persons helpline was established in October 2002, shortly after I came into office. Initially, funding of &euro;65,000, to include set up costs, was provided by my Department to establish the helpline, to be operated and administered by Victim Support. Further funding of &euro;45,000, net of set-up costs, was provided to the helpline in 2003. Senator Norris should bear in mind that this funding was provided subject to the conditions that no funding beyond the year 2003 should be necessarily implied, and audited accounts should be provided to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. I regret to state that to date, no audited accounts for that total of &euro;110,000 have been furnished to the Department. Perhaps that can be remedied, but it has not happened.</P>
      <P>The conditions under which my Department provided funding did not include any requirements concerning the operational activities of the helpline. Any decisions relating to the operation of the helpline were made by Victim Support, <Col N="491"/>which was an independent, non-governmental organisation with charitable status, which managed the operation of the helpline, in conjunction with the helpline itself.</P>
      <P>In March 2005, and after an independent review, I decided that continued funding of the organisation could not be justified due to serious concerns about governance, accountability for public funds and poor service levels after a lengthy period of instability within the organisation. I understand that Victim Support Limited closed down its headquarters during 2005 and a number of staff were made redundant, including the person employed to operate the missing persons helpline. My Department had no role in the decision of Victim Support Limited to make its staff redundant, other than to insist that full statutory requirements such as notice and holiday pay be met and that the interests of the staff be protected.</P>
      <P>Also in March 2005, I established a new Commission for the Support of Victims of Crime to devise an appropriate support framework for victims of crime in the future and to disburse funding for victim support measures. The commission is entirely independent in its decision making and it examines each application on its merits. Its members are Mr. Jim McHugh, a retired assistant commissioner of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Ms Nora Owen, a former Minister for Justice, Mr. Se&aacute;n Lowry, a former head of the probation and welfare service, Mr. Michael Whelan of Gemini Consulting, and Ms Marian Finucane, the well-known broadcaster.</P>
      <P>The commission received an application from the Missing In Ireland Support Service for &euro;7I,600 to establish, staff and operate a helpline for missing persons. After careful consideration of the application, the commission decided to offer funding of &euro;25,000. However, as the Senator implied, this offer was rejected by the Missing in Ireland Support Service on the basis that it would accept only the full amount sought. It should be borne in mind in this context that the commission is charged with funding support services for victims of crime, and that while some persons who are missing are almost certainly crime victims, most are not. Other than the request to the independent commission for funding, no request has been made by the helpline to my Department. It remains open to the Missing In Ireland Support Service to make an application directly to my Department for assistance if it so wishes. It will be carefully considered on its merits.</P>
      <P>The missing persons bureau in Garda headquarters is responsible for maintaining data relating to missing persons. All cases of a person reported missing in suspicious circumstances remain open and under ongoing review and investigation until the person is located or, in the case of a missing person who is presumed drowned, a decision to that effect is given by the coroner.</P><Col N="492"/>
      <P>At present, local Garda management takes direct responsibility for missing person cases and special investigation teams are appointed as necessary. All missing persons are recorded on the PULSE system. When a person is reported missing, the local Garda superintendent takes direct responsibility for the investigation and appoints an investigation team to include any specialised unit deemed necessary, such as the national bureau of criminal investigation or the technical bureau.</P>
      <P>The systems put in place by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to manage and deal with reports of missing persons are in line with best international police practice, and Garda management is satisfied, and has assured me, that the systems in place are adequate to deal with any reported case of a missing person. The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na interacts fully and appropriately with all media outlets, including print, radio and TV, in highlighting cases involving missing persons. The services of other external agencies such as Europol and Interpol are also available to assist in the investigation. In addition, every Garda district has a specially trained search team familiar with the locality. The investigation of missing persons is a dedicated subject on the curriculum at the Garda College in Templemore, and is also covered in in-service training.</P>
      <P>The establishment of a national missing persons unit has been suggested from time to time and the matter is kept under ongoing review by the Garda authorities. Arguments for and against such a proposal can be made. The view of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, gained through experience, is that while specialist units prove extremely useful in investigating certain types of crime, missing person cases, by their nature, require specific local knowledge both about the area where they occur and the circumstances and background of the person who is missing. Having a national unit that would descend on County Kerry to investigate a case could be counter-productive.</P>
      <P>Research regarding missing person investigations has been conducted by the police authorities in the United States of America. Garda authorities maintain close links with the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York. My Department functions as the central authority for implementing the Hague and Luxembourg Conventions, which operate to secure the speedy return of an abducted child where that is at issue.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The Garda authorities continually monitor international developments on investigations of missing persons to ensure that best practice is followed. If their professional judgment is that some change in the existing legislation or protocols would be of assistance in improving investigations, this will be considered positively by my Department.</P>
      <P>I share the view of Senator Norris that a helpline of this kind is best established on an independent basis and therefore by a non-official, voluntary organisation. I do not believe having a group <Col N="493"/>of garda&iacute; waiting to receive telephone calls is a good idea. I reiterate that if a proposal is made for funding separate from victim support, as victimhood and missing persons are not the same issue except for a small degree of overlap, I and my Department will carefully consider it to see what we can do.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The Senator made the point that two thirds of Garda stations had leaflets and that 100 telephone calls were generated. Even if the other third of Garda stations had leaflets, would that number of calls have risen to 130 and if so, would it justify spending the &euro;100,000 sought? That would amount to &euro;1,000 or &euro;700 per telephone call. We must ask whether it is an effective use of public moneys. If the Department is approached with a good business case and tight financing we will examine it. I will remind the Senator of the failure to produce audited accounts. Simply signing a cheque is not a politically responsible action for me to take.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his considered and positive approach. I agree with him that what is often involved is the social issue of dealing with the trauma of the relatives and not a police matter. I accept the point made on the non-production of audited accounts. It is partly the whirlpool created by the collapse of Victim Support. These are well-motivated amateurs who are genuinely affected. There is no suggestion that they made away with money.</P>

	<P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for allowing me to raise on the Adjournment the situation faced by the pupils and teaching staff at Presentation Convent Secondary School in Mitchelstown, County Cork. The Minister may not have any personal knowledge of the school, but I assure him that from an academic point of view, it has an outstanding record and history. On an annual basis, a large number of students continue to third-level education, which one sees in the tables presented on an almost annual basis on feeding schools for third-level colleges. The Mitchelstown school is always at the top of that list among non-fee paying feeder schools. While academic achievements are important the school also offers a broad range of subjects. There is a strong sense of co-operation between parents, teaching staff and the pupils in this school which has a fine sense of purpose and place. It is a treasure in the Mitchelstown community and the north Cork area.</P><Col N="494"/>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>The school has an accommodation difficulty. It has approximately 274 pupils. Most of the building is old and it has no sports hall, assembly area or lunch room. It has only one science laboratory and because a high percentage of pupils take science subjects they have access to the laboratory only once every fortnight.</P>
      <P>Over recent years efforts have been made to build an appropriate extension. In 1997 a formal request was made to the Department. In 2001 the school was advised of its entitlement to appoint a design team which it expected would lead to progress but unfortunately little progress has been made.</P>
      <P>I appreciate that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is not the line Minister in charge of the project but I appeal to him to discuss this situation with the Minister for Education and Science and outline the importance of trying to push this project forward. The numbers for next September&rsquo;s intake are almost finalised but there are accommodation difficulties. The school was disappointed to receive a letter from the Department to the effect that its application for short-term, temporary or pre-fabricated accommodation was unsuccessful.</P>
      <P>Ironically the school was also informed last week that it would not be included in the 2006 summer works scheme because a major project is on file. That project has been on file since 1997. It is disappointing that a small project to replace carpets and some other structural repairs has been rejected on the basis that a major project is on file. We need to see the major project up and running as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>I urge the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to speak to the Minister for Education and Science to see if some type of temporary accommodation can be put in place for next September. It is not too much to expect that science students would have access to a science laboratory at least once a week or that there would be some type of assembly room and lunch room, facilities required in a modern school and that parents, pupils and teachers expect.</P>
      <P>I thank the Minister for listening and I compliment all those involved in this school on flying the flag so high for education in Mitchelstown. It is a credit to the community. Informal discussions were held about the possibility of amalgamating the school to create an overall Mitchelstown educational project but the parents and students in the town decided to maintain the <i>status quo</i> and have a choice of schools. We need to give the accommodation in the Presentation secondary school the highest priority. I ask the Minister to do whatever he can to assist in that regard.</P>

	<P>On behalf of the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Hanafin, I thank Senator Bradford for raising this matter as it affords me the opportunity to outline to the Seanad the strategy of the Department of Edu<Col N="495"/>cation and Science on capital investment in education projects, and the position regarding the development of education provision in the Presentation secondary school, Mitchelstown.</P>
      <P>Modernising facilities in our 3,200 primary and 750 post-primary schools is not an easy task given the legacy of decades of under-investment in this area as well as the need to respond to emerging needs in areas of rapid population growth. Nonetheless, since taking office, the Government has shown a sincere determination to improve the condition of our school buildings and to ensure that the appropriate facilities are in place to enable the implementation of a broad and balanced curriculum.</P>
      <P>As evidence of this commitment there will be 1,300 building and modernisation projects active in our primary and post-primary schools during 2006. Over &euro;490 million is being spent on the primary and post-primary projects throughout the country.</P>
      <P>The Presentation secondary school is an all-girl post-primary school with an enrolment of 274 pupils. Enrolments have decreased slightly in recent years from 301 pupils in 2001 to 274 in the current school year. The school authority has an application with the Department of Education and Science for an extension. The long-term projected enrolment on which the school&rsquo;s long-term accommodation needs will be based has been agreed at 300 pupils. Schedules of accom<Col N="496"/>modation for the proposed extension were drawn up some time ago. Officials in the Department of Education and Science are re-examining these schedules to ensure that the level of accommodation being proposed will meet the long-term needs of the school. When these are confirmed progression of the project will be considered in the context of the School Building and Modernisation Programme 2006-10.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Education and Science made several announcements earlier this year about the school building programme for 2006. The Minister will also make further announcements in this regard over the coming months.</P>
      <P>Once again I thank the Senator for raising this matter which allowed me to outline the position of the Department of Education and Science in respect of the school building and modernisation programme. I assure the Senator that I will pass on the gravamen of his remarks to the Minister when I see her.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his response and ask him again specifically to raise with his colleague the need for short-term accommodation. We do not expect a new school to be built next week or next month. That project is hopefully coming down the line. We would, however, be grateful if the issue of short-term accommodation could be re-examined before next September.</P>
