   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I have received notice from Senator Tuffy that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
    <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to give an update on the schemes a parent of a child in a special needs school might access during the summer school holiday period to ensure continued classes, tuition, supports, etc., whether schools can be requested to continue classes for the child concerned and on what basis.</P>
    <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Morrissey of the following matter:</P>
    <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, given the State&rsquo;s position as shareholder in the ESB, and the Department&rsquo;s explicit role to represent the State in the corporate governance role and the facilitation of the ESB&rsquo;s growth, to outline the State&rsquo;s view regarding access to electricity in new housing estates in light of reported serious problems for new homeowners and families in north Dublin.</P>
    <P FLI="0">I regard the matter raised by Senator Tuffy as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business. I regret that I have had to rule out of order the matter raised by Senator Morrissey as the Minister has no official responsibility in the matter, it is a matter for the ESB.</P>

   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann has agreed to the amendments made by Seanad &Eacute;ireann to the Employment Permits Bill 2005.</P>

   <Title>Order of Business.</Title>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Order of Business is Nos. 1 to 3, inclusive. No. 1, a motion referred to the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence <Col N="222"/>and Women&rsquo;s Rights, and on which the committee has completed its deliberations, is primarily a judicial arrangement whereby the judicial authority in a state requested to execute an arrest warrant would recognise a warrant issued by the judicial authority in Norway or Iceland, this item will be taken without debate; No. 2 is a motion regarding the Offences against the State (Amendment) Act 1998, to be taken at the conclusion of the Order of Business and to conclude in one hour, the contribution of each group not to exceed ten minutes and Senators may share time; and No. 3, Road Traffic Bill &mdash; Report and Final Stages, to be taken at 12.20 p.m. and to conclude at 2 p.m.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>The fact that the social partnership talks have concluded successfully is to be welcomed on all sides of the House, although much of the high-wire act of recent weeks could be regarded as contrived and stage managed. It was inevitable that representatives of workers and medium and large business would do a deal because it is in their interests to do so, particularly on pay.</P>
    <P Just="Left">Would the Leader agree that while the objective of the initial social partnership deal was to reduce unemployment and bring stability to the Irish economy, the new challenges we face are different from those we faced in 1997 and 1998? These challenges are about re-engineering public services so that consumers get not just greater efficiency but greater service, and that we deliver on key targets in education, training and our commitments on housing affordability, which is now beyond the sights of many young people. We must debate these matters.</P>
    <P>Although we have a difficult few weeks ahead in terms of legislative priorities, a debate in the House on the conclusion of the talks yesterday would be useful. There is an ongoing role for the Oireachtas in monitoring the progress made in that agreement because ten years is a long time. Most Irish people have fallen out of love with social partnership, as they have with Europe. It is no longer as relevant to them as it was in the late 1980s. We all have a responsibility to highlight the importance of it and to show that the new challenges in our economy and society are met during this agreement.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I add my voice to Senator Brian Hayes&rsquo;s call for a debate on this issue and I agree with much of what he has said. We must be careful that we achieve our targets on education. The House will note that the class size of primary schools has deteriorated this year and on that basis we will not meet targets. Senator Brian Hayes will articulate that view and Senator Ulick Burke has mentioned it many times. It is crucially important that we debate it. I will not deal only with the central issues. Why is it relevant? Brussels and Strasbourg were crippled recently on the issue of pensions. Social partnership got a <Col N="223"/>commitment from Government last night that a Green Paper and a White Paper on pensions would issue over the next year. This shows that we are trying to anticipate the difficulty. Paris and all of France closed down six months ago because of labour legislation and problems relating to immigration. Last weekend the talks were delayed due to the need to deal with labour law and the protection of labour rights to ensure that what happened in France does not happen here. It is not by accident that we have the best industrial record in Europe over the past ten years, it is because people locked themselves away for the past six months to try to deal with the issues they anticipated would cause problems along the way. Social housing was also an issue.</P>
    <P>A commitment has been made on the minimum wage which brings us up to date with the rest of Europe, a protection of immigrants is part of that and, for the first time in western Europe, social welfare payments will be connected to the average industrial wage, as opposed to the consumer price index and the inflation index. These are some of the reasons this issue affects everyone. It is important that people know what the issues are and how we are trying to anticipate problems that are crippling other European countries. It is crucial that we debate this topic and draw conclusions. We should also congratulate people on all sides who have tried to bring these social partnership talks to a conclusion and wish the farmers well who have not finished their talks and who hope to conclude discussions tomorrow. They are probably under greater pressure than any other group at the moment.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I support Senators Brian Hayes and O&rsquo;Toole in their calls for discussion of the partnership agreement. I presume we will hear another announcement of 10,000 affordable houses to be built to make up for the fact that the last 10,000 houses announced at the partnership talks were never built.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>Exactly.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to draw the Leader&rsquo;s attention to a motion that my Labour Party colleagues and I have on the Order Paper seeking:</P>
    <P LI="1">That Seanad &Eacute;ireann will establish a petitions committee and initiate procedures for civil engagement with the Seanad through a right of individuals, community groups and organisations to petition the Seanad and make a request to the Seanad to take a view or initiate or amend legislation in relation to matters of public interest or concern.</P>
    <P FLI="0">I urge the Leader to consider this proposal because I know she has great interest in Seanad reform and a key part of this is the issue of engagement with the public. Granting the public the right to petition the Seanad would be an ideal <Col N="224"/>way to achieve this goal. The right to petition parliament is a concept that has existed for centuries and the Scottish Parliament has an e-petitioning system in place which has led to changes in the law in Scotland. Such a move would be particularly suited to the Seanad because we are not directly elected.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Some of us are.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Norris is directly elected by the masses of university graduates.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, 120,000 of them.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>Not all from Trinity College, I am afraid.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Some.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>People like Senator Norris have brought about changes in legislation and it is this tendency in the Seanad to take a broader view that could allow us to fulfil this role very well. It would provide for civil engagement with the Seanad and the right of public access to this Parliament. I urge the Leader to take this proposal on board. I have previously raised the issue of the need to allow councillors and university graduates to engage with the Seanad and the right to petition would grant this.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TomMorrissey"><NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
	<P>I concur with the previous speakers on the conclusion of the partnership talks. I would like a discussion on the area of reform, which might have been included or excluded from those talks. This Government has an ambitious &euro;34 billion transport plan yet the transport system in Dublin shuts down at 11.30 p.m. The Luas, which cost some &euro;900 million, closes at 11.30 p.m., the bus service consists of 1,200 buses and closes at 11.30 p.m. There is a skeleton Nitelink service to the outer suburbs. By 2016 the public transport system should function far later than this. Dublin is a modern European capital that runs on an almost 24 hour basis. Some people may not go home until 4 a.m., some may get up at 5 a.m. and 6 a.m. to go to work.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Not the same people, I hope.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TomMorrissey"><NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
	<P>Dublin&rsquo;s public transport system is antiquated and I seek a discussion on the reforms sought between now and 2016 by the various interest groups in the partnership talks. Without the deregulation of the taxi system which has brought 13,000 taxis, rather than 3,000 previously, I wonder what kind of transport system would exist in Dublin at 2 a.m. and 3 a.m. The taxi system was meant to supplement the public transport system at those times, not replace it. I seek a debate on this issue.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>On 16 November 2005 Minister of State at the Department of Health and Chil<Col N="225"/>dren, Deputy Tim O&rsquo;Malley, indicated in this House that the new radiotherapy unit at Mid-Western Regional Hospital, Limerick, cost approximately &euro;8.5 million. The Midwestern Hospital Development Trust and a generous business benefactor in the area provided all the finance for it. This facility dealt with both private and public patients and I asked the Minister of State on that occasion if he could indicate when the HSE would provide finance to the Midwestern Hospital Development Trust for the public patients attending this facility. The Minister of State indicated that he expected the matter to be resolved &ldquo;speedily&rdquo;, to use his own word. I asked if this would be resolved by January and he answered in the affirmative. All I know is that this matter has not been resolved to date. Would the Leader please find out when this commitment will be honoured?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>I join in warmly congratulating the Government and social partners on having practically concluded an agreement with the exception of the farmers who I hope will also come on board. This agreement is important for maintaining confidence in the economy and, as Senator O&rsquo;Toole has illustrated, the alternative is loss of confidence and industrial and possibly social unrest. I would welcome a debate on the full programme when it is published.</P>
    <P>I also endorse Senator Morrissey&rsquo;s request for a debate on aspects of the transport system. I point out, however, that the Luas system is ultra-modern and runs until 12.30 a.m., not 11.30 p.m.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a big help.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>It was 11.30 p.m. last Saturday night.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the new agreement, although my feelings are slightly ambiguous. Due to my natural greed, which we all share, I am delighted at the prospect of a 10% pay increase but I am worried that we might price ourselves out of international markets. We must be careful to stay competitive.</P>
    <P>Last night there was an interesting debate here on foreign policy issues and the use of Shannon Airport. Many of us will have heard a report from Washington this morning on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; on the funeral of the 2,499th member of the US military to fall victim to the war in Iraq. He was a young, 25 year old man from Appleton, Minnesota, the heartland of America. As I am sure everyone would like to do, I express my sympathy to their families on the wasted lives of these unfortunate young people. Speaking on behalf of the people of Iraq, who suffer most, I cannot turn my eyes away from the suffering of others. It is said that war is a continuation of foreign policy by other means, and it is, but it is often practised by old men at the expense of the innocent lives and blood of the young.</P><Col N="226"/>
    <P>Thank God for this wonderful weather. I hope it stays for Bloomsday. Young people of both sexes are looking absolutely beautiful in this weather, and it is a joy to be alive in Dublin. I rejoice with them.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator was running away from such young people a few days ago.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>There may be a sinister element accompanying this wonderful weather. We heard this morning of a plague of mosquitoes in Drogheda. It may sound amusing&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Not if one was bitten.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>There are gnats on North Great George&rsquo;s Street.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;but it indicates a substantial shift in the climate. For that reason I ask for a debate before the House goes into recess on the subject of climate change, global warming, the Kyoto Protocol and an underlying factor of the extraordinary expansion in population numbers. The leaving certificate examination is taking place at this time. Since I did my leaving certificate the population on the planet has doubled. The planet cannot sustain such exponential growth.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DonLydon"><NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
	<P>Some time ago we had a debate in this House on stem cell research. Will the Leader provide time to revisit this subject? I ask this in light of the fact that Members of the European Parliament are today being asked to sanction experimentation on and destruction of human embryos. I remind the House that human embryos are not potential human beings but human beings with potential. If we go along in any way with this type of endeavour, or approve it, we can never again criticise the Nazis for their experimentation on babies. The only difference is one of age.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Along with Senator Brian Hayes and others, I welcome the successful conclusion of the partnership talks. I may be wrong, but is this the first time that the pay deal element will run for 27 months but the agreement provides for a ten-year framework?</P>
    <P>We have been promised a Green Paper, to which Senator O&rsquo;Toole referred, on defined benefits with regard to pensions. We know this to be a contentious area in which this country is lacking. As Senator Brian Hayes has stated, there is an ongoing role for the Oireachtas. Some serious questions arise from this matter, and I would be grateful if the Leader would spell out the intended involvement of other Departments, not just the Department of the Taoiseach.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>That would be a matter for the responsible Minister.</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="227"/>
   <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the agreement and call for a debate.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>Is there such a thing as a responsible Minister?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Departments of Finance, Social and Family Affairs, Enterprise, Trade and Employment, and Environment, Heritage and Local Government will all be involved. They all appear to have roles, or they have acquired roles. As Senator Brian Hayes has mentioned, there is an ongoing role for the Oireachtas in monitoring the issue, and an early debate is called for.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Leader is aware of CIE&rsquo;s initiative entitled Art on the Move. It refers to the collection of paintings at CIE&rsquo;s head office at Heuston Station. However, some of the offices in which the paintings were held were removed to allow greater access for the public through the station. Some of this collection is now being shown to people in the regions, which is to be greatly welcomed. The paintings are on show in Kerry at the moment, and I attended the exhibition some days ago. I thought it a pity that more paintings were not on show.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>There is still life in Kerry then.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>This could be a very important national collection, which could and should be added to by paintings held by the Great Southern Hotels group.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Has the Senator a question?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>A number of those paintings were removed to de Vere&rsquo;s, as we know, for whatever purpose, be it storage or valuing.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>The Leader knows it.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I have a very important question.  Will the Leader bring the appropriate Minister here to discuss the issue? Is it possible to combine the collections, as they could become an even more important national treasure? They should be brought together.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator is correct.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Lydon raised the very important issue of embryonic stem cell research. We have previously had a debate on the matter which was very informed and balanced. The T&aacute;naiste was present on that occasion. There is a growing interest in the subject in Ireland and throughout Europe. More important, an awareness is growing of the nuances involved in the debate itself. In particular, there is the differentiation between embryonic stem cell research and adult stem cell research.</P>
    <P>There are no ethical grounds for opposition to adult stem cell research. There is a growing body of evidence to show that the potential coming <Col N="228"/>from the research on adult stem cells is very positive. It holds much potential for the treatment of many ailments. It is vital that we do not go down a road in the unethical manner now being suggested when clear alternatives are available.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senators Lydon and &Oacute; Murch&uacute; on the issue of embryonic stem cell research. A vote is taking place in the European Parliament today. The concept underlying the European project is meant to be subsidiarity, where decisions better made closer to the citizens could be made in that way rather than at a centre. It is time for us to once again have a debate on stem cell research because of the exact points raised by Senators Lydon and &Oacute; Murch&uacute;. There is a danger that this decision making may be taken away from us in Ireland. It is time for us to debate the issue.</P>
    <P>An horrific attack on a young fireman was mentioned some days ago, where a bottle was thrown and the man was seriously injured. I heard this morning on the radio that although garda&iacute; and prison officers have compensation schemes in the event of being attacked or assaulted on duty, firemen do not. I am not sure if that is correct, but there was much discussion on the matter this morning on the radio. I heard the young man involved speaking. If it is correct, we should consider the matter seriously and immediately.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>Over the past number of years we have on numerous occasions debated the issue of class size at primary level. It is disturbing to read a report in <i>The Irish Times</i> that 5,000 more children are currently being taught in classes of more than 30 than was the case two years ago. This figure came in response to a question tabled by Deputy O&rsquo;Sullivan. This is despite a commitment given that no child under nine would be in a class of 20 or more in the lifetime of this Government.</P>
    <P>The current Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Hanafin, dismissed this as a noble aspiration. When she attempted to give reasons the goal has not been realised, she used the idea that local school management decided that greater areas of priority existed and teachers would be moved to areas other than teaching children under nine years of age. More recently, the Minister has aired the idea that as a result of unforeseen expenditure in the area of supporting special needs, such a goal could not be realised.</P>
    <P>Our pupil-teacher ratio is the second worst in the EU, with only Britain in a lower position. It is unacceptable that in a time when we have such an abundance of resources, and despite all commitments given, such a goal is now just a noble aspiration. It is unfair to the children involved. Many children are in classes of more than 40, and some are in the Minister&rsquo;s own constituency. <Col N="229"/>Some of the classes are in County Galway. It is unacceptable.</P>
   <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
    <P>Despite many efforts to alert the Minister to what is happening, she has ignored the issue. She has failed, at Cabinet level, to get the necessary resources to bring about the commitment given when this Government took office. Will the Leader ask the Minister her plans to reverse the worsening situation of the past two years? That it is worsening rather than improving cannot be tolerated.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FrankFeighan"><NameTxt>Mr. Feighan</NameTxt>
	<P>I also welcome the national partnership agreement and congratulate all involved. However, not everybody is satisfied with the agreement. The Irish farming community seem to have been left out in ways.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>The IFA stayed out by its own choice.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>It was not of its own choice. Tell that to the farmers of Tipperary.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FrankFeighan"><NameTxt>Mr. Feighan</NameTxt>
	<P>Perhaps all the large farmers are satisfied, but the smaller farmers are not. We should have a debate on this issue. The way issues such as Greencore and the Irish sugar industry were handled show these people are taken for granted. I might laugh at myself, but I am a small shopkeeper.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator is a big shopkeeper.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FrankFeighan"><NameTxt>Mr. Feighan</NameTxt>
	<P>Small businesses have been taken for granted. The land, which has been extremely vibrant, has seen an exodus. In the rush to congratulate ourselves, we must take into account that the self-employed farming community are not satisfied. I ask the Leader for a debate on small businesses and the Irish farming community, which need to be recognised as a serious issue.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly"><NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>I also welcome the national partnership agreement in so far as it is concluded. It is not fully concluded yet. I have every confidence in the leadership of the farming community to resolve the outstanding issues in that regard. In dealing with the partnership agreement, will the Leader arrange for the Minister for Finance to give us a briefing on the detail of the agreement?</P>
    <P Just="Left">While these agreements are welcome, some have a long lead-in and delay in implementation. I am particularly concerned with the delay in the implementation of infrastructural and construction projects. Delays in the various stages of implementation of sewerage schemes, minor extensions and development of hospitals cause grave frustration throughout the community. We might find a way for the Minister for Finance to expedite these and cut out the red tape which delays many projects. Substantial funding has been ring-fenced for two, three or four years for some of these projects.</P><Col N="230"/>
    <P>Senator Ulick Burke raised the issue of teachers. While I accept the necessity to hear from the Minister on her plans for future developments, it is fair to state substantial investment has been made in the reduction of class sizes and 5,000 additional teachers have been employed in recent times. That must be acknowledged. We held a meeting with parents and teachers representatives. As part of an INTO campaign, we were presented with a petition of 5,000 names from parents and pupils in Clare, who feel class sizes are too big and remedial measures must be taken. If the Minister for Education and Science came to the House it would provide a useful opportunity to give an outline of the massive improvements she made in recent times and indicate how she proposed to deal with the issues raised by the INTO.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Brian Hayes welcomed the announcement of the fruition of the partnership talks. He spoke about high-wire acts. However, it was never laid out that they would succeed. It was quite difficult and I understand there were quite a lot of hiccoughs in its passage. It certainly was not ordained that it would just happen. It was prolonged and difficult.</P>
    <P>The Senator is right to state the challenge today is different to that of 1987, when the PNR, the Programme for National Recovery, was agreed. It is correct to state we faced a hugely perilous financial situation in 1987 after the four and a half years of the previous Government.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>And in 1981 and 1977.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>It started in 1922.</P>

	<P>Real leadership.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>&ldquo;National recovery&rdquo; are exactly the words I would use.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Programme for National Recovery was truly such. The Fine Gael Party played its part through the Tallaght strategy of Alan Dukes on which I fully commend him. However, the idea that everything was hunky-dory in 1987&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <P Just="Left">Senator Brian Hayes is correct to state we face different challenges now. It is a ten year framework which will require a great deal of monitoring. The Senator asked for a debate and then an ongoing monitoring role for the Seanad. I fully agree with that.</P>
    <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole echoed what Senator Hayes stated about partnership. He also raised the fact we will have a Green Paper on pensions, followed by a White Paper and, hopefully, legislation and action. Other European countries have experienced crippling strikes over pensions because they are at a further demographic stage to us. We hope to offset or work ahead of the issue so we are not caught in a pensions timebomb. The Senator also wished the farmers well. The farmers are still in negotiations and have not broken off. They are still within the partnership framework. Hopefully, it will end satisfactorily.</P>
    <P Just="Left">Senator Tuffy raised the matter of the motion to establish a petitions committee, which I read recently when I was waiting in the House. I was extremely interested in it. It is No. 26, motion 20. It is a motion to establish a petitions committee and initiate procedures for civil engagement with the Seanad. It is an excellent motion. I hope Senator Tuffy puts it forward in Private Members&rsquo; time. I will seek, if I can, that we do not put forward an amendment and that this House will accept it. It is well put together and necessary. Other parliaments have such a petitions committee, including through e-mail. I assume it was Senator Tuffy&rsquo;s idea because her name is first and she is entitled to credit if it is. It is a worthy motion.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Morrissey&rsquo;s point on the availability of public transport. He commended Bobby Molloy, although not by name, on taxi deregulation. He asked for a debate on how public transport can be accessible after 11.30 p.m. I am glad Senator Mansergh spoke about being on the Luas at 12.30 a.m.</P>
    <P>Senator Finucane raised the serious matter of private facilities in the grounds of hospitals. I happened to be in the Chamber when the Minister of State responded to that question. He asked when will the HSE provide finance for public patients to be treated in those facilities. I will endeavour, through the private secretary to the Minister of State, to establish when this commitment, which was given publicly, will be fulfilled. The Minister of State, Deputy O&rsquo;Malley, is extremely conscientious and I am sure he will endeavour to meet that commitment.</P>
    <P>Senator Mansergh is pleased the partnership talks have concluded and hopes the farmers will eventually sort themselves out. Senator Norris also welcomes the agreement. He also condemned the wasted lives in Iraq. He stated how women and men look so well in the fine weather. However, he ran away from the women. We saw him on the front page of <i>The Irish Times</i>. He <Col N="232"/>stated both sexes are lovely in fine weather and that is nice.</P>
    <P>Senator Lydon raised the matter of stem cell research. We notice that the clergy made a call from Maynooth to Europe yesterday in which a shot was sent across the bows of the MEPs on this matter.</P>
    <P>Senator Coghlan welcomes the partnership agreement but needs to know the responses of the various Departments that feed into it. Every Department would have had a say in what finally emerged. The Senator also referred to the Art on the Move initiative. The CIE art will be exhibited in every railway town, including Athlone, for a two-week period. There have already been moves in this regard.</P>
    <P>A Member of the other House asked on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; where the Great Southern Hotels&rsquo; paintings have gone. Senator Coghlan, who has such intimate knowledge of those hotels, will know the paintings are absolutely beautiful, particularly those in Parknasilla. He believes the two collections should be brought together for the Art on the Move initiative.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>There is an old connection in that CIE owned those hotels.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>The collections are wonderful. CIE offered sponsorship through the Arts Council, encouraged new artists and bought their paintings, many of which are now very famous and have accumulated great value over the years.</P>
    <P>Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; pointed out, quite correctly, that there are two types of stem cell research, namely, embryonic and adult, and asked that there be another debate on the matter. We will seek this.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn also called for this debate and stated that firemen do not have a compensation scheme for themselves, which I cannot understand.</P>
    <P>Senator Ulick Burke referred to class sizes. It is well documented, as in the parliamentary question, that there are 4,000 extra teachers, most of whom are concerned with special needs. This is fine and we are all very pleased they are concerned with these pupils, including foreign children who need particular care because they must learn a new language even though they may be a little older than is desirable. The Senator wants a debate on class sizes and we will certainly endeavour to have it.</P>
    <P>Senator Feighan referred to the partnership process and stated the needs of small farmers and businesses should be accommodated within it. IBEC would have had a special role in advancing the cause of all businesses.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FrankFeighan"><NameTxt>Mr. Feighan</NameTxt>

	<P>Senator Daly made the sensible suggestion that the Minister for Finance should brief the House on how the conclusions were arrived at and what will constitute the outcome. He would also like a debate on class sizes. I commend the INTO in this regard in that it is engaging in a proper campaign. I hope its representatives will come to Athlone. We did not hear from them yet on the matter but they would be very welcome.</P>
    <P Just="Left">We are all very pleased with the special needs teachers and the Government has made huge strides in this regard. There is no doubt that pupils with special needs are the most vulnerable, including those who need special care and arrangements. The regular children, for want of a better description, or those in the full classes also have certain entitlements and I therefore hope we can arrange for the Minister to debate the matter in the House.</P>

    <P LI="1">That Seanad &Eacute;ireann resolves that sections 2 to 12, 14 and 17 of the Offences against the State (Amendment) Act 1998 (No. 39 of 1998) shall continue in operation for the period of 12 months beginning on 30 June 2006.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P el="0">The resolution under consideration seeks approval for the continuance in force of those sections of the Offences against the State (Amendment) Act 1998 which would otherwise cease to be in operation on 30 June.</P>
    <P>In commencing the debate on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, I remind Senators that the 1998 Act was enacted in the aftermath of the Omagh bombing <Col N="234"/>of August 1998, which claimed the lives of 29 innocent people, including a woman pregnant with twins, and injured more than 200 others. That appalling act, which occurred a few months after the signing of the Good Friday Agreement and was clearly designed to derail the peace process, was perpetrated by people for whom human life holds no value.</P>
    <P>The Seanad will be aware that there is an upcoming criminal action against a person in Northern Ireland in regard to these murders. The retrial of another person is also pending in this jurisdiction. The investigation into this atrocity continues on both sides of the Border and there continues to be excellent co-operation between the Garda authorities and the PSNI in this regard.</P>
    <P>It will be recalled that, in recognition of the exceptional circumstances surrounding the enactment of the 1998 Act, there was general agreement that the Act be regularly revisited by the Oireachtas. The purpose of this recurring scrutiny is to ascertain if the circumstances then prevailing in 1998 justify the continuance in force of its provisions. Accordingly, by virtue of resolutions passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas on 16 June 2005, sections 2 to 12, inclusive, and 14 and 17 of the 1998 Act will cease to operate on and from 30 June next unless a further resolution is passed by each House authorising the sections to continue to operate for a period not exceeding 12 months.</P>
    <P>There is a requirement in the 1998 Act to lay a report on the operation of the Act before each House of the Oireachtas prior to any consideration by the Houses of the renewal of the provisions. The Minister laid such a report before the House on Monday. Its conclusion is that the relevant sections of the 1998 Act should remain in force for a further 12 months. In the first instance, this is the firm view of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which considers the Act to be vital in the continuing fight against terrorism and which considers it to be of paramount importance that the relevant provisions remain in operation.</P>
    <P>The harsh reality is that those responsible for the Omagh bombing and others like them continue to pursue, plan and promote campaigns of violence. Senators should remember that there have been a number of near misses involving the Real IRA and the Continuity IRA since the Omagh bombing, and it is only by dint of excellent police work by the Garda and the PSNI that further tragedy on a massive scale has been averted. The State must be prepared to meet the real threat posed by dissidents, particularly at this very sensitive time, when all our hopes are on a restoration of devolved government in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>No one in this House can be ignorant of the newer and more sinister forms of international terrorism &mdash; and in particular Islamist terrorism &mdash; which have manifested themselves in recent years in addition to home-grown terrorism. With the Madrid bombings of March 2004, and the <Col N="235"/>London bombings of last July, which together involved the murder of more than 250 innocent commuters, two of our closest European friends and neighbours have had to face the full horror of this phenomenon. It would be naive to imagine that Ireland is completely immune from such threats.</P>
    <P>The Criminal Justice (Terrorist Offences) Act 2005 was enacted to deal with this international terrorist threat by enabling the application of the Offences against the State Acts against international terrorist groups and individuals. Chipping away at these Acts would be neither wise nor warranted at this time.</P>
    <P>On behalf of the Minister, I will now turn to the individual sections of the 1998 Act which this House is being asked to continue in force for a further 12 months and I will outline the position on the various sections since the end of the last reporting period, that is, from 1 June 2005 to 31 May 2006.</P>
    <P>Section 2 was used on 14 occasions. It provides that where, in any proceedings for membership of an unlawful organisation, the accused fails to answer or gives false or misleading answers to any question, the court may then draw such inferences from that failure or from the furnishing of a false or misleading reply as appear proper. However, a person cannot be convicted of the offence solely on an inference drawn from such a failure.</P>
    <P>Section 3 was used on nine occasions. By way of explanation, section 3 provides that, in proceedings for membership of an unlawful organisation, the accused must give notification of an intention to call a person to give evidence on his or her behalf, unless the court permits otherwise.</P>
    <P Just="Left">Section 4 was used on two occasions. This section amends section 3 of the Offences against the State Act 1972 in such a way as to expand the definition of &ldquo;conduct&rdquo; that can be considered as evidence of membership of an unlawful organisation. Specifically, &ldquo;conduct&rdquo; can now include matters such as &ldquo;movements, actions, activities or associations on the part of the accused&rdquo;. This change simply aligns the definition of &ldquo;conduct&rdquo; in the 1972 Act with the reference to movements, actions, activities or associations used in section 2 of the 1998 Act.</P>
    <P Just="Left">Section 5 was used on 34 occasions. This section provides for the drawing of adverse inferences in the prosecution of a person for any offence under the Offences against the State Acts, any offence scheduled under the Acts and any offence arising out of the same set of facts as such an offence, provided that the offence carries a penalty of five years imprisonment or more. The effect of this section is to allow a court to draw inferences where the accused relies on a fact in his or her defence that he or she could reasonably have been expected to mention during questioning or on being charged but did not do so. As with section 2, however, a person cannot be <Col N="236"/>convicted of the offence solely on an inference drawn from such a failure.</P>
    <P>Section 7 was used on two occasions. This section makes it an offence to possess articles in circumstances giving rise to a reasonable suspicion that the article is in possession for a purpose connected with the commission, preparation or instigation of specified firearms or explosives offences.</P>
    <P>Section 9 was used on 110 occasions. This section makes it an offence to withhold information a person believes might be of material assistance in preventing the commission by another person of a serious offence or securing the apprehension, prosecution or conviction of another person for such an offence.</P>
    <P>Section 10 was used on 15 occasions. This section extends the maximum period of detention permitted under section 30 of the Offences against the State Act from 48 hours to 72 hours, but only on the express authorisation of a judge of the District Court. In this regard, the judge must be satisfied, on the application of a Garda officer not below the rank of superintendent, that the further detention is necessary for the proper investigation of the offence concerned and that the investigation is being conducted diligently and expeditiously. The person being detained is entitled to be present in court during the application and to make, or to have made, submissions on his or her behalf.</P>
    <P>In the reporting period in question, an extension was applied for in 15 cases. Fourteen of these applications were granted. Charges resulted in two of these cases.</P>
    <P>Section 11 was used on seven occasions. This section allows a judge of the District Court to permit the re-arrest and detention of a person in respect of an offence for which he was previously detained under section 30 of the Offences against the State Act but released without charge. This further period must not exceed 24 hours and can only be authorised in circumstances where the judge is satisfied, on information supplied on oath by a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, that further information has come to the knowledge of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na about that person&rsquo;s suspected participation in the offence.</P>
    <P>Section 14 was used on 54 occasions. The effect of this section is to make the offences created under sections 6 to 9, inclusive, and 12 of the 1998 Act scheduled offences for the purposes of Part V of the 1939 Act. This means that persons suspected of committing these offences are liable to arrest under section 30 of the 1939 Act. Sections 6, 8, 12 and 17 were not used in the period in question. The information on the use made of the provisions of the 1998 Act is based on data received from the Garda authorities and is contained in the report on the Act laid before the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy McDowell, appreciates that some Senators will look at the advances that have been made in the search for peace since <Col N="237"/>1998, and in the past year, and say that we no longer require this legislation. The Minister disagrees. The full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement remains an ongoing challenge and one this Government continues to pursue with the utmost commitment.</P>
    <P>The enemies of peace have not gone away, however. Dissident republican groups remain active, ruthless and determined to strike if given the opportunity. They remain resolutely opposed to the Good Friday Agreement and to the peace it has engendered, determined to destroy that Agreement and prepared and willing to kill indiscriminately to that end. As long as there are organisations dedicated to frustrating the will of the people through violence and mayhem, there must be robust counter-measures available to the State.</P>
    <P>The success of the two police forces in thwarting various attempts to take life, some of which I have mentioned, should not be perversely held up as reason to set aside this legislation; rather, it is proof that it is still required. Neither should the fact that some sections of the Act were not used in the period be held out as a reason for jettisoning provisions which provide the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with robust counter-measures against the unscrupulous godfathers of the paramilitary underworld. Both the Continuity IRA and the Real IRA would gladly kill and maim any number of innocent people in the name of their so-called republicanism.</P>
    <P>The Offences against the State (Amendment) Act 1998 is one element of the State&rsquo;s ongoing response to the terrorist threat. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform urges Senators not to countenance weakening any of the tools the State has at its disposal in the fight against terrorism. I commend the resolution to the House.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House. All of us would agree that the concept of emergency legislation is far from desirable. We should aim to put in place legislation that is responsible and reasonable to stand the test of time and retain its relevance. However, there are clear reasons the legislation was enacted in 1998 with regard to the provisions in respect of terrorist offences and it was necessary and important at the time. Similarly, there are valid reasons the legislation was made time sensitive and why it has become necessary for the House to renew legislation on an annual basis since 2000.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State has stated he believes there remains significant threats from, <i>inter alia</i>, the dissident groups which warrants the continuance in force, for the time being, of relevant sections of the Act. I do not want to compromise the ability of the State in any way in the face of the grotesque actions of dissident groups, nor do I wish to hamper any efforts by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to deal with the perpetrators of horrendous acts such as that witnessed in Omagh eight years <Col N="238"/>ago, but I am compelled to ask the Minister of State some questions.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister envisage a time when we could allow these particular provisions in the offences against the State legislation lapse? Will he share the basis for his reasons for retaining these provisions? I understand he may not be able to explain them in this open forum but he should at least be able to discuss it with Opposition spokespersons on justice. There must come a time when we rely on more than the Minister&rsquo;s word for these actions.</P>
    <P Just="Left">It is important that we balance the power of the State to defend itself and the ability of our law enforcement agencies to track down and capture the murderers of Detective Garda Jerry McCabe, who remain at large, with reasonable maintenance of our Statute Book. It is also reprehensible and despicable that a Member of the other House would go on public record to say he would encourage people not to contact the Garda if they had any information on the murderers of Detective Garda Jerry McCabe. Such statements are despicable, especially from Members of the Oireachtas, and should be condemned from all sides of each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>I support the motion because in the absence of a permanent and peaceful resolution to the conflict on this island we cannot compromise the capacity of the State to act decisively to deal with terrorism and dissident groups like the Continuity IRA, the Real IRA and other provisionals. It is an important tool for the Garda in combating crime and offences against the State. We have seen some instances in the recent past in that regard.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael supports the measures that promote a strong sense of law and order and we will continue to stand by the provisions in the 1998 Act, which are to be renewed by the motion before the House. Nonetheless, there should be a greater level of interaction by the Minister with this House. The faith we place in him by passing this motion should be reciprocated in some respect.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TonyKett"><NameTxt>Mr. Kett</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and I support the motion that is before us this morning regarding this ongoing legislation. I also support the arguments put forward by the Minister of State on the need for it to continue. It is a pity we need to do this, but such is life. In this regard I share the sentiment of Senator Cummins&rsquo;s question to the Minister of State. I wonder whether there is light at the end of the tunnel in terms of when we might not have to renew this legislation annually. I realise that is probably difficult to answer, because one never knows what might happen from week to week or from month to month.</P>
    <P>We are also aware of the tragic circumstances that gave rise to this legislation in the first instance, namely the Omagh bombing and the terrible hurt and maiming that took place there, which brought communities from North and <Col N="239"/>South together in an arena of disgust. It is one of those milestones in history when we all know where we were at the time we heard the news. It is similar in that regard to recalling where one was when President John F. Kennedy was shot. Most people in Ireland, North and South, will remember where they were when they heard of the Omagh bombing.</P>
    <P>It never ceases to surprise me that people with even half-baked intelligence could ever believe that anything can be gained from tragedies like Omagh. I would love to look into the mind of somebody who is responsible for such a tragedy for signs of any semblance of realisation of what was in his or her head when deciding to perpetrate or become involved in such acts. I fully endorse what the Minister of State has stated on the ongoing need for the legislation. The Good Friday Agreement remains in place and I have no doubt we need to be very conscious and diligent moving forward with that. There will be much debate and many meetings ahead. We hope that the restoration of devolved government will be a major step on that road if it happens sooner rather than later.</P>
    <P>I am glad to note also the continuing excellent relationship between the PSNI and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which is the kernel as regards the period of peace we have enjoyed over the last couple of years. They have provided an effective buttress to the peace process as we know it. That continuing success and what we are doing here this morning are crucial in this regard.</P>
    <P>Another compelling point for the continuation of peace is the real threat of international terrorism. There are more than lingering threats from the so-called Real IRA or Continuity IRA, as the Minister of State has pointed out. However, these have been fairly well contained by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in conjunction with the PSNI. The threat of international terrorism is a new animal and has shown its ability to penetrate the most sophisticated security systems in the world. We only have to look at 9/11, Madrid and London to see how effective it can be.</P>
    <P>We must forever be on guard against people who do not discriminate for a moment between an innocent child and their own pathetic objectives. As the Minister of State said, we can never assume for a moment we are immune from such an attack. In an ideal world this type of legislation would never be required. As there are individuals or groups who continue to undermine democracy, however, we must keep in place all the tools at our disposal in order to protect it.</P>
    <P>I believe most people have no problem with dissident republicans making their point in a valid manner. Many of them have done that by way of publications in the past and there is no harm in having a critical voice, regardless of the standpoint they happen to be coming from. It is indefensible, however, when they try to push their viewpoint into the mainstream thinking and <Col N="240"/>involve people in an absolutely hopeless campaign.</P>
    <P>It is sad in many ways that people who have spent their lives on this island still fail to recognise the existence and achievements of this Republic. Eight years after the Good Friday Agreement was signed, those who cherish the achievement of a united Ireland see lasting peace as a prerequisite. I hope that those who aspire to the objectives and ideals of a united Ireland realise that there is only one way in which this can be achieved, namely, through dialogue and working together in harmony and in trust.</P>
    <P>A sinister by-product to our success as regards the Northern Ireland peace process is the fact that so-called dissident republicans are now feeding armies down here with arms and expertise in terms of the drugs situation in particular. I speak for Dublin city, as I am aware of what is happening in the city. It is serious that so-called republicans can provide material for young thugs to kill each other in an attempt to establish who is boss of a drug situation in the city.</P>
    <P>We must supply whatever resources are available and more in an attempt to fight this issue. It is a major issue for the cities, particularly Dublin, equal in its threatening capacity to anything that might happen on the other side of the Border. I wish the garda&iacute; well in their pursuit of that and I wish the Garda and the PSNI well in their pursuit of continuing peace. I commend the motion to the House.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>This emergency legislation was adopted originally in 1998, so it has been in place almost ten years. Each year it is renewed and that is why we are here again today. It comes around very quickly because it does not seem like a year since we last dealt with it. It is on the Order of Business for both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State has mentioned that a report was laid by the Minister before the Houses on Monday. That does not give Members much time to analyse the report. We are not really examining the legislation. There is a need for much more briefing in this regard. We need to ask questions. We do not have the facility in this House to ask questions, revisit issues and tease them out, as perhaps a committee of the Oireachtas might do. I want to suggest that before the decade is up, either this year or next, the legislation be referred to an appropriate committee such as the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights.</P>
    <P>There is a need to take a longer-term view of this legislation. Should we continue to renew it each year or should other legislation be enacted on a more long-term basis? Is this type of legislation still needed? We must take such an initiative if this legislation is to be properly reviewed. It is not as if the legislation was enacted a year ago. It was put in place eight years ago and will soon be on the Statute Book for nearly a decade. Perhaps the conclusion reached will be to keep it <Col N="241"/>in place. However, rather than just continuing with the present procedure, we need within the next couple of years to have a much more substantial analysis and review of whether it should be renewed or replaced. I urge the Minister of State to consider that proposal.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senators Cummins, Kett and Tuffy for their contributions. If this was an ideal world, there would be no need for this legislation and we all wish that it was not necessary.</P>
    <P>Senator Cummins asked when would the provisions lapse. That is why there is a need to review this on a yearly basis and there is a unanimous view on the issue in this House. The Hederman committee was established to review the Offences against the State Acts from 1939 to 1998. The committee unanimously recommended that 13 sections of the 1998 Act be considered and there was a substantive opinion on eight of them. The committee recommended the retention of seven of the eight sections, either unanimously or in one case, by majority.</P>
    <P>We hope that the changing political situation in Northern Ireland will have a positive impact, as Senator Kett pointed out. Unfortunately, the IMC reported on the ongoing threat of the Continuity IRA and the Real IRA and there is still a need for strong legislation for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the PSNI and the courts to allow them to deal with a difficult situation.</P>
    <P>I am happy to come before the House and commend this resolution. I appreciate the positive contributions Senators have made today.</P>

I propose there is no need for the inclusion of the word &ldquo;genuine&rdquo; in the paragraph. The Minister of State might consider deleting it.</P>

	<P>I fully understand from where Senator Paddy Burke is coming in tabling this amendment but I would like to clarify the position and to refer to the word &ldquo;emergency&rdquo;. The word &ldquo;emergency&rdquo; has deliberately not been defined in the section, as it would be impossible to draw up an exhaustive list of circumstances that would merit emergency status. The genuine emergency defence provision was included in the Bill to cater for instances where the seriousness of the situation would warrant the making or taking of a call on a hand-held mobile phone where by not making or taking that call, the consequences would probably be loss of life, serious injury or putting the health or safety of a person at risk.</P>
    <P>Using the word &ldquo;genuine&rdquo; alongside the word &ldquo;emergency&rdquo; is intended to stress that there must be an objective seriousness to the emergency. The use of the word &ldquo;genuine&rdquo; is intended to make it clear that convenience, regardless of the urgency of the matter, would not constitute an emergency. The amendment, if accepted, would lessen the test of objectiveness in terms of an emergency and therefore undermine the restrictive nature of the defence.</P>
    <P>As I indicated to the House yesterday, ultimately it would be a matter for the courts to determine the merits of a genuine emergency defence in each particular case. Subsection (7), as drafted, strikes a balance between the need to have a hand-held mobile phone in a real emergency situation as against its urgent use for convenience purposes. I hope this explanation satisfies Senator Burke and that in practical circumstances good sense will prevail.</P>

    <P FLI="0">I retabled these amendments on Report Stage because the Minister of State said he would consider them overnight. We had a good debate yesterday on the times and places covered by an authorisation given to garda&iacute; to carry out random breath testing. I propose that the word &ldquo;times&rdquo; is preferable to the words &ldquo;hours at any time&rdquo;. The Minister of State said he would consider this matter and I await his up to date position on it.</P>

   <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>I gave this matter serious consideration. I need not emphasise that drinking and driving in Ireland is recognised as one of the most serious contributory factors in road collisions. Evidence shows that the incidence of drink driving is increasing among the younger age groups. There is widespread acceptance among responsible motorists and society as a whole that driving under the influence of alcohol is potentially dangerous.</P>
    <P>I will deal with the amendment by outlining what might happen if the amendment were accepted. I refer to an example where the time indicated on the authorisation establishing a checkpoint is between 12 midnight and 2 a.m. and the garda&iacute; on duty form the opinion that a number of drivers may be over the alcohol limit and decide at 12.30 a.m. to abandon the roadside test and take some drivers to the Garda station to carry out the evidential test. It is the job of legal representatives to find loopholes in the law and they will try to ensure that those who are brought before the courts are not convicted. The amendments tabled previously were examined carefully prior to now and particularly overnight, and this section has been drafted very carefully. To return to the example, if the garda&iacute; abandon that checkpoint at 1 a.m., I am advised that a case could be made for the individuals brought to the Garda station that the garda&iacute; were not in compliance with the authorisation because they abandoned the checkpoint prior to the time stated on it. For that reason, it is suggested that we must retain the words &ldquo;the hours at any time&rdquo; rather than the word &ldquo;times&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>That may be difficult for us as lay people to understand, but the position has been explained to me by my officials, and I fully understand their position and that of the Parliamentary Counsel. We are here to ensure the law will be foolproof and Senator Paddy Burke would also be anxious to ensure that. We do not want to create that position whereby there would be a loophole in the law. I hope the Senator will accept that explanation and consider withdrawing his amendment.</P>

	<P>I indicated yesterday that I would consider this and I wish to clarify a point on which I may have given the wrong impression to the House regarding the fines Bill that will come before the House. This fixed charge does not relate to that Bill which will refer to fines in court, whereas this is an administrative sanction or fixed charge.</P>
    <P>Rather than have the Minister increase the fines on 1 January each year, or at another particular time as the Senator recommends, and link it to some index, we will monitor the situation. If the Minister of the day finds it necessary he or she will introduce a regulation to increase the fine. It would not be appropriate to provide in primary legislation for the fixed charge under section 5 to be index-linked to the inflation rate set by the European Central Bank and automatically updated in January each year after coming into force. The Minister can keep the level of fixed charge under review and vary it in the future when he or she deems it appropriate to do so.</P>

	<P>I hope that my amendment No. 6 will cater for Senator Paddy Burke&rsquo;s amendment. I have further considered bringing forward amendments to section 5 in light of Senators&rsquo; comments on Committee Stage. The intention of the Bill in respect of the fixed charge and disqualification process is that where a person is found to have exceeded 100 mg of alcohol per 100 ml of blood, or the equivalent levels in urine or breath specimens, he or she will be prosecuted either for that offence or, if he or she has not <Col N="245"/>been convicted of a drink-driving offence within the previous five years, he or she will be served with a fixed disqualification notice.</P>
    <P>The Senator proposes an amendment to section 5(7)(<i>c</i>) to provide that if a person who is not eligible to be served with a fixed charge notice happened to be served with a notice, that person would continue to be liable for prosecution in the same manner as if a notice had not been served. It is intended that this would be the case and an express provision could bring greater clarity to the section.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Counsel advises me that an appropriate amendment could be inserted to section 5 at subsection (7)(<i>f</i>) which would address the concerns of the Senators. I propose to introduce amendment No. 6 which would ensure that a person who is not eligible to pay a fixed charge will at all times face the immediate prospect of summons for the substantive drink-driving offence. Amendment No. 6 caters for the intention of amendment No. 5.</P>

	<P>I have further considered bringing forward amendments to section 5 in light of Senator Paddy Burke&rsquo;s comments on Committee <Col N="246"/>Stage. My amendment No. 8 should address the Senator&rsquo;s concern.</P>
    <P>The issue here is that where a person is alleged to have committed an offence of driving, or being in charge of a vehicle, when the concentration of alcohol present in his or her body exceeded 100 mg of alcohol per 100 ml of blood, or the equivalent in other specimens, that person is eligible to avail of the fixed charge and disqualification notice process introduced in the Bill, unless he or she has been convicted of a drink-driving related offence within the five years prior to the date of the alleged offence.</P>
    <P>If a person is ineligible to avail of this process, namely, having had a conviction for a drink-driving related offence within the previous five years, and knows, or should in the circumstances have known, that he or she is ineligible but yet pays or attempts to pay a fixed charge, he or she is guilty of an offence.</P>
    <P>I propose a form of wording that should meet Senator Paddy Burke&rsquo;s concern, to the effect that the section will read &ldquo;a person who is ineligible under <i>subsection (2) </i>or <i>(3)</i> to pay a fixed charge and who knows or should in the circumstances have reasonably known that he or she is so ineligible&rdquo;.</P>

    <P FLI="0" el="5">Before people can be prosecuted, local authorities should be obliged to notify them their licences have lapsed. They already notify people that their motor tax is due for renewal and the same should apply with regard to licences. I understand the point made by the Minister of State with regard to the value of a licence and the need for people to ensure it is up to date. However, some people go away for long periods and spend six or eight months away in the sun and may forget about renewing their licence. I propose there should be an onus on the local authority to notify them.</P>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>We discussed this on Committee Stage. I appreciate Senator Burke&rsquo;s concern <Col N="248"/>that licence holders may not be aware that their licence has expired. He referred to the fact that motor tax reminders are issued by licensing authorities and suggested that driving licence reminders should also issue. Motor tax reminders are issued from the vehicle registration unit of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government on behalf of licensing authorities. Arrangements are being made for driving licence renewal notices to be issued in the same way.</P>
    <P>However, with regard to the proposed amendment, my main concern is that it would allow any person who had let his or her licence lapse to plead that he or she had not received a renewal notice. This would weaken the provision considerably and make the offence virtually impossible to prosecute. Another effect of the amendment &mdash; which I am sure is unintentional on the part of Senator Paddy Burke &mdash; is that it removes the offence in paragraph (<i>a</i>)(ii) which applies where a licence has expired for more than 12 months. A fine of &euro;2,000 and penalty points apply.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is putting in place a system whereby renewal notices will be issued in the same way as motor tax reminders. I take the opportunity of this forum to remind the only group I believe may have difficulty in this regard, those changing address, that they have the obligation to advise the local authority of so doing. If they do that, there is no major disadvantage.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>In effect, this is a technical amendment to subsection (9) of section 103 of the Road Traffic Act 1961. Its purpose is to clarify that the amount to be paid is as specified in the notice and that any moneys paid in respect of a fixed penalty charge can be received by the transport officers as well as by garda&iacute; or traffic wardens and that these moneys will be disposed of into the Exchequer as directed by the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>The existing text of section 103(9)(<i>a</i>) of the Road Traffic Act 1961 is unclear as to the amount of a payment to be paid under a fixed charge notice. This amendment to paragraph (<i>a</i>) clarifies that the amount to be paid is the payment specified in the notice. The existing text of section 103(9)(<i>b</i>) of the Road Traffic Act 1961 provides the payment of moneys for fixed charge offences can only be made to garda&iacute; or traffic wardens and that those moneys are disposed of in accordance with specific legislation.</P>
    <P>As a result of earlier amendments to the Bill, it will be necessary for moneys to be payable to transport officers. The amendment to paragraph (<i>b</i>) will mean that moneys can be paid to persons specified in the fixed charge notice, including transport officers. The amendment also means that moneys will be disposed of into the Exchequer as the Minister for Finance directs. This will allow transport officers to pay the moneys to the Exchequer as directed.</P>

   <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>On behalf of the Fianna F&aacute;il group I thank the Minister of State for his time in the House on this important legislation. The legislation has been in the offing for some time and no doubt the level of work he, the Minister and their officials have put into it will bear fruit in terms of the adoption of the various road safety strategies the Government has been working on for many months. It is obvious that we hope the level of effort and work that has been done in this regard will bear fruit in terms of dealing with the scourge of death on the roads. I have no doubt that despite this legislation, a greater effort will be required from everyone in society to work to change this country&rsquo;s road use culture. We will not have tackled this major issue until we start to consider the use of the road as a privilege to be used responsibly, rather than as a right. I hope that, over time, the shift in culture and mindset that is needed if we are to save lives on our roads will start to happen as a consequence of the communication with the public that has taken place through various elements of the media, the high-profile appointments which have been made in recent times and the legislation that has been passed in support of the enforcement of road safety.</P>

   <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. P. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State and his officials for their work on this important legislation. I also thank the Minister of State for accepting some Opposition amendments. I thank Senators Dooley and Wilson for their co-operation and the effort they have made on this important Bill. I do not doubt that it will save many lives on the roads in the long run.</P>
    <P>While we will face challenges as the legislation is brought into force, it will be a worthwhile exercise if it saves one life or prevents a number of fatalities. I wish the Minister of State, who has extensive knowledge of this good legislation, well with the Bill as he brings it to the other House and implements it as law. I am sure a great deal of work will have to be done by means of ministerial regulations. Will we be notified in advance of such regulations, or will they be laid before the Houses in the usual way? I wish the Minister of State well with this important legislation.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senators who took an interest in this important legislation. I am sure it will receive the same level of co-operation in the other House as it received from the Opposition parties in this House. We need to ensure that this important Bill is enacted before the sum<Col N="251"/>mer recess. Several Bills relating to road traffic law have been enacted in recent years, including the Bill that established the Road Safety Authority. I understand that the authority&rsquo;s first meeting since it was established on a statutory basis &mdash; there were some meetings of the interim authority &mdash; is taking place today in Dublin. Both Houses are aware of the evolving nature of road traffic law and the need to ensure that appropriate legislative supports are in place to promote road safety.</P>
    <P>Many issues were raised during the debate on this Bill. I tried to accommodate Opposition Senators as much as I could when they proposed amendments. That demonstrates the importance of debate in this House. The amendments I accepted will improve the Bill. I ask Members to appreciate that I was unable to accept some Opposition amendments, not for the sake of it but because they might have watered down the Bill. I know that was not the intention of the Senators who tabled the amendments in question. We hope to bring the Bill to the D&aacute;il next week, to be enacted within the next two weeks. This legislation will allow us to fulfil the aspirations of the Minister, Deputy Cullen, in respect of speed cameras and mandatory alcohol testing. I hope there will be a substantial reduction in the number of road fatalities over the next 12 months, compared with the past 12 months. If such a reduction takes place, I hope we will be able to attribute it to the introduction and enactment of this Bill by these Houses.</P>
    <P>As we approach what will hopefully be another beautiful weekend, I call on everyone who is responsible to work to improve safety on the roads and bring about a reduction in the number of fatalities. The Oireachtas can establish a road safety framework by means of legislation and regulation. Individuals who sit behind the steering wheels and walk along the roads need to take their responsibilities seriously. If we abide <Col N="252"/>by and adhere to the simple rules and regulations which are in place, we can make the roads safer for all road users.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude my summary, I would like to thank Senators for their contributions to this debate. I remind the wider public that the circumstances which might lead any of us to experience this problem could be around the next corner. Given that so many young people are in the Gallery at present, it is appropriate for me to remind their counterparts of all ages in all parts of the country that young people who do not drive can have an influence on others. For example, they can ensure that drivers do not move their cars until they and their passengers have put on their safety belts. I ask those who are visiting the Oireachtas to keep that simple message in mind. Along with their school colleagues, they can make a contribution by not allowing their families and friends to start driving until they have ensured that all safety belts are engaged.</P>
