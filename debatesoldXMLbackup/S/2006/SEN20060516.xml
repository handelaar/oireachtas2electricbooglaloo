    <Title>Deaths of Former Members: Expressions of Sympathy.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>We are saddened today that the representatives of each party must rise to voice sympathy on the deaths of two former Members of this House, John Mannion and Pat Codd. The former Senator, John Mannion of Fine Gael, served on the agricultural panel in Seanad &Eacute;ireann from 1969 to 1977. He was a member of Galway County Council for a long period, and of the former Western Health Board and other bodies. He was then elected to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and subsequently to Seanad &Eacute;ireann, and was well-liked. People in the west of Ireland talked about his family. He believed strongly in representing the people and was a keen member of the county council.</P>
      <P>His father, John Mannion senior, had been a Deputy for Galway West between 1951 and 1954. He too was on the agricultural panel. His son followed in his father&rsquo;s tradition.</P>
      <P>Pat Codd, from Wexford, was a Member of this House from 1975 to 1977, having come in on a Seanad by-election. He was a great champion of the Wexford people having been a diligent and painstaking member of Wexford County Council. I am reading from Deputy Kenny&rsquo;s press release because I did not know either gentleman so I must rely on this source. He believed in the power of politics to improve people&rsquo;s lives. We all subscribe to that tenet because that is why we are in politics. He was well-known and everybody spoke well of him which is highly unusual in political life.</P>
      <P>On behalf of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party, and its members, I express sympathy with the families of the late John Mannion of Clifden and the late Pat Codd of Wexford.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>On behalf of my colleagues in this House, and on behalf of the Fine Gael parliamentary party, I join the Leader&rsquo;s expression of sympathy for the families of former Senators John M. Mannion and Pat Codd. John Mannion and his family are known throughout the country as coming from a distinct political tradition in Galway-West. The Mannions have been in politics since the 1940s. John Mannion Senior was a distinguished Member of both Houses throughout the 1950s and 1960s.</P>
      <P>In recent years my party colleagues were sad to hear that John M. was crippled with arthritis. He has died young, at only 62 years of age. Our <Col N="1207"/>hearts and sympathy go out to his wife, Doris, and their two children. They live in a beautiful location in Clifden from where politically it is difficult to be elected in west Galway. John was a great champion of Connemara and of Galway. As the Leader of the House said, he had a distinguished record of service on Galway County Council for many years. He was a Member of this House from 1969 to 1973 and as a result of elections was a Member of the D&aacute;il from 1977 to 1981.</P>
      <P>I am reliably informed that he was a very quick-witted and colourful character. He enjoyed the company of other politicians and gave a lifelong commitment to the people of Connemara and to the people of Clifden in particular. He was a businessman with many business interests who employed a large number of people in Clifden. We remember the late John M. Mannion today.</P>
      <P>We also remember former Senator Pat Codd. He was a politician who hailed from Enniscorthy, County Wexford. I did not know him personally but I have heard his memory being eulogised by many colleagues in my party in recent months. Curiously, he won a by-election &mdash; a by-election is a very strange animal in this House because the result is known before the ballot takes place, assuming the Government of the day has a majority in the House. He was selected in April 1975 to win a casual vacancy in this House. It says a lot about the former Senator that the then Taoiseach, Liam Cosgrave, asked him to contest that by-election. He was a Member of this House from April 1975 until 1977. He was a councillor and former chairman of Wexford County Council.</P>
      <P>He had a deep interest in and a passion for agriculture and for rural affairs. He spoke in the House on many occasions on those matters. Colleagues have informed me that in recent years he virtually dedicated his life to charity work and to Self-Help Ireland and raised large sums of money for that organisation and for other charities in the south east. I offer our deepest sympathy to his wife, Evelyn, to his sons, Mark and John and his daughters, Mary, Sarah and Joan. We remember his commitment and the commitment of Senator Mannion to this House when they served here in such a distinguished way for many years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>The Independent Members wish to be associated with the words of condolence offered by the previous speakers. None of us served in this House with either of the two former Senators. I knew the former Senator Mannion quite well. He was on very friendly terms with the former Leader of the House, former Senator Maurice Manning. I met him when he visited the House and in Clifden on a number of occasions. I am aware of his family tradition of commitment to the needs of the west of Ireland which he represented at county council, D&aacute;il and Seanad level. I did not have the opportunity to meet former <Col N="1208"/>Senator Pat Codd but we express our condolences to the families of both.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Unfortunately I did not personally know either Senator Mannion or Senator Codd. Occasions such as this provide the opportunity to pay tribute to the principle of service as much as to individuals. It is worth repeating that their service was worthwhile even though not all of us would have known about it. I express my condolences to their families for their loss. It is certain that both of these men attempted to serve the country and their own communities and used all the abilities they possessed both within and without these Houses to do that service. The Labour Party wishes to be associated with the expressions of regret and condolence. We also want to pay tribute to the service they gave and to the fact that they choose to do it. Like all people who put their names forward in an election, they were willing to accept the possibility of losing as well as winning. Therefore, they were among the genuine risk takers in our society who take the risk not for their own sake but for the sake of what they believe they can do for their communities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>On behalf of the Progressive Democrats, I join the other groups in extending our sympathy to the family, friends and party colleagues of the late Senators John M. Mannion and Pat Codd.</P>
      <P>Like Senator O&rsquo;Toole, I would have met the late Senator Mannion with Maurice Manning when he was Leader of the House. Both Senators Mannion and Codd came from distinguished families in their respective parts of the country, families whose names would be well known within politics and well beyond that realm. Their commitment to agriculture was also referred to, of which I am aware from the past. Both of them served their areas and the State well. They deserve to be remembered here today with affection and regret.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to be associated with my colleagues&rsquo; expressions of sympathy to the families of John M. Mannion and the late Pat Codd.</P>
      <P>I served on Galway County Council with John M. Mannion for approximately 25 years. When I was first elected to the council in 1974 I remember well the bunch of heavies who were on it. When one remembers that people like Bobby Molloy, Mark Killalea, John Donnellan and Deputy Michael D. Higgins served on the council with John M. Mannion, one recalls that one had to stay quiet for a long period and serve one&rsquo;s time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is making up for that now.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="1209"/>
<?oasys _cl11.5- ?>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>Everyone who remembers John Mannion as a member of Galway County Council would say he was the type of person who would take one under his wing because he believed in consensus and the need to avoid conflict at all costs. For that reason many members across parties would rely on his careful decisions and the way in which he would put forward proposals if a matter was causing conflict in the chamber. That epitomises the character of the late John Mannion.</P>
      <P>John also served as a member of Western Health Board. He had many achievements on that board in bringing services to Clifden, the outer periphery of the health board area. At all times he was fair given that in a county like Galway there would have been serious conflict between east and west in so far as people from east Galway would have believed that Connemara was getting most and <i>vice versa</i>. John was the second Fine Gael chairperson of Galway County Council after the late Toddy Byrne who was the first Fine Gael chairperson of the council. His achievement in winning a seat for Fine Gael in the D&aacute;il from his base in Clifden was a super achievement. Were it not for the fact that he was recognised as a person of great integrity I do not believe he would have achieved that.</P>
      <P>I would like to be associated with the words of sympathy extended to his wife Doris and his two children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Generally, only Senators from the counties of the deceased members are asked to express sympathy but as Senator John Paul Phelan was a close family friend of Senator Codd, he may do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Cathaoirleach and am grateful for his indulgence. I did not know the late John M. Mannion but from colleagues I have heard many stories and yarns about this activities and politics down the years. I want to extend sympathy to his family.</P>
      <P Just="Left">However, I knew Pat Codd very well for the past number of years. He was very involved in politics even up to his sudden death and was interested and participated in all aspects of political life throughout the country.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I met him for the last time a couple of months ago in the Oireachtas Library. He was here on a visit with Deputy Kehoe from Wexford. We were very shocked by Pat&rsquo;s sudden death. He had a long and varied career in politics. As people have said, he was a former member of Wexford County Council. He was chairman of the county council in his last year there, 1984-85. Pat Codd had the unique distinction of being a member of the county council for Fine Gael with his son-in-law, Martin Dunbar, from the Labour Party. They represented two different electoral areas. Nonetheless, that is quite unusual in politics.</P><Col N="1210"/>
      <P Just="Left">All politicians can run up against their own organisation from time to time and Pat Codd had his difficulties with Fine Gael. He stood for a selection convention in February 1982 and was beaten by one or two votes by a 20 year old town councillor from Enniscorthy called Ivan Yates, who also went on to have a distinguished career in politics. He was upset at the time but afterwards became very actively involved in Fine Gael despite his disappointment. As Senator Brian Hayes has said, he was the organiser of the Self-Help Ireland charity in the south east region. He collected vast amounts of money and dedicated much of his latter years to that worthy cause, putting in a tremendous effort in that regard. He was a treasurer of the Wexford GAA County Board in years gone by and was very dedicated to that organisation.</P>
      <P>I was pleased to have been able to attend his requiem mass on Holy Thursday night in Marshalstown church, just outside Enniscorthy. I had the privilege of going to college with his grandson, as well as knowing Pat for a number of years and I wish to be associated with the expressions of sympathy to his family.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I also want to be associated with the tributes to the late former Members of this House, John M. Mannion and Pat Codd. I knew both of them. When I entered the House in 1977, Senator Mannion had already been a Member for the two previous terms. On that occasion, 1977, he was elected to the D&aacute;il. We stayed in the same hotel and a friendship developed between us. Since he left parliamentary politics I had occasion to meet him nearly every year at the Listowel races, where he stayed with his long-time friend, the former Deputy and Senator, Gerard Lynch. I attended his funeral and was pleased to do so. I always found John Mannion to be a gentleman who never let politics come between him and friendship.</P>
      <P>I also knew Pat Codd after he had left the Seanad. He was elected in 1975 in a by-election. There were five Seanad by-elections the same day. Fine Gael won three and the Labour Party won two. Pat Codd, who stood on the agricultural panel, won the seat by 20 votes from another Fine Gael candidate on that occasion, Joe Lennon, from Louth. Subsequently, when I was campaigning for the Seanad and when Pat Codd had a vote&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Title>Order of Business.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>The Order of Business is Nos. 1 and 2. No. 1, Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Bill 2006 &mdash; Report and Final Stages, to be taken on the conclusion of the Order of Business and to conclude not later than 5 p.m.; and No. 2, Road Safety Authority Bill 2004 &mdash; Second Stage (resumed), to be taken at 5.30 p.m. and to conclude not later than 7 p.m., with the contributions of Senators not to exceed ten minutes each and the Minister to be called upon to reply not later than ten minutes before the conclusion of Second Stage. There will be a sos from 5 p.m. to 5.30 p.m.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>We accept today&rsquo;s Order of Business. I wish to take this opportunity to put on record my view, and I suspect the view of the vast majority of the travelling public who have had to witness it, on the wildcat industrial action over the past two days by certain elements who allegedly want to support public transport. It is unacceptable that the travelling public can be dealt with like this. People arrived at train stations yesterday unaware of this action. Will the management of Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann indicate why people were not informed? Given the fact that it knew this situation was at hand and that it was forewarned of it, why was no public information given to people who wanted to use the rail service yesterday?</P>
      <P>That is unacceptable from the management of Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann but it is equally unacceptable for the unions involved to take out their difficulties in terms of training for these new trains on the travelling public. This is a reminder of an industrial age we hoped had long since gone. There are implications in this for the current partnership talks. This is a clear breach of the existing pay agreement and the associated commitments within that agreement.</P>
      <P>I ask the Government to provide time in the House, possibly today or tomorrow, so that everyone can put their views on this issue on the record. We have made a major investment in rail transport in recent years. The State is now subsidising the service to a significant degree in order to bring it up from the Third World service we had for many years. We now find that the main actors want to put all of that to one side. It is not acceptable and I wish to use this opportunity to speak on behalf of the vast majority of people who want to get on with their business without this kind of discommoding of service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>In dealing with industrial relations issues it is regularly pointed out to me how slow groups like IBEC have been to say when things go wrong with their members and that they are afraid to single them out for criticism. We do it differently on the other side. I do not have the slightest difficulty whatever in condemning this action. It is inappropriate, unofficial and is in breach of the national wage talks.</P><Col N="1212"/>
      <P>I wish to put on the record that the unions clearly said yesterday they did not approve of it. They said it was unofficial and they told the drivers to go back to work. I hope Senator Brian Hayes corrects the impression he gave in this regard as it is completely wrong of him to state that the unions are trying to take out their frustration on the travelling public. The unions had decided to continue with the talks and the introduction of the carriages. Two people withdrew their labour, as we all know they are constitutionally entitled to do. No one approves of it, least of all their own unions who had spent weeks in talks in trying to resolve difficulties.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>The matter had gone to the Labour Court, which had given a ruling which some of the drivers did not accept but the union did accept. Other issues were to be discussed, starting from today, which management and the unions were content to discuss. This is a failure of processes and a breach of agreements but I stress it is due to individuals and not to any union structures. It has not been sanctioned by union representatives participating in talks in Government Buildings who will do all in their power to correct this. There is no justification for it.</P>
      <P>Senator Brian Hayes is correct that the dispute should not have come on us like a ton of bricks yesterday morning. Apparently, management was aware of a problem last Friday afternoon and it offered the drivers additional training over the weekend but it should have at least indicated the problem to the public. I regret that did not happen but I regret the dispute more than anything following five years of peace in the most difficult workplace for industrial relations. Five years of industrial peace in CIE did not come about easily, as it required significant investment by the company in its human resources structures, which were appalling prior to that. The management representatives involved in human resources and the union leadership in this area have done their best to get the company working. I cannot remember another five years of industrial peace in the company and we should try to get back to that situation.</P>
      <P>No. 9 on the Order Paper is a Bill relating to the naming of places in the Gaeltacht. The House will be delighted that Kerry County Council decided by a large majority on Monday to put the naming of Dingle to a vote of the people. The council decided the vote would not be restricted to townlands or civil parishes. It will cover the municipal area, as determined by the council, in accordance with the interpretation of the Act provided by its advisers. This is line with my interpretation of the legislation and that of Senator Coghlan but it is different from the interpretation of the Attorney General and the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.</P>
      <P>I will not introduce the Bill until the plebiscite takes place in Dingle. There is no doubt about the result, which will be in conflict with the legis<Col N="1213"/>lation, and this will have to be resolved by the Government.</P>

	<P>Nuair a tharl&oacute;idh s&eacute;, t&aacute; s&uacute;il agam nach mbeidh reifreann eile i mbaile fearainn eile ar imeall Gaeltachta ag iarraidh go n-athr&oacute;far an logainm &oacute; Ghaelainn go B&eacute;arla toisc nach dtaitna&iacute;onn s&eacute; le daoine bheith ainmnithe mar chuid den Ghaeltacht. M&aacute; theasta&iacute;onn le pobal an Daingin an logainm a athr&uacute; go B&eacute;arla, ba ch&oacute;ir go n-imeoidh siad amach as an Ghaeltacht. N&iacute; f&eacute;idir liom theacht ar an r&eacute;iteach go mbeidh ainm oifigi&uacute;il B&eacute;arla ar bhaile at&aacute; in ainm is a bheith sa nGaeltacht. N&iacute; thuigim sin agus n&iacute;or thuig m&eacute; riamh &eacute;.</P>
      <P>I have little to add to the comments of my colleagues on the rail strike, except that whenever there is an operational problem in Irish Rail, the workers are always wheeled out by management. I have never seen a manager on a platform when trains are delayed or overcrowded. Usually a junior staff member is presented. I recall a very nice gentleman walking through the train one day saying, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m really sorry the train is overcrowded. It is not my fault. You should take it up with management who makes these decisions.&rdquo; One would spend a long time looking for Irish Rail management after 5 p.m. daily or on a Sunday when trains are sometimes overcrowded. I agree the industrial action is entirely wrong and I am bemused by it. I recall the Garda sought more money to use the PULSE system, which was intended to make its job easier. I am never too sure why people want more pay when they are about to be given improved equipment to do their jobs better. It is always a mystery.</P>
      <P>However, Irish Rail management agreed drivers needed additional training over the weekend. There might be ambivalence or uncertainty about whether people are properly trained and while the action is wrong, there are issues. On Friday evening, the management conceded at the last hour that there might be a training deficit issue, which I find quite frightening. This issue is not just about one individual, as these trains are full of hundreds of people. Let them go back to work, let these issues be resolved and let the long-suffering people have access to trains that are less than 20 years old, commuters on the Cork to Dublin route having suffered for quite a while as a result of the older trains.</P>
      <P>Ten reports on ten different accident and emergency services have been extracted from the Department of Health and Children. The reports were compiled for the Department using taxpayers&rsquo; money &mdash; the T&aacute;naiste would call it &ldquo;our money&rdquo;, because she is a great defender of taxpayers&rsquo; and Government money &mdash; but they were to be kept secret until the Freedom of Information Act was invoked by a national newspaper. Now that the reports have been published by the national newspaper, could the Leader ensure they are also placed in the Oireachtas Library so that Members are not marginalised again on a debate <Col N="1214"/>about information? Notwithstanding the spin in a Sunday newspaper, those reports confirm that the accident and emergency service is a mess. That is not the fault of the people working on the front line. We ought to see those reports and it is peculiar that they had to be extracted using the Freedom of Information Act.</P>
      <P>I received a letter last week from Christian Aid about conditions in the Palestinian territories. Among the issues raised in the letter, it was pointed out that the occupying power is responsible for the well-being of the occupied people. It is a profound breach of international law for the Israeli Government to use the people of Palestine as hostages. Ten Israelis have been killed in an horrific car bombing and 20 Palestinians killed by the Israeli defence forces in the same period of time. The two to one ratio continues and I suspect that it is a deliberate ratio. For every one Israeli that is killed, two Palestinians are killed. Some people have tried to pretend that the crisis was over. I ask the Minister to come before the House and explain how the EU proposes to ensure that security and public services are sustained if it is going to ignore the government of the Palestinian territories. This is a humanitarian crisis that was not caused by an act of God, nor by a natural disaster, but by the deliberate policy of the US, Israel and the EU.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Ryan&rsquo;s request for a debate on the Palestinian situation. I hope the Minister for Foreign Affairs can come in to discuss the issue as a matter of urgency. Can the Leader provide time in next week&rsquo;s schedule to discuss the serious drought in Kenya, Ethiopia and Somalia? I commend the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan, as well as the president of the Irish Red Cross, David Andrews, who has been visiting the affected areas. The response of the Government has been very generous and over &euro;7 million of taxpayers&rsquo; money has been earmarked for the region. We should also commend the work of the voluntary agencies and the priests and nuns who carry out dynamic work there. The Sisters of Mercy have spent 50 years in Kenya working with the poorest of the poor and we should recognise their contribution. We need the opportunity to debate this grave situation, which is affecting around 11 million people.</P>

	<P>I compliment the producers of &ldquo;Prime Time Investigates&rdquo; on their programme last night, which was followed by a very comprehensive analysis on &ldquo;Questions and Answers&rdquo;. This morning, I listened to the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Tim O&rsquo;Malley, admit on my local radio station that he was embarrassed by the programme, as he should, given that he has been in office for longer than four years.</P>
      <P>Senators on this side of the House are constantly told that 1997 was a pivotal year in politi<Col N="1215"/>cal history but I remind Members on the other side that they have been in Government for the past nine years. The T&aacute;naiste has recently admitted that an emergency exists, so the Government should get on with resolving the matter. We do not want to be described by people from outside this jurisdiction as a Third World country in respect of accident and emergency services.</P>
      <P>Last week, I received a telephone call from a person whose 88 year old father was on a trolley in Limerick Regional Hospital for more than 24 hours. He asked me if I could do anything to help, so I visited the accident and emergency department at midnight and spoke to the person in charge, who was extremely co-operative but drew my attention to other elderly people on trolleys and said she was ashamed of what she saw. Regrettably, as there were no spare beds in the hospital, a commitment could not be made to facilitate the person&rsquo;s father. Meanwhile, Professor Drumm claims we need better primary care services instead of extra beds. I remind Members of the bureaucracy in the area of nursing home care and subventions. We must do away with these impediments and ensure elderly people are facilitated.</P>

In this year&rsquo;s public capital programme, &euro;427 million is being invested in CIE and the public wants the rolling stock at Limerick Junction, which has been travelling back and forth to Cork on trial runs, to be put into service.</P>
      <P>Representatives of Aer Lingus unions approached me outside the Mansion House to argue strongly against any privatisation of the airline. It is difficult to sustain that sort of argument when wildcat strikes take place in other public services. Similar strikes do not occur in the private sector because they would cause the employer to close. While I hope the issue will be resolved as soon as possible, we should hold a debate on it because, as Senator O&rsquo;Toole noted, the strike is entirely contrary to the spirit and letter of partnership.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I concur with Senator O&rsquo;Toole that this is an unofficial strike which does not have union sanction and that unions have behaved responsibly. It is somewhat unfair to transfer by analogy events taking place within the rail services to Aer Lingus in an attempt to discredit those, such as myself, who oppose privatisation. This unofficial strike is undemocratic, inappropriate and damaging to tourism. Many of us heard the anger expressed on the radio by foreign visitors to our shores.</P>
      <P>I commend the staff of St. Patrick&rsquo;s Cathedral on their humane approach to the awkward <Col N="1216"/>situation in which a group of about 40 Afghans have camped in the cathedral. Although I understand the reservations of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, it would be useful were he to meet them without giving any commitments. These people are in despair and have indicated they will starve themselves to death. They come from an appalling country, in which their lives are plainly at risk. Given that we are seeking favourable treatment for our own vulnerable emigrants to the United States of America, we ought to be sensitive in our treatment of these people rather than drive them into a corner. They have shown the imagination and capacity to come here in difficult circumstances. They would be an addition to this country. The Minister could, as happened in Belgium, meet these people without commitment. Belgium allowed them to stay, and that would be the decent thing to do especially in light of the appalling record of those charged by us to examine people&rsquo;s cases. There is at least one person who has boasted that he has never let anybody in. That is not good enough. We should investigate this.</P>
      <P>I support the calls for a debate on the Middle East, especially Palestine. The United States and the European Union have behaved disgracefully in refusing to allow funds to go to a democratically elected government. While it may not be of the complexion we would welcome, it is elected and, as Senator Ryan said, the civilian population is being used as a lever. While we were abroad on parliamentary business last week I saw on the BBC World Service a father grieving by the bedside of his nine year old son, waiting for him to die as a result of lack of parts for a kidney dialysis machine. The doctor explained that the boy was drowning in his own waste products and would inevitably die owing to a lack of equipment that should have been supplied. The funds for such equipment are being withheld. The death of that boy, which is now taking place, is a reproach to the conscience of decent people everywhere and we should put pressure on our Government to ensure at least the basic elements of welfare for this suffering people.</P>

      <P>One of the great human tragedies in the history of the State was the manner in which so many were infected with hepatitis C and HIV as a result of the use of contaminated blood and blood products. We all remember the harrowing stories of families that found themselves in this position. Although the story has left the headlines and is no longer big news, the suffering of the families <Col N="1217"/>continues and will continue for many years. Transfusion Positive, an action group for victims of this terrible mistake, has contacted us about an insurance scheme for the victims. This issue has been going on for a considerable time, almost nine years. Our sympathy goes to those victims because their lives will never be the same again. They found themselves in the wrong place at the wrong time. It behoves us to come to their aid and ensure that insurance scheme is implemented as soon as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>On numerous occasions in the past year I have asked the Leader to bring to the notice of the Minister for Education and Science the serious situation that has developed on an ongoing basis, and which has been repeated today, whereby the bus fleet for transporting pupils to school is unsafe. It is unbelievable that the Minister ignores the calls and concerns of many partners in education who are not politicians. They have repeatedly asked for a complete audit on all school transport vehicles, those of Bus &Eacute;ireann as well as the private operators. This inspection must be independent. A disaster was narrowly avoided today when a bus caught fire in County Westmeath. We have had disaster and tragedy in Meath and Offaly in the recent past.</P>
      <P>I am not so sure what it will take to activate the Minister to address the problems and disasters associated with school transport. It is important that there be an independent assessor for all the vehicles, once and for all.</P>
      <P>It is clear the bus that went on fire today did not have a fire extinguisher on board. If it were not for the alertness of the pupils themselves, we would surely be talking about an even greater tragedy today. The Leader should invite the Minister to the House to indicate clearly that she will carry out, once and for all, a thorough audit of all school buses, both private and public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomMorrissey"><NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
	<P>Like other Senators, I condemn out of hand the wildcat strike that has taken place in the past 48 hours. My party has always said that reform should be part of the great investment in public transport, including in our railways. Only last week the interconnector for the DART in Dublin was being designed and spoken about. It is inappropriate for a strike such as this to spread across the country at a time when we are trying to improve people&rsquo;s confidence in public transport. There is no question but that it must be condemned. Irrespective of whether management or unions are at fault regarding the strike, safety must be paramount on our railways, especially if we are to encourage people to use public transport.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader make time available in this or the next session for a debate on our ports? The former Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Gallagher, recently published a report by <Col N="1218"/>Indecon which clearly illustrated the need for further investment in port infrastructure. Now that our ports have been brought under the aegis of the Department of Transport under Transport 21, I would like a debate on this matter. The group of 100 exporters and the large companies of this country, which have been interviewed about the report, accord high priority to further investment in our ports under the next national development plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>Bearing in mind the shortage of hospital beds reported in Ireland, my attention was drawn recently to the position on hospital beds in other countries. A friend of mine who recently went to hospital in the United States was told he should stay in the hotel beside the hospital. His operation was not very serious and he was told he could be picked up at the hotel and brought to the hospital after which he would be returned to the hotel. Something similar happened in Hume Street Hospital some years ago &mdash; Hume Street is not too far from Leinster House. The hospital reorganised and devoted half of its operation to day care because it found that a very large number of its patients did not have to stay in bed all day long or all week long.</P>
      <P>My attention was drawn this morning to a proposal in the United Kingdom that the relatives of older people who are blocking hosptial beds, but who are not ill and refusing to move out, should be obliged to pay for their accommodation. I am not sure whether this is the right approach but we sometimes try to invent a new approach to solve our problems in Ireland when we could copy what is happening in other countries. There is a solution worth examining which would immediately remedy some of the demands in regard to our hospital beds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Ms White</NameTxt>
	<P>I call for an urgent debate on care options for older people following the report in today&rsquo;s edition of <i>The Irish Times</i> that a consultant recommends that families be charged the full cost of caring for their elderly relatives in acute hospital beds in circumstances where those families have blocked their discharge from hospital. The reality is that families often cannot afford to pay for the cost of residential home care. Most people do not want to enter residential home care.</P>
      <P>I call on the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children to spell out the correct care options that should exist for older people. Most people, only 5%, end up in residential home care. Some &euro;1 billion is spent every year on care for the elderly. Although this is anti-ageism week, Ireland is lax in its care of older people. Most people wish to remain at home when they get sick and do not wish to enter residential care. We have poor back-up home care in this country, despite the &euro;1 billion spent on investment in residential home care by private entrepreneurs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Transport to the House to debate the ever-increasing backlog of those awaiting driving tests. The figure in respect of each county is increasing, despite promises made by the Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen, to slash the backlog. In the past 12 months the figure has increased by 10,000 nationally. There is a waiting list of 135,000 nationwide for the driving test. This is a damning indictment of a Minister who promised change. It is an outrageous attack on our young people, who are forced to pay high insurance premiums because of the inability to test them. Sitting the test would enable them to receive a full licence and reduce their insurance premiums. This lame duck Minister has failed to overhaul the driving test system. He has squandered taxpayers&rsquo; money in every portfolio he has held. It is time he came to this House to account for his actions, waste and negligence with regard to reducing the driving test waiting list.</P>

	<P>Like Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute;, I support the calls of the Irish Haemophilia Society and Transfusion Positive. They have been awaiting an insurance scheme for people infected with hepatitis C and HIV through contaminated blood and blood products for nine years. The T&aacute;naiste promised that legislation would be introduced by April. When will such legislation be introduced?</P>
      <P>I agree with the call for a debate on our ports, which carry the vast majority of trade and traffic of exports and imports. They are of vital importance to the country and I look forward to an early debate on this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCoonan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coonan</NameTxt>
	<P>Last week the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform announced a staffing grant of &euro;100,000 for a cr&egrave;che centre in Templemore. This is most welcome but the problem is that the centre is not yet built. The planning process is under way at present. Now that the war chest is full and such grants will be allocated over the summer, can the Leader ensure equal treatment for the taxpayers of Ireland? A number of people have applied for grants for cr&egrave;che facilities and have been ignored yet a centre that is not yet built has been awarded a staffing grant. Could the Leader arrange to explain to Members of the Opposition the criteria used in determining allocation of these grants?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Leader to investigate the delay in urgently needed home care and home help workers to take up their positions. Many people have been successful in their application for home help and have been recruited but are held up because of the backlog created by new vetting procedures that come into effect on 1 January. There is a crazy scenario where many elderly people who are urgently in need of home help and home care, but who are perhaps stuck in nursing homes in which they do not wish to be, cannot return home because of the vetting procedure. Will the Leader speak to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to see if extra resources can be given to the vetting unit which, I believe, is in Thurles to screen those applications quickly, thus avoiding problems elsewhere?</P>
      <P>I totally disagree with Senator Norris on the Afghan asylum seekers. When people apply for asylum here, they agree to leave the country if they are unsuccessful. We cannot have a scenario where people who do not get their way write their own rules. It is a very awkward situation and I wish the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform well in his endeavours in this regard. We would want to be very careful about giving in to mob rule on this issue.</P>
      <P>Somebody came into my office recently claiming he had fled a war torn country and came straight to Ireland. It emerged later that he had lived in England for years and had a family there. His story was completely bogus. It is important to check out these cases. If people are refused asylum on legitimate grounds, they should leave the country and we should not be bullied or forced into taking another position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Brian Hayes raised the wildcat industrial action by locomotive drivers and particularly the fact people were not informed of the action. If they had been informed, they would not have crowded into Kent Station only to be sent away. Young students in Kildare were setting off for university exams and we heard one of them on radio yesterday. One must consider the discommoding of people going about their business.</P>
      <P>As Senator O&rsquo;Toole said, these were wildcat strikes which were not legal. The talk about training is a smokescreen for looking for more money for driving new trains. In 2001, when the new trains were ordered, the drivers got a cash payment. The Labour Court expressly stated they received that payment. One cannot treat people in such an appalling way.</P>
      <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole is right that there were five years of industrial peace because the last substan<Col N="1221"/>tial agreement with CIE workers of all grades, but mainly with drivers, gave them decent pay which they were due because they perform a very onerous job. The drivers cannot treat the public in this way.</P>
      <P>I fully agree with Senators O&rsquo;Toole, Brian Hayes and Morrissey and others who spoke on the matter. Complete disregard was shown for people who pay fares and pay the drivers&rsquo; wages. Everyone has the constitutional right to withdraw his or her labour but one must operate according to strictures and there are procedures which these drivers can work through with their unions. I was glad to hear one of the trade union representatives yesterday condemn this type of action, which Senator O&rsquo;Toole mentioned.</P>
      <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole raised the fact the people of Kerry are to hold a plebiscite on what they should call Dingle. That is a common sense approach and we are glad that will happen. The Senator will not move his Bill until he sees what happens. Senator Ryan wondered if there would be a further raft of plebiscites if other towns decide to change their names. He also said Irish Rail management was nowhere to be seen. He said there was a deficit in training but there is not. A considerable amount of training has taken place. He also asked that the ten reports on accident and emergency services be put in the Oireachtas Library. I will pass on that request.</P>
      <P>Senator Ryan also spoke about the very graphic Christian Aid letter on the people of Palestine. He said the humanitarian crisis was not caused by God but by man. Senator Leyden called for a debate on Kenya, Ethiopia and Somalia and on the valiant priests and nuns who have worked in those places for so long.</P>
      <P>I share Senator Finucane&rsquo;s praise for the &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; report on accident and emergency services which I watched along with the programme after it. It was very graphic and it was sad to see, in the main, very elderly people terrified of going to a hospital. None of us would like to go to hospital but these people were terrified because they did not know how they would be treated.</P>

	<P>Senator Mansergh referred to the public capital programme and the &euro;427 million being invested in CIE in 2006. He spoke about being approached outside the Mansion <Col N="1222"/>House by the Aer Lingus unions but said there was no parallel between the privatisation of Aer Lingus and the wildcat strikes. Senator Norris seemed to think Senator Mansergh was comparing the two cases but he was not. He was pointing out there was no comparison between the two.</P>
      <P>Senator Norris also referred to the Afghan asylum seekers in St. Patrick&rsquo;s Cathedral and the humanitarian way in which they are being treated. We are all glad to know they have been drinking water since yesterday. The Senator also spoke about Palestine.</P>
      <P>Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; referred to Dingle. He also raised the case of those infected with hepatitis C and the fact that nine years later, an insurance scheme has still not be introduced. There is some word on that issue. The hepatitis C and HIV compensation tribunal (amendment) Bill is expected to be published this session. It will provide for the establishment of an insurance scheme for infected persons. Hopefully, it will be published this session and we will be able to convey that to those who wrote to us on the matter.</P>
      <P>Senator Ulick Burke referred to the bus fleet and said it was unsafe. I do not know the circumstances of the fire on the bus at Delvin but the Senator has called for an independent audit of all buses, including CIE buses and those which are subcontracted. There does not appear to have been a fire extinguisher on board the bus at Delvin. Senator Morrissey condemned the wildcat strikes and said safety must be paramount. He also called for a debate on ports, which are now the responsibility of the Department of Transport.</P>
      <P>Senator Quinn referred to a friend of his in the US who went into hospital for a minor operation but who stayed in a hotel close by before and after the procedure. It is always very instructive to look at other countries and how they manage situations.</P>
      <P>Senator White called for a debate on the elderly, care options and home care. Senator Bannon called for the Minister for Transport to come to the House to discuss driving tests. I am glad to tell him there is a move in that regard, although not realised as yet. Talks are under way to bring about an arrangement whereby driving tests will be outsourced for a short period to get a large number off the books, which is very welcome.</P>
      <P>Senator Cummins asked about the insurance scheme for those infected with hepatitis C and HIV. As I said, that Bill is being drafted and will be introduced in this session. Senator Coonan welcomed the staffing grant for the cr&egrave;che in Templemore but wanted to know why other such facilities were not getting grants. Since I am not in the inspectorate of child care facilities, I have no idea why one such facility would get a grant over another. No doubt the Senator will make much noise about that issue.</P>
      <P>Senator Browne said we should check the bona fides of those seeking asylum. One is meant to <Col N="1223"/>seek asylum in the country of first origin, according to the Dublin Convention for which the former Minister of State, Deputy Burton, was responsible.</P>
      <P>I too have come across the long period it takes to vet people taking up caring positions. In that time the position may lapse or the person may not come through the vetting procedure which gives rise to problems. I would be glad to take up this point.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 1 in the name of Senator Bannon is consequential on amendment No. 2, and amendments Nos. 3 to 5, inclusive, and amendment No. 28 are related. Amendments Nos. 1 to 5, inclusive, and amendment No. 28 may be discussed together by agreement.</P>

	<P>I am grateful to the Senator for his persistence and charm. Regrettably, my answer will be the same as it was on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>Before I reply to the Senator, however, I wish to speak on a personal note. I recall the former Senator Codd, who was from Wexford. I am aware that Senators have just paid tribute to him, and to former Senator Mannion, and while it may be inappropriate for me to do so, I wish to be associated with those fine tributes. I extend my <Col N="1224"/>sympathy to the members of Fine Gael, who have lost two former colleagues.</P>
      <P>This group of amendments seeks to revise the description of the actors in the planning process, namely, the Environmental Protection Agency and the prospective applicants, with the consequential deletions. On Committee Stage I sympathised with Senator Bannon&rsquo;s attempts to simplify the language of the Bill as virtually every Bill could do with some simplification. I made it clear, however, that while the language may seem excessively complicated the phrasing used by the Parliamentary Counsel is the best and most appropriate way of expressing our intentions.</P>
      <P>None of these amendments would add value and they could reduce the legal certainty of the text. I regret that I am not in a position to accept any of the amendments. We will later discuss another amendment which demonstrates the dangers of accepting textual amendments on the hoof.</P>

I stated previously that I did not believe this achieved the objective Senator Bannon was trying to achieve, which was to make things a little shorter and more concise.

	<P>The amendment proposes to insert the phrase &ldquo;where applicable&rdquo; in the paragraph permitting the board to indicate that it considered granting permission subject to the applicant for permission submitting revised drawings, with the addition of the phrase &ldquo;where applicable&rdquo;. This is unnecessary because the section states that the board has an absolute discretion as to when it can fulfil the function outlined in the section. The provision concerned, therefore, is one of the important changes sought by the board to allow it greater flexibility and powers in handling major applications and will allow the board ensure the right development in the right place. For this reason and because I do not believe the addition of the phrase would add anything to the Bill and <Col N="1227"/>as it runs contrary to the earlier editing that Senator Bannon was proposing, I regret I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

	<P>Amendments Nos. 18, 20, 23 and 24, propose to delete the words &ldquo;or for the purposes of an activity for which&rdquo;, from section 5 and would reinstate a similar phrase later on. This phrase, &ldquo;comprising or for the purposes of an activity&rdquo; is used throughout the Planning and Development Act 2000, the Environmental Protection Act and the Waste Management Act. It is a common phrase which seems to be somewhat cumbersome. I think it is sufficiently broad to ensure that the EPA is consulted where necessary for the board to obtain its views and therefore, I do not propose to accept the amendment. There is a particular risk of confusion where different language is used in different sections to express the same idea. Much of the language used in the Bill is based on the existing phraseology in the 2000 Act, as amended by the Protection of the Environment Act 2003.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Senator Bannon suggested on Committee Stage that this language had been used to amend these Acts in the Protection of the Environment Act. I refer the Senator to section 99F, inserted by section 15 of the 2003 Act in which the language used is the same as is used here.</P>
      <P>With regard to amendment No. 19, it would simply delete the word, &ldquo;a&rdquo;, in the phrase, &ldquo;an integrated pollution control licence or a waste licence&rdquo; in subsection (5). The phrase is correct as it is and I do not propose to change it as this would be a disimprovement.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Brady is correct. I explained on Committee Stage that this amendment is unnecessary. The amendment proposes to prevent the board making a decision on an application, where there is a live request to the Environmental Protection Agency to make observations on an application which, &ldquo;comprises or is for the purposes of&rdquo; an IPPC or waste-licensable activity. I do not propose to accept the amendment. It should be noted that the board does not make decisions without having sought the views of the EPA where the board considers they are necessary.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>The planning and IPPC licensing systems are separate but related processes. There is, however, an interface between them, the principles of which are set down in the Environmental Protection Act 1992, as amended by the 2003 Protection of the Environment Act. The current arrangements enable the planning system and the IPPC&rsquo;s licensing systems to reach their own conclusions on applications and for planning permission to be refused on environmental grounds, but opportunities are taken for each system to acknowledge the other and for the separate consent authorities to consult each other.</P>
      <P>The amendment would put the strategic consent process out of step with the arrangements currently in place for dealing with non-strategic planning cases, which are working fine in practice. I am sure such an effect was not the Senator&rsquo;s intention but that would be one of the practical implications of what he proposes.</P>
      <P>The proposed change would also introduce a delay into the strategic process which is contrary to what we are trying to achieve in this Bill and contradictory to the Senator&rsquo;s subsequent amendment to reduce the time the board has to make a <Col N="1229"/>decision. It would effectively tie the hands of the board in key cases, when in practice we need to ensure the board has the flexibility to make efficient and robust decisions. Senator Bannon in his contribution strongly supported the idea of making robust and timely decisions. He suggested an even more timely period than the 18 weeks provided in the Bill.</P>
      <?oasys _cl11.5- ?>
      <P>There is a contradiction in terms of the effect of the proposed amendment. First, it would have the unforeseen circumstance of rendering the consent process out of step with the arrangements currently in place for non-strategic cases and, ironically, would result in a further tieing of the hands of the board, which is contrary to good amendments put forward by the Senator in other cases. In the interests of ensuring the Senator is consistent, I will not accept the amendment.</P>

    <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    <P>Government amendment No. 22:</P>
    <P LI="1" el="5">In page 12, line 33, after &ldquo;provision,&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;the report (and the recommendations, if any, attached to it) submitted by a planning authority in accordance with section 37E(4),&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>On Committee Stage in response to an Opposition amendment submitted by Senator McCarthy and supported by Senator Bannon, I said I would consider amending the Bill to specify that the board shall consider the planning authority&rsquo;s report to it and take into account any recommendations by the elected members. It was always the intention that this would be the case.</P>
      <P>As I said in my Second Stage contribution, one of the unusual features of this Bill is that we are returning to a situation that has not pertained since 1963 in giving councillors, the elected representatives of the people, a statutory right to have their voice heard.</P>
      <P>However, I have decided that the explicit inclusion of the report and recommendations in the list of matters to be considered by the board in making a determination is appropriate and I take this opportunity to do so. It underlines the importance I attach to the views of the authority and, in particular, the views of elected representatives being taken on board as part of the deliberations.</P>
      <P>The two main Opposition parties would be strongly supportive of this view. That argument was made by Senators McCarthy and Bannon. I am pleased to propose this amendment in response to the cogent argument made by Senator Bannon and in response to my ethos, which is to give a real role to local authority members to make their expressions and will heard.</P>

    <P>Government amendment No. 25:</P>
    <P LI="1" el="5">In page 15, line 7, to delete &ldquo;to be specified by the Board,&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>Throughout my responses on Committee Stage and today, I repeated that the Government must rely on the advice of the Parliamentary Counsel on the correct and accurate expression of our intentions in this legislation. It has been on this basis that I have refused to accept most of the textual amendments put forward. However, I indicated that I had sympathy with this amendment when it was tabled by Senator Bannon and I raised it again with the Parliamentary Counsel, as I promised I would on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>This is a good example of how a seemingly innocuous amendment with a reasonable justification &mdash; Senator Bannon made a reasonable case for its inclusion on the last occasion &mdash; could create legal difficulty by affecting the overall balance of a studied and carefully worded text. While it initially appeared to have no impact on the meaning of the section, the Parliamentary Counsel has pointed out that it could be read in a different way, meaning that the board could indicate after giving its decision what community facility or service was to be funded, instead of indicating that at the time the decision was given. This would be a perverse interpretation because this is certainly not what Senator Bannon had in mind, nor I when I was supportive of his proposal.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Counsel suggested a number of amendments to rectify this problem, which would have to follow through in each case the community gain provision occurs and would add substantially to the complexity of the language, something of which I know the Senator would not approve and would not want to impose on the Bill.</P>
      <P>The simpler solution appears to be to delete the text in question and return the phrasing to the original, which is most appropriate to our objective and that is what I propose we should do.</P>
      <P>The views of the Parliamentary Counsel on the impact of the proposed change were precisely the opposite to the reasonable argument put forward by the Senator. I propose that we delete the words that were added and which I was agreeable to add and to return to the original text.</P>
      <P>This is a good example of how the Parliamentary Counsel can prudently come up with, to put it mildly, meanings and that could be construed in a court case or in a challenge to the legislation to be contrary to the effects the Senator and I had hoped to achieve. What I propose is not a sleight on Senator Bannon, as if it were, it would be a sleight on me. I am simply bowing to the well argued case put forward by the Parliamen<Col N="1231"/>tary Counsel. I hope the House will support this amendment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senators Bannon and Cummins. These amendments relate to the new power being given to the board allowing it to attach community gain conditions to a draft permission, a matter on which we had a long discussion earlier. The amendments would delete the subsection (8) that provides for the community gain condition to be proportionate; the subsection states that the financial contribution required to comply with the community gain condition should not be so large as to essentially make it financially unviable for the developer to carry out the development.</P>
      <P>I know all Senators support this change to planning law which, while simple, is in some way quite radical. I can appreciate the sentiment which would seek to ensure the absolute maximum for local communities is forthcoming after a planning case has been through the process. However, this clause was inserted on foot of discussions with the Parliamentary Counsel to ensure that the provision, or any condition imposed on it, could not be challenged as unfair. Furthermore, it is perfectly reasonable to ensure that the condition to provide for community gain is not used as a way of refusing permission by the back door, granting permission but making the community gain condition so burdensome as to essentially dissuade the applicant from carrying out the development.</P>
      <P>There is another point. While reading through the papers earlier, it struck me that removing the word &ldquo;conditional&rdquo; could have two outcomes, namely, that a condition could be disproportionately large or disproportionately small. That would not be the intention of anybody in this House. The idea of having a proportionate community gain condition is wise and prudent in the circumstances. Unfortunately, I am not in a position to accept the amendments. If the Senator thinks through what I have said, particularly my last point, he would realise that all sorts of perverse and completely unforeseeable and undesirable changes could flow if we were to remove the word &ldquo;conditional&rdquo;.</P>

      <P FLI="0" Just="Left">This recommendation is to reduce the time for a decision from 18 to 12 weeks. A 12-week period is sufficient. We discussed this in great detail on Committee Stage and the Minister appeared to be undecided. Finally, while not conceding the issue, he more or less reverted to the 18 weeks. However, during his contribution I felt that he would allow the three-month period. A 12-week period is a long time but an 18-week interval puts considerable pressure on much of the development that is to take place. The Minister referred to my earlier amendment and said it would be contradictory to this. However, I do not believe so. The Minister could reduce the time-lag for a decision. One would complement the other and greater clarity would be brought to the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CyprianBrady"><NameTxt>Mr. Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>Some of the projects to be dealt with under this legislation will be among the largest in the history of the State. They will be even bigger into the future. I suggest that the 18-week interval could be found at some stage in the future to be too short and extensions may be sought. It does, at least, leave it open for decisions to be made quicker, if it says &ldquo;within a period of 18 weeks&rdquo;. In the future, when some of the major projects come on stream, it could be that the time interval will need to be extended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I said earlier, on Committee Stage, that I very much shared Senator Bannon&rsquo;s ambition that decisions should be made as quickly as possible. The Senator is quite right. We are talking about strategic infrastructure, which is an enormous gain for the community as a whole. It is therefore important we make decisions quickly, certainly more speedily than at present. In my constituency there is a piece of strategic infrastructure that has been tied up in the planning process for 12 and a half years. If I could get it down to 12 and a half months, I would be lucky. However, there are cogent arguments against bringing it right down to 12 weeks. A decision has to be made within 18 weeks, so the board is required to take the full period in which to reach it. The amendment is somewhat unrealistic, however, given the size of the projects we are talking about. Some of them will be of massive scale requiring a high level of quality in terms of the process and decision making involved. In practice, therefore, 18 weeks is the shortest feasible time within which the board can give thorough scrutiny to projects, especially in cases where oral hearings are required. In comparable cases in terms of size currently before the board, <Col N="1233"/>namely, local authority cases, the board made decisions in three quarters of them within the 18-week period. I therefore regard 18 weeks as quite ambitious.</P>
      <P Just="Left">As the Senator mentioned the last day, I have agreed to increase the board&rsquo;s staffing by an additional 24 people. That should ensure that the board can deal with ordinary appeals and absorb the new work. However, I think that to reduce the time interval from 18 to 12 weeks would be unwise because it would be overly ambitious. I share the Senator&rsquo;s ambition, nonetheless, that we should make these decisions as quickly as possible &mdash; and 18 weeks is probably getting it right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I tabled this amendment out of frustration. The Minister is probably aware that I come from the BMW region where there is a major underspend of approved funding. A programme of funding was to be spent by 2007 and we are less than half way into the drawdown of these moneys. There are major problems with many of the large infrastructural projects. There are problems with the southern bypass for Longford and tourism development projects in Roscommon. Decisions have not been taken on those despite the public outcry for quick solutions. I have put down the amendment out of frustration because there are unnecessary delays in a great many areas, particularly in the drawdown in BMW areas, which stands at around 46% of the entire budget, and this is ridiculous. Those moneys were to be spent on the poorest areas of the country and the drawdown is very poor; I want that on the record of the House yet again. There is frustration among the general public as regards the lack of infrastructural development in the region. We are told the moneys were provided, but there are problems with planning and with getting projects off the ground.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>I fully appreciate the points the Senator is making. I have voiced my feelings at the inappropriate use of the planning process simply to delay projects. He mentioned the southern bypass at Longford. As the Senator knows, I visited the town recently, and the frustration there is very real. One can discern there is a major impact on the quality of life on coming though the town, where one has to make a right and a left turn. The heavy traffic going through Longford town makes life impossible. Sadly, the Senator is quite right in his assertion that there are cases up and down the country where people are using the planning process &mdash; which is very open and democratic &mdash; as a means of simply delaying, very unreasonably, infrastructure that delivers benefits. In the BMW region, in particular, such infrastructure is necessary. The whole ethos of the Bill is about getting rid of such obstacles and achieving a better balance.</P><Col N="1234"/>
      <P Just="Left">Notwithstanding that, I do not believe a 12-week period gives sufficient time. I realise the Senator has tactically tabled the amendment as a marker and I compliment him on that. If planning decisions could be taken within the 18-week period, we should all be very happy. It does not happen at the moment, but hopefully when the Bill goes through, it will. If we can get something through in a stipulated period, it will make life easier for those of us who wish to see this country with the type of infrastructure it needs in all areas, particularly in the BMW region. While I sympathise with the Senator&rsquo;s cause, I do not believe it is practical to try to tie matters down to 12 weeks. The 18-week interval is ambitious and we should keep it at that. I cannot accept the amendment, so I hope the Senator is not pressing it.</P>

	<P Just="Left">We discussed this matter at some length on Committee Stage and it is a very interesting proposition. However, it is not one I have sympathy with for the simple reason that it would leave the particular Minister of the day open to all types of challenges as regards abuse of power etc. The amendment proposes to empower the Minister to give direction to the board to prioritise a particular application. As I explained on Committee Stage, the text as it stands allows the Minister to give directions to the board to prioritise a class or certain classes of infrastructure that may be of particular importance at a given time. However, I thought I was clear in asserting that I could not accept this amendment as it would be inappropriate for a Minister of the day to have the specific power to fast-track a particular application, which is what is being proposed. As Minister, I do not wish to have this additional power. </P>
	<P Just="Left">The existing powers to direct the board to expedite certain broad types of case are sufficient. If Ministers were to intervene in the manner the Senator is proposing, in individual planning applications, this would raise the possibility of charges of political interference. It might well be political interference for a positive reason, but it is far better that we avoid giving the Minister of the <Col N="1235"/>day power to make a direction in the form suggested in the amendment as regards individual cases. It is preferable that the Bill should give the Minister power to prioritise a certain class or classes and leave it at that. I ask Senator Bannon to withdraw the amendment.

      <P>The key issues are as follows. First, ensuring that the interconnector, which may not be owned by the ESB, can still come within the terms of the Bill, although in general the electricity transmission system is by definition owned by the ESB, there is an exception in the case of an electricity interconnector. Under new provisions to be enacted in the Energy (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2006, an interconnector may be constructed, operated or owned by a person other than the ESB.

      <P FLI="0">This amendment relates to the size of windfarms. When I discussed this matter in detail on Committee Stage last week the Minister indicated he would give some consideration to a reduction in <Col N="1238"/>the size of the windfarm. Perhaps he will give an update on his position.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Amendment No. 48 relates to harbour areas. I propose to delete 20 hectares and substitute this with ten hectares. As I pointed out on Committee Stage, the need arises on the River Shannon &mdash; one of our finest waterways &mdash; to have small harbours for berthing purposes. The same is true of other areas and this should be accommodated in order to improve the tourism industry. An area of 20 hectares is large and this should be reduced to ten hectares. The Minister previously indicated he would consider a reduction in the size.</P>
      <P>I also seek a reduction in the number of wind turbines from 50 to ten because many small windfarm enterprises are being developed, especially in the Cavan and midlands area. We should not put obstacles in place for these people but try to improve the planning system where possible to accommodate a clean energy supply.</P>

	<P>I appreciate the Senator&rsquo;s arguments on the issue of thresholds but I think it is unwise at the outset of a new consent process to lower the thresholds down to the extent he proposed. For example, to take the thresholds for windfarms down from 50 to ten would cause difficulties.</P>
      <P>I have given consideration to these amendments but on reflection I must conclude that the proposed thresholds are wise and prudent. We do not wish the new consent process to be overwhelmed with relatively small-scale projects, even though, as the Senator has indicated, they may be of importance locally. They should still be dealt with through the planning process.</P>
      <P>The ElA thresholds used in the text as the general threshold appear to be the most appropriate to ensure the process is used exclusively for large-scale strategic infrastructure development. If we go below that level we will leave ourselves open to all sorts of ambiguity. However, once the system has been in operation for some time, we could well reflect on the experience and see if it is necessary to review the thresholds.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I regret I cannot accept the amendments, although I did give them a great deal of consideration because the arguments put forward by Senator Bannon were cogent. I hope he will agree, notwithstanding the good intentions of his amendments, that accepting them could result in overloading the system at an early stage, in addition to causing a great deal of unnecessary controversy around what is intended to deal with bottlenecks in strategic infrastructure.</P>

	<P>The amendments propose that the eight-week period for making an application for leave to apply for a judicial review should begin on the date of the making of the railway order or the date on which a copy of the relevant extracts from the railway order and the plan referred to therein are served on every, if any, occupier and every, if any, owner of the land. I do not propose to accept the amendments. The board must publicise the making of a railway order as early as possible following the decision and that will facilitate extensive notification of the making of the order. As a consequence, I consider it inappropriate that the eight-week period should begin on the date of the making of the order. It is also critical that any challenges should be taken as quickly as possible. I cannot extend the time limit potentially indefinitely and that would be an unforeseen consequence of the Senator&rsquo;s proposals. His amendments could also introduce a degree of confusion into the timeframe for the start of a legal challenge. We do not want to create another opportunity for legal challenges. For those reasons, I cannot accept these amendments, but I did consider the points made by the Senator.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill do now pass.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche"><TitleTxt>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
	<P>We all agree that Ireland needs a new and improved infrastructure across a number of areas, for reasons we have all outlined in this House. We need to tackle bottlenecks in our economy, to enhance our effectiveness and to create infrastructure where it is needed.</P>
      <P>I thank Senator Bannon in particular for his contributions, but I thank all Members who have contributed throughout this lengthy debate. We have taken very important steps in this Bill. The Government is committed to the continued existence and extension of an efficient and fully democratic participative planning process. The Bill, as it now stands, reflects that commitment. It is a crucial development in our delivery of modern, quality infrastructure, but it does so in a way that is balanced as it will involve the local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister and other Members who contributed to the process. I also thank the departmental staff for enduring this long and often tedious debate.</P>
      <P>There is much to be welcomed in the Bill. It will fast-track much development which is needed for the improvement of the country&rsquo;s infrastructure. The crucial projects are those related to transport, the development of our harbours, of the electricity network and the extension of the <Col N="1244"/>gas pipeline, including the development of spurs to the towns and villages that have not been connected. Natural gas is a clean form of energy and is important to the development of our towns and villages, especially in the midlands. We are starved of different types of energy and we must rely on electricity. Other forms of energy will make us more competitive. Wind energy is provided for in the Bill. I had a number of amendments to that particular section, but unfortunately they were not accepted. However, we will revisit this Bill in three years. The Government is encouraging people to develop off-farm enterprises and many farmers will chose to provide other forms of energy.</P>
      <P>We support this Bill and we wish it a speedy passage through the Oireachtas. I thank the Minister for taking on board many amendments from this side of the House. This will improve the Act when it becomes law. However, much needs to be done outside the Houses. There also needs to be judicial reforms and we will need greater resources. The Government must also change its attitude in trying to bring about balanced regional development. I highlighted the shortfall in spending in the BMW region and this needs to be examined quickly. There are several major tourist developments in the midlands and in the west of Ireland, but they have been held up for quite a while by planning problems. This Bill will allow these projects to be fast-tracked and that is very welcome. We all want to see Ireland develop and become a proud part of Europe from a tourism, agricultural and industrial perspective.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>Garda&iacute; and local authorities are aware of a number of accident blackspots, the elimination of which should be of paramount importance. We are making some progress in this area but more needs to be done. How often do we learn from news bulletins that people have been killed on roads on which fatal accidents previously occurred? Regardless of whether the blackspots are the responsibility of the National <Col N="1245"/>Roads Authority or local authorities, money should not be a factor in their elimination.</P>
      <P>It is appalling that the Rules of the Road booklet has not been updated in the past ten years. The failure to update it reflects the complacent attitude taken on this issue.</P>
      <P>With regard to Northern Ireland vehicles driving at speed in this jurisdiction, it is time that discussions are held with Northern Ireland officials to introduce an all-Ireland policy on road safety and ensure that penalty points apply in both jurisdictions. This common sense approach should be progressed at every possible level.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Drink driving is a major cause of road accidents. Last year, Garda figures revealed a 30% increase in the number of people convicted of drink driving. The culture of drink driving must change. We have heard a lot about random breath testing, which I believe is favoured by the vast majority of people in this country. However, Fine Gael obtained information from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform which reveals that only 64 Garda stations have intoxilisers, one-fifth of garda&iacute; are trained to use roadside breathalysers and even fewer can use the evidential breathalyser equipment based in Garda stations. Under these circumstances, can the Government really claim to be serious about road safety?</P>
      <P Just="Left">These issues are indicative of what the former chairman of the National Safety Council claimed for years, namely that there is no joined-up thinking among Departments. I hope that will change because we will go nowhere otherwise. The Garda claims that since the introduction of the new penalty points scheme, 350 people per day have received penalty points. Enforcement is the key to any successful strategy and we must learn from best practice in places such as Victoria and other Australian states, otherwise we will continue to see carnage on our roads until we have proper enforcement.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Deputy Gallagher, back to the House. I am delighted to have an opportunity to speak on the Road Safety Authority Bill 2004, formerly the Driver Testing and Standards Authority Bill. Recently, there has been a lot of discussion in the media about the numbers of fatalities on our roads, particularly those involving young people. The issue has also been debated on a number of occasions in this House, yet fatalities continue to occur.</P>
      <P>I welcome the appointment of Mr. Gay Byrne as chairman of the road safety authority because, if anybody can do anything, it is Uncle Gaybo. Set a busy man or woman a task and it will be done. Not a man to hang around, he intends to quit his position if he does not see results. He set out his stall and I wish him well. I commend his <Col N="1246"/>predecessors on their efforts, which, for whatever reason, did not work.</P>
      <P>The issues of what to do with young people and waiting lists for driving tests have been the subject of extensive debate. There is a year-long waiting list for driving tests. People must pass a theory test before they can apply for a provisional licence. With that provisional licence they can drive for two years with an &ldquo;L&rdquo; plate and then sit their driving tests. Like everybody else here I have been told stories about people who are involved in car accidents on the morning of their driving tests, fail their tests and drive home, still on their provisional licences. That is no longer acceptable. We must do something that will impact on those people. If they do not pass their driving tests a restriction must be put on their driving. Those who pass their tests should be subject to restrictions for the first year. Some young drivers have monitors on the speedometers of their cars and agree with insurance companies to drive below a certain speed in exchange for a special insurance rate. Such speed monitors should be used. An RTE Radio 1 programme referred to a device fitted to cars in Sweden which reduces one&rsquo;s speed depending on weather conditions. It reminded me of Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s comment last week that in France the speed signs carry two different limits, one for fine weather and a lower speed for wet weather.</P>
      <P>Travelling between Sligo and Dublin, as I do two or three times a week, I am always astonished by the number of young drivers who pass me in clapped-out, souped-up cars, generally with registrations from the 1980s. While I am driving at 60 mph they overtake me doing 70 or 80 mph. I immediately slow down because if they have a blow-out I will be involved in the accident. They overtake on continuous white lines on the brow of a hill. I often yearn to be a garda with a blue light in order to be able to chase some of those youngsters. I hate to think where they might end up. On my stretch of road I meet them all the time. The presence of a Garda car, even if the garda&iacute; are only sitting in it, can be a deterrent and slow people down. It slows me down. I was interested to note last week an increase of 32% in general accidents, 350 people per day getting penalty points and an increase in drink driving offences and in the offence of driving without tax or insurance.</P>
      <P>I want to talk about a recent inquest into a fatal accident in which the jury recommended a rider to existing legislation. I raise it here because there have been two fatalities in my constituency over the last few months. I know at first hand how distraught were the families of those two young men in their prime who were killed one night in a motor accident. The rider proposed mandatory testing for all drugs, including alcohol, for anybody involved in a road traffic accident, irrespective of whether they are in possession of alcohol <Col N="1247"/>or drugs. That would be a wonderful idea and, if implemented, would result in fewer people getting into their car with one or two drinks or after smoking a joint or two. Although they might not feel it impairs their judgment, it does. It would make younger people in particular more responsible. In rural Ireland, for example in west and south County Sligo and north County Leitrim, away from the bigger towns, youngsters drive after taking a few drinks. This cannot be allowed to continue. Too many families wake on a Saturday or Sunday morning to the horrific news that one of their children has been involved in a fatality.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I will briefly refer to section 22, which restricts Members of both Houses and local authorities from membership of the board. While I can understand why Members of the Oireachtas are restricted, the presence of a Member from either House would make a difference. Members of local authorities should not be restricted. Our local councillors come to me and tell me the concerns of the people. That is where I heard about the rider to the legislation that is in place. We should look to the National Youth Council of Ireland or organisations such as Youthreach and have young people on that authority because they are the people who will bring the message home to their peers. There is no point in packing the authority with people who are not out there on the ground. If local councillors and young people are eliminated, 50% of people are immediately cut off. When we come to Committee Stage I would like to see an amendment to address that.</P>
      <P>Having spoken to driving school instructors, I know they want legislation. It is time for regulation. All professions are regulated and this profession sets up young people to get behind the wheel of a car. There should be tests for driving instructors and for the testers. Both trainees and trainers should be tested at the same level and time.</P>

    </Speaker>

	  <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister of State. Although I missed the debate last week I want to make some points. I welcome the Bill with some reservations. It is a great idea to make one authority responsible for driving tests, schools and instructors but the responsibility rests with the Government. However, the prime responsibility for good driving lies with drivers. We have learned that this cannot be achieved without enforcement and that is the responsibility of Government. It is good value for money to invest in enforcement. Some time ago I produced figures from the US and elsewhere showing that <Col N="1248"/>every dollar invested in enforcing safe driving saves the government large sums of money. I will speak about one potential target for investment, namely, licence plate identification equipment. It costs money but I have seen it work. There are only two cameras in Dublin. If we invested in this equipment, we would not need garda&iacute; to look at the cameras because they identify speeding drivers automatically and immediately. If there were ten or 20 of these cameras on the road from Galway to Dublin, they would identify, without anyone having to look at them, whether one was driving too quickly between one camera and the next. It is almost magical what we can do with technology.</P>
      <P Just="Left">We do not have to invent new ways of doing things &mdash; we can look at what other countries have done. I was in Finland last week and learned about technology that must be installed in the cars of those found guilty of a drink driving offence. Senator Feeney touched upon this in respect of Sweden. One must blow into a unit before one starts one&rsquo;s car. It represents further investment in technology. If one is fined for accumulating penalty points in Finland, one is fined a percentage of one&rsquo;s income. The week before I visited, a very wealthy and successful businessman had been caught speeding on his motorbike and was fined &euro;200,000. Somebody else might only be fined &euro;200. This would straighten out one&rsquo;s mind. In Dubai I noted sirens on taxis &mdash; maybe they were on other vehicles also &mdash; that automatically sounded if one exceeded the speed limit. Senator Cummins mentioned the enforcement of penalty points north and south of the Border. They should be enforced throughout Europe and not just on this island. This matter is typical of one regarding which all-island co-operation could succeed.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Senators who stated Gay Byrne was an inspired choice. He is great and has threatened to resign if he does not get his way. He will not have the patience of Eddie Shaw. Eddie Shaw was marvellous at what he did &mdash; he hammered and shouted but eventually had to give up when it did not work. Gay Byrne will succeed and will step down, as he has threatened, if the Government does not solve the problems associated with road safety. It is in its power to do so and the citizens know it is its responsibility. With sufficient investment in technology, it can enforce the law as it stands. All the other proposals mentioned, including random breath testing, must also be implemented. Investment in technology is necessary so the law can be enforced to the point where we, the citizens, will obey it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Quinn for sharing his time with me.</P>
      <P Just="Left">It is somewhat dangerous for us all to stand around and preach about bad driving because I <Col N="1249"/>do not believe there is anyone in this Chamber who is not a sinner in one way or another. I have accumulated penalty points myself as a result of some minor speeding offences. While I believe it is essential that restrictive measures be introduced and that penalty points are a necessary and sensible way of doing so, we must be wary of sitting in judgment over those we say are bad drivers. Many of us are probably pretty bad drivers ourselves and I certainly confess to being one. One of the reasons for bad driving is that once one has passed the driving test at 17, there is absolutely no compulsion on one to keep up to date with any of the rules of the road. I and others, if we are honest, will confess that we sometimes see signs at the side of the road and do not know what they mean because we have not read the up-to-date rules of the road. Apart from fulfilling certain moral and legal obligations, we have no obligation to read the rules of the road.</P>
      <P>There is a case for testing people regularly as the time of their driving tests becomes more distant. It is a bit absurd to say people are competent to drive in modern conditions when they passed a test 60 years ago. This is not ageism but a matter of experience in that one may have passed one&rsquo;s test in road conditions that were completely and utterly different from those of today. Everybody knows people travel at a much faster speed, that traffic congestion is much worse and that the rules of the road are different. The Minister should consider some way of re-testing drivers who passed their tests a very long time ago. I do not believe I would pass one if I were asked to do so today. I do not believe many others would do so either, but that does not mean I will volunteer for a test &mdash; I am afraid I am not as noble as that. The NCTs would be more appropriate to people than cars and driving tests should be almost as frequent.</P>
      <P>Several Senators referred to board membership. I am disappointed in this Bill because it follows the normal pattern established by Governments in respect of board membership. The 11 members of the board of the authority are all political appointees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>If the Minister tells me not to worry and states the members will all be appointed because they know a lot about road safety and transport, I will just tell him I do not believe him &mdash; that is no reflection on him. The experience of those of us in politics and others is that politicians appoint their friends and relations to boards, even to the boards of the most vital, sensitive State agencies and semi-State bodies. That is unfortunately true and it is treating the boards with utter contempt. It is also treating the issues involved &mdash; in this case, road safety &mdash; with utter <Col N="1250"/>contempt. This would have been an appropriate time to establish a board that is not appointed exclusively by the Minister, and preferably not appointed by him all. The road safety authority, like so many others, is likely to become not just a creature of the Government but also a creature of a political party. The Bill represents an unfortunate blueprint in this regard. However, this may not be the case regarding Gay Byrne.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether it is a good idea to amalgamate these agencies or what is going on behind the scenes but it strikes me as particularly regrettable that no opportunity was taken to relieve the Minister of some of his extraordinary power of political interference in this issue. There is not a paragraph in the Bill that does not mention the Minister. Even the plans the authority makes must be subject to the consent of the Minister. Why the hell should they? Why can the board not comprise people of undoubted abilities and talents who would be given a budget and told to get on with it? In every paragraph, the Bill states that the appointees must seek political approval. Road safety should not be subject to day to day political approval. There is a Government policy on road safety but the Government should not be micro-managing road safety down to the last sign, budget and penny.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P Just="Left">My proposal regarding political interference should also extend to the appointment of<Insert> the</Insert> chief executive. Why the hell should the Minister, once he has appointed the board, also have to consent to the appointment of the chief executive, which amounts to the same thing? The chief executive is possibly being chosen for his ability regarding road safety but also because of his political acceptability. Road safety, an issue of such importance, is now right in the middle of the party political arena.</P>
      <?oasys _cl11.7- ?>
      <P>Let me refer to another extraordinary clause that is included in all Bills such as this. All board members must make declarations of interest, a pattern followed in most of these Bills. I hope the Minister does not reply by stating that this is standard. That would not be an acceptable reply. Declarations of interest are made only to the board and no member of the public can know what these are.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Ross stated that road safety is not a matter for political approval. The Minister will not be involved in approving road safety issues.</P>
      <P>Members of the Joint Committee on European Affairs visited Tallinn in Estonia recently. If one has an accident in Estonia and has alcohol in one&rsquo;s system, one is presumed to be culpable. That is the way it should be.</P>
      <P>The State can improve signs in Ireland. Directional signs have improved but, as representatives from Waterford will agree, one sees signs placed beyond the junction on the N7. How do engineers manage to do this? The driver is past the junction when he or she sees the sign. In that case, he or she stops and reverses on the motorway, which is a lethal manoeuvre. Members of local authorities frequently make the same point.</P>
      <P>Roadworks signs are erected but not removed after roadworks have been completed. As a result, drivers do not slow down when they see these signs because they are used to passing them when work is no longer taking place. Oil spillage signs are erected throughout the country yet I have only seen an oil spillage on one occasion. The people responsible for discredited signs should get their act together, a matter that is within the remit of the State.</P>
      <P>Differing speed limits are in effect in wet and dry conditions in France. Speed limits here are discredited. A dual carriageway leading to Newbridge was the national primary route but since the motorway was built it has become a national secondary route and a speed limit of 80 km/h applies. Roads where the speed limit should be no higher than 80 km/h have limits of 100 km/h. Although a national system is understandable, some flexibility must be allowed.</P>
      <P>We have discussed the contributory factors to accidents. We must be far more rigorous on the standard of driving required. Over the years we have been casual but there are now far more people driving powerful cars that can travel at high speed. Reference has been made to vehicle quality and we are not as rigorous as we should be with regard to the capacity of the vehicle to stop within a certain limit.</P>
      <P>I have noticed a proliferation of cars with &ldquo;for sale&rdquo; signs on the side of the road. It is no longer politically correct to use the term &ldquo;non-national&rdquo; but people coming into the country buy such cars and do not demand any documents. They are driving in uninsured and untaxed vehicles. This <Col N="1253"/>trend, which seems to be increasing, must be examined.</P>
      <P>People must take responsibility because the State cannot be a nanny state. If one is afraid of being caught, one will slow down. Over the past fortnight cars seem to have slowed down, particularly on the motorway at Portlaoise. Fewer cars overtake when one is travelling at 120 km/h. This is due to the increased visibility of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the fear of being caught.</P>
<?oasys _ic14- ?>
      <P>Traffic calming is a major deterrent and should be examined in urban areas. One will not travel over speed ramps because of the consequences for one&rsquo;s car. Much has been done, particularly in Dublin city, but more must be done in rural towns, particularly around schools. I understand why it cannot happen on national primary routes where heavy volumes of traffic use the road. I wish Mr. Byrne and the authority well. I hope it will have a positive effect. I know the authority will be vocal and will have no difficulty telling the Minister where to get off, if this proves necessary.</P>

    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State. As legislation passes through the House it is important that the Government receives co-operation across the political divide on an issue such as this. Mr. Gay Byrne was interviewed by his successor on the &ldquo;Late Late Show&rdquo; on Friday night and the show was repeated last night; perhaps the Minister of State watched it. I would strongly disagree that he was an inspired choice to lead this authority. It was a public relations stunt on the part of the Minister to appoint someone whose record of arrogance we well appreciate from his pronouncements on &ldquo;the box&rdquo; on numerous occasions and from his failure to accept criticism at any time of himself or his views. He made a statement the other night that a raft of legislation must be introduced before the summer recess, of which this Bill is part. I am not too sure if he has read all the promises made since 1998 on legislation which have all been broken. He said he would walk within one year so I ask him to look at the 15 promises made, almost all of which have been reneged on or which have not been followed through.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I would also like an apology from Mr. Byrne who said, in respect of legislation being brought before the Houses of the Oireachtas, that he hoped the other crowd would not make a political football out of it. That is a dismissive statement and is arrogance beyond belief. For the success of his chairmanship, he should withdraw that statement and apologise to Members of both Houses who may have an opinion to offer other than his own or who may wish to contribute in some way to the legislation before the Houses.</P>

	<P>I will move on but I ask the Minister of State to talk to the chairperson and request him to reconsider the statement he made because he branded Members of both Houses in such a way. That is not acceptable for a person who is looking for goodwill and co-operation from the Houses of the Oireachtas and other bodies which have an interest in this issue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask for Senator Burke&rsquo;s co-operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>There are known blackspots throughout the country. Anybody who ever drove from Dublin to Galway will remember the 25 crosses on the side of the road between Ballinasloe and Loughrea where 25 deaths occurred. Tragically, despite numerous deputations to the National Roads Authority, it failed to respond to the wishes of the people that something be done as a matter of urgency. Every excuse in the book was given. I drove that route twice a day for 25 years and on many occasions, I witnessed a number of horrific accidents. As a response to the request of the people, the NRA eventually acquired some land to realign part of the N6 route. As it was so slow in going ahead with the work, many deaths occurred in the interim. That land was supposed to have been used to bypass this particular treacherous blockspot but, thankfully, a new road has been proposed from Ballinasloe to Oranmore which will travel north of the N6. This is another example of the number of road deaths which must occur to get agencies to respond.</P>
      <P>Some 15 measures were promised by the Government but only three have been implemented, including the increase in the number of penalty point offences and the breath testing. The chairman of the new authority said he got a commitment from senior Garda authorities that 60 garda&iacute; out of every Garda class would be assigned to road safety. Can the Minister of State confirm that the Government has agreed to this or is it a case of the chairman going on a solo run on this issue? If it is, it is a bit early for him to be going on a solo run. The Minister <Col N="1255"/>of State should check the record with RTE but the chairman said he obtained a promise from the Garda Commissioner that 60 garda&iacute; out of every Garda class for the next number of years would be assigned to the traffic corps, which would be very welcome. However, when put in the context of the history of the assignment of Garda personnel to this division, it must be corrected or confirmed that this is Government policy.</P>
      <P>Many Senators said one cannot teach an old dog new tricks. It is of paramount importance that schools are used to change the mindset of potential drivers and to teach about road safety in general. Co-operation between the Departments of Transport and Education and Science is important so as to introduce a slot, whether weekly or otherwise, into the school timetable to educate young people about road safety. Hopefully, young people&rsquo;s understanding of road safety will be visible at a later stage.</P>
      <P>All this legislation will be judged on whether it is a response to the terrible carnage on the roads and it will mean nothing if it does not result in a reduction in the number of road deaths. Unfortunately for many families, it is a question of whether the deaths of so many will be seen as the catalyst for success in eliminating the carnage on our roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State and his officials to the House. The Road Safety Authority Bill is welcome and has the broad support of the House. The greatest problem on the roads is speed. While it would help for Government to reduce speed to a maximum of 50 km/h that is not possible because people must get from A to B, and go to work. We have improved the standard of the roads and our speed limits match the norm in Europe but unfortunately many people do not observe them.</P>
      <P>One sees people drive at alarming speeds on the road from the west or the midlands to Dublin but because there is a well-publicised speed camera at the end of the motorway in Lucan, these drivers slow to 80 km/h. It is not a problem to slow to that speed, even in heavy traffic. Maybe there should be more portable cameras. Placing camera bases, even without live cameras, at black spots would immediately improve road safety.</P>
      <P>People blame drivers with provisional licences but many provisional licence holders are careful and safe drivers. Blaming them is often an easy way out. People complain about the numbers holding provisional licences but this is a wealthy country. A few years ago no one needed a provisional licence, unless for a bicycle, because people could not afford to buy cars. Today, people have the money to buy cars and therefore need provisional licences. There may be a back<Col N="1256"/>log in the driver testing centres but provisional licence holders are not the real problem.</P>
      <P>The use of mobile telephones in cars is also raised as a road safety issue. While people have hands-free mobile telephones in their cars, many people drive cars and trucks with one hand on the steering wheel and a mobile telephone in the other. This continues, regardless of the advertising and warnings issued by the Department. That is not acceptable. People should act responsibly but unfortunately do not do so.</P>
      <P Just="Left">
        
        As a pioneer I should perhaps not comment on drink driving because people criticise me for knocking drink drivers but nobody should drive when under the influence of alcohol. Garda records show an increase in the numbers caught drink driving in recent months, due to good detective work and having more garda&iacute; on the beat. The Government and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform deserve credit for ensuring there are more garda&iacute; in the traffic corps.</P>
      <P>Drivers fear getting penalty points. Unfortunately, however, there are cases of people who come from outside the 26 counties who get away with dangerous driving. The story goes that Irish people who are caught give the names and addresses of friends from the North. That problem, however, is being tackled and hopefully people coming into this country will observe the speed limits here or, if not, receive penalty points on their licences.</P>
      <P>At weekends, when traffic is heavy with people driving to matches or whatever, it is unreasonable to have a full lane dedicated to buses as there are few buses on the road. That should change &mdash; some bus lanes are open at weekends but most are not.</P>
      <P>I notice many people driving left-hand drive cars. They come here to work and are welcome. When they earn some money it seems they can bring in old cars from their own countries, which are left-hand drive. Recently, I drove behind a person in one of these cars in a small town. The driver tried four or five times to pass the van in front of him. In order to see the oncoming traffic he had to put the front of his car out on the road but each time had to pull back because traffic was coming against him. The consequences of pulling out in that way can be serious as recent accidents, in which carloads of people have been killed, show.</P>
      <P>We welcome the increased number of garda&iacute; but it is wasteful for the garda who has caught someone breaking the law to have to attend in court because often the solicitor will seek and be granted an adjournment. A chief superintendent or sergeant should be able to go into court on behalf of that garda and look after the case. One sees many garda&iacute; in the courts. We must deal with that problem.</P><Col N="1257"/>
      <P>I wish Gay Byrne and the road safety authority well. They will do a good job. No matter who was appointed, people would shout that he or she was the wrong person. He and the authority need a chance to prove themselves, as does the Minister of State in his new role. There has been some improvement in road safety and we will soon see more.</P>

The Government has been confronted by the resignation of Eddie Shaw who addressed the Joint Committee on Transport of which I was a member. He was fairly trenchant in his criticism and he laid down a list of things he felt should be done. I hope the Government will make available to the incoming authority those recommendations of Mr. Eddie Shaw because they would be valuable. The Government should not discard the work already done by a very able and honourable man.</P>
      <P>Unlike some of my colleagues here, I heartily approve of the appointment of Gay Byrne. He is an ideal person because he is well known and well loved. He has a very keen and shrewd intelligence. I worked with him on a few occasions in broadcasting. He is one of the most efficient people I know and a great disciplinarian. If he is set a task he will make it his business to get it done.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>&ldquo;The Moving Finger writes; and, having writ, Moves on.&rdquo; I cannot recall the verse but I understand the Chair&rsquo;s admonishment and the reason for it.</P>
      <P>The road safety authority is to be welcomed. The primary aim must be to make Irish road users respect the law. In order for that to happen, we must give them laws they can respect because this is not the case at present. Many of the laws are a tissue of nonsense. Having centralised responsibility for road safety, the Government should go further and centralise control of road management as well. I am sure the Minister of State may find it in his heart to at least secretly agree with me that there is a huge amount of inconsistency regarding speed, for example. How can anyone respect the speed limits? They are inconsistent and capricious and are governed by local authorities. It is completely absurd that as a motorway passes through different jurisdictions <Col N="1258"/>the speed limits change. We all know of instances where the garda&iacute; literally lie in wait under a bridge in a place where the speed limit does not meet the circumstances of the roadway. This is like shooting fish in a barrel.</P>
      <P>By some miracle I have not yet acquired any penalty points although it may be tempting providence to admit it. The Government needs to have a coherent set of speed limits and this can only be achieved through a centralised body. It is not appropriate for every local authority in the country to make its own decisions about roads that are part of a national transport system. We are not dealing with boreens anymore but with major national highways which should be dealt with in a professional manner.</P>
      <P>Road humps are idiotic things which simply do not work. As was explained to me by a resident of an area where these things were put in, they are supposed to stop kids speeding in what are called joyriding cars but these kids get an even greater thrill by driving at these humps and watching the effect on somebody else&rsquo;s car. Some salubrious areas of Dublin have nice, mild little humps that one would hardly notice while in other areas, such as Londonbridge Road, they are cliffs of brick which even if one drives at 10 km/h will do some damage to a car. This type of flagrant ignoring of the welfare of motorists can only inculcate contempt. I ask for consistency and coherence in this matter.</P>
      <P>Even worse is the state of road surfaces. I have raised this matter in the House on a number of occasions. I refer to the inappropriate road surface materials used by some county councils. I have been asked not to name individuals and families in the House but the record will show that I raised this matter both in the House and as a matter on the Adjournment. I refer to the tragic case of a young girl who was driving carefully and with no drink taken. Her car suddenly hit a patch of road. She lost control of the car which went into a lorry coming in the opposite direction and she was killed.</P>
      <P>The tragic accident involving a school bus near Trim was exactly the same. The road surface treatment was inappropriate. How many more accidents of this kind will happen? Local authorities are once again letting down the general public. In some of these instances the local authorities were alerted but even after the accident did precious little.</P>
      <P>Appropriate speed limits should be put in place. It should be possible to drive in safety over those road humps at the maximum prescribed speed. A vehicle should be able to cross those humps in safety at the maximum permitted speed, otherwise the whole thing is a nonsense. These two terrible tragedies involved an individual driver and a party of schoolchildren. There should be some central authority to take <Col N="1259"/>responsibility for these matters as has been done with regard to certain but limited aspects of road safety in this Bill. We need to get road users to respect the rules of the road and the condition of the road. This can only be achieved by giving them something to respect.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I will unburden myself of another grouse with which the Minister of State, other Members and members of staff may be familiar. If one turns left having exited by the back gate of Leinster House, one rapidly hits the junction of Clare Street, Merrion Square and Merrion Street. This junction, like many all over the city, has a yellow box. It is a common occurrence for a double-decker bus to land in the middle of the box and stay there until the traffic light changes. Not one car can move as a result. I ask the Minister of State to ask the police to check this junction at rush hour over a period of one week to see if I am correct and to do something about the situation. Driving should be taught in schools, as is the case in Germany. It should perhaps be a compulsory extra subject in fifth or sixth year. They could be taught driving skills and respect for the road.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State is from County Donegal and he must feel keenly the carnage on the roads in that county. There seems to be a constellation of circumstances in these accidents. The victims are very often young people and it happens on a Friday night and Saturday morning or Saturday night and Sunday morning. There may be a few drinks on board, too many people in a powerful car and it is in the early hours of the morning. This scenario is so often repeated as reported on the radio and in the newspapers. We know what are the elements that contribute to major road accidents and we should do something about them.</P>
      <P>The proposal that members of the board should make a declaration to the board is very closet-like, in my view. Why are they not a bit more open about it? We as Members of the Oireachtas must make our declarations. I once made a declaration which included a portfolio of shares I had inherited from my aunt. The details appeared in the newspapers having been obtained under the Freedom of Information Act and while it was reported that I was a decent fellow and a good legislator, the reporter asked whether would one buy a share from me given all the crap I had in my portfolio. If I had to make a declaration, why can members of the board not be required to make a similar open and clear declaration?</P>
      <P>What is the logic in disbarring Members of the Oireachtas or members of county councils from membership of the authority? I am not the biggest fan of county councils, as Members will know, but if we are to continue to allow them to have responsibility for certain areas of manage<Col N="1260"/>ment in terms of roads and road safety, I do not see why by being elected, we sometimes must be penalised by being excluded from areas of service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House. I have spoken on various issues related to road safety many times on the Order of Business. There has been considerable lethargy in enforcing action to rectify the difficulties that exist. It was a shocking indictment of the Government when the previous chairman of the authority mentioned that he believed that more than 200 lives a year could have been saved if proper action has been taken. After nine years in process, this legislation is better late than never. However, it is only in the past year that I have noticed a sharper focus on road safety and a consciousness of our responsibility to ensure it. Many Members would make the point that road safety is the responsibility of the individual motorist but it is equally the responsibility of Government to provide the necessary framework to ensure people appreciate what is involved in road safety and that the necessary deterrents to penalise motorists driving at speed, etc. are in place.</P>
      <P>In every county, including my own, certain locations are noted as accident blackspots and there have been fatalities. The road from Newcastle West to Foynes is a classic example, on which there is a large volume of heavy trucks. I am sure the position is similar in other parts of the country. Following such road fatalities the council concerned tends to take remedial action by erecting red and white signs and making road markings. While all that is fine as a measure, I do not understand why the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government does not require local authorities to pinpoint the locations in a county, whether it is five, ten or 20, where serious road accidents have occurred and take proper remedial action to rectify the problems that exist at those locations. It does not take a genius to work out that if remedial action is taken to improve these locations, at least something may be done to reduce the number of accidents that occur.</P>
      <P>It is remarkable that the Minister, Deputy Cullen, said in May last year that the direction of his policy in this area would be to reduce the number of people waiting to do the driving test. It is a sad commentary to think that in May of this year 10,000 more people were waiting to do the driving test than in May last year. A total of 135,000 people are waiting to do the driving test compared to 125,000 in May last year. The filling of nine driver testing positions was help up for many years because sanction was not approved for the posts. It is a shocking indictment of the Government that this number of people are waiting to do their driving test throughout the coun<Col N="1261"/>try. The latest statistics show that in driving test centres the waiting time for a driving test has extended rather than reduced.</P>
      <P>It was regrettable that IMPACT, representing driving test instructors, recently pursued a mechanism to evade a position whereby the Minister sought to privatise the testing of 40,000 people waiting to do their driving test in order to reduce the number on the waiting lists. I do not understand the fears of driving test instructors because their jobs are guaranteed. There is no threat to the jobs in the long term given the volume of road transport and the number of people on the waiting lists. They were rewarded with extra overtime to carry out additional driving tests. The action taken by the union in using the mechanism of the partnership talks was wrong. It was able to refer to a relevant section used in the past to ensure its representatives could not be compelled to accept the private contracting of driver testing. I said recently that I hope the latest partnership talks, which regrettably have taken political representatives who have a great understanding of the whole process out of the equation, do not a allow a similar situation to emerge. I read a recent newspaper article which implied that the representatives had changed their attitude and that there may be some movement. I hope there will be positive movement, as it is important that we reduce the number of people on the waiting lists for driving tests and in that way reduce the number of motorists with a provisional driving licence.</P>
      <P>The driving test was introduced in the early 1960s. We cannot compare the number of cars on our roads then with the number on them today. There is a driving test centre in my town of Newcastle West and instructors in the driving test schools bring provisional licence holders on the routes taken by driving testers. In my estate many learner drivers practise driving around a corner, which poses a hazard for the people living in the estate. The current driving test does not take account of the situation that exists in terms of number of cars on our roads, driving on motorways, driving at night and so on. We need to examine the format of the driving test, make it a little stiffer and ensure it conforms with the situation that pertains.</P>
      <P>The position in regard to speed cameras is an indictment of the Government. The small number of speed cameras in Dublin has been well publicised. There is a promise to address that situation but we have to wait and see what will be done.</P>
      <P Just="Left">One feature of the penalty point system annoys and galls me and many others who often seem to be given penalty points for rather trivial offences. When I drive to Dublin from Limerick I, like many, have to grin and bear it when I see motorists particularly with Northern or foreign registrations show me the two fingers when they zoom <Col N="1262"/>past while I am driving at the 120 km/h limit. They know that the penalty points system that operates in the Twenty-six Counties does not apply to the motorists from Northern Ireland, the UK or eastern European countries. I have raised issues such as this, which are pertinent to North and South, at meetings of the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body. Motorists from the North who travel South should be subject to the penalty points system. That they are not must be galling for motorists in Border counties, such as the Minister of State who lives in Donegal, and motorists in Sligo, Monaghan and other counties where there is a large volume of traffic to and from the North. It must be upsetting for such motorists that they are obliged to be law abiding citizens and comply with the penalty points system operating here, while motorists in the North can get away with not complying with it. That position must be addressed and changed. Statistics on penalty point offences last year show that 20% of them could not be proceeded with on the basis that the offenders were from outside the Twenty-six counties and for other minor reasons.</P>
      <P>Mr. Gay Byrne has been appointed to his new position and I will mention him only once. He is a national figure. I saw him on a television programme last week and did not like his attitude. He almost appeared to say that legislation will go through these Houses and everybody should subscribe to it immediately, accept it lock, stock and barrel and not question or probe it. He said that he hoped the other side would not object to it. The other side does not object; it embraces anything that happens in a positive fashion to improve road safety. It is up to Members in this and the other House to seriously examine legislation when introduced and to ensure that what is embodied therein is compatible with what is required outside these Houses. I wish Mr. Byrne well in his position as a supremo. He said that if he does not get satisfaction he will walk away from the job.</P>
      <P>Perhaps many positive strands are beginning to come together in terms of road safety, especially if there is a degree of privatisation of driver testing, if more speed cameras are erected and more garda&iacute; become involved in traffic corps activities. If we can put all the pieces of the jigsaw in terms of road safety together, of which there are many components, we could succeed.</P>
      <P>We have to cope with the new situation as regards the rapidly expanding east European population coming into the country. Is it right that a person with a car only a few years old is subject to NCT testing? Is it right that a person from an eastern European country can come in with a very old car and not be subject to the same testing? It is obviously wrong. We are accustomed to driving on one side of the road while they are <Col N="1263"/>used to driving on the opposite side. We all know the difficulties involved in trying to pull out from behind a truck and get sight of the correct distance in front of us. A new potential hazard to emerge for many of these left-hand drive cars relates to the increased dangers in trying to overtake trucks. Regrettably, the fatality figures in this regard demonstrate the hazards involved.</P>
      <P Just="Left">As regards road safety policy, the changed situation and environment, the eastern European dimension etc. must be factored in so that we can see how we cope. There are even basic considerations to be dealt with, for example, the road safety book, in which miles rather than kilometres are denominated, with the then Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Howlin, still being depicted ten years later. It does not take rocket science to appreciate that this book must be brought up to date rapidly. If a person goes into a shop in Limerick and is Polish, Lithuanian, Latvian or whatever and wants to seriously learn about the rules of the road, translations should be available in the appropriate language. Let us get on with it and put all the pieces of the jigsaw together. Ultimately, the objective is to stop all the casualties on Irish roads. We are moving in the right direction but there is a good deal more to be done before we get matters right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senators for their contributions to the debate on the Bill and acknowledge the general welcome given to the Bill&rsquo;s provisions. In the course of the debate last week and again, this evening, Senators raised issues which were pertinent and directly related to the Bill and other issues as regards road safety in general. I fully understand that it is very difficult to differentiate between these elements.</P>
      <P>The road safety authority will have primary responsibility for taking the lead in the whole area of road safety. I am confident it will open up a new era in the promotion of road safety and I am sure the authority will note the views expressed by Members of the House, on all sides., when considering how best to promote better driver behaviour, which is of paramount importance. If drivers could improve their behaviour, then without any legislation I am quite sure the number of fatalities could be dramatically reduced. We can introduce regulations and legislation. Ultimately, however, safety is the responsibility of road users, largely drivers. Others using the roads must also take responsibility for their own safety.</P>
      <P>Although I should not perhaps make a specific reference to him, I want to refer to the chairman of the board and the criticism of him by some Members. We are very fortunate that somebody of the calibre of the chairman agreed to take up <Col N="1264"/>this position. If he was not working long hours as chairman of the board, he could be spending his time in a leisurely fashion in his adopted home town of Dungloe in County Donegal. I want to express the thanks of the Minister and the Government to the chairman for accepting this post. There was criticism of both him and members of the board, as political appointees. Of course they were all appointed by the Minister. When one looks at the membership of the board, however, one can see they are not political appointees. The chairman and the members are appointed by the Minister, but not on the basis of politics.</P>
      <P>I do not have much time, but I want to refer to a few important points as regards the regulation of driver instruction. The Bill tasks the authority with the regulation of driver instruction. This will require those in the industry to meet predetermined standards which will not only cover their ability to drive but ensure that those meeting the standards will have the necessary instructional skills to deliver the message to novice drivers. The registration process will benefit driving instructors and people taking lessons will have greater confidence in the quality of the instruction being given, which will eventually lead to better and safer drivers on our roads.</P>
      <P>The Government decided on 12 April 2006 to give priority to a new road safety Bill. I refer to this in the context of this debate because many Members have referred to random alcohol testing or random breath testing as it is known. The road traffic Bill to be introduced and hopefully enacted by the summer will deal with that. It will support the operation of privately operated speed cameras, which have been referred to throughout the debate. There will be 11.1 million speed checks per annum. It will give increased powers to the Garda to impound unlicensed, untaxed and uninsured vehicles including foreign registered cars. It will ban driving when using a hand-held mobile phone. It will increase financial penalties and introduce a system of administrative disqualifications. I am sure we will get the co-operation of both Houses in introducing this Bill by the summer.</P>
      <P>I am a member of a road safety committee established by the Taoiseach. It is chaired by Deputy Cullen, as the Minister for Transport and the Ministers for Finance, Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Health and Children, Education and Science and Environment, Heritage and Local Government are also members of the committee. The Taoiseach, who has made road safety a Government priority, attends the meetings and is fully briefed at all times. I understand speed cameras, some stationary, some moveable, will play a major role in slowing down drivers.</P>
      <P>On the declaration of interests by members of the board, I cannot say what real difference this <Col N="1265"/>will make. The fact is that they will declare their interests to the board. Members of this and the other House will know that under the freedom of information legislation it is possible to establish what those interests are. I do not believe it is necessary for individual members of the board to have to make this information available to the Houses of the Oireachtas. They will make it available to the board. Anyone who knows them will realise that they are people of the highest integrity.</P>
      <P>As regards the traffic corps, I am familiar with the temporary corps set up in Inishowen, where last year we had 31 road fatalities, half the figure for the entire county. The Garda Commissioner, together with the chief superintendent decided on a temporary basis to establish a traffic corps there. I am convinced that this has made an important input into road safety, notwithstanding the tragic multiple fatalities of the five Latvians and Lithuanians at that time. Nationally, however, we have a full traffic corps.</P>
      <P>The chairman of the board is right, an assurance has been given, not just to the board, but generally, that the membership of the traffic corps will increase progressively by 60 members every quarter to bring the membership of the national traffic corps up to 1,200. That increase will play a major role in reducing fatalities.</P>
      <P>This is not a debate in which to be political but I must put on record the fact that the expenditure on national roads is &euro;1.5 billion, an increase of 500% since 1997. The National Roads Authority should get the recognition it deserves for that major increase. Investment in our non-national roads has doubled since that period. I accept there is a long way to go and we will continue that unprecedented level of investment.</P>
      <P>I again take the opportunity to call on all drivers to observe a few simple rules; to drive within the prescribed speed limits and to ensure that all passengers are wearing seat belts. I also call on all drivers who even contemplate having a drink and driving to desist from that because their fate, or the fate of someone with whom they may come into contact, may lie just around the next corner. I look forward to debating the specific issues in the Bill on Committee Stage.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SiledeValera"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Tuffy for raising this matter on the Adjournment. I should point out that universities and institutes of technology are autonomous institutions and, as such, are free to reduce or increase places available in particular disciplines in accordance with student demand and industry requirements.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>The Department of Education and Science does not have specific statistics on places left unfilled, as requested by the Senator. However, in general, enrolments in science have remained quite constant over the period to which the Senator referred. For example, in the 2000-01 academic year, 13% of total enrolment in both the university and the institute of technology sectors was in the science disciplines. In the 2004-05 academic year, this was again 13% in the university sector and had risen to 14% in the institute of technology sector.</P>
        <?oasys _cl11.7- ?>
        <P Just="Left">Engineering enrolment has also been quite constant, with 8% of overall enrolment in the university sector being in this discipline in 2000-01 and 25% in the institute of technology sector. These figures were down slightly, to 6% and<?oasys _jy ?>22%, respectively, in the 2004-05 year. Within engineering, while civil engineering enrolment remains strong, enrolment in electronic engineering has weakened, which has an impact on the ICT sector.</P>
        <P>There has also been a wider fall off in enrolments in the computing area which has been reflected in experience worldwide. In 2000-01, computing accounted for 8% of total enrolment <Col N="1267"/>in the university sector and 15% in the institute of technology sector but this dropped to 3% and 8%, respectively, in the 2004-05 academic year.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s strategic ambition for Ireland is to continue to develop as a world-leading knowledge economy. The availability of an adequate number of graduates skilled in the fields of mathematics, physical sciences, biological sciences, computing, technology and engineering will be a critical factor in supporting this aim.</P>
        <P>A number of initiatives are under way aimed at increasing participation in science at third level. Discover Science and Engineering is a national marketing and awareness campaign that aims to increase interest in science, technology, innovation and engineering among students, teachers and members of the public. Women in Technology and Science, WITS, works to actively promote women in science in Ireland. It has produced material, including a role model booklet, and a pack prepared by third level institutions, introducing secondary school girls to careers in technology and science.</P>
        <P>It is worth noting that Ireland is performing reasonably well in the OECD in terms of our science graduation levels. With respect to our degree and advanced degree science graduation levels, we are ranked sixth out of 27 countries. As a response to recommendations of the expert group on future skills needs, the Department of Education and Science established an ICT undergraduate skills programme and an information technology investment fund for higher education. The Department has allocated &euro;2.5 million to this fund, which is administered by the HEA, for the current year.</P>
        <P>The fund aims to expand participation in IT education, particularly through the use of part-time education and in-company training. It supports IT education and training through postgraduate conversion courses, targeting improved completion rates in IT courses and equipment renewal. In conjunction with the ICT sector, the HEA has also launched an active publicity campaign to support students in considering the value of ICT when making their higher education choices through the CAO.</P>
        <P>It is hoped that measures such as these will help to bridge any developing enrolment gaps in areas which are of vital importance to our future economic development, and where the job prospects are now looking increasingly good. I thank Senator Tuffy for raising this matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Tim O&rsquo;Malley, to the House. I tabled a similar motion on cystic fibrosis a few months ago and I expect I will table another one in a few months time because one of the weaknesses in <Col N="1268"/>politics is that we are good at raising issues but the difficulty is following through on them and ensuring progress has been made.</P>
      <P>I seek an update on the progress that has been made in the treatment services provided to people with cystic fibrosis. Those who suffer with this problem form a group that is largely ignored. Dr. Gallagher, who is a leading specialist in cystic fibrosis in St. Vincent&rsquo;s Hospital, said lately there had been no improvement in this area in 20 years. They are not exactly the words we all want to hear.</P>
      <P>Although Ireland has the highest rate of cystic fibrosis in Europe we have some of the worst facilities. As far as I am aware, the cystic fibrosis gene is dormant in all of us but it can be activated if two people with this gene have children. It is a serious problem.</P>
      <P>I am aware that up to three years ago there was a cystic fibrosis specialist, Dr. Cosgrove, in Waterford Regional Hospital. He retired and, for some reason, was never replaced. A paediatrician looks after cystic fibrosis patients but the patient to whom I refer recently turned 17 years of age and, therefore, is no longer eligible for paediatric care. He has been informed he must travel to Dublin and the first problem he faces is that he will have to wait months for an appointment. In addition, no isolation unit will be available unlike in Waterford Regional Hospital, which provides him with his own room and privacy. Cystic fibrosis sufferers are more prone to infection and it is vital that they should have their own rooms.</P>
      <P>The Pollock report was published early last year. It provided an assessment of the current and future need of cystic fibrosis patients and made a number of recommendations. It concluded that fewer units of a more significant size were needed to sustain viable staffing levels and to ensure staff had a sufficient workload to enable them to maintain their skills level. The HSE established a working group following the report and it is due to report shortly. The Government has provided additional funding in this area amounting to &euro;4.78 million, which is welcome but more money needs to be invested. A daughter of one of my constituents in Carlow had to sleep in a chair in the accident and emergency department of Tallaght Hospital recently before being admitted. That is not on, especially given that cystic fibrosis sufferers require regular hospital stays.</P>
      <P>Sufferers are also under pressure because organ donations have reduced worldwide following advances in intensive care practices. Michael Scanlan, the Secretary General of the Department of Health and Children recently wrote to Deputy Twomey about this issue. He admitted in the letter that there were 76 donors in 2005, down from 89 the previous year, which is worrying. I look forward to the Minister of State&rsquo;s reply. I hope he will update the House on progress since <Col N="1269"/>the publication of the Pollock report and clarify what is the difficulty with the appointment of a consultant dealing with cystic fibrosis at Waterford Regional Hospital.</P>

	<P>I am taking this matter on behalf of my colleague, the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister for Health and Children. The enhancement of services to persons with cystic fibrosis has been identified as a key priority by the Minister. As part of the overall funding for health services in 2006, additional funding of almost &euro;5 million has been allocated for the development of cystic fibrosis services. This funding will allow for the recruitment of additional medical, nursing and allied health professional staff, which will greatly improve the delivery of care to persons with cystic fibrosis throughout the country.</P>
      <P>Included in the overall funding is an allocation by the HSE of &euro;220,000 to recruit a consultant respiratory physician and support staff for Waterford Regional Hospital, with links to the specialist cystic fibrosis unit at St. Vincent&rsquo;s University Hospital. A paediatric service is in place at Waterford Regional Hospital for children with cystic fibrosis, which is led by a consultant paediatrician. The hospital treats approximately 30 paediatric patients with cystic fibrosis. The need to develop services for persons with cystic fibrosis is widely acknowledged. The Cystic Fibrosis Association of Ireland commissioned a review of hospital services with reference to accepted international standards. The report, which was published in 2005, provided an assessment of need for current and future cystic fibrosis patients. It made a number of recommendations regarding the numbers and categories of staff appropriate for a modern, multidisciplinary cystic fibrosis service. The report concluded that cystic fibrosis care should be provided in fewer units of a more significant size so that viable staffing levels can be maintained and staff have a sufficient workload to maintain their skills.</P>
      <P>Following publication of the report, the HSE established a multidisciplinary working group to undertake a detailed review of cystic fibrosis services. The working group was asked to review the current configuration and delivery of services to persons with cystic fibrosis in Ireland. It will also make recommendations for the reconfiguration, improvement and development of those services. The working group is due to report shortly and it will make specific recommendations on a range of service improvements for persons with cystic fibrosis, including the future development needs at Waterford.</P>

	<P>Do I take it from the Minster of State&rsquo;s reply that funding has been provided for <Col N="1270"/>the recruitment of a consultant respiratory physician? Has the vacancy been advertised? If so, is there a difficulty filling it? Why is there a delay?</P>
      <P>The Minister of State said the working group is due to report shortly. Does &ldquo;shortly&rdquo; mean weeks, months or years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Mr. T. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>I not aware of the exact position regarding the vacancy but I am sure I can find out from the HSE whether it has advertised the position. It depends on the availability of someone with the appropriate qualifications to do the job. The working group will make specific recommendations very soon.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State. An ambulance service base is needed in<?oasys _jy ?>Edenderry following a major population increase in north Offaly. Edenderry District Hospital also services north and west Kildare. I thank the Minister of State for the funding that was proved for the aged care unit in the hospital. An ambulance base could be set up at the hospital without significant cost. A good ambulance service is provided in both Tullamore and Birr, which was established recently. I receive complaints about the response time of ambulances when called out to emergencies in Edenderry when roads are busy and so on. That should be addressed immediately. The ambulance service is on call all the time at the Tullamore base but, at high risk times, a service should be provided at a base in Edenderry. I hope the Minister of State will have favourable news.</P>

	<P>I thank the Senator for raising this matter, which I am taking on behalf of my colleague, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children. The Health Service Executive has responsibility for the continued development of the ambulance service in the former Midland Health Board region. The HSE has advised that there have been a number of developments in pre-hospital emergency care services in the region in recent years. These include the provision of a new ambulance station at Birr, County Offaly, which opened last February. This station is providing a new service on a 24 hour basis to the area. The elimination of on-call arrangements as a means of providing emergency ambulance cover is designed to facilitate improvements in response times. Additional funding has been provided to the HSE in recent years towards this initiative. This funding has facilitated the elimination of on-call in the former Midland Health Board region.</P>
      <P>The most significant development in the sector for many years is the roll-out of the advanced paramedic training programme. This will ensure that ambulance personnel can administer a range <Col N="1271"/>of 19 additional medications. This includes, for example, cardiac medications, which cannot be administered currently. The national ambulance training school, which operates under the auspices of the HSE in conjunction with University College Dublin, is providing training for advanced paramedic candidates. Two advanced paramedics from the former Midland Health Board region graduated in 2005 and another five are currently receiving training.</P>
      <P>The HSE purchased two rapid response vehicles for the former Midland Health Board region in 2005 to enable the establishment of a new rapid response service. This service is being operated by the two advanced paramedics since they graduated. The HSE also replaced six ambulances in the region&rsquo;s fleet with new vehicles as part of its fleet replacement programme. The <Col N="1272"/>HSE has identified the provision of an ambulance base at Edenderry as a priority development in its capital plan for 2006. The capital plan has been approved by the HSE board and was submitted to the T&aacute;naiste for consideration. The T&aacute;naiste will respond to the HSE on the matter in the near future.</P>
