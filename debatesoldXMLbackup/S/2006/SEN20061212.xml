	<P>I have notice from Senator Bannon that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to provide an update on the application by Scoil Etchen, Kinnegad, County Westmeath, for a proposed building project which is urgently required to facilitate the demand for places at the school, caused by the increased population levels in Kinnegad.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Kitt of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to address the question of approval for Kinvara sewerage scheme, County Galway.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator O&rsquo;Meara of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to ensure that additional staff are allocated to the Garda vetting unit in Thurles, County Tipperary, in light of the fact that the staff there cannot cope with the additional requirement to vet all staff in pre-schools and creches, resulting in the failure to implement new child care regulations on 1 January 2007.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>Some months ago the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform unfortunately stated that, regarding organised crime, we were witnessing the last sting of a dying wasp.  In Finglas this morning the wasp was at it again.  The threat posed to this society by organised crime, specifically drug related crime, is as real and serious as the threat posed by the IRA and other subversive organisations in the recent past.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is far worse.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>The situation on our streets is very dangerous and is deteriorating.  Murder levels have increased by 300% in the past three years and the incidence of firearm use has increased in the past three years by 45%.  At the weekend the Minister stated that judges &ldquo;have to get real&rdquo; on sentencing.  I wish to hear him outline what else can be done by way of legislation, additional powers or resources for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to ensure that this wasp is decommissioned.</P>
        <P>This is a direct challenge to modern Ireland.  There are two Irelands, one that is law-abiding and another that believes itself to be outside the rule of law and carries out summary executions as seen in Finglas this morning.  We must examine this issue seriously.  Judges must play a role in implementing laws on minimum mandatory sentences passed by this House.  What else, according <Col N="1251"/>to the Minister, must be put in place so that organised crime can be tackled?</P>
        <P>I saw the &ldquo;Prime Time Investigates&rdquo; programme on the corrupt practices of estate agents, auctioneers and others in the Irish housing market.  In 1998, I proposed the Home Purchasers (Anti-Gazumping) Bill, which was voted down by Fianna F&aacute;il in the D&aacute;il.  I was told there was no need for mandatory codes or regulation because the industry could regulate itself and that voluntary codes were the way to go.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Like the press.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>The programme exposed what everyone with knowledge of the market knew and such corrupt practices must be tackled.  The only way to do so is with a new regulatory environment where people are held to account.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>The sad part of the programme is that there was little new in it.  I offer my congratulations to Senator de Rossa, the newly appointed auctioneer.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Se&aacute;n de Rossa.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>A first cousin of Proinsias de Rossa.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Ross and I tabled a motion in May 2003.  Every item, bar one, mentioned in last night&rsquo;s programme was included in the debate.  Various people spoke in the debate, including Senator Scanlon who spoke as an auctioneer.  Not enough has happened.  The Minister was as good as his word in establishing a commission, which has since reported, but nothing has happened.  The only revelation last night was the clear connection between mortgage companies and estate agents.  We believed auctioneers favoured buyers whose mortgage was arranged by the auctioneers.  At that stage I thought the purpose of this was to receive a commission but I did not realise how underhanded it was.  It was linked to the amount the young person could afford to pay.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is disgraceful that the public is not being protected.  It is also disgraceful that a minority of estate agents and auctioneers are drawing many responsible auctioneers into disrepute.  Their names and reputations are sullied by these revelations.  We know the issues and it would now be easy to introduce legislation.  We have a responsibility to do so and in this regard we could demonstrate our commitment to members of the public who are affected by this.</P>
        <P>The Competition Authority&rsquo;s report on the legal profession has come to the fore in recent days.  I will give an example, speaking with vested interest as vice chairman of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board.  When a solicitor comes to the Personal Injuries Assessment Board on behalf of a client to put a claim through, we are prevented <Col N="1252"/>by a court ruling from telling the client that he or she does not need a solicitor.  This is a reason difficulties arise and why we are appealing the matter to the Supreme Court.  The issue may require a change in legislation at some time in the future.</P>
        <P>These types of protective practices cause difficulties for the legal profession but I do not agree with the idea of qualified conveyancers to do land conveyancing.  I would have more trust in a legal person than anyone else with such a matter, but the idea of a legal services commission to oversee the operation of both sides of the legal profession would be important.</P>
        <P>I would like a focused debate on the Competition Authority, as some of its actions should be questioned.  It is not correct the whole time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>There are important issues that we must consider.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>In the number of years I have spent in this House I have frequently ended up in the company of people regarded by some members of the Garda as subversives.  In such cases I noticed that whether three people were attending a meeting or 20, there was never a shortage of garda&iacute; to keep an eye on these suspected subversives.  They would incessantly follow these people around, visit their homes and pick them up.</P>
        <P>I would regard the threat of people such as those who carried out this morning&rsquo;s killings to the way we live in this country as worse than the Provisional IRA, as their actions are based entirely on self-centred and brutal greed, without any spark of ideal.  That is not to explain or dilute anything done by subversives in this country.</P>
        <P>The threat is profound and an innocent young man who happened to be working in the house is dead.  We should not hear about more legislation and my views on prisons are well known.  If we were to double the number of prison places, the prisons would inevitably be full or overcrowded in another two months.  We need resources for those sections of the Garda S&iacute;ochana that are most expert in this area, in order for them to have 24-hour vigilance over these people in the way they used to with what were probably correctly termed subversives 20 years ago.  There should be a continuous assembly of information.</P>
        <P>How could this murdered individual, a top Garda suspect, have been in this location without anybody knowing?  For 20 years Gerry Adams could not be anywhere in this State without the Garda knowing exactly where he was, which was right.  How can an equivalent threat to our society apparently not be under the same level of surveillance?  That is a matter for the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in<?oasys _jy ?>allocating resources and the priorities for the<?oasys _jy ?>Garda.</P><Col N="1253"/>
        <P>I call for an immediate debate on the proposals by Minister for Health and Children regarding residential care for older people.  There are a series of issues contained in these which are profoundly worrying for older people and the type of society we have.  Age Action Ireland has already indicated that the only group which will have these burdens imposed on them is the elderly.  I find the matter distasteful.</P>
        <P>We are approaching Christmas week and people are getting involved in singing hymns about peace and harmony, most with images of Bethlehem and Palestine.  What the Western world and the world in general is doing to the people of Palestine is only one step away from genocide.  These people will begin to die soon, either because of internal strife, hunger, disease or the absence of electricity.  This is done because in the most freely contested democratic election the Middle East ever saw, the wrong party won.  That party is asked to do things Sinn F&eacute;in or the IRA were not asked to do before we negotiated with them.  We did not ask the IRA to recognise Northern Ireland, renounce violence forever or recognise a succession of previous agreements before we negotiated with it.</P>
        <P>The only liberation struggle ever asked to abandon its principles before negotiation is that which now represents the people of Palestine.  The world&rsquo;s reaction was to impose the most appalling suffering, not on the government but on the ordinary people of the Palestinian territories, the place where all of our minds will look during the next few weeks because it is the place where the events of Christmas took place.  I would like our consciences to be a little aware of what is being done in our name to the people of Palestine.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I share the House&rsquo;s grief and sorrow at the shooting dead of the sub-postmaster in Kilkenny.  It is a disaster for his family.  He was a brave and courageous postmaster and we should send our sympathies to the postmasters' union on the tragic murder of a brave person.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Expressions of sympathy are personal.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I personally sympathise.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Will the Leader of the House have an early debate on the Competition Authority&rsquo;s view on the legal profession?  I issued a detailed statement on this.  I do not agree with the removal of restrictions on barristers and solicitors advertising.  We stopped this type of advertising on a previous occasion.  We all remember the ambulance chasers who sought clients and took large advertisements in the Golden Pages.  The Competition Authority wants to reverse what we already did.  I do not agree with all of the recommendations.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>They removed them.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1254"/>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>This is what they recommend and it was restricted.</P>
        <P>The great Law Society of Ireland told me it does not support the Registration of Wills Bill 2005.  It tries to stop investigation and the introduction of regulation to control its business.  It got away with murder on the registration of wills.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>It will be debated tomorrow evening.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I intend to hold a major debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator should hold his fire.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a promo.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>This is a separate issue, the recommendations of the Competition Authority.  After Christmas, we should have a general debate on the legal profession in light of those recommendations.</P>
        <P>The &ldquo;Prime Time Investigates&rdquo; programme last night was quite chilling.  I congratulate Mr. de Rossa on his election as an auctioneer and valuer.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>It is Senator de Rossa in this House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Senator de Rossa, auctioneer, valuer and estate agent.  I wish him well in his new practice and on his return to the House.  Last night&rsquo;s programme &ldquo;Prime Time Investigates&rdquo; gave great service to the country in exposing difficulties.  However, it does not apply to all auctioneers and valuers, only to a small group.  Every organisation has people who do not live by the rules.  Nobody in this House is like that.  The auctioneers in this House are fine and upstanding.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>What a contrasting world we live in.  This morning I looked at the newspaper and saw a lovely smiling photograph of the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, and the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Parlon, cutting a tape at the official opening of the Data Protection Commissioner&rsquo;s office in Portarlington.  Only one staff member out of 24 moved from Dublin to that office.</P>
        <P>However, I also read about the murders which happened during the week.  It is deeply saddening to think the life of a young apprentice plumber was taken because he was a witness to the execution of another man.  I worry about the state of anarchy prevailing in the country.  Rather than cheap mugshots of the Minister in the newspaper at a non-event, I would prefer to see him being pro-active in crushing what is happening here.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>Given the closure of Castlemahon Foods and more than 300 workers now <Col N="1255"/>unemployed, of which the Cathaoirleach will be aware, I would like the Leader to raise this issue with the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin.  What are known as customised training programmes are available and people may be interested in specific training programmes.  However, there is a restriction on the amount the State will pay, which is &euro;650.  With regard to workers like these, where promises are made that F&Aacute;S will give maximum assistance, we should, where possible, give the maximum assistance, whether it is a heavy goods vehicle driving course, a SafePass course or a specialist machinery course, if we are serious about getting these people back into the workplace.  The Leader should raise this issue with the Minister and offer some hope to these workers who are reaching out to find a new opportunity.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>I also call for a debate on the conduct of the auctioneering business and, in that context, I congratulate Senator Ross on his appointment.  We must call into question how people are assessed in graduating and acquiring certification to carry out auctioneering.  I was disgusted by the revelations in the programme last night.  While I know Senator Ross is very capable of handling his brief, it definitely highlights the fact that the process is very easy.  After seeing the programme last night, I also feel that it is time for the &ldquo;do it yourself&rdquo; people to set themselves up and see how best we can overcome these problems.  A debate on this issue is certainly well overdue.</P>
        <P>I also congratulate the Minister for Health and Children on her imaginative scheme for dealing with long-term care in the future.  By putting a charge on the value of a residence after death, we will relieve anxiety in many families who find themselves in a very difficult monetary situation when they try to pay the costs of putting an elderly relative in a nursing home.  This is a worthwhile scheme, although some people may not like the idea of it.  We should have a discussion on it some time in the new year and tease out where the weaknesses may be.  The concept behind the scheme is worthwhile.  It is a great and very imaginative idea and I hope it will work.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>I endorse everything said by Senators O&rsquo;Toole, Brian Hayes and Ormonde about last night&rsquo;s edition of &ldquo;Prime Time Investigates&rdquo;.  The programme was pretty raw in that it obviously revealed an unregulated industry running riot among first-time buyers or any buyers or any of the most vulnerable people when they wish to make the largest investment of their lives.  I was not surprised by the programme because, as Senator O&rsquo;Toole said, we have already identified most, if not all, these problems and a few more.</P><Col N="1256"/>
        <P>The most dangerous aspect of auctioneering practices is that these people handle vast sums of money without being supervised by anybody.  They take booking deposits that have no value or legal standing.  As Senator O&rsquo;Toole noted, this was brought to the attention of the House by us three years.  It will be four years shortly.  While a commission sat and made some recommendations, nothing has been done about them and I doubt anything will be done about them before the general election, despite the latest edition of &ldquo;Prime Time Investigates&rdquo;.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>I issue two words of warning.  One of the problems which was not identified and which is a delicate one in respect of this House is that auctioneers have traditionally had immense political clout.  This does not just apply to this House, which contains a large number of auctioneers, practising or not, but also to the other House and, especially, to county councils.  Auctioneers sitting on county councils are deeply conflicted because they are involved in rezoning decisions which obviously involve their clients.  This matter should have been tackled many years ago through the imposition of more stringent declarations of interest and the introduction of legislation.</P>
        <P>We should be careful in stating that this matter merely relates to a few cowboys.  There is no evidence regarding the latter assertion because very little research has been carried out in respect of this completely unregulated profession.  I would not rely too much on the two quite ineffective umbrella bodies &mdash; they refer to themselves as &ldquo;institutes&rdquo; &mdash; which are in existence and which supposedly regulate their members.  One of the whistleblowers in last night&rsquo;s &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme was a member of one of the institutes when he was practising.</P>
        <P>The prime offence outlined on last night&rsquo;s programme related to mortgages being dealt with by the members of one group, namely, mortgage brokers, who where exchanging information with auctioneers.  The problem in this regard is that a large number of supposedly reputable auctioneers operate, as subsidiaries, mortgage broker businesses, which, in fact, they own.  If that is not a conflict of interest, I do not know what is and such practices should be outlawed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to extend my deepest sympathy to the family of the 20 year old apprentice who was shot this morning.  I also extend my sympathies to the family of the victim of the other murder in Kilkenny.  I know nothing about the apprentice who was shot this morning, other than that he comes from the inner city and possibly from a disadvantaged economic environment.  This young man had obviously been encouraged or had decided to make something of his life but he was callously murdered because he happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.  As a child, I was a great fan of 1930s gangster films.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1257"/>
      <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Many Members are offering.  The Senator should be brief.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>We want to hear what the Senator has to say.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Unfortunately, we do not have time to do so.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I would love to hear what Senator Mooney has to say but we do not have time to do so.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I was merely attempting to ask the Leader if she agrees that there is a need to follow the example of what happened in America in the 1930s, when a group know as &ldquo;the untouchables&rdquo; was established?  I have always accepted the primacy of the law.  I support the views expressed by other Members and perhaps there is a need for the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to examine the nature of due process.  If the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is aware of the identity of those who carry out crimes of this nature and if its members cannot touch them, there is then a need for change.</P>
        <P>The Special Criminal Court was established to deal with the Provisional IRA and it sat in the absence of juries.  As Members are aware, widespread intimidation of witnesses has taken place.  Will the Leader convey to the Minister the horror of Members regarding what has happened and ask him to reflect on the way forward?</P>
        <P>I applaud the brave and courageous students in Tehran who have taken on the maniac President Ahmadinejad.  The latter has been hosting a conference on whether the Holocaust occurred.  I did not believe that there were such brave dissenters within the troubled country of Iran.  I wish to record the dismay of a great many people, particularly the victims of the Holocaust, that such an outrageous conference is taking place in what is purported to be a civilised country.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>As already stated, many Members are offering.  I ask Senators to be brief in order that we might accommodate everyone.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to add my voice to that of other Senators who expressed their horror at this morning&rsquo;s killing and also at the murder of an innocent man in Kilkenny who was merely going about his business.  The way these people were killed has been a shock to everyone.  On many occasions, we have expressed our horror in respect of events of this nature.  However, there really has not been an improvement in the situation.  The situation on the streets is growing worse as innocent bystanders are getting caught in the crossfire between gangsters.  It is out of hand.</P>
        <P>We have called on the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to come to the House, <Col N="1258"/>and he has, to tell us what he proposes to do about the matter.  It is unacceptable that so many guns are available.  When innocent people are killed it is time for the Minister to do something more serious.  We want to hear what can be done, whether longer sentences for those who are caught, greater resources for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or stiffer legislation to ensure people are safe on the street, in their workplaces and going about their business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Mr. Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I share the call for a debate on the cost of nursing homes and the future plans in this area.  This Government has a fine tradition of providing for the future, as the National Treasury Management Agency encourages people to take out pensions.  Two major costs most people encounter during their lives are school fees and long-term nursing home care.  It is possible, through long-term and ultra long-term bonds to provide for these costs.</P>
        <P>The Government might step in and assist through tax relief or double tax relief at top marginal rates because if people make provision early enough that small sum can become significant.  If there were tax relief for the long-term bonds, as there is for pensions, using the 72 rule, which is the mathematical formula for the number of years it would take to double one&rsquo;s money at a return of 13%, a sum would increase tenfold over 50 years if one put it away at an early age.  That would make a difference for the future.</P>
        <P>I wish to call for a debate on the situation in Iran.  For the first time we are hearing again the calls that were heard in the 1930s in Europe about the Jewish people.  I address my remarks to the President of Iran who said the State of Israel should be wiped off the map.  It is unacceptable for any sovereign state to hold that view and all the more so if that state becomes a nuclear power.</P>

	<P>I have read reports in the newspapers, including <i>The Irish Times</i>, to the effect that the Government might delay a referendum to deal with the fall-out from the statutory rape controversy and the age of consent.  It is no secret that I oppose the lowering of the age of consent.  I have said this any time the issue has been debated here.  I agree with the Rape Crisis Centre that we may need to empower young people to feel firm and confident in their ability to resist pressure from older people and their peer group to have sex before they are ready.  </P>
        <P Just="Left">Not lowering the age of consent will not in any way expose children to the dangers of sexual predators.  That issue should be put on hold and debated further because there are differences in public opinion and within political parties.  The Government should prioritise implementing the <Col N="1259"/>numerous recommendations of the report of the sub-committee on child protection on which there is consensus.  There are 62 recommendations, all of which are important, and those which are agreed by all should be implemented without delay.  There should be a referendum before the election on the need to include the express rights of children in the Constitution.  I would like to have a debate on the child protection report as soon as possible.</P>
        <P>I support the calls for a debate on the proposals to seek money from the estates of older people for the cost of nursing home care.  The point has been made that older people pay their taxes, but not only that, many of the older people who would be affected by this measure paid the highest taxes ever paid in this country of up to 60% and 70%.</P>

	<P>On foot of the &ldquo;Prime Time Investigates&rdquo; programme, I support what was said about some auctioneers.  I commend Senator Ross for his stance and the manner in which he progressed the matter.  I seek a debate on planning enforcement.  I was a member of a local authority for 25 years.  In many cases, ratepayers and taxpayers have picked up the bill for the completion of estates.  Clearly, that is wrong.</P>
        <P>I welcome the call for a debate on the recent announcement pertaining to nursing homes.  It is important old people who are currently in nursing homes, or are due to go into nursing homes, would be able to put aside the concerns that have been expressed in recent weeks.  Excellent proposals are contained in the Minister&rsquo;s policy document but it merits discussion.  I call for an early debate on this matter.</P>

As someone who has long held an auctioneer&rsquo;s licence, even though I am not currently practising, I spoke in that debate.  We were all agreed on the issue in this House.  None of us condones what was referred to in the programme concerned, which I have not seen but about which I heard this morning on a radio programme.

	<P>I welcome the report of the Competition Authority in respect of the legal profession.  It was long overdue.  The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is taking some initiatives in this area.  I call for a debate on that report early in the new year because the Law Society and the Bar Council are already circling their wagons with a view to rubbishing the report and avoiding its implementation.  That would be a travesty.  This is one sector that needs to be independently regulated and we should move in that direction.</P>
        <P>I am disappointed the report on the bombing of Kay&rsquo;s Tavern by the sub-committee on the Barron report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights is not on the Order Paper.  The suggestion was made during a debate last week that it might be postponed.  I remind the House that the committee has called for a debate in this House and the Lower House to address the issues involved.  The victims have been crying out for truth on these matters for 30 years.  To assist them in their efforts to seek closure, I urge that the report, which recognises that this State has also failed the victims, is debated and that we do not compound their hurt by these Houses also failing the victims.  I seek a debate at the earliest possible opportunity on this important and scandalous issue.</P>

	<P>When the State was founded, we established a Garda force that was unarmed.  Ten or 20 years ago, if a murder took place in the State in which a gun was involved, it received banner headlines.  What happened recently in Kilkenny was very sad, but even more threatening is what happened in Finglas this morning.  I know both areas very well.  There are many scared people not only in Finglas but in Dublin because of what happened this morning.</P>
        <P>I would not be surprised at reprisals or at calls for different steps to be taken.  We have a debate on policing tomorrow.  That is the occasion to focus to see whether we can help to ensure that the police force which was established in the State so many years ago has the ability to achieve what it set out to do, namely, to protect its citizens.

        <P>I welcome the plan announced by the Minister for Health and Children.  We debated some of these matters last week.  It represents substantial progress.

	<P Just="Left">I condemn the savage death of Alan Cunniffe and the young man in Finglas.  The instinct in all of us is the sense of the volunteer, to chase somebody who is robbing a post office or a bank.  I was in that situation more than ten years ago when a bank was raided beside me and I ran after the armed raiders.  When I think now of what could have happened my blood runs cold.  I would like it to go out from this House that we have professional men and women, very brave people, in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and we should contact them because we are dealing with savage, violent criminals, rather than take our lives in our hands.  That is not to take from the bravery of the young man.  I ask that the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform come into the House for a debate on crime and to outline what he intends to do.  Clearly we have lost the battle in the fight against organised crime.  We do not want to go through another Christmas with a repeat of what has happened during the past few years.</P>

	<P>In my document, A New Approach to Aging and Ageism, I wrote extensively about the financing of long-stay care for older people in residential homes, both private and public.  One of the points I made was that the issue of financing of residential care for older people is divisive in society.  I compliment the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, for putting her proposal on the table yesterday.

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Senator White.  I thought the headlines were appalling and irresponsible.  The Minister has put forward an interesting proposal.  A degree of sensitivity is required.  It is possible to add to it because there is potential for unfairness.  There are different values for houses and it may affect some people more than others.  I have worked with Age Action Ireland and have heard it refer to this as an example of ageism.  What does it expect in old people&rsquo;s homes?  It is not a maternity ward.  Of course it affects these people.  This kind of silly comment is regrettable.  I do not believe there is as much interest as people posture about either in the newspapers or politically even in this House.  I spoke in the debate last week and it collapsed.</P>

	<P>On drugs, I share the horror at the death of this young man.  It was only a matter of time before there were civilian casualties in this war.  It is a very problematic area.  This country cannot handle it on its own.  It is an international problem.  I take the very unpopular but realistic view that we need to legalise, license and control these substances.  What is driving the trade internationally is the profit motive.  Many of the countries that are strongest in their condemnation of drugs are the very ones that fuel it, such as the Governments of the United States and the United Kingdom, which turn a blind eye to the convoys going through Uzbekistan for their own political reasons.</P>
        <P>I join my colleagues in calling for a debate on the Middle East.  Although I share Senator Ryan&rsquo;s views on the dreadful plight of the Palestinians, I regret that, Ismail Haniyah, the Prime Minister designate of Palestine, said in Tehran that he was on a jihad that would not end until the city of Jerusalem was re-conquered.  Will the Leader request the Minister for Foreign Affairs to call in the Iranian ambassador and <Col N="1263"/>rebuke him for the conference that is taking place?

      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I join colleagues in speaking about the armed crime of recent days involving a number of murders.  I condemn the activities of those who committed the crimes and urge the Minister to become more active in pursuing those kinds of criminals.  Senator Feighan spoke about the particularly poignant case of Alan Cunniffe in Kilkenny who had just taken over as postmaster from his mother last Wednesday.  We discussed post offices in this House on a number of occasions.  He was shot on the street outside his post office on Friday.  I never expected such an event on the streets of Kilkenny, but it has now happened.  Such events are all too common and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, rather than directing his mock anger at the media, would be better served directing it at the perpetrators of such horrific crimes.</P>
        <P>I agree with other Senators who expressed concern at the proposals announced yesterday by the Minister for Health and Children regarding nursing home care and the possibility of making a link to deceased people who have been in receipt of nursing home care of up to 15% of the value of their home.  We should have an early discussion on the issue.  I do not agree with it.</P>

	<P>A number of sources have mentioned 15%.  I agree with other Senators who have called for regulation of auctioneers and valuers.  I do not have the in-depth knowledge of Senator Ross.  It is my understanding that many people who are involved in this business for many <Col N="1264"/>years would like to see effective regulation.  We should take that approach as soon as possible.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>In speaking about the dreadful double murder this morning in Finglas, Senator Brian Hayes observed that for many years we all worried privately and in our public discussions about the activities of subversives and that what is happening now is another type of subversion, equally dangerous to that which occupied our minds for so long.  He asked how the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform proposes to deal with such summary executions.</P>
        <P>The Senator also spoke about the expos&eacute; of the housing market that featured on &ldquo;Prime Time Investigates&rdquo; and, in particular, the connection between mortgage companies and particular buyers.  I agree the extraordinary evidence of insider collusion is the worst aspect of the matter.  First-time buyers must scrimp, save, beg, borrow and cajole to purchase a home, and their entire future and life aspirations are bound up in that.  Some of these practices are already unlawful under existing legislation.  The Data Protection Act 1988, for instance, imposes restrictions on the exchange of information about individuals.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole echoed Senator Brian Hayes&rsquo;s comments on the murders in Finglas.  He also referred to the Competition Authority&rsquo;s report on the legal profession.  The latter is the last frontier in terms of the lack of a system of independent regulation.  I was displeased with the comments of a certain director general &mdash; whom I will not name &mdash; whose knee-jerk reaction involved a defence of what had and had not been done and what would not be done in future.  In many cases, we are faced with mysteries wrapped up in further mysteries.  We all agree there are many decent solicitors and barristers and many of us depend on such people for our legal dealings.  There are many areas, however, in which we are not allowed step into their world.  I do not know why this is the case.</P>
        <P>Senator Ryan observed that in the past, members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na would attend any meeting in respect of which there was even a suggestion of anything subversive.  The Senator called on the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to attend the House to speak about resources and priorities for the force.</P>
        <P>He also called for a debate on the nursing home proposals.  The Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, said in a television interview last night that she wishes to facilitate a regime of consultation on the matter.  She has given me an undertaking to come into the House in the first week of the new session to discuss her proposals.  Committee and Report Stages of the Health (Nursing Homes) (Amendment) Bill 2006 will be taken in the House after Christmas.  By its nature, however, Committee Stage is a truncated mechanism.  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s undertaking to discuss the matter with Senators.  Her proposals are worthy of debate.</P><Col N="1265"/>
        <P>Senator Ryan reminded us of the sufferings of the Palestinian people and observed that large numbers of them face slow and painful deaths through hunger and disease.  He asked that all our consciences be finally awakened on this matter.</P>
        <P>Senator Leyden referred to the shooting dead of the postmaster in County Kilkenny.  He also spoke about the Competition Authority&rsquo;s report on the legal profession.  I agree the &ldquo;Prime Time Investigates&rdquo; investigation was powerful in the way it got to the heart of the matter.  We were already aware of many of the issues but it is hugely important that they were highlighted in conjunction with related matters in this way.</P>
        <P>Senator Finucane referred to the photograph of the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Parlon, and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, at the official opening of the Data Protection Commissioner&rsquo;s office in Portarlington.  There is nothing unusual in such a joint appearance.</P>
        <P>I agree with the Senator that the saddest aspect of today&rsquo;s double murder is that the young apprentice plumber was an entirely innocent and unwitting murder victim.  He heard and saw what took place and his life was deemed expendable.  His murderers simply got rid of him in case his presence at the scene of the crime posed any danger to themselves.</P>
        <P>Senator Finucane also referred to specialised programmes for people who have been in certain types of job and may want to change, particularly in the case of the Castlemahon Foods workers.  I will convey the Senator&rsquo;s views to the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>My point is that the limitation for such courses should not be at a maximum of &euro;650.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.  Senator Ormonde called for a debate on auctioneering and congratulated the Minister for Health and Children on her imaginative scheme for care for the elderly.</P>
        <P>The weather on Sunday was dreadful but I thoroughly enjoyed Senator Ross&rsquo;s article in the <i>Sunday Independent</i>.  It was a clever piece in which, under the name Se&aacute;n de Rossa, he applied for an auctioneer&rsquo;s licence and received it in six weeks.  He spoke of auctioneers handling vast sums of other people&rsquo;s money without being supervised.  They have always had immense political clout.  It is not just a few cowboys.  Last night&rsquo;s &ldquo;Prime Time Investigates&rdquo; programme showed auctioneers are already in breach of the Data Protection Act by exchanging intimate information about property deals.</P>
        <P>Senator Mooney spoke feelingly about the apprentice killed on a caprice in Finglas today.  He was killed because he just happened to be in a particular place.  He got himself a good training.  Senator Mooney also referred to the students in Teheran who shouted out that there was a Holocaust.  I do not know what they are at in Iran.  I <Col N="1266"/>heard an imam this morning on the radio claiming there were 60 people killed in the Holocaust.</P>
        <P>Senator Terry added her voice to the condemnation of the terrible killings in Dublin and gun crime.  Senator Hanafin called for a debate on nursing homes.  The Minister for Health and Children has already stated she wants a debate on the subject.  He spoke of the attractive nature of long-term bonds which would be productively used in the care of the elderly.  He also spoke of the situation in Iran.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator Tuffy is against lowering the age of sexual consent.  She wants a further debate on this and the child protection report.  She called for a referendum to give more emphasis to the rights of the child in the Constitution.  My fear is that this will be inadvertently linked to the furore over the lowering of the age of sexual consent.  It will be muddied up in it when the rights of the child stand on their own merits.</P>
        <P>Senator Glynn called for a debate on planning enforcement and the completion of housing estates by developers as the taxpayer and the innocent end up paying for it.  He also called for a debate on the recently published nursing home proposals of which he is in favour.  We must check the small print and see what the proposals really mean.</P>
        <P>Senator Coghlan called for a debate on auctioneers.  Senator Jim Walsh called for a debate on the Competition Authority&rsquo;s report on the legal profession.  I cannot understand why the legal profession does not see it as a good move.  Maybe we were lazy, but we have adopted the same format as used in the D&aacute;il to discuss the various tribunals and reports on the Garda.  Senator Walsh believes we should have included the Dublin-Monaghan bombings, the murder of Seamus Ludlow and the bombing of Kay&rsquo;s Tavern in Dundalk.  On matters such as this, the Seanad takes its lead from the Taoiseach&rsquo;s office.  I will see if there is a chance to include the reports on collusion between security forces and loyalists.</P>
        <P>Senator Quinn claimed that after the recent gun crimes many are in fear.  He believes there will be a regime of reprisals for today&rsquo;s murders.  Senator Mansergh is glad, as is Senator &Oacute;<?oasys _jy ?>Murch&uacute;, that 16 Moore Street will be preserved.  He also welcomed the proposals on care for the elderly from the Minister for Health and Children which he thought were enlightened and progressive.</P>
        <P>Senator Feighan spoke of today&rsquo;s Finglas murders.  He also pointed out that when he was a shopkeeper he chased criminals from his shop.  A similar incident to that in Kilkenny could have happened to him.  The Garda is the only barrier between us and criminals.</P>
        <P>Senator White praised the Minister for Health and Children.  She spoke of the repugnant depiction of the Minister in one of today&rsquo;s newspapers.  We need a press council to deal with such matters.  It was awful and I could only think of <Col N="1267"/>how the Minister would feel looking at it.  We are supposed to have thick skins but we have not.</P>

B&iacute;mse agus an tAire ar aon aigne faoi a l&aacute;n ruda&iacute; &oacute; am go ham.  T&aacute; a fhios aige go bhfuil roinnt mhaith suime agam i gcuid bheag d&aacute; Dh&aacute;ilcheantar.

        <P>I thank the Minister and the Government for facilitating this debate in Government time.  I particularly thank the Leader and Deputy Leader of the House, Senators O&rsquo;Rourke and Dardis, respectively, and various colleagues on both sides of the House who have expressed an interest in something that to many people might seem obscure but which is, in fact, a significant issue.  It is the type of issue with which the Oireachtas, in conflict mode, would never get around to dealing but with which the Seanad, in slightly more reflective mode, should be able to deal.</P>
        <P>This Bill is not some type of esoteric undertaking but is part of the way modern and democratic societies organise themselves.  Like many things in modern society, its roots lie in a very ancient tradition.  I am intrigued by the fact that countries as ancient as the United Kingdom and as modern as the Republic of South Africa both consider it necessary to have heraldry Acts, a state herald and a bureau of heraldry.  We like symbols; they express our identity.  There is a skill and a good deal of artistry involved.</P>
        <P>The idea of recognising heraldry and of giving it only under regulated conditions is ancient.  The first record of a herald of arms for Ireland dates back to 1382, more than 620 years ago.  The office of Ulster King of Arms which, peculiarly, became the awarder of arms in Ireland was established by King Edward VI in 1552.  Some people might, somewhere in our hearts, have reservations about his jurisdiction to make such decisions even then &mdash; it took a long time to sort out that issue &mdash; but he was the legal authority at the time.  He even noted it in his diary on 2 February that year.</P>
        <P>The Ulster King of Arms, the first of whom was a Bartholomew Butler, persisted in that role from 1552 until 1941.  Nobody is sure where the use of the term &ldquo;Ulster&rdquo; came from; it does not relate to the province but is an adjective that was used.  The deputy Ulster King of Arms continued in office until 1943, when the powers were transferred from the United Kingdom to the State and the office of the Chief Herald of Ireland was established.  That redoubtable figure in Irish literature and history, Dr. Edward MacLysaght, was the first Chief Herald of Ireland.</P>
        <P>Why tell the history?  When something&rsquo;s origins are buried in the mists of history, questions of legalities can arise.  The problem is that the transfer of the office of arms to Irish control was done without any legal enactment.  There was considerable concern about that.  That concern persisted.  The records and the office were transferred but the legislative basis for this is murky, at the least, and, in the opinion of some, unsustainable.  Attempts were made to resolve the problem in the National Cultural Institutions Act 1997, which was introduced by my esteemed colleague, Deputy Michael D. Higgins, who was Minister at the time.  Without casting aspersions on the current Minister&rsquo;s distinction, he was one <Col N="1270"/>of this Minister&rsquo;s more distinguished predecessors.</P>
        <P>The provision in that Act states:</P>
        <P LI="1">(1) For the avoidance of doubt, it is hereby declared that the Genealogical Office is a branch of the Library. [That is, the National Library].</P>
        <P LI="1">(2) The Board shall, from time to time as occasion requires, designate a member of its staff to perform the duty of researching, granting and confirming coats of arms and such member shall use the appellation Chief Herald of Ireland or, in the Irish language, Pr&iacute;omh-Aralt na h&Eacute;ireann while performing such duties.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The Genealogical Office is declared to be a branch of the National Library but the Genealogical Office is not founded in legislation anywhere.  The body does not have a legislative or legal basis, or that is the argument.  This is not just esoteric; it relates to our heritage.  This dates back to more than 600 years ago.  It relates to how we deal with symbols, flags and the like.</P>
        <P>The provision in the 1997 Act, on the basis of which the existing Chief Herald was established, was always questioned by people involved in specialist genealogical services.  However, in 2002 a report appeared in the newspapers and it has not, to my knowledge, been contradicted.  It stated that the Attorney General had advised the Minister in June 2002 that there was no legislative basis for courtesy recognition of the Gaelic chiefs.  He went on to state that there was no legislative basis for the granting of arms by the Chief Herald on behalf of the State.  That is the reported advice of the Attorney General.  I am familiar with the rigmarole that it is not practice to disclose the advice of the Attorney General but the fact that the report has not been contradicted suggests there must be some truth in it.  We are, therefore, in a peculiar legal quagmire.</P>
        <P>Why should that matter?  It leaves open the possibility that arms which have been issued, including those of many organisations, are open to legal misuse and abuse.  It leaves open the question of whether the issue of arms is copyright.  I have made the point, a little mischievously but without attempting to distort, that if there is no proper and enforceable legal protection for the issue of arms, the coat of arms of Uachtar&aacute;n na h&Eacute;ireann, for example, could be used by somebody who opens a lap dancing club, calls it &ldquo;The Presidents&rdquo; and uses that coat of arms as an emblem of the club.</P>
        <P Just="Left">If the legal basis is as seriously non-existent as I am told, this issue raises fundamental questions.  It is part of what we need to do to guard our heritage.  This Bill is an attempt to respond to that uncertainty and to give the matter proper legal footing.  I am not optimistic.  I read the Minister&rsquo;s dismissive response to questions raised by a Member of the other House saying that since the <Col N="1271"/>board of the National Library of Ireland had not informed him of any deficiencies, there are none.  I imagine the board of the National Library of Ireland has a long list of matters to deal with and that a matter such as this, which is to do with the legislative base of the protection of a specific part of our heritage, would be a matter for Government.  It would be interesting if the Minister asked the board its opinion and how it felt the interpretation of others in this area differs from its own.  It would be interesting if he asked the board members in confidence how they feel the Attorney General&rsquo;s advice can be reconciled with their apparent willingness to accept the situation.</P>
        <P>I have often sat in this House going through long Bills section by section with Ministers.  The House will be spared that because I do not have time to go through the entire Bill.  It contains 40 sections, six Parts and three Schedules.  It is appropriate to mention the sections of the Bill.  The Bill has a long list of objectives, including the regularisation of the delivery of the services, which is not being done, and performs a variety of functions, including the establishment of the office of arms with a firm legal basis, assigning responsibility for the management, control and administration of the office of arms within the National Library, providing for the granting of arms, which we are told the Attorney General has advised may not be legally grounded, and providing for copyright matters because without a clear and unambiguous position on copyright of arms, they can be copied, thus undermining the purpose of the issue of unique arms.</P>
        <P>The Bill also aims to give a less expensive method of granting arms, give Pr&iacute;omh-Aralt na h&Eacute;ireann responsibility for the overall policy and delivery of such services, provide retrospective confirmation of grants of arms issued since 1943, establish a new register of emblems and provide for such and provide for the appointment by licence of heraldic and vexillogical agents.  Vexillology relates to flags.  Even Senator Norris was defeated by that word.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>This legislation is a classic example of the sort of work Seanad &Eacute;ireann can do that will not be done anywhere else.  I appeal to the Minister to let the debate persist.  If we vote it down now, the people who believe it is necessary will begin again.  Their agenda is not political but relates to our heritage.  They want to see the resolution of what they believe to be ambiguity.  Perhaps the Minister can offer clear, unequivocal advice that there is no need for this.  Apart from the issue of the register of arms, there are other issues regarding quality, services, accessibility and copyright, and I hope the Minister will deal with them.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister not to let us get involved in an argument about details in this legislation that the Minister feels are inconsistent.  In the past two years I have been responsible for two Government Bills having to return to the D&aacute;il late in the summer because they contained mistakes.  If the Minister wants the names of these Bills I will tell him.  One of them, the National Economic and Social Development Office Bill, had sat in the D&aacute;il for four years and contained a fundamental contradiction.  Any inadequacies or mistakes can be remedied on Committee Stage.  That is what Committee Stage is for and we can have a long, leisurely reflection on this over Christmas and pursue it gently in the new year.  The alternative is to vote it down, in which case the same people will begin it again in January.  Until they are convinced that there is no need for it, this issue will surface, as it has done intermittently for the past 60 years.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><TitleTxt>Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to have been asked to speak to this House on a Private Members&rsquo; Bill and I congratulate Senator Ryan on bringing it forward.  I remind this House of the excellent progress this Government has made in recent times in supporting the arts.  The total expenditure for <Col N="1273"/>my Department in 2007 will be &euro;698.6 million, which is up by 17.6% over 2006.  Of this, &euro;216.56 million is for arts and culture, an increase of 8.65% on a record 2006 expenditure.  In recent years the arts, sport and tourism sectors have received unprecedented tangible support from the Government in terms of increased financial allocations.  Since 2003, current funding has been increased by 43.4% or &euro;121 million, but capital funding has increased by 147.5% or &euro;178 million.  That is before taking account of the public private partnership allocations for the redevelopment of the National Concert Hall and the new Abbey Theatre.  I am delighted that the sectors have acknowledged such support and responded with vibrancy and innovation in their programmes.</P>
        <P>The arts are a response to our individuality and our nature.  They demonstrate and shape our identity as a people.  They can become the driving force for healing division and divisiveness as well as a potent economic force.  Nobody can question this Government&rsquo;s commitment to the arts.  The Arts Council is the main vehicle through which State support is channelled to the arts and the Government&rsquo;s ongoing commitment to the arts sector is well demonstrated with an allocation of &euro;80 million to the Arts Council in 2007.  Artists and arts organisations should see the decision to provide a further substantial increase, following on from the 18% increase provided in 2006, to the Arts Council as confirmation of the high regard in which Government holds the arts and culture sectors.</P>

	<P>Commitment to the arts infrastructure is further evidenced in the continued funding under the arts and culture capital enhancement support scheme, ACCESS for a wide range of capital projects at new and existing venues throughout the country.  Again the Government has been able to provide a substantial increase for the national cultural institutions such as the National Museum, National Library, National Archives, National Gallery, Chester Beatty Library, Irish Museum of Modern Art and National Concert Hall.  As Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism I am proud of the work undertaken by these institutions.  I am confident they will continue to be an easily accessible resource to all our citizens and visitors.  I commend the role they play both as a tourism asset and as educational facilities.  I will return to the matter of the National Library.</P><Col N="1274"/>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>Overall funding of &euro;19.7 million will be allocated to the Irish Film Board in 2007.  This increase will enable the board to continue its essential role of developing and supporting the indigenous industry.  The increased current allocation will facilitate the board in marketing Ireland as a film location and will assist the work of the newly appointed official in Los Angeles in raising the profile of the Irish audiovisual industry abroad.  This provision underlies the sustained Government support for the board that has seen its allocation increase by 60% since 2002.</P>
        <P>A 50% increase in funding has been secured for Culture Ireland to ensure that Irish art is promoted both at home and abroad.  Taken together with the 50% increase secured in 2006, this represents unprecedented Government support for the arts.  I will continue to highlight the necessity to invest in the arts.  The Government must nourish the broader aspects of society and should not weigh up all matters in purely economic terms.  Artists and the arts, in conjunction with the national cultural institutions, seek to promote a more rounded development of our country and our lives.  After many years of neglect, I have striven to increase Government investment in arts and culture and will continue to do so as Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism.  Under my stewardship the arts have been pushed boldly into the core of Government policy.</P>
        <P>The Genealogy and Heraldry Bill concerns one of our national institutions, the National Library of Ireland, in which I have taken keen interest over the past few years.  When I first assumed office as Minister with responsibility for the arts, one of my objectives was the reinvigoration of the national cultural institutions.  The National Cultural Institutions Act had only been partly enabled.  Two of our most venerable institutions then formed part of the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism.  These were the National Library of Ireland and the National Museum of Ireland, which had over the years come under the aegis of the Department of the Taoiseach and the Department of Education.  I was keen to move both of these institutions out of my Department and make them independent under their own boards.  It never made sense to me that such specialised institutions should form part of a Department and they would be better placed to deliver as statutorily independent entities.  I also sought to avail of the opportunity to provide an environment that facilitated 21st century governance and accountability infrastructure in these institutions.  After much negotiation with staff and the Department of Finance, both the National Museum and the National Library were made autonomous in May 2005 under the National Cultural Institutions Act.  In each case I appointed strong, independent boards.</P>
        <P>There remain some matters to be finalised under the Act, such as export licensing for the National Museum and extending mandatory <Col N="1275"/>deposit for the National Library.  However, I am convinced that the ability of both institutions to discharge their functions has been immeasurably improved with independence and substantial additional resources.</P>
        <P>Within the past year and a half both institutions have made good strides in independent guises.  The National Museum recently opened a new permanent exhibition at Collins Barracks, which deals for the first time with the history of the Irish soldier at home and abroad and in many different uniforms.  This exhibition is entitled &ldquo;Soldiers and Chiefs&rdquo;, an appropriate title for a future Private Members&rsquo; Bill.</P>
        <P>The National Library of Ireland is similarly on a sound footing.  It is currently hosting a seminal exhibition on William Butler Yeats, poet, romantic and distinguished former Member of this House.  Last month the National Library won a major award for the outstanding way in which it informs and involves the public.  The award was from the Association for Heritage Interpretation and it singled out the National Library&rsquo;s current exhibition on Yeats as a magnificent example of the way in which the library interacts with the public. <i> </i>Over 30,000 people have visited the exhibition to date and I exhort Members to make sure they do so.  I congratulate the board, director and staff of the National Library on this success.</P>
        <P>In the case of press publications the National Library of Ireland seems to fascinate in the matter of heraldry and what were dubbed chiefs of the name.  It must be some medieval mystique that attracts people in a constitutional republic to such relics of history.  The Government is not in a position to support Senator Ryan&rsquo;s Bill.  I commend the Senator for the work that he and others have clearly put into the Bill.  While I appreciate his interest in this area of public administration I am unconvinced of the need for this Bill.  Nothing I have heard from the Senator today leads me to believe&mdash;&mdash; </P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash; that there is a need for this proposed legislation and for the elaborate and presumably expensive structures proposed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>There should be some subtlety in the scriptwriting.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>There are not significant issues of public interest that would justify the parliamentary time and administrative resources in my Department required to process this Bill.</P>
        <P>New legislative measures were put in place on 3 May last year regarding heraldry when sections 12 and 13 of the National Cultural Institutions Act came into effect.  These set out what I and my predecessors believed were the appropriate arrangements for the promotion and delivery of <Col N="1276"/>heraldic services.  While it will take time for those new arrangements to fully settle down I have no reason to speculate on their effectiveness.</P>
        <P>The 1997 Act gave the board of the National Library the power to facilitate, encourage, assist and promote the granting and confirming of coats of arms.  The Act also declared that the genealogical office was a branch of the National Library and provided that a member of the library&rsquo;s staff would be designated to perform the duty of researching, granting and confirming coats of arms and would use the appellation Chief Herald of Ireland.  The board of the National Library established the committee on genealogy and heraldry, provided for in section 13 of the 1997 Act, and designated a staff member to use the appellation Chief Herald.  The position had been vacant for two years.</P>
        <P>Through the committee on genealogy and heraldry the board has been reviewing issues relating to the granting of arms, including eligibility to apply for grants of arms, the procedures for granting of arms, the wording of grants of arms, etc.  The Bill attempts to legislate in considerable detail for matters such as this.  Such level of detail is not appropriate to primary legislation.  Having entrusted matters of genealogy and heraldry to the board of the National Library, there is no reason the board should not be allowed to deal with such matters as it has been doing since it was established.</P>
        <P>There has been speculation in the media &mdash; humorous, petulant and otherwise &mdash; as to whether the provisions of the legislation provide an adequate basis for the granting of arms by the Chief Herald.  If this were the case I would expect, as I indicated in a response to a parliamentary question on 7 November, that the board of the National Library would bring any deficiencies in the legislation to my attention.  The board is the statutory body responsible for this particular area and it is best placed to advise me on the appropriateness or otherwise of its statutory framework.</P>
        <P>Regarding genealogy, the 1997 Act assigns limited functions to the National Library.  A number of statutory bodies have responsibility for the management and delivery of genealogical services.  I am not clear as to why a greater role is now envisaged for the National Library in this area rather than any other public body.  I do not see the justification for assigning such significant responsibilities to the National Library.  It would require a considerable level of analysis to see if it would lead to any significant improvement on existing arrangements.</P>
        <P>The Bill proposes an elaborate structure for the delivery of heraldic services.  I am not convinced of the need for such a structure.  There is little merit in the proposal and it is difficult to justify the additional expenditure.  Heraldry is a small specialised area and I am not clear why an elaborate administrative structure might be needed to deal with it.  To create a number of additional <Col N="1277"/>public posts in this area, particularly posts that would require a degree of expertise that may not exist, is difficult to justify.  I am not in a position to sanction the creation of such posts given the current restrictions on staffing in the public service.</P>
        <P>It is proposed that the posts of Chief Herald and Deputy Chief Herald be created within the National Library but with Civil Service status.  This ignores the fact that since the establishment of the board of the National Library on 3 May 2005 professional staff ceased to be civil servants and became employees of the board. The Bill seems to suggest a dual structure where a Chief Herald, who was a civil servant, would report simultaneously to the board of the library and to a Minister of the Government.

	<P>I have concerns about the proposals for the registration and granting of arms.  The constitutionality of the proposal to grant emeritus arms to meritorious individuals requires clarification.  I am not satisfied that the granting of emeritus arms is an appropriate method of recognising meritorious individuals.</P>
        <P>The Bill proposes to grant retrospective confirmation to grants of arms made between 1 April 1943 and the present.  Not only has the need for such a procedure not been established but even if it had, its constitutionality would need to be fully considered.</P>
        <P>The Bill provides for the designation of Gaelic chieftainship in grants of arms.  This is an issue that has arisen previously and led to practical difficulties in determining eligibility regarding use of the appellation of Gaelic chieftainship.  I am not in favour of legislating for this issue and I am of the view that it is a matter for persons styled as Gaelic chiefs to devise procedures that would clarify the line of descent.  I do not see any role for the State in this process and I also must point out the apparent irony and historical contradiction in suggesting that the determinant for Gaelic chiefship is that of primogeniture, the first-born male, when this was not the system used by clans and septs to select Gaelic chiefs.  This is, however, a moot point.</P>
        <P>On the issue of a national vexillogical register, a register of flags, I am unconvinced of the need for such a register.  This is not an area coming under the aegis of my Department at present and I see no compelling case for legislating for it.  The Government would have to be clearly convinced that existing arrangements, such as they might be, are unsatisfactory before it would consider legislation of the extent proposed in the Bill.  I am not clear why this is an area that requires legislative <Col N="1278"/>intervention and I am even less clear as to how the area of vexillogy&mdash;&mdash; </P>

        <P>I thank Senator Ryan for his efforts but I have to say that the newly-appointed board of the NLI must be allowed to fulfil its role and functions in matters related to genealogy and heraldry.  I realise the Senator has worked extremely hard on the Bill and has put much effort into it, which should not go without acknowledgement.  I note what he has stated about the matter resurfacing again if it is voted down, and he is unquestionably correct in that.  Although it is a very specialised area, those concerned with it have a great interest.  As a man said, when they have an opinion, they have an opinion.</P>
        <P>Rather than see the Bill voted down, I would prefer if the Senator agreed, after an informed debate, to withdraw the legislation so the issues raised within the Bill can be considered by the statutory board of the National Library.  I will undertake to go to the board with the legislation and ask it to give the issue very careful consideration.  It would not be right to second guess a new institution so soon after its establishment.  I would like the board to have the opportunity of carefully considering Senator Ryan&rsquo;s Bill.  The Senator may be aware that the chairperson of the National Library is Mr. Gerry Danaher, an eminent senior counsel who may have some ideas from his own background with regard to how matters might proceed.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Although I am not accepting the legislation, I acknowledge the work which has gone into it and the motivation for it.  I know of Senator Ryan&rsquo;s deep interest and understanding of our culture.  D&eacute;anaim comhghairdeas leis an Seanad&oacute;ir ar&iacute;s.

      <Speaker pid="FrankFeighan"><NameTxt>Mr. Feighan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House and I welcome the Bill, which is designed to regularise the delivery of heraldic services by the State.  Up to the point of passing the National Cultural Institutions Act 1997, these functions were performed by the Office of the Chief Herald of Ireland.  When the 1997 Bill was passed, the genealogical office was referred to as a branch of the National Library, although the legislation did not explicitly establish such an office or provide for its functions.</P>
        <P>The Council of Irish Genealogical Organisations welcomes the publication of the Bill and <?oasys _dc18- ?>acknowledges that it would never have reached<?oasys _dc0- ?> this stage without the hard work of Michael Merrigan of the Genealogical Society of Ireland.  The Bill proposes some far-reaching changes which, to use the Bill&rsquo;s own wording, would &ldquo;regularise the delivery of heraldic services by the State&rdquo;.</P><Col N="1279"/>
        <P>We have read in the press over the past few weeks about the issue of heraldry in Ireland and the State&rsquo;s role in it through the Office of the Chief Herald, attached to the National Library.  While some of the coverage was informative, other stories unfortunately did little to make the case for change and seemed only framed at embarrassing the authorities.  I hope the Government&rsquo;s decision not to accept the Bill is not a knee-jerk reaction to unfavourable press statements.</P>
        <P>There appears to be differing views on whether the Office of the Chief Herald, also known as the genealogical office &mdash; which I am finding difficult to pronounce &mdash; was established in such a way as to allow it to grant arms after it was transferred by the British to the State in 1943.  Those who question its status to grant arms rely upon the ambiguity surrounding the royal prerogative in Ireland during the years between 1943 and the establishment of the Republic in 1949.  However, the whole issue is so complicated that whatever is decided through legislation is unlikely to find favour with all.</P>
        <P>Another argument is that there can only be one legitimate authority able to grant arms in Ireland, the State, of which we are all part.  Thus, whether legislatively or not, this responsibility is currently exercised on behalf of the State through the Office of the Chief Herald.  If it should be that the Chief Herald has no responsibility in this area, does it indicate the Chief Herald is currently presiding over what I may term an &ldquo;illegal armed operation&rdquo;?</P>
        <P>To again quote the Bill, it also provides for &ldquo;proper management and co-ordination of the delivery of genealogical services in the State&rdquo;.  There has been growth since the early 1980s of the various county-based genealogical indexing centres across both this State and Northern Ireland, and I saw it as part of the tourism infrastructure in Strokestown, County Roscommon, in the lean 1980s when we had no significant tourism infrastructure.  It was welcome for so many Canadians, Americans and Australians coming to our county to look up genealogical services.  It has been a recognised part of our tourism through the years.</P>
        <P>Very recently the Government has reorganised how it operates Irish Genealogy Limited, the company through which it funds the various indexing centres.  Senators will recall, for instance, that reference to genealogy, in the guise of the General Register Office, has many times over the years been raised on behalf of those annoyed at the lack of proper access to the historical records held by that office.  If this Bill was allowed to progress to the Statute Book, perhaps issues such as the General Register Office might be more adequately addressed.</P>
        <P>The most clear improvement the Bill would make to accessing State records would be to suggest an amendment to the Statistics Act 1993, <Col N="1280"/>which would have the effect of opening the 1926 census returns to researchers.  Currently, the returns for this census are held by the National Archives.  Some might baulk at the idea of opening census data before the completion of a hundred-year period since the taking of the census, but neither the Genealogical Society of Ireland nor the Council of Irish Genealogical Organisations is suggesting that census returns should routinely be opened early.  The issue could be considered.</P>
        <P>In this case the argument relies upon the fact that Ireland&rsquo;s earlier 19th century census records were destroyed in the fire which consumed the Irish public records during the civil war in 1922.  Contrary to popular belief, the 1926 census returns do not include anything like the detail required in modern census returns.  The information recorded is little different to the minimal amount of detail recorded in the surviving 1901 and 1911 census returns.</P>
        <P>Interestingly, those returns were first opened to researchers, without any public objection or demonstration then or since, as early as 1961 on foot of a warrant made by the Minister with responsibility for Justice under the Public Records (Ireland) Act 1867.  This was only 50 years after the 1911 census was compiled.  It is the general view that this Bill, if not ultimately accepted by the Government, should at least stimulate the various authorities to look in greater detail at the State&rsquo;s delivery of heraldic services and access to the State&rsquo;s genealogical records.</P>
        <P>The Bill will provide for the registration and protection of the arms of Ireland such as the presidential standard, flags and the emblems of the Irish Defence Forces and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It reminds me that a few years ago, the GAA had to change its emblem which was not protected.  The Bill provides a template which the State or recognised vendors could work with for marketing.</P>
        <P>The scheme was designed to recognise the enormous contribution made by the Irish diaspora.  We are discussing family names.  For hundreds of years people were called Malone or O&rsquo;Fiachain.  However, they were so engrossed in scraping out a livelihood during difficult times, they did not have time to research their families&rsquo; traditions or ancestors.</P>
        <P>We must welcome the fact that the Irish diaspora got on very well.  For far too long we thought about the people in New York, London, Glasgow and Liverpool.  Through good fortune, some did better financially than others.  However, they are all part of the Irish diaspora and I remind people of that.</P>
        <P>On St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day we spend our time travelling to places deemed to be more successful, such as New York, Chicago and Washington.  Ministers go to Singapore and Sidney.  I do not want to take away from this.  I was very proud to be in Chicago this year.  However, it would be nice to see Irish <Col N="1281"/>Ministers recognising the diaspora in Glasgow, Liverpool and other places which are not as colourful as Sydney or Washington.  We must recognise that people left Ireland in difficult times.  They went to the shipyards on the Clyde and the Tyne and worked in coalmines in Nottingham.</P>
        <P>We consider the Irish diaspora with great pride and recount how well Irish people did in New York and consider those who are presidents of corporations.  I am equally as proud of the people who stand on the terraces in Celtic Park, also known as Paradise, who espouse their love for Ireland.  They may not have the finances to examine their ancestry and the Government should recognise that.</P>
        <P>The Irish diaspora has millions of people throughout the world, all of whom we should recognise and not only the President of the United States.  We should be equally proud of the people who left Ireland during the 1950s and fell on hard times in London and Cricklewood and cherish them as much as those we espouse from platforms on St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day.</P>
        <P>President McAleese was involved in the design of her coat of arms.  The motto of her coat of arms is &ldquo;Come to the Edge&rdquo;, from a poem by Christopher Logue which the President quoted in her inaugural address in November 1997.  Above the shield is a helmet and the crest on top is an oak tree complete with acorns.  It is stated the oak is a reference to the President&rsquo;s association with my county, County Roscommon.</P>
        <P>I commend this Bill to the House and support it.  It aims to make services more accessible to the ordinary citizens of Ireland by creating a new and less expensive procedure for obtaining a coat of arms for individuals, institutions, clubs and corporate bodies.  It will mean sports clubs, schools, societies and others will be able to register a coat of arms and obtain legal protection for their unique heraldic symbols.</P>
        <P>I commend Senator Ryan on promoting the Bill.  It has created a debate in this House.  On many occasions I stated that politicians do not act, they react.  I hope the Minister accepts the Bill.  If he does not, I hope he reacts favourably by ensuring the provisions in the Bill are provided by the State body or otherwise.  I thank all those who helped in this.  We can discuss crests and emblems.  However, on this occasion we should not forget the diaspora, those who left this country and show great interest in our past.  As a State we now show interest in our past.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KieranPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. K. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister for Arts, Sports and Tourism, Deputy O&rsquo;Donoghue to the House.   I am happy to have an opportunity to speak on the proposed Genealogy and Heraldry Bill 2006.</P>
        <P>I listened carefully to the case put forward for the Bill and to the Minister&rsquo;s reply.  The debate thus far has demonstrated the high esteem in which heraldry is held in this House and in <Col N="1282"/>society as a whole.  I see heraldry as very much part of our daily lives.  Many of the sporting organisations I am associated with proudly wear local and county crests on their jerseys as they take the field.</P>
        <P>Through my work on tourism in this House, I have become aware of the great value of our heritage and history.  Much of our tourism could be described as heraldic tourism with huge numbers travelling to Ireland to trace their ancestors and their roots.  As such, I have a high level of respect for those providing such services to members of the public, organisations and institutions.  However, this Bill, although brought to the House with good intentions supporting a noble profession, is unnecessary and would lead to excessive legislation.</P>
        <P>Section 13 of the National Cultural Institutions Act 1997 provides for a genealogical and heraldic service.  During the 20th Seanad, my colleague, Senator Mooney, achieved 28 amendments to the text of the Bill which appeased many concerns of the interested parties at the time of the Bill&rsquo;s enactment.  That Act adequately provides for the heraldic services.</P>
        <P>The 1997 Act established a genealogy office with a chief herald responsible for research.  This office is under the autonomous control of the National Library and I believe this office is more than adequate for the needs of the genealogical field and that additional legislation is unnecessary.  The board of the National Library has not alerted the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism to any deficiencies in the 1997 legislation that may serve to hinder the work of the Chief Herald.  Neither has there been any challenge to the legal basis of the office.  Therefore, I believe that section 13 of the National Cultural Institutions Act 1997 adequately provides a legal basis for the work of the Chief Herald and that this Bill is not necessary in order to protect Irish genealogy and heraldry.</P>
        <P>I thank the Minister for taking time to come to the House to speak on this matter.  I will leave it to my learned colleague, Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute;, to deal with the vexillology register and matters of this kind.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Whatever about heraldry, it is refreshing to discover that the art of prophesy has not vanished from the earth because Senator Kieran Phelan who, I am glad to say, is a representative of one of the distinguished septs of my own part of the country, Ossory, was able to <Col N="1283"/>imagine or prophesy in his typed-up script what Senator Ryan said.  The Minister said on page three of his script or whatever it was &mdash; I pointed it out at the time &mdash; that nothing he had heard today had convinced him.  He had not heard it when the speech was typed up so it is a complete and utter nonsense.</P>
        <P>We are used to this in this House.  We get it on matters relating to Standing Order 29 all the time.  One puts down that one wishes to raise a motion under Standing Order 29 and the Cathaoirleach po-facedly says that he does not believe anything is contemplated by this Standing Order, no matter what it is.  It does not matter whether it was an armed insurrection in Listowel or a volcano in D&uacute;n Laoghaire, it is not contemplated under Standing Order 29.  This is all typed up and written out before we get to the point.</P>
        <P>The Minister is a thoroughly decent man and I have many reasons to be grateful to him and not only for his enthusiastic support of cultural life in Ireland, in particular my own little baby, the James Joyce Centre in Dublin.  The late Terry O&rsquo;Sullivan, who wrote the Dubliner&rsquo;s Diary, after a huge feast of drink went back and snored in the offices of <i>The Irish Press</i>.  Somebody asked him if he was going to write up the column after filling his face with all their food and drink and he said: &ldquo;Let us astonish them by our ingratitude.&rdquo;  I propose to astonish the Minister with my ingratitude and say that was an absolutely pathetic speech.  I do not believe he concocted it himself.  This was obviously a set up.</P>
        <P>There is clearly a case for the proper authorisation of heraldry.  Again, I can perhaps understand the feeling of the Department because this was also concocted by the people in the Genealogical Society of Ireland, and more power to them.  We all get the society&rsquo;s gazette, called <i>The Genie Gazette</i>, which is sometimes very interesting.  It is important we regulate the area for a number of reasons, one of which is the scandal that surrounded the MacCarthy M&oacute;r, which was a dreadful affair.  It was laughable in one sense that this fellow was floating around Tangier with his boyfriend behind him and a poodle on a pink cushion claiming to be the MacCarthy M&oacute;r.  Apparently, the nincompoops over here actually recognised him.  How farcical can one get?  One has to establish something that gets away from this sort of thing.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Donoghue</NameTxt>
	<P>I can tell the Senator that he was not the Kerry MacCarthy M&oacute;r.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>History does not reveal which part of the globe he originated from, but he ended up in Tangier.</P>
        <P>In his speech, the Minister is certainly right about the question of the Gaelic chieftains.  This is a very interesting area because it is so full of contradiction and paradox.  I have a cousin of some kind who is, or styles himself, the<?oasys _jy ?><Col N="1284"/>MacGiolla Ph&aacute;draig.  He is certainly the descendent of the last one that was duly elected as chief of that clan.  It was done by election.  There was a kind of central family stem and from within that, the leader of the family was, more or less, elected.  They were pretty grim in the way they did it.  There are records in my mother&rsquo;s family of people putting out their own brother&rsquo;s eyes because one could not be an Irish chieftain if one was blind.  They made bloody sure they were blind so they could not be elected.</P>
        <P>If one looks at the chiefs that are recognised, many of them belonged to the Church of Ireland.  I find this fascinating.  The MacGiolla Ph&aacute;draig obviously belonged to the Church of Ireland, while the O&rsquo;Hara, the O&rsquo;Grady in Killballyowen and the MacGillycuddy of the Reeks from the Minister&rsquo;s constituency were also members.  Interestingly, the two most wonderful and romantic titles, and, essentially, it is all about romance, are the O&rsquo;Conor Don and the MacDermott, Prince of Coolavin.  Since it is now said that one can make oneself an Irish chief, I think I might do so.  Senator Ross made himself an auctioneer on &ldquo;The Late Late Show&rdquo;.  I propose to award myself a title, which I hope will be recognised and observed by my colleagues in Seanad &Eacute;ireann.</P>
        <P>There is, however, a certain seriousness about the matter, even though it is full of fantasy, fun, vexillology and what not.  There is a legal problem about the granting of coats of arms.  If, as a republic, we decided to abolish the whole thing, this would have been one situation, but we did not.  We then purported to grant arms to people such as President Kennedy, a former President of the US, for the younger members of the House who do not recall that period of history.  President Robinson and the current President McAleese have also been granted coats of arms.</P>
        <P>If one looks inside the Oak Room in the Mansion House in Dublin, one can see all kinds of coats of arms, some of which are the real coats of arms of the ancient Irish or Norman families.  Some of them are completely concocted.  It is very interesting to see them.  It may well be that many of these, especially the grants made to distinguished visiting persons, are challengeable internationally.  We can call them what we like.  The biggest pedants on this matter are the British.  We inherited the system from them in 1943 &mdash; the Ulster King of Arms and so on.  Nobody was appointed for quite a long time, which creates a gap.  One is in a situation where one must abolish and then recreate.  This Bill would be a very good point.</P>
        <P>I thought the Minister was very dismissive about the need for these kinds of records.  I do not think it is appropriate just to have it as a kind of appendage in the National Library that can be dismissed.  I am not denigrating the National Library in this.  Serious historical and scholarly work can be done on coats of arms which reveals interesting things.</P><Col N="1285"/>
        <P>Even though my surname is English, my mother was a descendant of a very old Gaelic Irish family.  I was unearthed because of a more distinguished uncle, who is deceased, by people who asked if there were any relatives and asked to go to the Fitzpatrick Clan rally.  I love and adore any kind of hokum like that.  I attended the rally and poor old Denys in Key West in Florida, who was aged 101 at that stage, sent over a message as the MacGiolla Ph&aacute;draig.</P>
        <P>There were a couple of very interesting lectures, one of which was about the crest which features a green dragon and a lion rampant.  The lecturer on this subject indicated that at various times, the positions and dimensions of these two animals changed.  One could tell the temperature of Irish political life as far as the Gaelic nation was concerned by the relative size and aggressiveness of the two animals, which is very interesting.  The items featured in the coats of arms are often indicators of the family business and connections.  I suppose trade would have been more or less excluded.  I think we in Ireland were much less coy about accepting trade.</P>
        <P>There is a great deal of interest in this and for this reason and no other, it would be very important to consider something such as Senator Ryan&rsquo;s Bill.  Having reprimanded the Minister in a jocose way, I would like to say that was the printed script.  Senator Ryan would, however, be well advised to accept the generous offer the Minister made when he spoke off the cuff and stated that he would, if the Bill were withdrawn, refer the matter back to the people in the National Library who are genuinely interested in it to see what legislative proposals might come about as a result.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Another matter to which I wish to refer is that of recognition of excellence.  Most societies like to recognise excellence and there is nothing very much on offer in Ireland in that regard.  Perhaps we should consider reviving the Knights of St. Patrick, among whose number were a number of the old Irish families, including mine.  I was pleased, when attending a recent concert at St. Patrick&rsquo;s Hall, to see the flag of my family on display.  Reviving the Knights of St. Patrick would be worthwhile.  One could not refer to a member of the Most Illustrious Order of St. Patrick as &ldquo;Sir&rdquo;.  In any event, courtesy titles are not supposed to be used &mdash; I do not believe Mr. O&rsquo;Reilly is aware of this fact &mdash; in a republic.</P>
        <P>I am happy to await the revival of the Gaelic monarchy, if the O&rsquo;Conor Don can be located.  As far as I am aware, such an individual still exists.  I am comfortable enough with the Republic but some recognition of merit would be a useful and decent development, and the taking of action in this regard should be considered.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I wish to spar with Senator Ryan regarding the term &ldquo;vexillogical&rdquo;.  Information regarding this could easily have been included in the explanatory memorandum to the Bill.  The latter should explain things.  Most people do not know what <Col N="1286"/>vexillogical means and the majority cannot even pronounce it.  I am going to be blazingly honest and state that if the word &ldquo;vexillogical&rdquo; had been presented to me on an otherwise blank sheet of paper, I would have been hard put to guess at its meaning.  However, I worked out what it means from the context in which it is used.  As a member of the universal and infallible church which he claims as his own, I have no doubt that Senator Ryan is, as he informed the House, again correct with regard to his definition of &ldquo;vexillogical&rdquo;.  However, that excludes the matter of courtesy.  One would have thought that the latter would have been appropriate in a Bill that deals with heraldry.  As a courtesy to plain, honest, decent, ordinary citizens not yet ennobled by the State, it might have been useful to provide us with a definition of the term.</P>
        <P>I wish Senator Ryan well with the Bill.  Outside of the fun we are having, there is something to be said for regularising the position.  Even if one does not believe in it or is not interested in the romance &mdash; I described it as hokum &mdash; or the history and the important historical elements involved, one must consider the tourism aspect.  The Yanks are obsessed with their ancestry and we can fleece them for the privilege of discovering it, if we have at our disposal the correct machinery.  I am all in favour of the latter.  It is important that we do not make prats of ourselves by handing out coats of arms that could, in the absence of a proper legislative basis, be challenged by our cousins across the water.</P>
        <P>I exaggerated the amount of time the Minister spent discussing the Bill.  I estimate that less than 25% of his contribution was devoted to the legislation, which he dismissed.  The Minster spent his time, as usual, engaging in dreary self-congratulation regarding what has been done for the National Library &mdash; I accept his bona fides in this regard &mdash; and other cultural institutions.  He also highlighted his interest in the Abbey Theatre.  We will spend another day debating that matter because I have tabled a motion in respect of the Abbey.  We should move the theatre not to the docklands but to O&rsquo;Connell Street, where it belongs.  It is appalling that a small cabal of business people and property speculators can sit on the Carlton site and blow a raspberry at the Government and the people.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Everybody knows that if, sadly, the Abbey Theatre cannot remain on its historic site at Abbey Street, where it should be located, it most certainly not act as an anchor in a commercial development and as a little piece of the jigsaw that is the financial services centre.  The Abbey should be for the people of Ireland and it should be located on the main thoroughfare of the capital city.  As a national cultural institution, the theatre should be used to lift the northern axis of our principal thoroughfare out of the oblivion and mire of chip shops and knicker sale rooms into which it has sunk.</P><Col N="1287"/>
        <P>Since the Minister opened the debate on this matter, I am glad to state that I have a motion in respect of it on the Order Paper.  I will be seeking that he come before the House to explain why the Abbey Theatre should not be located in O&rsquo;Connell Street.  While we are at it, perhaps we could arrange some small but significant tribute to Daniel O&rsquo;Connell.  I heard a radio interview the other day in which the Minister, or one of his colleagues in Government, referred to digging up the Manchester Martyrs.  Why is it only the violent tradition of Ireland that is celebrated?</P>

T&aacute; an t-&aacute;dh linn, dar nd&oacute;igh, go bhfuil scol&aacute;ir&iacute; den scoth ag glacadh p&aacute;irte sa d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht seo agus go bhfuil faisn&eacute;is &aacute; cur ar f&aacute;il acu.

Aonta&iacute;m leis an Aire, an Teachta O&rsquo;Donoghue, nuair a thugann s&eacute; c&uacute;lra na ceiste seo d&uacute;inn.  Nil aon amhras faoi n&aacute; go bhfuil r&eacute; &oacute;rga nua &oacute; thaobh cult&uacute;r agus eala&iacute;on i bhfeidhm sa t&iacute;r seo i l&aacute;thair na huaire.

        <P>I wish first to declare an interest.  I am chairman of the Irish Family History Foundation and my former vice-chairman was the late Sir Robert Kidd, who was also the former chairman of the Northern Ireland Civil Service.  My secretary was Paddy &ldquo;Bogside&rdquo; Doherty from Derry.  The reason I mention these individuals is to underline the diversity of interest in the subject under discussion in the context of this Bill.  I do not doubt that the results which come from such a confluence of aspirations, sentiment and philosophy must, of themselves, be rich.  We should bear that in mind in the debate on the Bill lest in some way we may inject a sense of elitism where it should not exist.</P>
        <P>In some ways, such a sense was created by the fact that almost all the emphasis in the debate so far has been on heraldry.  The Bill presented by Senator Ryan also deals with other genealogical <Col N="1288"/>sources, which are quite comprehensive.  Senator Feighan referred to such sources.  I would have expected that this debate would have resulted in a much greater balance.  In saying this, I do not intend to take away from the issue of chieftainship, heraldry or whatever.  I had a friend who died some years ago and the wedding present he generally gave was a combined coat of arms for the two families which always sparked debate about how authentic were the coats of arms.  We felt there was a poetic licence attached to these gifts and that the mottos and coats of arms were intended in some way to boost the morale of the recipients.  One wonders if an element of that attitude does not attach to this debate.  The credibility of continuity has been undermined by some serious recent major cases.</P>
        <P>The initial exchange between Senators Ryan and Norris in this debate was to an extent about semantics.  I do not mean that in a derogatory sense but it accentuates my point that most people outside this House will not watch this debate on &ldquo;Oireachtas Report&rdquo; tonight, even if it is broadcast on the programme, which in a way is sad.  There is an element of elitism in this debate which should not be the case.  When we get down to the semantics we may be promoting that concept about a part of our heritage.</P>
        <P>I watched Senator Ryan&rsquo;s body language while the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, Deputy O&rsquo;Donoghue, spoke and hope that I interpreted him correctly.  He sat up very straight when the Minister rightly praised him.  Senator Ryan deserves the credit not just of this House but of the country for the amount of effort he has put into this Bill.  It is not a Mickey Mouse Bill.  It is well-researched and underpinned by a great degree of sincerity and I compliment the Senator on that.  The Minister took the same view and did not want to see a Bill of this importance and potential end in a vote.  That would only add to the lack of public interest in this subject.</P>
        <P>I would prefer to look upon this debate as another stepping stone towards the acceptance of our heritage and to see the Bill sent to the National Library.  That would not be the end of it.  As Senator Ryan said even if the Bill is voted down today it will almost certainly return because there will be always people outside here who will be interested in the subject.</P>
        <P>The other genealogical sources have been neglected.  There are 40 million people of Irish extraction in North America, most of whom have, or are developing, an interest in their roots, partly because of the position Ireland holds in the world today, not just an economic one, although that is important, but in the areas of culture, sport, literature and so on.  People of the diaspora are proud of their roots and want to trace them.  That area is more relevant than the heraldic element of the Bill.</P>
        <P>Having declared an interest in this matter I feel entitled to expand on the Irish Family History Foundation.  There are 33 centres in Ireland, <Col N="1289"/>North and South.  Both traditions are fully integrated into the project.  All the Catholic Church records have been made available to the foundation&rsquo;s centres, only in this context.  Most of the Church of Ireland records have been also made available and a large section of the civil records have been input on a computer.  Almost 80% of the records have been input and computerised and we have almost concluded this work.  In a matter of months all these records will be accessible on the Internet.  A new pay per view system is being devised between North and South and we are signing the agreement whereby all those records will be available for everybody in the world to access.</P>
        <P>There will not be just a centralised computer database.  The system will bring one back to the local centre, which will encourage cultural tourism.  Senator Ryan may not have been conscious of the extent of that area of genealogical research and service.  We should be careful not to ascribe a quaint historical concept to this by bringing the State in to legislate for it because that is a minefield.  The bodies involved in this area should be open and accountable, and through their scholarship and journals should try to bring more people into consideration.  I salute Senator Ryan&rsquo;s work and appeal to the Minister not to let this Bill drift in a vote but to keep it alive because it has the basis for much greater development.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Irish Genealogical Society for providing information to the Labour Party to help us draft this Bill.  My contribution relies on much of that information.  The legislative basis of this issue was last debated here in 1996-97.  The problem that confronted Members then was whether the Genealogical Office was already established in law and needed to be abolished in its old form before being included in the new legislation or whether the new legislation had to establish the office in law.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>During the debate a suggestion was made that a formula be found to get over these sometimes absurd arguments and notions that the Office of the Chief Herald of Ireland is &ldquo;the oldest office of State&rdquo; and that the &ldquo;Chief Herald of Ireland held his prerogative powers personally like his predecessors the Ulster Kings of Arms since 1552&rdquo;, without any basis in fact.  The wording adopted by the then Minister, Deputy Michael D. Higgins, and his officials was that &ldquo;for the avoidance of doubt, the Genealogical Office is a branch of the National Library&rdquo;.  This was to incorporate the status quo in section 13 (1).</P>
        <P>The Genealogical Society of Ireland strongly holds the view that it was understood when the legislation was adopted that it would be necessary to revisit the issue.  The implementation of section 13 in May 2005 was not the way to proceed.</P>
        <P>There are problems about the legislative basis for the office before the transfer of various functions to the Irish Republic and the payment of <Col N="1290"/>grants to it.  The Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Act 1939 had, as the principal Act, the Ministers and Secretaries Act 1924, which was enacted by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann to facilitate the allocation of various statutory bodies established by either the UK Parliament, or the earlier Irish Parliament, to the new Departments established by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  One can well ask whether this was the appropriate legislation to use in 1943.  The issue arises as to whether the bodies established by royal charter or letters patent which, for the purposes of the Ministers and Secretaries Act 1924, were deemed to be statutory bodies, covered the office of Ulster King of Arms.  There is a strong argument to the effect that it did not.</P>
        <P>The functions of the office of Ulster King of Arms were conferred by letters patent to an individual, usually for life, and not to an institution.  Nowhere in the 1924 or 1926 Act is the position of the royal prerogative in respect of personal letters patent mentioned for the purposes of including same in the legislative or constitutional framework of the Irish Free State.  It is clear, therefore, that the functions and powers of the office of Ulster King of Arms were not capable of being transferred under the 1924 Act and, therefore, likewise under the Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Act 1939.</P>
        <P>It has been argued extensively that the concept of the royal prerogative did not survive the enactment of the 1922 Constitution and its various amendments and, therefore, because it did not exist it was not possible for it to be transferred or inherited by the 1937 Constitution.  There are many more arguments in this regard.  The Government of the Irish Free State could have given itself the power to grant arms through the enactment of legislation but that did not happen.</P>
        <P>The legislative instruments employed in 1943 to give effect to the transfer of the records and treasures of the office of Ulster King of Arms and the subsequent decision to commence the delivery of heraldic services by the State through the issuance of letters patent claiming various rights, etc., were inappropriately applied by the Government of the day.  If that was the case, then legislation should have been enacted.</P>
        <P>Some other matters are also covered by the Bill.  We should get our house in order in terms of the legislation.  Much work is ongoing in regard to a British-Irish protocol on armorial bearings in respect of the mutual recognition of heraldic jurisdiction and the special position of Northern Ireland.  If we get this legislation in place we can work on such issues.</P>
        <P>In addition, the Bill deals extensively with related issues such as genealogy and vexillology &mdash; I hope I have pronounced that correctly &mdash; which, as Senator Ryan indicated, is a constituent discipline of heraldry given to the study of flags and emblems.  This Bill is breaking new ground by incorporating these important aspects of our heritage in legislation, thereby providing for their protection and structured development.</P><Col N="1291"/>
        <P>One of the most important genealogical matters dealt with in the Bill is the proposal for a special heritage category for the first census of population of the Irish Free State.  I looked up some census information this year.  We all get to the stage where we want to find out about our identity and from where we come, etc.  During the summer I did some research on the occurrence of the name &ldquo;Tuffy&rdquo; in counties Sligo, Mayo, etc.  I realised that much documentation is unavailable, although a great deal of information is available on the Internet.  Various bodies do good work in terms of the provision of this information for people who wish to research their Irish heritage.</P>
        <P>The 1926 census returns are an invaluable source for genealogy and social history covering the most turbulent period in modern Irish history.  The new Irish Free State held its first census in 1926 at the height of economic depression and emigration.  This is a most important period of our history.  The 1926 census was closed to public view for 100 years by the Statistics Act 1993, in line with all other census returns taken since 1926.  An amendment to the legislation reduced the period of closure to 70 years.  The Bill aims to keep the 100 year rule for census returns generally, but to make an exception for the 1926 census.  The proposal is to afford the 1926 census a special heritage category and reduce its closure period to 80 years for research purposes to bridge this gap in our records covering this most important period in our nation&rsquo;s history, from 1911 to 1926.</P>
        <P>The United States of America has its 1930 census returns available for research on-line and, similarly, the Canadian province of Newfoundland, which is possibly the most Irish place outside Ireland, has its 1949 census returns open to research.  It is most important that this measure would be taken on board by the Government.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

	<P>I welcome this debate.  We have relatively few debates on cultural and sporting issues in this House.  Therefore, the Minister was quite in order to outline the outstanding achievements in all three areas of his portfolio.</P>
        <P>We should be grateful to Senator Ryan for bringing forward this Bill for discussion.  Like other speakers, I pay tribute to the amount of work he put into it.  He added to my vocabulary <Col N="1292"/>with the proposal for a national vexillological register.</P>

	<P>And to my own as well.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>The modern democratic aspect of heraldry relates to the emblems of civic organisations, clubs, societies etc.  That has its importance.  Senator Ryan gave an interesting history going back to the middle ages.  He missed out the great scandal of the early 20th century, which was the involvement of the Ulster King of Arms, Arthur Vicars, in the disappearance of the Irish crown jewels.  Subsequently, he was killed in 1922 but he was disgraced long before that.  My great uncle who died in 1906 had a fascination with heraldry and was a friend of Sir Arthur Vicars.  Several of his books on heraldry are in my house in County Tipperary</P>
        <P Just="Left">Although I have a coat of arms and a motto, I do not actively use either of them.  My motto is &ldquo;<i>Toujours pr&ecirc;t</i>&rdquo;.  My wife snorts occasionally at it.  One can translate it as, &ldquo;Always flexible&rdquo;.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Mansergh is in the right party.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>Perhaps it might fit.  The State should not get too involved in formalising this area.  The current arms-length relationship through the National Library is probably appropriate.</P>
        <P>I fully endorse what Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; said about family research.  I do not want to belittle it in any way but for many older people tracing ancestors is an absorbing hobby.  I have an Australian cousin who has about 4,000 sheets of paper of various sizes.  I think she can, more or less, claim descent back to the Pharaohs.  It keeps her busy and it has huge tourism potential.  It is harmless.  I believe that if one goes back more than two or three generations one&rsquo;s links with one&rsquo;s ancestors are probably extremely tenuous and vice versa.  I am convinced that probably Brian Boru and Charlemagne had millions of descendants and that may include all of us.  I am not sure how much we can claim reflected glory therefrom.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister has made Senator Ryan a very fair offer, which I hope he will take up, as the proposals contained in the Bill would be thoroughly vetted by the National Library to see what more needs to be done.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I endorse what the Minister has said.  The Government&rsquo;s commitment to the arts is well illustrated by the &euro;700 million allocation for 2007.  In that regard it would be remiss of me not to compliment and thank the Minister for his support for the Wexford Opera Festival and, in particular, the new theatre which will be built in Wexford at a cost in excess of &euro;26 million, which will continue the prime position Wexford holds in the opera calendar worldwide.  I endorse also <Col N="1293"/>what he said about the National Museum, particularly in regard to Collins Barracks.  It is a fine museum as those who visit it will testify.</P>
        <P>As other Senators have done, I compliment Senator Ryan on tabling the Bill and highlighting what is an important topic.  I hope he will accept the Minister&rsquo;s invitation to withdraw the Bill in order that aspects of it can be examined which would enhance what is already on the Statute Book.</P>
        <P>As other speakers have said genealogy is becoming quite an interest for family histories and family trees and is important from a tourism point of view.  In New Ross we developed with a university in Philadelphia the history of those who emigrated from Ireland from the mid-19th century onwards from the manuscripts of the various shipping lines which left Ireland and Liverpool.</P>
        <P>I support the thrust and the sentiments of much of what is contained in the Bill.  I hope the important aspects which threaten what is already in existence will be undertaken.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DonLydon"><NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
	<P>I too support the thrust of the Bill.  When I first read it I thought it was a very good Bill and written by somebody who has an interest in this area as I have.  I can see from where the Minister is coming when he speaks about the committee on genealogy and heraldry as provided in section 13 of the 1977 Act, that there is a Chief Herald and that it is legal.  The only matter on which I take issue with him is the designation of Gaelic chieftainships and grants of arms.  It would be a pity if we lost forever the whole concept of Gaelic chieftainship because there are people like O&rsquo;Conor Don, O&rsquo;Neill, O&rsquo;Donnell, O&rsquo;Brien of Thomond, McDonnell of the Glens, McGillycuddy of the Reeks and so on, who can genuinely trace their ancestry back to when before the Normans came to Ireland.  I do not believe in titles but there would be some way of recognising these people and I believe it could be included in the grants of arms.  </P>
        <P>I welcome the thrust of the Bill.  Whoever put it together had a genuine interest.  I would hate to see it being voted down because we can get what we want by using the committee.</P>

	<P>I thank Senator O&rsquo;Toole for sharing time.  I welcome the Bill and commend my colleague, Senator Ryan, on introducing it.  I hope it will get a speedy passage into law.  I am aware that some people think that heraldry and genealogy is a colonial heritage that we should not value in a Republic.  I could not disagree more.  I believe it is the sort of thing we should value if we are to maintain the nation&rsquo;s heritage.</P>
        <P>Another issue that has been raised is that there is a commercial aspect to it.  There is little doubt that those who emigrated many years ago wish to be able to access the information that is available.  I learned only today that some statute is necessary if legal doubts are to be removed concerning some of the arms that were granted to President Robinson, President McAleese and also to President Kennedy and President Clinton.  We need a <Col N="1295"/>proper department of heraldry and genealogy and a vexillological register.</P>
        <P>Dr. Pat Donlon, who is in charge of the National Library, wrote in 1996 that her long term plans included a dedicated, open access, genealogical reference centre to be housed in the refurbished extension to the National Library into the former National College of Art and Design premises.  I hope the Minister will look again at those plans.  There is a benefit in this for our heritage and a benefit for our traditions as well as a commercial benefit.  I congratulate Senator Ryan on introducing the Bill.  I hope the Minister will find a way to ensure it comes to fruition in whatever manner is the most suitable.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>I am grateful to Senator Ryan for accommodating me.  I line with the contributions from both sides I support the spirit of the Bill but I take cognisance of what the Minister has said.</P>
    <HtmlBk SectId="4" />
        <P FLI="0">I had the honour and privilege of being the Opposition spokesperson when the Cultural Institutions Bill was taken in the House and I became very familiar with the area of vexillology, genealogy and heralds.  The Genealogical Society of Ireland has been at the forefront in this regard.  I was reminded of Margaret Thatcher&rsquo;s famous &ldquo;out, out, out&rdquo; speech when the New Ireland Forum issued its report.  To the three areas that Senator Ryan indicated in his Bill, the Minister has said unequivocally and unambiguously &ldquo;no, no, no.&rdquo;  However, I share his views and those of the Genealogical Society of Ireland about some form of recognition for eminent people in this country.  I had this argument at the time of the previous debate.  Former Senator, Joe Lee, and I mounted a challenge with the then Minister, Deputy Michael D. Higgins, who had fixed his mind in much the same way as has the current Minister about the specific proposal on honours and titles.</P>
        <P>Government generally seems to have some sort of blind spot whenever one discusses these matters, partly because we are in a republic and should not do this.  It is regarded as an anachronism and going back to the old times.  However, I believe we could reach an accommodation in this republic of ours.  It happens in France, which is probably the best example of a functioning republic with a monarchical structure.  I see no reason someone could not devise something similar to the order of St. Patrick.  We have very worthwhile local and national institutions that annually recognise the contribution that ordinary people make in the course of their daily lives.  I attended a function recently in my county and understand it takes place in several other counties.  I refer to the ESB-Rehab Person of the Year award and there are many others.  The <i>Leitrim Guardian</i> magazine, which uniquely is the only magazine in my county published on an annual basis, has a person of the year award.  While all these awards are good and fine, there is an argu<Col N="1296"/>ment for establishing a national scheme for recognition of people, which would in no way compromise our republican credentials.</P>
        <P>I was very anxious to make a modest and limited contribution to the Bill.  As I said at the outset, I empathise greatly with much of its contents.  As Senator Jim Walsh said, I acknowledge what the Minister has said in the firm argument he made against allowing the Bill to proceed.  It is encouraging that he said he would reflect on the points and arguments made here.</P>

	<P>I apologise to my colleagues if I do not mention everybody&rsquo;s contribution.  It is an inevitable consequence of the brevity of my reply.  I do not mean this as a nasty point.  Once we got away from the set scripts we had a very good debate arising from which is something that people may not have known, which is how important the issues are.  Many people here have views.  Whether I or other Senators agree is secondary.  It is clear this is an issue with ramifications that matter to many people.  I have taken the debate in that spirit.  I have many smart remarks about the Minister, which I will leave out.  I will have plenty of opportunities again.  There is nothing inconsistent with a republic having a chief herald.  That proudest of new republics, the Republic of South Africa is the example I would cite.  There is no single model of a republic.  A republic is a democratic state that does not have someone who remains as head of state for life.  After that, provided it is democratic, there is a range of republics.</P>
        <P>While it is not like a politician to say this, I have received enormous compliments for my diligence in drafting the Bill.  I did not draft the Bill, other people drafted it.  If I deserve a compliment it is for introducing it and having the neck to go through with something as complicated and risk the possibility of making a fool of myself in the process.  I deserve no compliment for the detail of the Bill.  It was prepared by people who know considerably more than I do.  However, this is how we should do our business.  We cannot, as Members of the Oireachtas, be experts in every field.  When other people impress us with an idea and their expertise, we should use it and admit it.</P>
        <P>Having said that, a number of matters arose.  Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; spoke about the impending extraordinary event where much of our family history will be accessible on the Internet in a very organised fashion.  When investigating the family history of ordinary people, like ourselves, as distinct from the distinguished families, I am always struck by the sudden terrifying gap in the middle of the 19th century.  In the investigation of family history, there is a sudden staring over the brink of the catastrophe in the middle of the 19th century. <Col N="1297"/> When we sought the history of my grandfather and grandmother in County Tipperary, I found it was easy to go back to the late 19th century.  It was a bit more of a struggle in the early 19th century, but beyond that there is suddenly a gap, which remains deep in our self-conscious.</P>
        <P>I am a chemical engineer, the only engineer in the Oireachtas and the missing engineer on Senator Ross&rsquo;s list, as many Senators will know.  Every chemical engineer in that building over there had to be able to say &ldquo;vexillological&rdquo; before being allowed in.  If Senators believe that they will believe anything.  However, we must get one up on Trinity if we get a chance.</P>
        <P>I was somewhat disappointed in the Minister&rsquo;s response.  There is no point in responding to Private Members&rsquo; legislation with arguments about detail.  The Minister did not address the central issue of whether a sound legal base exists for the issue of arms in the State.  I would like to know what the Attorney General advised the Government in 2002 in this regard.  If advice exists, it is a pity we are not discussing it.  I do not know why the National Library of Ireland has not pursued it.  I know the current chief herald does not believe it.  However, while he may be a fine chief herald, he is not an authority on law and the Constitution.</P>
        <P>Some Senators spoke about our diaspora, which is a legitimate part of it.  We are an extraordinarily diverse people who are spread throughout the world.  We have connections in many countries and the Internet will greatly expand the access that people will have and will want to have to what exists of records here.  This is why one of the Bill&rsquo;s provisions to prevent the improper or illegal export of genealogical records is extremely important.  Within a generation such matters could go from being the stuff of parish records to the sort of items that could sell for large amounts of money at international auctions.  Some great works of art barely sold 100 years ago and are now worth up to &euro;50 million.  We need to ensure we recognise our heritage while we still have it in our hands and before it drifts away from us and is scattered around.  It is a tragedy that the personal papers of some of our great writers are now scattered through half a dozen different universities.  I think of the papers of James Joyce, in particular, that are scattered in a variety of places.  It is a tragedy because when it could have been done it was not done and now that we could perhaps do it we cannot afford to do it.</P>
        <P>I still cherish that one of the more distinguished former members of this House was the<?oasys _jy ?>McGillicuddy of the Reeks.  Senator Norris assured me he insisted on the emphasis being on the first syllable rather than on the second syllable, which is peculiar.  However, the man knows more about pronunciation than anybody else here does.</P>
        <P>There is consensus on pursuing the issue.  It is not an issue on which there is a major party politi<Col N="1298"/>cal divide.  It would be a pity to force it to a vote.  I do not propose to do this because I do not want to embarrass Members who are sympathetic to my intention.  It would be a pity to do so.  I therefore ask the permission of the House to withdraw the Bill.  I accept the Minister&rsquo;s offer to seek the views of the board of the National Library of Ireland on the issues raised and I hope this will be done reasonably expeditiously.  I ask Government Members to pursue the Minister on the question of whether there is a genuine and reliable legal basis for the current issue of arms and whether there is a need for clarification in this regard.</P>
        <P>I thank Members for their contributions to this entertaining and enjoyable debate, which was conducted in good spirit and with little rancour.  I also thank the Government for allowing it to take place in Government time.  This is unusual and I welcome it unequivocally.</P>

        <P FLI="0" el="5">I strenuously opposed this Bill in its entirety on Second Stage.  My opposition grows stronger every day but I chose not to table any Committee Stage amendments because this is a Bill that cannot be improved by amendment.  The only way to improve it is to throw it out altogether and begin considering anew the issues it raises.  I did not receive an adequate response when I made this proposal last week.</P>
        <P>In his speech last week, the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, acknowledged that the driving force behind the Bill are two recent Supreme Court judgments which called into question the legality of the way in which some European legislation was transposed into Irish law over the years.  The Supreme Court effectively decided that for all these years, the Executive exceeded its powers under the Constitution.  It usurped the powers of both Houses of the Oireachtas and consistently abrogated to itself powers that rightfully belong to those Houses.</P>
        <P>It is interesting to note the inevitable reaction of the Executive to being caught out like this.  The Government contends that the Supreme Court, in its usual technical and excessively fussy way, merely accused the State of failing to dot the i&rsquo;s and cross the t&rsquo;s.  This means we must pass a new law giving the State the powers which the Supreme Court says we do not have but which we believed we did.  In other words, the Government&rsquo;s way of fixing a wrongdoing on its part is to make it legal, not only for the future but also retrospectively by validating all the wrongful actions of the past.</P>
        <P>The Government did not for a moment consider the stance it should have taken, which is to acknowledge that the Supreme Court caught it out in exceeding its powers and that it must be careful not to make the same mistake in future.  This is the line that should have been taken but it is not a great surprise that it was not.  Whenever the Executive makes a decision, it is invariably because it suits it rather than that it answers the wider need.  It is for us, as part of the Legislature, to resist this approach all the way.</P>
        <P>This section is perhaps the most regrettable element of the Bill because it abrogates to the Executive the power to create indictable offences by ministerial edict.  This shows up at its starkest the fundamental weakness of the entire project before us.  It may seem elementary to remind ourselves of the basic fact that the reason we have a Legislature is to make law which the Government <Col N="1300"/>then implements.  This is a clear division of powers.  In practice, because the Government dominates the Legislature, it alone has the power to make laws as it wishes.  Bypassing the Legislature is a very different matter and should be resisted every time it is proposed.  On Second Stage, I spoke at some length as to why this important Bill is fundamentally bad legislation.  As we consider this section, it might be worthwhile to revisit some of what I said on Second Stage.  I hope Members have thought further about the important issues at stake.</P>
        <P>What is not at stake is the value of our EU membership or that Ireland has benefited hugely from it.  I am well aware of the negotiating principle of when in doubt, bang the table.  The Minister&rsquo;s equivalent is when his argument is weak, play the EU trumpet.  There is no difference between me and the Minister in our fundamental enthusiasm for the EU or in the determination that Ireland should live up fully to its responsibilities and obligations of membership.  I part company with the Minister on the respective roles that should be played by the EU, national governments and legislatures.</P>
        <P>It is commonly accepted that one of the EU&rsquo;s fundamental problems is its perceived distance from its citizens.  This is not just an image problem with practical consequences.  With more of our lives dominated by matters at EU level, it is important that people feel personally involved with the institutions and they are interested enough to monitor the EU&rsquo;s day-to-day decision-making processes.</P>
        <P>There are many obstacles to making this a reality.  One is the relative influence on the EU decision-making process exercised by officials rather than by politicians who have a mandate.  I refer not just to the Brussels bureaucracy which I described on Second Stage as the most maligned civil service in history &mdash; the Official Report quoted me as saying &ldquo;most malign civil service&rdquo;, the fault for which was probably in my diction or perhaps it was a Freudian slip on somebody&rsquo;s part &mdash; but also to the part played by Irish officials in the day-to-day interface between the individual member states and the European Commission.  Much of the decision making on EU affairs is taken by and between officials, with politicians coming in at the last minute to rubber stamp and add some finesse to the decision.  I refer to the bread and butter EU decisions rather than the headline issues aired at EU summits.</P>
        <P>Added to this, the European Commission has the sole right of initiating EU legislation.  There is already a system that is overbalanced in favour of officials to the detriment of an input from those who have been elected.  Against this, there are several valuable safeguards.  We must resist having them diluted as this section seeks to do.</P>
        <P>The most important safeguard involves the role of national parliaments.  These are closer to the people of their countries than a bureaucracy based in another country.  In the soul searching <Col N="1301"/>carried out following the rejection of the first Nice treaty, the Oireachtas adopted a raft of measures to increase scrutiny of European legislation that was until then passing into our law unnoticed.  In the discussions which gave rise to the EU constitution, a prime consideration was increasing and deepening the role of national parliaments in the overall European process.  This section flies in the face of this.  It is possible to argue that it provides for efficiency by replacing primary legislation with the simpler process of a statutory instrument in the form of a ministerial order.  I argue against these provisions on the grounds of openness and transparency.  We must increase rather than dilute the amount of EU business that is carried out in the full light of day.  Ministerial orders, in practice, are invisible.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>I respect the cogent, thoughtful and detailed contribution made by Senator Quinn.  Under section 2, I understand the Government will not initiate indictable offences.  This section relates to the European Communities Act 1972 which brought Ireland into the EEC.  The Bill is a result of a Supreme Court judgment relating to penalties imposed on two fishermen in County Donegal.  Will the Minister of State clarify the issue of the maximum fine?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Quinn&rsquo;s contribution was a reiteration of a Second Stage speech.  He spoke about the transparency of the scrutiny of EU legislation but I could not make out his point on the section.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelTracey"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
	<P>The terms defined in the Bill reflect the close interdependence that exists between national and EU law at this mature stage of our EU membership.  All too often legislative terms employed in EU legislation are accused of being deliberately opaque.  That is not true.  The process of law making from its inception in Brussels to the implementation at national level still remains poorly understood even though we have been successful EU members for more than 30 years.  Constant allegations are made that EU proposals could be processed without any political input, a charge repeated on Second Stage.</P>
        <P>It is not the case that there is any lack of political input when decisions are being arrived at in the EU.  Politicians, not officials, take the <Col N="1302"/>decisions.  The Commission is vital in ensuring a level playing field.  It proposes, discusses, debates, assesses the challenges and complaints from European citizens and examines the requirements of various governments and the debates at European Council level.  Following that, it is charged with the responsibility of creating a legislative working document which is then debated through the political process.  At no time has the Commission the power to take decisions; it only has the power to initiate work to be done.  We work on that basis.</P>
        <P>European Community law-making is an intensely political process involving the governments of the member states, which carry with them their respective democratic mandates, and co-decision with the European Parliament.  EC law goes through an elaborate and usually lengthy process which has crucial political input at all key points.  It is often mistakenly assumed that decisions are taken by officials or by the European Commission.  This point was inferred by a number of Senators last week but it is not how things work within the Union.</P>
        <P>Under the European treaties, the Commission has the right to make proposals for legislation and only a very limited law-making power on a basis delegated by the Council.  The Commission&rsquo;s role is important in ensuring that proposals are designed to serve the collective European interest and not the interests of individual member states.</P>
        <P>The main EU decisions are made in the Council of Ministers where Ireland is invariably represented by Ministers or Ministers of State acting on behalf of the Government.  In Ireland, the National Forum on Europe regularly debates European issues.  Ministers, especially the Minister for Foreign Affairs and I, regularly attend meetings of the Joint Committee on European Affairs to debate proposals from the General Affairs and External Relations Council and other European Councils.  All aspects of these proposals are discussed in general and in detail.  There is cross-fertilisation of ideas and responses and we leave those meetings armed with the knowledge of what our legislators require of us in making decisions.</P>
        <P>We go to the Council meetings, therefore, with the back-up of our officials, diplomats, officials in Brussels and civil servants in Ireland and in the Attorney General&rsquo;s office.  All these support us and ensure that what we do is constitutionally and legally correct and is fair and equitable for the people of Ireland.  These officials operate in a supporting role and do not take decisions.  It is only when a proposal reaches the ministerial level that it can be adopted by the Council of Ministers.</P>
        <P>With regard to some of the points raised concerning section 2, including those raised last week, I explained last week that this section will give Ministers of the Government the power to create indictable offences in regulations made pursuant to the European Communities Act 1972 <Col N="1303"/>where the Minister deems such a sanction necessary for more serious breaches of EC law.  Some Members expressed concern at the perceived high levels of the penalties provided for, namely, a maximum fine of &euro;500,000 and a maximum term of imprisonment of three years.  Other complained that the scope of the power being given to Ministers was very wide-ranging.</P>
        <P>Two points should be made.  First, the penalties cited are the maximum penalties under the Bill.  These will not be included in every regulation.  In practice, many regulations adopted to transpose EC measures will continue to provide only for summary offences.  The level of penalty will need to match the seriousness of the offence.  The main point that must be borne in mind is that the European Commission proposes, the European Council makes decisions and we, as members of the Union, are obliged to accept those decisions and implement them in our domestic law.  On the principle of subsidiarity, it is the legislators of this Parliament who make the decisions on what penalties are to be applied and what regulations are to be implemented through statutory instruments or whatever mechanism.  We make those decisions on the basis of the power given to us under the Constitution and pursuant to the 1972 Act.</P>
        <P>I can offer some examples.  The Sea Pollution (Amendment) Act 1999 provides for penalties of &euro;10 million and-or five years&rsquo; imprisonment.  Under the Veterinary Practice Act 2005, penalties of &euro;320,000 and-or ten years&rsquo; imprisonment are provided for.  Under the Animal Remedies Act 1993, a person who has in his or her possession a prohibited remedy or an animal which has been administered such a remedy is liable on a first offence to a fine of &euro;100,000 or ten years&rsquo; imprisonment or both.</P>
        <P>The Oireachtas passed that legislation.  We are capping penalties in European legislation at &euro;500,000 and a maximum of three years&rsquo; imprisonment.  On the principle of subsidiarity and taking account of our responsibilities, therefore, we are capping the powers that Ministers have to make regulations on all those issues even though other legislation permits much greater penalties.  The penalties in this Bill of a maximum of &euro;500,000 fine and up to three years&rsquo; imprisonment &mdash; and the courts will make the decision on the actual fine and the term of imprisonment within those limits &mdash; are not especially excessive when compared with other legislation.</P>
        <P>If we are to live up to our obligations, we must be in a position to provide for more stringent penalties where these are necessary.  In some cases, it is necessary to provide for indictable offences to give proper effect to certain aspects of EC law.  Indictable offences will only arise where this is necessary to ensure that we can provide for sanctions which are effective, proportionate and dissuasive.  There is no point having legislation and penalties unless they dissuade <Col N="1304"/>citizens from breaking the law.  There is a deterrent and people know what the impact will be if they break the law.  That does not mean people will not break the law but their chances of breaking the law are lessened when the penalties are enforced.</P>
        <P>Legislators have the power to put these penalties into practice, and it is critical that we do so.  We are bringing uniformity to the maximum power, on the principle of subsidiarity, that we are transferring to our Ministers to make statutory instruments and secondary legislation.  We are capping and restricting the power of Ministers and I have no difficulty with that position.</P>
        <P>The European Union has evolved significantly in the past three decades.  This means that the range and scope of EC law has increased.  Many such laws have far-reaching objectives to which member states must give full legal effect at national level.</P>
        <P>The maximum levels of the penalties have been set following careful consultation on what is necessary to implement EC law properly and a review of practice in other countries.  In some cases, more stringent penalties will be required.  Ministers in these cases will have to provide for such penalties either in existing legislation already approved by the Oireachtas which provides for such penalties or, if no such legislation exists, Ministers will have to propose new legislation which will be fully debated by the Oireachtas.  We are satisfied that the levels of penalties are reasonable and equitable.</P>
        <P>Second, in this Bill the Minister will only have a limited power to make provision for indictable offences where this is necessary to meet our treaty obligations.  In such cases, the Minister will need to operate within the parameters laid down in section 2.  In this case, &ldquo;necessary&rdquo; means precisely what it meant in 1972 when the Oireachtas gave Ministers powers to take the actions required nationally to give effect to our EC obligations.  This requires Ministers to make a careful assessment of what is required of us nationally to transpose a specific EC measure into domestic law.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>There are safeguards. The courts, in a number of important cases, have reviewed the manner in which the State implements EC law by way of secondary legislation.  The courts have outlined in these cases that there are parameters which must be respected when implementing EC law by way of secondary legislation.  Essentially, secondary legislation should only be used where the EC measure sets out in sufficient detail the principles and policies to be implemented.  If this has not been done, the courts have indicated that in those instances, primary legislation should be used.  Thus, Ministers&rsquo; decisions when implementing EC measures will ultimately be subject to challenge in the courts, which are key arbiters on our precise legal obligations under the treaties.</P><Col N="1305"/>
         <P>I pay tribute to Senator Quinn, as a committed European and national politician, for the contribution he is making in this debate.  On behalf of all our colleagues I congratulate him on being elected chairman of EuroCommerce, an important body in the EU.  It is important that we fulfil the goal of the EU, the Single European Act, the thrust of European law and the ethos of the union, that is the mobility of goods, services and people.</P>
        <P>Ireland has a critical responsibility to fulfil its obligations as a member state under the EU directives past and future.  To ensure we have an administratively and legally effective solution we ask this House to ratify this legislation, taking into account the fact that we already did so in 1972 and that we have acted fairly and successfully in implementing European law.  However two cases under the Common Fisheries Policy, taking into account the secondary legislation the Supreme Court debated, make it mandatory that we as legislators bring our law up to date so that there is no doubt about the capacity of Ministers to make statutory instruments and secondary legislation to execute our obligations as members of the EU.  On the principle of subsidiarity and equality we must ensure it is administratively effective, legally correct and uniform in its application and that we are capping the powers Ministers can have today and tomorrow in the exercise of those serious legal duties.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
        <P Just="Center">SECTION 3.</P>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 4, lines 38 to 45, to delete subsection (2).</P>
        <P FLI="0">What I have just heard from the Minister of State in response to Senator Quinn&rsquo;s earlier intervention goes a long way towards supporting my amendment.  If we want to keep Europe relevant and real and ensure our part in the European project continues strongly, we must ensure we do not distance the people of this country from the European institutions, all matters flowing from them and European legislation.  Although the Minister of State&rsquo;s speech was an extraordinary <i>tour de force</i>, I question its relevance to the man or woman on the street.  While it is politically proper, this use of the jungle of jargon of European language can make the citizen of Ireland and Europe feel distant from the European political process.  Notwithstanding the necessity of the legislation before us, it is crucial that it is dealt with through primary legislation.  My amendment reflects our disquiet at the ease with which statutory instruments would become the norm rather than the exception.</P>
        <P>In the aftermath of the defeat of the first Nice treaty we had a major debate.  Some good came from it as certain measures were introduced to <Col N="1306"/>try to deal with the situation caused by the defeat of the Nice treaty.  We all, including Deputy Treacy in his ministerial capacity, agreed that we had to include the citizen to the maximum extent and that no matter what measure was coming from Europe, a major one such as the constitutional treaty or a minor directive, the citizen had to be part of the process.  The free use of statutory instruments to transpose European regulations and directives goes against the spirit of what we all agreed two, three or four years ago.  It goes against the spirit of the progress we made by the introduction of the Sub-Committee on European Scrutiny.  It goes against the spirit of the public meetings we have had across the country on the EU constitution.  If that good work is to be fruitful and effective we must ensure we use the parliamentary process to the full, not in a minimalist, rubber-stamping fashion.  That is why I submit to the Minister of State that primary legislation rather than statutory instrument must be to the fore in the European project from an Oireachtas perspective.  I hope the Minister of State considers my comments positive and helpful.  We can win votes at Oireachtas level, but as we saw in the Nice treaty vote, unless we can make people feel part of the project the Leinster House ship may travel in a different direction from the rest of the populace.  Fully debated legislation going through both Houses must be the rule rather than the exception.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand where Senator Bradford is coming from.  We have spoken at length in this House and at the Joint Oireachtas Committee on European Affairs on the transparency necessary to implement regulations and EU law.  I welcome the fact that the Minister of State has noted our concerns, has responded accordingly and will ensure statutory instruments will not be implemented in a dictatorial fashion but will reflect the public.  The public wants to know when there are directives out there and when they are implemented.  When EU laws impact on domestic law we must take cognisance of the need for transparency.  I accept the Senator&rsquo;s concern, and the Minister of State has also accepted it and has reassured the House that it will be considered when he has to implement any regulations that are part of EU law.  I have no doubt the Minister of State will take that into account.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>While I appreciate Senator Ormonde&rsquo;s words and I am convinced the Minister of State intends that, he is Minister of State for the moment.  We are passing legislation that gives a future Minister the opportunity to introduce statutory instruments instead of primary law.  The Minister of State has correctly described it as more &ldquo;effective&rdquo;.  While it will be effective, it will not fulfil Senator Bradford&rsquo;s aim of bringing citizens closer to the European idea.  Subsidiarity, about which the Minister of State has spoken, is <Col N="1307"/>weakened as we avoid primary legislation and permit statutory instruments.  The Nice treaty failed here but we managed to get it through the second time.  In France and the Netherlands they turned down the constitutional treaty, and various explanations were given but I believe it was because the citizens were removed from central Europe.  This closeness to the citizens is in danger of being damaged as we pass legislation that is not open to the full glare of publicity.  Here and in the rest of Europe, every time we pass legislation by statutory instrument instead of primary legislation that passes through the Houses of the Oireachtas, we give the Minister the possibility to pass legislation that is not noticed.  It is the wrong way and we should reconsider it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>I have much sympathy with the argument that is being made.  During Second Stage and on previous occasions I have argued that there is a vacuum in the relationship between the Executive and the Oireachtas on European matters.  I appreciate that the constitutional treaty was going a long way to tidying up many of these deficiencies and Senator Quinn referred to a strengthened role for national parliaments.</P>
        <P>I wondered why there are references to EC and EU.  One learns something new every day.  I am grateful to officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs for explaining this to me.  They have been deservedly acknowledged in the past and their ability to weave their way through EC law is legendary.  When one refers to laws, one uses the term European Community.  When one refers to external matters, the term is the European Union.  Why does this confusion exist?  We should not be surprised the public is confused about what is happening in Europe when two descriptions refer to it.  The draft European constitution will address this and perform a housekeeping role on matters such as these.  The constitutional treaty addresses many abstract issues that cause such confusion.  Senator Ormonde has expressed this in her contributions as spokesperson on European affairs in the Seanad and in the Forum for Europe.  Why should we be surprised that half the country does not vote on matters regarding Europe?</P>
        <P>I will continue to make the point as long as I am a Member that I do not understand why this House is not used in a more efficient manner for European legislation.  The Administration should use this House and the expertise contained in it.  The Minister of State is the latest in a long line of Ministers who have dutifully acknowledged the expertise in the House.  The House has the structure, membership and time required because it is a less adversarial Chamber than the other House.  It can debate matters in a non-confrontational manner, as seen earlier on the Genealogy and Heraldry Bill.  I hope the momentum encouraging the people to vote for the draft EU constitution might include a sideways glance at the continuing <Col N="1308"/>role of this House, placing us in the scheme of European primary legislation on directives.  Senator Quinn has advised that issues regarding this Bill are effected through statutory instruments and regulations that are not passed by either House of the Oireachtas.  The Executive proposes and the Executive disposes.</P>
        <P>I have confidence in the Minister of State and whoever will represent the Government in EU matters.  This House could be used as a Second Stage Chamber.  Legislation to be transposed into Irish law could be debated by this House.  We could identify its flaws.  This would not be for our sense of ego or because we are wonderful people to discuss EC law.  The general public could then find out about the detail and minutiae of EC law.  Thank God for Jimmy Walsh and <i>The Irish Times</i> because I would not like to rely on other national newspapers to be informed of what goes on in this House.</P>
        <P>I nail my colours to the mast on this issue.  I am not critical nor do I seek to upset the apple cart.  I propose an argument that would enhance accountability and transparency of EC law.  It would also give an opportunity to the public, who we expect to be knowledgeable about the draft EU constitution, to understand what EC law comprises.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelTracey"><NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
	<P>I sincerely thank all Senators for the focused contributions.  Senator Bradford asked what ordinary citizens would think of this situation.  We can be guided by available information.  According to the last European barometer poll, 87% of Irish citizens were positively in favour of the EU.  Some 50% had a strong interest in the EU and 30% were committed to engaging with EU issues.  We were pleased that we led EU countries in this table.</P>
        <P>The citizen is part of the process and we as Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas are representatives of the citizen.  The Sub-Committee on EU Scrutiny, comprising legislators, also represents citizens.  The European Parliament, the largest and most democratic parliament in the world, is directly elected and represents the citizens of the European Union.  By direct decision of the Council, or by co-decision with the Parliament, decisions are taken on a democratic basis after an average of three years&rsquo; gestation, discussion and debate.  At the Council of Ministers and in partnership with the Parliament a consensus is reached on directives.  This is then sent to the Oireachtas, the representatives of the citizens, to ensure it legislates for the decisions taken.</P>
        <?oasys _cl11.5- ?><P>Member state governments have a democratic mandate.  Europe is a reservoir of democracy in global terms and all member state governments represent citizens.  This Bill is about the implementation of EC law, initially at European level.  On the basis of subsidiarity and membership of the EU, our citizens expect us to take account of the unique character of European law.  It is initiated by the Commission and negotiated <Col N="1309"/>under various treaties, councils and in the European Parliament.  It is ultimately agreed that it is mandatory on us, as legislators and as Government of a member state, to implement decisions in tandem with others on the basis of subsidiarity, taking into account our constitutional position and the peculiarities of various sectors of society, the economy and the social partnership agreements.  Legislators have the ability to pass laws that are equitable and fair, even-handed and balanced and to ensure that penalties proposed are effective, dissuasive and proportionate.  That is the purpose of the Bill.</P>
        <P>Section 3(1) will permit Ministers to make regulations to give effect to EC law under the power already granted by the Oireachtas in domestic legislation.  This is a perfectly reasonable provision which serves to avoid unnecessary duplication of legislation.  Prior to the Browne and Kennedy judgments, it was thought possible to use a domestic regulation-making power for the purposes of giving effect to EC law, provided that it fell within the parameters of the particular domestic Act.  The secondary legislation should be linked to the primary Act.  In this case the original legislation of 1959 was passed prior to 1972 and the secondary legislation was passed in 1998.  The Supreme Court struck it down based on the doubt surrounding the link between the three.  On that basis we must revisit it and ensure the link is clarified and given the full force of the law.  Consequently, we are debating it to ensure the legislation can stand the test.  When penalties are enforced they should be legislatively powerful and operable in this jurisdiction.  The Supreme Court held that such domestic regulation-making powers were not available for the purposes of giving effect to EC law unless the domestic legislation explicitly provided that it could be used for the purpose of implementing EC law.  Prior to 1972, nobody could have created a situation under the Constitution whereby we would pass laws that would conform and adhere to the European Union.  We presumed the 1972 Act would do that but we have found as a result of a Supreme Court decision in two cases that this was not so.</P>
        <P>Consequent to that it behoves us as legislators to rectify the matter and ensure the legalities are clarified and perfected.  This would mean the components of law, be they European directives, domestic law, secondary legislation or statutory instruments, have the force of law which is full, legal, operable, acceptable to the Supreme Court and fair to the citizens of the land.  It is therefore necessary to make explicit provision for domestic powers to be used for the purpose of implementing European Community law.</P>
        <P>In 1972, the Oireachtas gave Ministers the power to give effect to European Community measures through statutory instruments.  At that time the Oireachtas indicated that Ministers, in <Col N="1310"/>making such regulations, could amend other legislation, including primary legislation, when necessary for the purposes of giving effect to the European Community law in question.  This was required because of the primacy given by people to European Community law when they passed a constitutional amendment in 1972 which enabled us to accede to the European Community.</P>
        <P>Section 3(2) replicates what is already contained in the 1972 Act with regard to regulations made for the purposes of implementing European Community law.  As the new power will be used for dual European Community and national purposes, it is necessary to replicate the provision existing in the 1972 Act allowing regulations made for the purposes of giving effect to European Community law to amend legislation, including primary legislation, where necessary.</P>
        <P>What is being proposed is no more than what was already provided for in the 1972 Act, although its remit is more extensive on this occasion.  It is worth noting that section 3(2) is limited in its scope.  It cannot be used to amend this Bill, the 1972 Act or the relevant section of the primary legislation being used to create the statutory instrument.  The constitutional validity of this approach was accepted by the Supreme Court in the Meagher <i>v.</i> Minister for Agriculture case.</P>
        <P>There are safeguards in place and a Minister can only use existing primary legislation to give effect to a European Community measure if the existing primary legislation relates in whole to the subject matter of the European Community measure.  For example, a Minister cannot use the Institutes of Technology Act 2006 to give effect to a European Community measure on water quality, as it is not permissible to jump from one to the other.</P>
        <P>However, it makes no sense if a Minister could not use, for example, an existing Act dealing with water quality to give effect to a European Community measure on the same subject.  There would be cohesion, parallelism, linkage and commonality.  On such a basis, it would be practical and sensible to ensure the legislation and the right to create secondary legislation is allowable under the Act.</P>
        <P>This section will correct this anomaly and allow primary legislation which has been fully debated by the Oireachtas to give effect to relevant European Community measures which cover the same subject matter as the existing legislation.  As outlined earlier, the courts have set out the parameters within which it is acceptable to use secondary legislation to implement European Community measures.  According to the courts, in some instances it will not be appropriate to use secondary legislation and primary legislation will be required.  Ministers are always subject to the review of the courts when using secondary legislation.  I ask the House to accept the section as <Col N="1311"/>laid down and I regret I cannot accept the amendment so generously tabled and well debated by the Senator, and so well supported by the House.</P>

        <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 4 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I oppose section 4.  We have the advantage of the helpful advice received from the Minister of State&rsquo;s office of his views on our amendments.  The Minister of State expressed surprise that I oppose this section.  He recounted my comments made last week that we must respond to the Supreme Court judgment, which we do.  However, needing to respond to the Supreme Court judgment and how we respond to it are different matters.</P>
        <P>In a recent Supreme Court case, a written submission was made but not argued orally in court concerning the retrospective nature of the type of statutory instrument mentioned in section 4.  On November 28, the Supreme Court judgment found against the appellants.  This is my concern about section 4, namely, the retrospective nature of what we are attempting.  Obviously, the Government and the Minister of State must respond once the Supreme Court adjudicates, but how we respond is what is being debated in respect of this amendment.  This effort to put everything in order retrospectively, to correct <Col N="1312"/>with one stroke of the pen difficulties which would have arisen and to make right issues which may have been wrong, is something about which we must be concerned.</P>
        <P>The power we are giving the Minister of State and the Government through the introduction of section 4 is excessive and is not the only necessary response to the Supreme Court judgment.  If Members excuse the pun, it is certainly a rush to judgment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>I would again be grateful for the Minister of State&rsquo;s clarification on this.  I was of the opinion that because the issue of validation arose on Second Stage, the Minister of State went quite a long distance in explaining the reasons.  Am I correct in saying that apart from section 2, it also formed the core of the Bill in that it relates to the validation of certain statutory instruments?  Irrespective of and despite my earlier comments about the processes of statutory instruments, this Bill is essentially about where statutory instruments are implemented because there is an obligation on the Government under primary legislation already in place to give effect to what would be the obligations of our membership, for example, in respect of indictable offences and maximum fines.  That is, essentially, what this section is about.  I would again be grateful for the Minister of State&rsquo;s clarification.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Bradford&rsquo;s proposal.  The questions of retrospection and validation of a statutory instrument are clear in this. <Col N="1313"/> I am opposed in principle to the effect of the statutory instruments being used.  I know Senator Ormonde has already accused me of making a Second Stage speech on this matter.  However, the truth is that ministerial orders are, in effect, invisible.  They are stealth legislation and are not subject, in practice, to any scrutiny and rarely, if ever, raise themselves above the parapet and into public visibility.  There is a place in the overall scheme of things for ministerial orders and statutory instruments, but we should be very careful about what we send into this realm because, in effect, what we are doing is giving up accountability and consigning the matter into the outer darkness of invisibility.  Ministerial orders are very popular because, in my experience, many officials have a horror of getting involved in the legislative process and much prefer to do it when they only have an audience of one.</P>
        <P>The net effect of this Bill as a whole will be to make it possible for a European legislative proposal to pass through the entire process, from conception until promulgation into law, without the benefit of any political input.  Section 4 states that &ldquo;Every statutory instrument made before the passing of this Act . . . shall, in so far as it purported to give such effect, have statutory effect as if it were an Act of the Oireachtas.&rdquo;  It is the very principle of this which worries me because I believe what we are doing is incorrect.  It will certainly be effective in making legislation work but it will not bring our citizens closer to the European Union.  This is what we should be aiming to do at the same time.  I support Senator Bradford in his effort to replace this section.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>I would hate to think our Minister of State is not accountable, which seems to be the implication of what has been said.  It appears to imply that statutory instruments give the power, as opposed to the introduction of secondary legislation, which would give the power to the Houses of the Oireachtas in respect of implementing any EC law.  I would hate it if the Minister of State were unable to overcome that problem and if he were to say that it gave him such power that he was no longer accountable.  That is not what this section is about.  I am reading it and am glad the Minister of State has written it down to clarify the position.  I think he knows exactly what he is doing by making his statement.  It is too loose otherwise.  He could not possibly make a statement in the House which could be interpreted as his saying that he is not accountable, that any EC regulations introduced are not transparent and that he has the power to ride roughshod over everybody.  I could not stand over that and I have no doubt that this is not the Minister of State&rsquo;s intention, but I will let him speak for himself.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelTracey"><NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
	<P>This is again a very interesting debate for which I thank all the Senators involved.  Last Thursday and again today, Senator <Col N="1314"/>Bradford clearly stated that he fully accepts the necessity and urgency of this Bill and I think all Senators accept this, which I appreciate.  Senator Bradford stated that the Supreme Court judgements needed to be responded to.  This has been the theme of my speeches from both last week and this week.  Despite this, Senator Bradford now proposes to remove from the Bill one of its essential elements, which is the very provision that responds to and seeks to deal with the consequences of the Supreme Court judgements.</P>
        <P>This section aims to remove uncertainty and doubt about the status of the secondary legislation affected by the Supreme Court judgements.  The desirability of doing so was widely acknowledged last Thursday.  When passed, this section will confirm the validity of the hundreds of statutory instruments, while at the same time protecting the constitutional rights of our people.  Again, we must have balance.  We protect the validity of the statutory instruments and also protect the constitutional rights of our people.  The Legislature must respond to the Supreme Court decisions and we, as legislators, are doing so in this Bill.</P>
        <P>It seems irresponsible for the Government and the Houses of the Oireachtas to require every one of the hundreds of those regulations to be remade, re-enacted and debated again.  We would have a current debate on historic situations that had been part of our corpus of legislation over the years.  This would seem to be a waste of parliamentary time and legally unsound.  After all, they were adopted in good faith on the assumption that Ministers were perfectly entitled to use domestic legislation to give effect to EC law.  It was accepted by everybody &mdash; lawyers, legislators and the populace at large &mdash; that this was the proper thing to do.  Section 4 seeks to validate those regulations and confirm the aspirations and beliefs of all the different parties to all these legislative situations, be they our citizens, legislators, lawyers or our Governments.</P>
        <P>The Supreme Court in Browne <i>v</i>. Attorney General and Kennedy <i>v</i>. Attorney General held that a regulation-making power could only be used to give effect to EC law where it specified this as one of its purposes.  I highlighted the specific timelines which had given rise to this problem in the case brought by that fisherman prosecuted under an order in 1998 made under an Act passed in 1959 to give effect to treaty obligations we undertook when we joined the EC in 1973.  In this legislation, we are tying all the periods and legislation together.  We are giving validity to all the Acts to have secondary legislation attaching to them and taking that into one commonality of EC law that under such law, this Act copperfastens the initial decisions and legislation passed in the European Communities Act 1972.  We are bringing all this together to have clarity and full legality and force of law, which is very important.</P>
        <P>This Bill is intended to ensure uniformity in our mechanism for meeting our EC obligations and <Col N="1315"/>to end any uncertainty regarding measures introduced over the past 33 years.  It does so by importing into every existing domestic regulation-making power the ability to use that power for the purpose of giving effect to EC law where the instrument of EC law falls within the scope of the Act in question.  It is very clear.  We are engaged in a serious legal brick-building exercise.  We have the baseline of the Constitution of the country, under which we brought in the European Communities Act 1972 Act.  We also have the baseline or common European directives passed by the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament.  Linking the two, on behalf of the citizens of Ireland, is this new Bill, which grants power to ensure that the primary Acts of Parliament passed over the centuries and also the statutory instruments and secondary legislation created are accepted in law by the courts as legal instruments, connect with European directives and conform with the Constitution.  We are doing no more and no less.  This represents good law making.</P>
        <P>Section 4 is required to validate any regulations which may have been made under purely domestic regulation-making power but which give effect to European Union law within the scope of the Act in which the power appears.  The regulations being validated come within the ambit of the power to make regulations which was already granted by the Oireachtas, save that the Oireachtas did not specify that the power could be used for the purpose of giving effect to European Union law.  The Oireachtas presumed that it was giving the power but it did not specify that fact.  The position is being rectified by means of this Bill.</P>
        <P>We are importing into every such instance of the power to which I refer the power to make regulations not only for the domestic purposes specified in legislation but also for the purpose of giving effect to European Union law in areas which fall within the parameters of that legislation.  It is, therefore, appropriate to validate the regulations made and which, because of the judgments in Browne and Kennedy cases, are now in doubt.  Many such regulations deal with matters of a very technical nature, such as, for example, the rules relating to the identification of animals.  It is only the regulatory matters that are being saved by section 4.  The latter provides that no regulations which conflict with the constitutional right of any individual can be saved by that provision.</P>
        <P>The approach adopted in section 4 of validating existing secondary legislation reflects an approach adopted in a number of previous instances.  It was used, for example, in section 4 of the Immigration Act 1999, which was the subject of a challenge in Leontjava <i>v</i>. the Director of Public Prosecutions.  In the case to which I refer, the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the approach, namely, incorporating instruments by reference rather than verbatim in the <Col N="1316"/>body of an Act.  The Supreme Court has, therefore, already made a decision, the basis of which is similar to what we are seeking to achieve.  What we are doing conforms with successive Supreme Court decisions, the Constitution, our major corpus of law and secondary legislation.</P>
        <P>Senator Quinn and others raised a number of issues.  A statutory instrument must be published in <i>Iris Oifigi&uacute;il</i>, the official journal of the State, and the national newspapers, and it subject to the courts.  Any Department worth its salt will publish, by press release, decisions signed by Ministers in the form of statutory instruments.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>Several times.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelTracey"><NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
	<P>Indeed, usually on the day before they are published in the newspapers.  Statutory instruments appear in the newspapers and <i>Iris Oifigi&uacute;il</i> on the same day.  If a person is prosecuted under the statutory instrument, the latter must stand, in the first instance, the test of the court where the prosecution takes place.  It must also stand the test of an appeal being taken from a lower to a higher court in respect of a particular matter.</P>
        <P>Statutory instruments must face the same rigours as primary legislation.  They must also stand the tests to which I refer and be cleared by the Attorney General and the Parliamentary Counsel.  They are, therefore, subject to strong legal scrutiny.  In addition, there is an obligation to ensure that a Minister taking a decision is doing so on behalf of the Government and the Oireachtas.  On that basis, I deem that section 4 is critical to the sustainability of law and I ask the House to validate it.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>If this debate has revealed anything, it is an undercurrent of concern among Senators regarding the process involved in how information relating to the laws, directives and statutory instruments of the European Union emerges and is communicated to the public.  In that context, I again suggest to the Minister of State that when he is reflecting on this matter and on the wider issue of the European constitution which, as the Taoiseach indicated, will soon be before the people, the administration and execution of business of the Sub-Committee on European Scrutiny be reviewed.</P>
        <P>A number of Members have had experience of the sub-committee to which I refer.  Its work is <Col N="1317"/>obtuse, complicated, highly technical and complex.  I fully appreciate that the directives are highly technical and legalistic in nature.  I am grateful to one of the Minister of State&rsquo;s officials who pointed out that a number of countries adopted an attitude that is the opposite of that which obtains in this country in respect of the processing of directives.  The parliaments in the countries to which I refer deal with directives, statutory instruments and regulations as primary legislation, with the result that their business is now in a tangle.  Italy is one of the countries in question and its Parliament must debate, <i>ad nauseam</i>, every item that comes from Europe.  That is the other side of the equation.</P>
        <P>I will not repeat what I said earlier.  However, I hope that, in the interests of all the issues raised in this debate, namely, accountability, transparency, due process and, most importantly, the needs of the electorate, to the members of which we are all responsible, a review might be carried out into how directives, statutory instruments, etc. are transposed into Irish law.  We might then, perhaps, be in a position to take a more positive view of Europe.  As the Minister of State indicated, the figure in this regard &mdash; 87% &mdash; is quite high.  If, however, people were obliged to listen to what we have been obliged to listen to in this debate, would it remain at that level?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his willingness to listen to the views of Members.  I concur with Senator Mooney&rsquo;s comments.  The majority of Members of the House are pro-European.  Where small difficulties arise, we would like them addressed and dealt with in order that room for doubt is not created among members of the public.  I welcome the Minister of State&rsquo;s comments on the statistics relating to polls in the context of what the people of Ireland think of Europe.  When a real vote on what people think of Europe took place in the first referendum on the Nice treaty, however, and notwithstanding what the opinion polls had indicated, citizens voted differently when there was room for doubt.  We need to fill the void in this regard.</P>

        <P>Senator Mooney referred to the Sub-Committee on EU Scrutiny, of which I am a member.  At 9.30 a.m. every second Thursday, the sub-committee deals with 50, 60 or 70 proposals from Europe.  It is removed in every respect from the public yet each of those proposals and submissions is of great importance to every citizen.  We must find some way to ensure the public knows what is done on its behalf and the relevance of the work of the Sub-Committee on EU Scrutiny.</P>
        <P>Some time in the past 12 months we had a Europe day in the Oireachtas, at the instigation of Deputy Quinn, which worked well.  A token Europe day every now and then is not enough.  Who knows which of us will be here when the Oireachtas considers further reform of its business?  I hope by then it will be moving towards <Col N="1318"/>devoting one day every week or ten days, or one week in every five or six to European issues which require that time.  To have the sub-committee meeting every second week, and the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Affairs trying to find a slot between other committees with us rushing in and out of meetings is not the way to do business.</P>
        <P>The European Union is so relevant to every citizen that the Parliament needs to give it a little more respect.  If we do that, the people will respond even more enthusiastically as we begin the next phase of EU development and further treaty debate.</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister of State and his officials for their attention to the details in and queries raised on this Bill.  Some of my words may have appeared anti-official but that was not my intention, apart from being pro-democracy.  Senator Mooney touched on my concerns which stretch to the overall EU ideal and the danger that we will lose the trust and confidence of the citizens.  There must be a better way to scrutinise legislation, perhaps through reform of the Seanad.</P>
        <P>Part of my reason for being anti-statutory instrument was that in 1970, I won a case in the Supreme Court on the basis of a statutory instrument written in 1938.  That was the only case that ever went to the Supreme Court on Article 44, which covers discrimination on the grounds of religion, and it was found that the statutory instrument fell short of the Constitution.  I will tell the Minister of State about it some other time.  That is one reason I have a personal interest in ensuring that legislation goes through in the full light of consideration by Parliament.</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister of State and his officials for processing this Bill in the Seanad and for making it somewhat  easier to understand.  When I started to read this Bill I found it very technical.  I agree with many of the points raised on the other side of the House in respect of transparency and that there is too much power going in one direction.</P>
        <P>We do not emphasise enough the importance of getting the message out to the electorate.  I would like the Minister of State to push for this House to have responsibility for informing the electorate about how the European Union works.  That is the core of this Bill.  We all worry that the so-called Mr. European is out there and is not involved with us.  This is becoming more important in respect of directives.  We must use this House, and the Forum on Europe and the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Affairs to get our message out.  I wish the Minister of State well in bringing the Bill through the D&aacute;il.</P>

        <P>I especially thank Senator Quinn for alluding to the fact that he was involved in a Supreme Court decision in 1970.  I will ask some of the lawyers who support us as outstanding officials to dig that out, and I may read it over Christmas or afterwards.  It shows how we, as citizens who become legislators, can be involved in the process which helps to make us better legislators.</P>
        <P>I am grateful to everybody in the House whose lead and positive attitude to the Bill and to the European project I hope will be followed by our colleagues in the D&aacute;il.  We are here to ensure that we have the fairest, most balanced and even-handed legislative process possible for the citizens, taking into account our responsibilities under the Constitution and as members of the European Union.</P>
        <P>We have done a good day&rsquo;s work for which I am deeply grateful.  I thank the Leas-Chathaoirleach, the Clerk to the Seanad and all the staff and officials from the Department for their tremendous work.  I wish a very happy Christmas to all.</P>

      <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, for coming to the House to respond to this important matter of the Garda vetting unit in Thurles, County Tipperary.  I specifically refer to the recently allocated responsibility to manage an element of the updated child care regulations.</P>
        <P>On 9 October last, the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, announced welcome new child care regulations.  They were long overdue.  This was informed by a wider consultation process that had taken place over a number of years.  One widely welcomed aspect of the regulations was that staff, including voluntary staff, of pre-schools and cr&egrave;ches would have to be vetted.  Surprisingly, cr&egrave;che owners were only given until the end of this year to prepare for the new regulations which were due to come into force on 1 January next.</P>
        <P>It occurred to me at the time that the vetting requirement, in particular, would put a great deal of pressure on the staff of the Garda vetting unit in Thurles.  Accordingly, I tabled a question to the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and <Col N="1320"/>Law Reform inquiring whether additional resources would be made available to the Garda vetting unit to allow it to carry out its additional responsibilities.  The T&aacute;naiste stated in reply that staffing levels at the Garda vetting unit were &ldquo;adequate to meet existing and foreseeable demand&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>Not long after, a letter was issued to a cr&egrave;che owner in Dublin from a Garda inspector which stated:</P>
        <P LI="1">Unfortunately, due to current agreed commitments to other organisations who have been waiting for Garda vetting services for some time, we cannot extend vetting to your organisation at present.</P>
        <P FLI="0">As I feared, cr&egrave;ches and pre-schools applying for vetting to the Garda vetting unit in Thurles would not be accommodated.  The minimum time for processing a vetting application is two months.  From October to December is only a three-month period so I did not see how it would be possible for the Garda vetting unit to process all the applications.  Without these applications being processed, cr&egrave;ches and pre-schools would be considered to be in breach the law, not through their own fault but because of the Government&rsquo;s failure.</P>
        <P>I read in <i>The Sunday Business Post</i> that the regulations will not now be implemented until September 2007.  It is unacceptable that a Minister should announce regulations but not put in place the necessary resources to ensure those who are affected by them can operate efficiently.  In effect, the Minister has not thought through the short timeframe provided for in the regulations.</P>
        <P>Staff in Health Service Executive offices who handle child care inspections need to be trained.  It is my understanding that no training has been scheduled before Christmas so the training will take place in the new year at the earliest.  Surely the Government knew that when it published the new child care regulations.  The situation is in disarray.  I invite the Minister of State to explain how this has happened and to give an assurance on the matter so that the staff needed in the Garda vetting unit in Thurles are made available.  Children will be affected by this lack of provision.</P>
        <P>The requirement to vet staff is essential and one with which we all agree.  Resources must be put in place to ensure this takes place.  It is unacceptable that the implementation of the regulations has been postponed rather than the necessary staff provided.  If it were the case that the postponement was until March, for instance, one could accept that the Minister may have made a mistake, but that is not the case.  I look forward to the response of the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern.  I have major concerns about this matter, the handling of which has been less than satisfactory.  I am being kind in using that expression.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I speak on behalf of the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on this important topic of vetting in the pre-school sector.  I trust the House will allow me to address some of the apparently erroneous assumptions made in the matter raised on the Adjournment.</P>
        <P>It is the case that the coming into operation of the Child Care (Pre-School Services) Regulations 2006 has been deferred from 2 January, 2007 to 3 September, 2007.  These regulations provide, <i>inter alia</i>, that a person carrying on a pre-school service shall ensure appropriate vetting of all staff, students and volunteers who have access to a child by acquiring Garda vetting.  However, it is not correct to state that this deferment is the result of insufficient human resources or processing capacities within the Garda central vetting unit.</P>
        <P>To facilitate the roll-out of Garda vetting to an increasing number of sectors from the first quarter of this year, staffing of the Garda central vetting unit has been more than doubled.  Thanks to these additional resources, the Garda central vetting unit has the capacity to expand its vetting service to the pre-school sector on a phased basis during 2007.  The reason for the deferment of the coming into operation of the 2006 regulations relates to the organisation of the pre-school sector itself rather than anything to do with the Garda central vetting unit.  For each sector requiring vetting, whether it be the education sector, the health sector or whatever, the Garda central vetting unit provides its vetting service via a sectoral central point of contact, the task of which is to process vetting applications centrally for that sector.</P>
        <P>This arrangement is not simply an administrative convenience, rather it is an important element in the professionalisation of the vetting process by which vetting application forms can be properly and attentively processed and the criminal record disclosure process properly managed.  In this regard, there is a huge onus on each sector to ensure the proper checking of applicants&rsquo; identities and that the information supplied on vetting application forms is accurate and honest.  If these steps are not performed diligently, then the benefits of vetting are set at nought.  To facilitate best practice in this regard, the Garda central vetting unit delivers comprehensive training to the sectoral central points of contact as an important means of promoting vetting as an aid to child protection, but only when properly managed.</P>
        <P>The sectoral central point of contact system is in place for all the sectors to which vetting has already been extended, including the primary and post-primary education sectors, the youth work sector, the care home sector and so on.  This approach has proven its worth from both the perspective of the Garda central vetting unit and the <Col N="1322"/>sectors themselves, not least in terms of eliminating duplication and preventing waste in the processing of incorrectly completed vetting application forms.</P>
        <P>The Office of the Minister for Children, which has responsibility for the pre-school sector, is represented on the multi-agency implementation group overseeing the roll-out of Garda vetting nationally.  That office is aware of and in agreement with the principle of a sectoral central point of contact.  To that end, the Office of the Minister for Children remains engaged in the process of identifying and developing such a point of contact for the pre-school sector.</P>
        <P>In this regard, the T&aacute;naiste understands that discussions are ongoing with the Health Service Executive and a number of umbrella bodies for the sector.  Unfortunately, this process of administrative development has taken longer than originally intended, but the T&aacute;naiste understands that the Office of the Minister for Children is determined to ensure appropriate processing systems are in place as soon as possible.  In any event, on behalf of the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, I state unambiguously that Garda vetting will be extended to the pre-school sector as soon as appropriate liaison mechanisms for the sector are put in place, including the identification of a sectoral central point of contact to manage vetting applications and disclosures thereon.</P>
        <P>On the question of staffing, the human resource requirements of the Garda central vetting unit are monitored on an ongoing basis to ensure a match between vetting demand and processing capacities.  The additional human and other resources already provided to the unit have been more than adequate to meet demand to date, and the Garda authorities have not made any further additional staffing requests to the T&aacute;naiste.  However, I assure the Senator that should additional staffing requirements arise, the T&aacute;naiste has indicated his willingness to consider any such application in a favourable light.</P>

      <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for clarifying the position.  It is worse than I thought.  It is a major administrative error which should have been spotted last October.  I find it difficult to believe the Office of the Minister for Children could not have foreseen this problem.  It is unacceptable that it has left it until the last minute to deal with the issue and also, in the Minister of State&rsquo;s response, there is not one reference to the needs of children.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Leas-Chathaoirleach for allowing me to raise this issue and the Minister of State for coming to reply.  For many years the town of Kinvara has been in need of a sewerage scheme which comes within the small schemes projects.  I hope we can get approval and funding for the scheme.  The people of Kinvara have waited many years for such a scheme.  While the town is a tourist area, tourism cannot develop in the absence of a sewerage scheme.  We would also like to see the development of the oyster and mussel farms.  It is hard to envisage housing development while no sewerage scheme exists.  In the summer there is the problem of stench from the bay.  Given the length of time it has taken to have a decision made on the scheme, people are concerned it will never happen.</P>
        <P>Recently the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, was in Gort and met a community group from Kinvara who were anxious to have a decision.  I hope the Department can make the decision quickly.  I would appreciate it if approval were given so that work could begin as soon as possible.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I am taking this Adjournment matter on behalf of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche.  I thank Senator Kitt for the opportunity to update the House on the progress of this important scheme.</P>
        <P>The Minister is conscious of the unsatisfactory state of affairs in Kinvara where raw sewage is being discharged directly into the bay.  This arrangement is not acceptable in this day and age.  The Department is determined that it should end as quickly as possible.  Many representations have <Col N="1324"/>been received about this scheme and I am aware of how important it is locally.</P>
        <P>I am glad to re-affirm that the funding for the scheme has been set aside in the Department&rsquo;s water services investment programme 2005-2007.  A sum of &euro;2.8 million has been earmarked for Kinvara and this money is available for drawdown by Galway County Council as soon as it is required.  The position with the scheme is that the Department is finalising its examination of Galway County Council&rsquo;s preliminary report in light of the additional information received from the council at the end of October.</P>
        <P>The preliminary report is a detailed document that sets out the objectives, proposed areas to be served, and outputs expected from a water services scheme.  Given the fundamental importance of the preliminary report, the Department must be fully satisfied that the proposals contained in it can meet the environmental objectives set for the scheme and that they represent the most appropriate and cost effective solution from a public expenditure point of view.  Needless to say, a scheme cannot just deal with current problems, it must also ensure that infrastructure is put in place to cater for future needs and, in this case, to protect Kinvara Bay from pollution for the foreseeable future.</P>
        <P>The Department is anxious to get the scheme under way as soon as possible and to see it progressing through the approval and contract processes and on to construction with the least possible delay.  The Minister will, therefore, ensure that a decision on the preliminary report is conveyed to Galway County Council as soon as possible.  Approval of the report will allow the council to prepare contract documents.  Since it is expected to cost less than &euro;5 million, the council will be free to advance the scheme right through to construction without further reference to the Department.  A number of streamlining measures have been introduced to speed up water and sewerage schemes being funded under the Department&rsquo;s water services investment programme.  As a result the Kinvara scheme will move ahead quickly once the preliminary report is approved.</P>
        <P>I assure the Senator that I have listened carefully to what he has said and will report back to the Department.  I am sure the Department will do everything it can to facilitate an early start on the construction of the scheme.</P>
