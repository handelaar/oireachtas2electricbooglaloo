	<P>I have notice from Senator Finucane that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter: </P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to outline the number of houses under council ownership and the number of private houses that will have improvement works carried out in Glenma housing estate, Croom, County Limerick, which was approved in principle on 14 May 2002, when construction will commence and the timeframe for completion of this project.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Norris of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to make special provision under statutory instrument 312 of 1997 or some analogous mechanism to provide for the inclusion of more than 700 graduates of TCD in the electoral register for Dublin University, who were accidentally excluded as a result of human error, in time for the next election.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Kitt of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">To ask the Minister for Education and Science if she is aware of the decision of the Sisters of Mercy, western province, to withdraw as providers of education in the Kinvara area and to close Seamount College, Kinvara, County Galway; if her permission is required to disband the college board of management and the efforts she can make to allow this thriving school to continue.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Browne of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to clarify if she plans to change the current practice where primary school teachers <Col N="1706"/>give up five days of their summer holidays to get back three personal leave days; and if she plans to allow paid substitute cover for those days.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator McHugh of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to update the board of management at Glenswilly national school, Newmills, Letterkenny, County Donegal, regarding the plans for a school extension.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator John Paul Phelan of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to outline the reasons for her failure to give a devolved grant for a building extension to Scoil N&aacute;is&uacute;nta na Maigheine Muire, Ardattin, County Carlow in either 2004 or 2005 and to outline the current position regarding the necessary funds for this extension.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Bannon of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to clarify the position regarding the inequity of charging fees of more than &euro;6,000 for a student (details supplied) repeating a college year, with the allied loss of third level grant provision, in circumstances where she is relying for funding on a widowed parent, whose sole income is disability benefit and to outline how, under natural justice, such a punitive measure can be enforced.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator O&rsquo;Meara of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister of Health and Children to ensure that vacancies for orthopaedic consultants in the mid-west area are filled as soon as possible as this failure is resulting in intolerably long waiting lists for Croom Hospital, particularly patients in the north Tipperary area.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Ulick Burke of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to intervene and indicate her intentions regarding provision of second level education at Seamount College, Kinvara, County Galway, following the announcement by the Sisters of Mercy of closure of the school.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected the matters raised by Senators Finucane, Norris and Kitt and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senators Browne, McHugh, Phelan, Bannon, O&rsquo;Meara and Burke may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

    <Title>Order of Business. </Title>
      <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Order of Business is Nos. 1, 2 and 29, motion 12.  No. 1 is a motion that was referred to the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights for consideration.  The joint committee has now completed its deliberations.  Under the Disability Act 2005, the six Departments named in the motion are required to produce sectoral plans relating to the delivery of services to people with disabilities.  The motion seeks the approval of these plans put forward by the Departments concerned and it is proposed to take it without debate.  No. 2, statements on the current situation in the Middle East, resumed, will be taken on the conclusion of the Order of Business and will conclude no later than 5 p.m.  Notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, Members who have already contributed to the debate on this matter may do so again.  Contributions of spokespersons shall not exceed ten minutes and those of all other Senators shall not exceed six minutes, and Members may share time.  The Minister is to be called upon to reply no later than ten minutes before the conclusion of the statements.  No. 29, motion 12, which relates to pre-nuptial agreements, will be taken from 5 p.m. to 7 p.m.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>In respect of No. 1, may I ask the Acting Leader why the House is not taking this matter today?  As I understand it, the relevant committees have not yet debated the sectoral plans produced in the various Departments.  As this legislation was put in place in 2005 after a gestation period of approximately four years, the House has a responsibility to debate the matter as soon as possible.  I ask him to comment in this regard.</P>
        <P>I ask the Acting Leader and all Members to reflect on the distinctive and important role played by the Church of Ireland since the foundation of the State and on the particular ethos that has been brought to bear on Irish medicine and Irish medical practices over many years.  In that light, the House should note the strong comments made yesterday by the Church of Ireland Archbishop of Dublin, the Most Reverend John Neill, when he referred to the ongoing controversies surrounding the selection of the new national paediatric hospital, in which a decision has been made in favour of the Mater Hospital.</P>
        <P>I raised this issue on the Adjournment last week and received an admission from the Government that no scoring mechanism was put in place by the evaluation task force regarding the six hospitals that made bids for the new national paediatric centre.  Although this was the most important medical decision to be taken in respect of children for a generation, the six bids were not scored.  To make matters worse, the very terms of reference for that evaluation task force was a McKinsey report containing nine criteria upon which the decision should have been based. <Col N="1708"/> However, the Department of Health and Children has admitted that the evaluation task force did not score each bid according to the set nine criteria.</P>
        <P>Given Archbishop Neill&rsquo;s comments yesterday and the widespread public concern regarding the fairness of the evaluation process, the House should have a debate on this matter as soon as possible.  This is particularly important in view of the comments made by the chairman of the Mater Hospital who stated that the Taoiseach had given an absolute promise, before the evaluation process had taken place, that the facility would end up in the Mater Hospital.</P>
        <P>This is not simply a Dublin issue as it affects the best decision for paediatrics nationwide.  While we have one chance to make the correct decision, an admission has been made that on a major piece of medical infrastructure, no evaluation ending up with a scoring mechanism took place. This was admitted in the House, at approximately 9.30 p.m. last Wednesday, 11 October.  The House must return to this issue soon and I ask the Acting Leader to facilitate this.</P>
        <P>I congratulate both Governments for the agreement reached between them last week at St. Andrew&rsquo;s.  It is the responsibility of all mainstream political parties in both jurisdictions to support the Governments in their efforts during the coming months to bring about devolved shared government in Northern Ireland.  Whatever difficulties may remain, I believe the basis is now in place to find an agreement that will bring about devolved government.  I congratulate the Governments on this and ask the Acting Leader to facilitate a debate on the matter next week.  I do not seek the Taoiseach&rsquo;s attendance in the House, as any of the three Ministers serving in the Department of Foreign Affairs would suffice to set out a paper and hear the response from all sides.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I am uneasy about taking No. 1 without debate.  Almost all Members had an input to make during the passage of the Act and representations were made from all sides.  While I do not wish to go against the procedure for dealing with such matters, it is a significant issue pertaining to how disabilities will be addressed under the different headings of health, enterprise, transport, etc.  Issues ranging from the kind of bus design to who can get into schools, etc., will have a serious impact on many people.  I want to hear an explanation.  I would prefer not to accept it if it cannot be taken without debate.  A debate on the issue has been withdrawn from the other House.  Perhaps this matter can be clarified for Members.</P>
        <P>As for the final issue raised by Senator Brian Hayes, I appreciate the need for a debate on the North of Ireland.  However, the antics witnessed yesterday in Stormont will be part of the choreography of the coming weeks with people stepping in and out and with umbrage meeting out<Col N="1709"/>rage.  I concluded that they should be left alone, behind a locked door and told to come out when ready.  I was taken by the original idea that there would be only a black and white picture in yesterday&rsquo;s news with no television coverage.  That lasted only an hour or two before we were out on the steps again.  I am not saying this in a negative way; they have difficult work to do which they would be best to do alone.  They should be left for a week or two before the debate is conducted, though it is important that the debate takes place before 24 November.</P>
        <P>A number of years ago I raised the matter of the outrage felt by decent people in Limerick city regarding the brutal assassination of Brian Fitzgerald, head of security in the nightclub that imposed the strictest control of drugs in the city.  For his pains he met his death.  The Garda must be congratulated, yet again, on continuing with the case and bringing a second person to trial.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I am not prejudging the trial, that is not my business.  It is encouraging that the Garda has moved this forward.</P>
        <P>Dare I mention voting machines?  I notice the Taoiseach has been talking about them again and has referred to the current voting system as &ldquo;that old system that we need to get rid of&rdquo;.  I happen to agree with the Taoiseach on this issue, though I have been afraid to say it for a number of years.  The discussion in the past two or three years has focused on the machines.  People were against the type of electronic voting system we tried to introduce.  I have not heard any party say it is against electronic voting&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Individuals, including myself, have said it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;with the exception of some neanderthals and luddites.  If we could get the voting right in Trinity College&mdash;&mdash; </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I am working on that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;I can see how the machines might be a help there.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>Try using pencils and pens.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>This issue is being addressed in the United States prior to the November elections and there is already a great deal of anxiety relating to the types of voting machines that will be used.  We can all recall the row about hanging chads in the 2000 presidential election.  </P>
        <P>I suggest we have a debate where we no longer mention the &euro;67 million that has been wasted on this so far and how much the machines are costing per year.  We will say it once and then concentrate on the issue.  I think we should move towards electronic voting of a kind in which we can have trust and confidence.  This will require a <Col N="1710"/>marked paper which can be read like a lottery ticket by a machine and a total calculated.  If there are subsequent arguments the paper can be checked.  I would like a debate on this issue in a non-party political, non-confrontational manner.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach will be relieved to know Senator O&rsquo;Toole agrees with him occasionally as he is well known as a critic of the Taoiseach.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>He does not know the half of it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I have a note here from the Disability Federation of Ireland stating it seeks a debate in the Seanad on many issues relating to the sectoral plans.  This can be done in two ways.  I understand the Government will propose that some time in the medium-term future there will be a talking heads session.  The correct way is to postpone approval of this until it has been debated.  The only other occasion I can recall where similar approval was given was the Appropriations Bill, where Seanad &Eacute;ireann&rsquo;s powers are limited in any case.  We pass that Bill and then we debate it.  </P>
        <P>We are trivialising disability by suggesting we will nod it through as if the reports do not matter.  This means the Minister for Health and Children, the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, the Minister for Transport<b>, </b>the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources<b>, </b>the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government<b> </b>and the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and their officials will escape serious accountability.</P>
        <P>This was nodded through one committee in a hurry, it is now being nodded through Seanad &Eacute;ireann and will be nodded through D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  My party will not accept this.  I therefore move amendment No. 1:</P>
        <P LI="1">That item No. 1 on the Order of Business be taken at 7 p.m. for an open-ended debate, to continue for as long as Seanad &Eacute;ireann wishes to continue it; at the end of the debate, having heard all of these Ministers or their representatives, the House will then take a decision on whether to approve the sectoral plans.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The idea that sectoral plans to do with what this Government turned into the most elaborate display of hoop-la, bells and whistles when it was announced should be nodded through both Houses of the Oireachtas with virtually no serious debate is preposterous.  Each of those Ministers should have been scrutinised before the appropriate Oireachtas committee.  That is what accountability means.  To ask them questions after the event is not accountability.  It is somewhat discomfiting for a Minister and takes up half an hour when he or she could be elsewhere, but it is not accountability.  I therefore move the amendment to the Order of Business that a debate should commence at 7 p.m. and continue <Col N="1711"/>until all Members of the Seanad have spoken, and then we take a decision.</P>
        <P>On an unrelated issue, does the Acting Leader know anything about the peculiar situation concerning penalty points incurred in this country in September, not for breaking an amber light or driving in the wrong place on a motorway, but for driving without insurance, in which 3,642 offences were identified by the Garda.  Of the 3,642 offences, in 3,454 cases the Garda could not identify who the drivers were and they got off.  Only 180 out of the 3,642 people involved were issued with penalty points because the rest could not be identified.</P>
        <P>The Government is probably slightly exuberant because of a couple of aberrant opinion polls.  I hope it gets over its exuberance and figures out at least the basic level of competence, which means we cannot have 3,500 different cars identified in a month with virtually 95% of the drivers remaining unpunished even though we know they are driving without insurance.  For God&rsquo;s sake, is the Government serious about anything or is it all smoke and mirrors and deception?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GeraldineFeeney"><NameTxt>Ms Feeney</NameTxt>
	<P>I support and welcome the debate called for by Senator Brian Hayes on the location of the National Children&rsquo;s Hospital.  I am on record as speaking in the House when the location of the new hospital was announced.  The announcement was welcomed with great words and applause, it was said it was long-awaited and so on.  Everyone sang from the same hymn sheet on that occasion, particularly&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not.  I opposed it publicly, as I said.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GeraldineFeeney"><NameTxt>Ms Feeney</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;-medical personnel as well politicians.  Having sat on the Joint Committee on Health and Children, I have engaged in the debate where it was said time and again that the National Children&rsquo;s Hospital should not be confused with a Dublin children&rsquo;s hospital.  This is a hospital for the entire country to deal with children from the Inishowen peninsula to the furthest point in Kerry, from the most westerly point in Galway to the most easterly part of Monaghan or Louth.  The best thing we could say is that those sick children and their parents should have easy access to that hospital, wherever it is located.</P>
        <P>I am particularly sad at the tone the current debate is taking.  Medicine does not recognise any boundaries or barriers, particularly religious or political.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>What was the point of the committee?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Feeney, without interruption.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1712"/>
      <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Brian Hayes was just off key.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly"><NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator should explain his interest.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>Exactly, I agree with that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GeraldineFeeney"><NameTxt>Ms Feeney</NameTxt>
	<P>Whether a sick child is Muslim, Christian, Catholic or Protestant should not enter the equation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>Agreed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Nonsense, of course it does.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Give us a break.  Where a woman is sick, she cannot be treated.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="GeraldineFeeney"><NameTxt>Ms Feeney</NameTxt>
	<P>The hospital should be located on the best site for the sick children of Ireland and not confused with a Dublin hospital.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>There has been a degree of success in the area of road safety.  People are now more responsible when it comes to drunken driving.  I welcome the compilation of the list of roads around the country with accident blackspots on which garda&iacute; will feature.  However, on consulting the list I was surprised to find that there are no roads in County Limerick that were regarded as blackspots.  There are many roads in County Limerick on which fatalities have occurred.  It amazes me that the Department of the Environment and Local Government does not compile a dossier of accident blackspots in every county and then, in conjunction with the National Roads Authority, do something about them.  It would not take a lot of expenditure to take remedial action.</P>
        <P>While I welcome the speed camera and the emphasis upon them, I am concerned about a statement made by an executive of Tele-traffic.  That company has the exclusive contract to supply all the handheld laser speed guns to the Garda.  The executive said it had provided the Garda with a new system to make up revenue.  I hope the cautionary principle will operate and these speed guns will not be seen as a revenue making mechanism by the Exchequer.  The public should be forewarned and they may then take precautions.  It concerns me that the executive that sold these products to the Government would make such a statement.</P>
        <P>I second Senator Ryan&rsquo;s amendment to the Order of Business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly"><NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>Dialogue between the European Community and the United States authorities on the development of an open skies policy for aviation has been ongoing for many years.  The Acting Leader will be aware that the Minister for Transport is involved in the discussions, which seem to be getting bogged down.  Given that an agreement now appears unlikely, can the Acting <Col N="1713"/>Leader arrange for the Minister for Transport to outline to the House the Government position on the open skies policy?  I presume that our current bilateral agreement with the United States will continue until such time as the open skies policy is agreed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I join with Senator Brian Hayes in calling for a debate on the children&rsquo;s hospital.  Senator Feeney was inaccurate in what she told the House; I am sure it was unintentional.  I raised this issue immediately upon learning of it.  I did so in light of the fact that there were calls from a group of senior consultants asking that an international peer review panel be established.  It would not have caused a big hold-up, it would only have taken three weeks to review the criteria.  This was not done.</P>
        <P>Archbishop Neill has commented on the issue.  As archbishop, his statements have invariably been moderate, considered and balanced.  It is important to listen to him when he speaks on an issue like this.  We cannot be coerced into agreement.  While I believe in the separation of church and State, we need to listen when someone like Archbishop Neill speaks in such tones.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The children&rsquo;s hospital was closed down and amalgamated with Tallaght Hospital.  Undertakings were given at the time but these have now been broken.  There is no doubt that this will be a considerable loss to the surrounding area.  I live next door to the Mater Hospital and we are living in a traffic jam.  Any idiot can see that it is easier to get to Tallaght.  If I had any children it would suit me to have the Mater Hospital upgraded and I do not begrudge anything that is brought to the north side of the city.</P>
        <P>It is sometimes said that there is no religious boundary in the provision of treatment.  This is incorrect and the Mater Hospital is a classic example of this.  I raised this when cancer treatment was withdrawn from women on spurious grounds&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>So did I.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;that had nothing to do with medicine but everything to do with the completely inappropriate ethical committees that sat in judgment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not like Catholic ethical committees.  I do not like Protestant ethical committees.  Religious sectarianism of any kind does not have a role in this area.  The only reason I would support what is described as a Protestant ethos is because it clears those theological conceptions out of the way and places at the centre of treatment the rights and welfare of the patient and the sanctity of the doctor-patient relationship.  That is an important value which should be open to all <Col N="1714"/>citizens of this State, not just Catholics or Protestants.</P>
        <P>I want to raise a number of other issues.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Other Senators have indicated they wish to speak, Senator Norris.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I managed to get an extension of this time by 15 minutes, about which I am sure they will all be pleased.</P>

      <Speaker pid=""><NameTxt>A Senator</NameTxt>
	<P>For himself.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Not just for myself.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>He did it all on his own.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>These are serious issues.  We put forward the idea of the amendment to the Treaty of Amsterdam.  We were given certain indications.  We were told, for example, that there were only one or two pieces of information.  That is wrong.  A total of 34 pieces of information were given.  We were told it would be hermetically sealed.  The American authorities have indicated that this information is being made available to the FBI and the CIA as well.  We should reopen this matter.</P>
        <P>On a similar issue, we should have a debate on the Shell to Sea campaign.  It is not appropriate that the Garda forces of this State should be enlisted in the interests of multinational corporations, particularly ones that have disgraced themselves throughout the world.  It is not appropriate to have an elderly woman pushed to the ground and injured.</P>
        <P>Finally, could we have some solidarity and respect for this House from our fellow Members?  Yet again today the transport committee meets at 2.30 p.m. to coincide exactly with the Order of Business in this House.  That is a gross lack of respect for this House.  I have spoken to the Government side.  I have had informal agreement.  We should pull our members out of that committee.  It cannot meet if we all show loyalty.  It would be <i>in quorate.  </i>I am dismayed by some of my fellow Senators who let us down by turning up at the committee and allowing it to function while they treat this House with absolute and total contempt.  By collaborating with the committee, they are bringing this House into disrepute.</P>

	<P>An bhf&eacute;adfaimis cuireadh a thabhairt don Aire Gn&oacute;tha&iacute; Pobail, Tuaithe agus Gaeltachta, an Teachta &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, teacht isteach go dt&iacute; an Teach seo agus tuarasc&aacute;il a thabhairt d&uacute;inn ar st&aacute;das na logainmneacha Gaeilge i gcomhth&eacute;acs na reachta&iacute;ochta at&aacute; i bhfeidhm i l&aacute;thair na huaire?  Bheadh d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht mar sin thar a bheith cabhrach, mar bheadh s&iacute; bunaithe ar fh&iacute;ric&iacute; seachas r&aacute;fla&iacute; agus m&iacute;thuiscint.  Inviting the Minister, Deputy &Oacute; C&uacute;iv, into the House to discuss placenames in Irish, particularly in the Gaeltacht areas and in the context of the langu<Col N="1715"/>age legislation we now have, would be particularly helpful.  I ask the Acting Leader to endeavour to have that debate in the next few weeks.  I have no doubt the Minister would be delighted to come into the House, which should be so.</P>
        <P>Also, it is right for this House to send best wishes to the political parties in the North of Ireland and to wish them well at this time, which is full of opportunity and potential.  We would be wrong to underestimate the strong messages that have come out of the dialogue in Scotland and also the choreography that led to that dialogue.  If we want one example of that we found it on &ldquo;Questions &amp; Answers&rdquo; this week.  One had only to listen to the new tone adopted by a member of the DUP and a member of Sinn F&eacute;in on the same programme, and to watch the body language.  There is no doubt that powerful forces, minute though they may be and coming from the most unexpected areas, will endeavour to derail this effort.  I believe that will not happen but it behoves everyone, not just people in public life, the media and others, to support it.  Many people, including the churches, have shown support and attempted to sideline these minority forces, particularly those in the intelligence area.  We must be careful to ensure the opportunity we have, which may never return, will not be wasted.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Meara</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the motion by my colleague, Senator Ryan, on sectoral plans on disability.  Many Senators took part in the debate on disability legislation and know that this legislation must be closely considered.  We have received a request from the Disability Federation of Ireland to consider its concerns.  We should do so because we have time and it would be remiss of us not to do so.  I seek support in this respect.</P>
        <P>A Privacy Bill is on the Order Paper of this House.  Unlike the Defamation Bill, it has never been accompanied by an in-depth consultation or examination of its implications.  It is clear that the Bill&rsquo;s provisions are of serious concern to the media and while that alone is not enough to merit concern on our part, it should be noted.  The concerns expressed are broad and widespread.  I suggest we debate the principles of privacy legislation and assist the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform by giving our views in a debate on Second Stage.  I ask the Acting Leader to communicate a proposal that we examine this Bill and give our views to the Minister.  As it stands, the Bill borders on being dangerous and some legal people believe it is unconstitutional.</P>
        <P>The National Children&rsquo;s Hospital is not a Dublin issue.  Children in need of the services of the National Children&rsquo;s Hospital come from throughout the country.  The location of such a hospital is of importance to communities throughout the country.  The recently expressed opinion of Archbishop Neill should be considered, as should the suggestion expressed by <Col N="1716"/>colleagues in this House that this matter be given the consideration it deserves.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMauriceHayes"><NameTxt>Dr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I congratulate the parties involved at St. Andrew's, especially the Taoiseach for his part in bringing about the agreement.  This is not an agreement in the sense we generally understand.  It is more a syllabus for examination that the parties are now invited to pass.  They should be left to themselves and we should respect people working under great pressure and difficulty.  Senator O&rsquo;Toole made a case for having a debate but the language he used made the case for not having a debate.  It is not helpful to refer to antics or refer to people as if they were in a zoo.  These people must negotiate with each other and with their own people at the same time.  The next few weeks will be crucial and after that, the House can debate the matter.</P>
        <P>Regarding the discussion of the National Children&rsquo;s Hospital, I am less concerned about its location than the need for it to be open to all on an ethical basis that everyone can accept.  It should not be limited to practices based on a fairly narrow interpretation of Catholic medical ethics. I concur with Senator O&rsquo;Meara&rsquo;s remarks.  As Members are aware, I have an interest in this issue and believe it would be worthwhile setting aside time for a debate on it.</P>
        <P>Over the weekend, we learned about the location of speed cameras, which I welcome.  Many speed cameras are located along the Border, which brings me back to a point made by Senator McHugh and I in the past.  When will an agreement be signed which will allow penalty points to be recognised and applicable on both sides of the Border?  People on either side of the Border have a peculiarly cavalier attitude to driving on the other side.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Picking up on the points made by Senator Brian Hayes and Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute;, everyone here salutes the fine work carried out at St. Andrew&rsquo;s.  We all agree there should be a debate on this issue.  Perhaps it can be decided shortly when would be the most suitable time to hold such a debate?  I believe it would be acceptable to all.  We all believe the difficulty is only a glitch and I do not believe anyone here will do any damage in any contribution he or she might make.  We are proactive and completely supportive of the restoration of the executive in the North.  </P>
        <P>The Acting Leader and Members will have noted that the chairman of An Bord Plean&aacute;la has stated that he would favour local authorities making provision for high-rise developments in their local area plans.  He wishes to see clearer policies at local authority level that would give indications as to where high-rise developments would or would not be acceptable.  Will they be confined to cities and certain areas of cities?  Clearly, this is a very divisive issue, as Members will appreciate.</P><Col N="1717"/>
        <P>In view of its importance, could the Acting Leader tell the House whether the Government envisages, through the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and his Department, drawing up a blueprint or strict guidelines in respect of this issue, which I believe are necessary?  We have already witnessed the lack of uniformity in so many planning matters between different local authorities throughout the country.  Certain guidelines have been produced but in the absence of a directive, many of them are not proving to be very effective.  We have witnessed how planning applications have been invalidated differently throughout the country and through different local authority areas.  Given the importance of this issue and the considerable value involved&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="TomMorrissey"><NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
	<P>Last week, the National Consumer Agency published a report, Putting Consumers First, which deals with the issue of management companies established in new housing estates.  The report, which contained many excellent recommendations, was the result of research into the functions of management companies, the different types of management companies, the non-existence of an arms length approach by both developers and those who run management companies and the duties and responsibilities of these companies.</P>
        <P>This area is of major importance among many new communities in Dublin and across the country.  It was the subject of a Private Members&rsquo; motion in the House earlier this year.  It is opportune for us to revisit the subject in light of the publication of this excellent report and I ask that the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Noel Ahern, come to the House to discuss the report and examine the type of legislation that can be introduced.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I concur entirely with the sentiments expressed by Senator Norris in respect of the persistence of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport in meeting at 2.30 p.m. on Wednesdays.</P>

      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Brian Hayes for raising the issue of Tallaght Hospital and I add my voice to those who believe there should be a full debate on the matter in this House.  I am astonished that the matter has not been fully debated.  The issue at stake is not so much denominational as it is political, with the location of the hospital ending up in the Taoiseach&rsquo;s constituency.  That does not seem to be a complete coincidence.</P><Col N="1718"/>
        <P>As Senator Norris stated, we should listen to the fears expressed yesterday by Archbishop Neill.  We should also consider the fact that at least one consortium of businessmen, led by Noel Smyth, offered a free site for a national children&rsquo;s hospital which was turned down for inexplicable reasons without even a hearing by the committee examining the situation.  It was decided to examine it after public outcry.  It was given a cursory examination and turned down.  The decision is fraught with flaws and must be investigated thoroughly.</P>
        <P>I cannot understand why it is necessary to put all our eggs in one basket.  I have sympathy with Members on the other side who state it is not only a Dublin issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>We do not have time to debate it today.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>I will ask a question to the Acting Leader and then finish.</P>
        <P>It is not only a Dublin issue.  More than anybody, it affects the people of Tallaght, which has the fastest-growing population in Ireland.  However, the Mater Hospital is inaccessible to a large number of people who may need treatment extremely quickly.  Will the Acting Leader tell the House why we cannot have a children&rsquo;s hospital established as a hub and spokes?  A large hub could be established in the Mater Hospital and treatment could also be given to children in D&uacute;n Laoghaire, Tallaght and other places.  I cannot see what is wrong with that.  Perhaps it could be a compromise.</P>
        <P>The ethical issue is another matter which can be resolved within an umbrella organisation.  However, I cannot understand why it must all be placed in the Taoiseach&rsquo;s constituency.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Acting Leader organise a debate on the register of electors, which was referred to earlier?  I am mindful of the extremely good work done by local authorities, using enumerators such as those used in the census, to complete a thorough investigation of the register.  Many people missing from the register for the last local elections will be added.  However, a danger exists that many people who should not be on the register will remain on it.  People studying or working away from home may be included on more than one register.  Voting machines may provide the answer, as if we had electronic voting people could not vote more than once.  This could be included in a debate on the register of electors.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I thought Senator Ross would support me.  With all the talk about decentralisation, the national children&rsquo;s hospital represents <Col N="1719"/>a huge opportunity missed.  I felt the most appropriate place for this hospital was the midlands.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>We have seen the escalation of costs associated with farming. Those are issues that must be addressed.  Farmers feel that there is a weak Minister for Agriculture and Food who sold us out to the EU.  We must have an urgent debate on the decline in farming incomes, an issue of concern to us all.</P>
        <P>I also support the call for a debate on the new draft register of electors.  I am puzzled by and alarmed at the number of people who have been left off it &mdash; almost 20% of the population is excluded.  I know people who have been living in <Col N="1720"/>the same place for 40 years but who work elsewhere.  They can be 12 hours away from home and cannot be facilitated by local authority representatives calling to collect forms.  They are automatically eliminated from the register and I am therefore calling for a debate on the issue before it is too late.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Mr. Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the calls for a debate on agriculture, and I would like to commend the Minister on the great work she is doing.  I would especially  like to seek a debate on bio-fuels.  Last week we had a debate on energy and there was a strong demand for excise duty to be removed from home-grown fuel.  We have a case for such measures, particularly in light of the quantitative restriction law in the European Union.  This country has already had a test case heard for Campus Oil, where we were allowed our own national refinery.  I see no difficulty with all excise duties being removed from home-grown fuels.  It would offer a wonderful opportunity to farmers interested in alternative crops.</P>
        <P>I also call for a debate on Sudan.  In recent years there has been ethnic cleansing on the basis of religious belief among the population in the south of the country.  Further similar efforts are under way in Darfur in the west of Sudan.  This is a catastrophe that could reach genocidal proportions because of the colour of people&rsquo;s skin.  This country has a fundamentalist regime and it is of great concern that questions have arisen over the United States placing restrictions on necessary information.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Senator seeking a debate on the issue?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Mr. Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I can, however, understand why the United States would want information in light of the events of 11 September 2001.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I wholeheartedly support those who said we should avoid a debate on Northern Ireland.  The prize of peace and agreement there is so worthwhile that at such a fragile time we should avoid debating the issue.  We should be listening now, not pronouncing.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I agree with Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute;&rsquo;s remarks, however, about listening to Mr. Jeffrey Donaldson of the DUP speaking recently.  I was especially impressed by his pronunciation of &ldquo;Sinn F&eacute;in Ard-Fheis&rdquo; and &ldquo;Sinn F&eacute;in Ard-Chomhairle&rdquo;.  His Gaeilge seems far better than that of many others.  He would not have used such words only a short time ago.</P>
        <P>I also agree with Senator Maurice Hayes.  We can do something about the penalty points system on an all-Ireland basis.  We should keep quiet about some things and speak about others.  It is in our hands to do something about road deaths <Col N="1721"/>in this part of the country.  We have done some work, the recent figures have been encouraging, and we must support the work that will make a difference.  The question of speed cameras and other areas where we can work together, instead of those areas where we can do nothing, should be to the forefront.</P>

I ask that we bring the Minister for Finance or the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform into the House to debate stamp duty.  We must know the Government&rsquo;s plans, if any, on the issue.  Do they amount to an election promise or are they an aspiration?  Will they be delivered in the budget?  What precisely does the Government plan to do?  Those who intend to buy or sell property in the coming months are confused.

I intend to write a second letter to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges seeking to have the issue addressed and call on Senators to support me.  Of the nine matters submitted for debate on the Adjournment today, only three will be taken.  This is not fair on Senators who sought a debate on a matter but were refused.

      <Speaker pid="DonLydon"><NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>

	<P>The new children&rsquo;s hospital will be the largest project undertaken by the State in the medical area for decades.  Senator Brian Hayes and others have done us a great service in discovering that no scoring process was employed in the evaluation of the six sites chosen as possible locations for the new facility.  The rage felt by people in Tallaght is shared by staff in St. James&rsquo;s Hospital who believe their facility is in a much better position to serve the people, certainly in terms of access, because it is a national hospital.</P>
        <P>It is of great concern that the chairman of the board of the Mater Hospital, in addressing a function in the hospital attended by the Taoiseach, thanked the Taoiseach for fulfilling his promise <Col N="1722"/>to have the national children&rsquo;s hospital located on the Mater Hospital site and for his undertaking that the new facility would be completed before the 150th anniversary of the hospital.  The Taoiseach did not contradict the chairman&rsquo;s remarks.  For the purposes of clarity, it would be a good idea if the House debated this matter.</P>

In the past two months, I have encountered harrowing cases, including one of a 90 year old man who was refused transport to an appointment and one of a visually impaired man who was refused transport from the Mater Hospital in Dublin last week.  Transplant patients have also been refused transport and old and vulnerable people are losing these services.  The Minister should state whether this is a national trend or one that is confined to the HSE western region.  It is incredible that I must raise this issue again.  I ask that the Minister for Health and Children address it immediately.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>The Pensions Board recently expressed concern about the decision of Aer Lingus pilots to use their pension fund to buy shares in their company.  I do not often agree with the Pensions Board but in this case I do.  I ask the Deputy Leader to invite the relevant Minister, probably the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Brennan, to come before the House to state whether he agrees with the concerns expressed by the board and indicate whether employees should use their pension fund to buy shares in their own company.  This practice puts at risk the pensions fund.  Given the volatile circumstances prevailing at Aer Lingus and Ryanair, employees could end up losing their pension fund. </P>

	<P>Yes, I ask that the Minister come before the House to indicate whether he agrees with the Pensions Board.  It is wrong that employees use their pension fund for this purpose.  Emergency legislation is required to protect the pension funds of all employees.  If the recent action of Aer Lingus pilots was a blatant abuse of their pension fund, it is surprising the Minister has not responded to the comments made by the Pensions Board.  An urgent response is required.</P>

I have tried on five different occasions, through every method open to me, including a parliamentary question in the D&aacute;il <Col N="1724"/>through a colleague, in debate here on numerous occasions, as recently as last Wednesday when I asked the Minister if he would provide details of a contract given to Tynagh Energy&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>That was debated.  We will not hear it again.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>Although it was debated, we were not answered.  I want an answer now.  It is a simple process.  I ask the Acting Leader if we can have the details of a contract which states that 100% of the capacity of that generating station is to be paid for by the Government and the contract that was done for the ESB, while as little as 25% of that capacity might be used on any given day.  That is what they call efficiency.  There is something behind it.  Gama Construction built this and we cannot find out who are the investors that have bought it.  If the Acting Leader can give me the answer I want, we can debate it another day.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>A multitude of questions has been asked and I do not know how it will be fair to those who want to contribute to the debate on the Middle East if I answer them comprehensively.  The clocks seem to be running ten minutes fast on the hour.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>There were 24 speakers on the Order of Business today.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>I am also aware of the Standing Orders of the House.  The first matter, item 1, the Disability Bill, was raised by Senators Brian Hayes, O&rsquo;Toole, Ryan and O&rsquo;Meara.  This matter is to be taken without debate.  I suggest the resolution be passed.  The Leader gave an undertaking that this would be debated and I give a similar undertaking.  I understand it will take place in the next fortnight to three weeks.  It is a serious matter and merits full debate.  We could not do it justice in this afternoon&rsquo;s timescale.  I urge that the Whips meet and agree a time for this debate.  There are serious issues here.  The Disability Bill was debated comprehensively and well in this House and this matter can be dealt with in the same way.  It needs a considered approach and more time.  That is why we should wait.  I propose not to take the amendment but to put the resolution without debate.</P>
        <P>The National Children&rsquo;s Hospital was raised by Senators Brian Hayes, Feeney, Norris, O&rsquo;Meara, Maurice Hayes, Ross, Bannon and Henry while Senator Feighan raised related health service issues.  I noted what the Church of Ireland Archbishop of Dublin, Dr. John Neill, said and he has every right to say it.  I am aware of the contribution the Church of Ireland has made to medical services.  It brings an important dimension to that debate.  We discussed that here when we considered the transfer of the Adelaide Hospital and the necessity to maintain the ethos.  Religious <Col N="1725"/>ethos is important, be it Church of Ireland, Muslim or Roman Catholic.  The morality of the patient, not the ethos of the hospital, should determine outcomes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid=""><NameTxt>Senators</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>That was Senator Feeney&rsquo;s point, that the care of the patient is the paramount consideration&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>The facts she stated were wrong.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>Just as Senator Norris is capable of interpreting Senator Feeney&rsquo;s words I am capable of interpreting myself, as I have just done.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Dardis interpreted Senator Feeney&rsquo;s words, not his own.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>On the location of the hospital, notwithstanding what Senator Norris said about hub and spoke, we need the hub.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Ross said that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>We cannot have the spokes without the hub.  We need a national centre of excellence.  This was determined by an independent committee.  In my experience of such determinations it would be unusual for the committee to have used a points system&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>Unusual?  It is project management.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>Although the determination has been made, everybody wants the ball back to play the game again.  The best course is to build the facility and ensure the patients are looked after in the best possible way and receive the best care, which they will get in a national centre of excellence.  A point was made on what is best for the patients and for paediatrics, and that is the overriding consideration.</P>
        <P>The St. Andrew&rsquo;s agreement was raised by Senators Brian Hayes, O&rsquo;Toole, &Oacute; Murch&uacute;, Maurice Hayes, Coghlan and Quinn.  We should stand back.  I agree with Senator O&rsquo;Toole that it is up to the parties to sort out their futures.  Hopefully they will be given the time and space to do that.  The first deadline is 10 November and the second is the 24 November.  We should wait until the first, and possibly the second, deadline has passed before we debate the matter in detail.  I agree with the remarks on the Taoiseach, the British Prime Minister and everybody associated with what was done at St. Andrew&rsquo;s.  It was fruitful, and a major step forward.  Hopefully the nuances can now be sorted and the glitch, as the Secretary of State described it, can be overcome and we can come to a lasting settlement involving devolved government and an executive in Northern Ireland.</P><Col N="1726"/>
        <P Just="Left">I have nothing to say on the assassination of Mr. Brian Fitzgerald other than that I agree with Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s remarks on the Garda.  Senator O&rsquo;Toole also raised the matter of e-voting while Senators Michael Kitt, Bannon, Ormonde and Lydon raised the related matter of the electoral register.  While I am an e-voting enthusiast, I accept the need for a paper trail.  People must have confidence in the system and this is the only way they can.  The hardware is fine; it is a question of finding the suitable software and backup.  I hope e-voting is introduced because it is a step in the right direction.  It is curious that Ireland, one of the largest software exporters in the world and a leader in this area, does not have electronic voting.</P>
        <P>The register of electors is a more serious concern than the voting method.  In my county the council recently circulated a letter saying just over 20% had responded to the house-to-house invitations to be put on the register and that people would drop off the register.  That is serious.  There is an onus on the State and the local authorities to ensure the register is up to date and that as many people as want to vote can do so and will not be impeded.</P>
        <P>The matter of penalty points was raised by Senators Ryan, Finucane, Maurice Hayes and Quinn.  I accept Senator Ryan&rsquo;s point about the numbers without insurance.  However, we are all subject to the law and if there is a loophole in road traffic legislation, that loophole will be found.  Identification is an important matter and one cannot go after people willy-nilly if they are not properly identified.</P>
        <P>The point about both sides of the Border is important.  When southern drivers go to the North and Northern drivers go south of the Border they appear to ignore the rules of the road in those jurisdictions.  Perhaps when the Executive and the Assembly are up and running and there is more co-ordination between North and South, this matter can be dealt with effectively.</P>
        <P>With regard to accident blackspots, I believe that is being dealt with.  My local authority received money over several years from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to deal with accident blackspots.  I do not know if that is still the case but it certainly was until a few years ago.  The Garda is on record as saying that it is not a matter of revenue, regardless of what the man from America said.  I accept what the Garda says.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>What does the Government say?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Daly referred to the open skies agreement.  I will invite the Minister for Transport to the Seanad to discuss the issue.</P>
        <P>Senator Norris referred to the requirements regarding passenger information.  I am uncomfortable about that as well.  It was pointed out this morning that a certain state was able to <Col N="1727"/>intervene to stop some flights on the basis of something that cropped up on a computer.  The situation can get out of hand and there are civil liberty issues involved but we have debated the matter.  There must be some level of security and, given the American experience on 11 September 2001, some of what has happened is understandable.  Nevertheless, there is an issue in that area.</P>
        <P>It is wrong to state that a multinational enlisted the help of the Garda.  That did not happen.  The Garda is responsible for maintaining the law, ensuring that there is peaceable protest and that people can go to work.  That is why the garda&iacute; are at that location.  It is not at the behest of the multinational.</P>
        <P>Senator Norris is right about committees.  I have no control over whether people attend a committee meeting or come to the Seanad but the committees should facilitate the House.  Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; raised the matter of Irish placenames.  I will see if we can arrange something on that matter.</P>
        <P>Senator O&rsquo;Meara and Senator Maurice Hayes referred to the privacy Bill.  Senator O&rsquo;Meara made the important point that while the provisions of the Bill might be of concern to the media, they might not be of concern to us.  There is an important distinction.  I accept that the matter should be teased out and the way to do it is on Second Stage, when the principle of the Bill is discussed.  The Minister has always shown that he is amenable to accepting ideas on Second Stage and including them in a Bill.  However, I will see if there can be consultations with him prior to that.</P>
        <P>Senator Coghlan referred to the chairman of An Bord Plean&aacute;la and high rise buildings.  That is a matter to be decided by each local authority in its development plan.  Hopefully, the board will fall into line with those development plans but, as matters currently stand, it can disregard them, which is a curious situation.  It is a matter that should be debated.</P>
        <P>Senator Morrissey referred to the National Consumer Agency report and management companies.  It is an important issue to which we should return.  We discussed it previously with regard to housing estates.  It is one thing to have such management companies for apartment blocks but it is another matter to have them for housing estates.</P>
        <P>Senator Kitt referred to the register of electors, which I dealt with earlier.  Senator Bannon gave his single transferable speech on the farmers.  It seems to be the same speech he gives on the medical service, transport and everything else.</P>
        <P>Everybody wants the children&rsquo;s hospital to be moved provided it is moved to their constituency.  Perhaps the middle of the Bog of Allen is as good a place as any for the hospital but it has been decided to locate it at the Mater Hospital and I believe that is a good location for it.</P><Col N="1728"/>
        <P>I agree we should have a debate on agriculture.  However, it is important to know the statistics rather than what the IFA says.  Farm incomes rose significantly during the past 12 months; that is statistically correct.</P>
        <P>The related matter of biofuels was raised by Senator Hanafin.  It is part of the IFA budget proposals to provide some assistance for biofuels.  They definitely require assistance if they are to be economical.  Farmers will not grow these crops if they are not profitable.  It is something we should discuss.</P>
        <P>The issue of Sudan, although not strictly relevant, could be raised in the debate on the Middle East.  Senator Browne raised the issue of stamp duty.  The T&aacute;naiste and leader of the Progressive Democrats did not say stamp duty would be changed in the forthcoming budget but that it would be renegotiated when the Progressive Democrats go back into Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>I agree with Senator Terry&rsquo;s remarks about pension funds.  It would be extremely dangerous and prejudice the pensions of the people involved to invest the pension fund in Aer Lingus.  Anybody involved in investment will advise one to spread the risk.  It might be plausible and laudable but it would be extremely dangerous.

        <P>Senator Ulick Burke raised the issue of energy and the Green Paper.  I need not answer that as it was answered last week.</P>

    <Title>Current Situation in the Middle East: Statements. </Title>
      <Speaker pid="NoelTracey"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
	<P>I am grateful to the Members of this House for, once again, devoting time to consideration of the situation in the Middle East.  It remains the most serious challenge to international peace and security.</P>
        <P>The events of recent months in Lebanon, Israel, Palestine and across the region, serve to confirm an essential point, namely, there can be no unilateral or military solutions to the interlinked problems of the region.  Lasting peace and security will be achieved only through a credible process for a comprehensive settlement.  At its core must be a negotiated two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.  The need for a settlement is now more urgent than at any time in the past 60 years.</P>
        <P>The Middle East has been a central concern of Irish foreign policy under successive Governments.  We are consistently active on the issue in the European Union and at the United Nations and have no selfish national interest to pursue.  However, we have a clear interest as Europeans <Col N="1732"/>in a democratic and peaceful Middle East in which the rights and security of the Arab and Israeli peoples are secured.  Along with our partners in the EU we are determined to work with all parties in the region on the basis of respect for fundamental principles and rights.</P>
        <P>The fraught situation across the region, which continues to blight the lives of so many innocent people, imposes a clear and compelling obligation on the international community to come together in a major effort to launch serious negotiations for a peaceful settlement.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>No one can remain indifferent to the suffering witnessed in the past year.  Lebanon has experienced violent death and destruction on a wholly unacceptable scale and the Palestinians continue to face a security and humanitarian crisis.  Israelis feel insecure and unsure about the political path forward.  The daily toll of violence and death in Iraq has reached previously unimaginable proportions and efforts to encourage Iran to play a positive and constructive regional role seem to have reached stalemate.</P>
        <?oasys _cl11- ?><P Just="Left">Against this bleak background there are some signs of hope.  Agreement on Security Council Resolution 1701 created the conditions for an end to the conflict in Lebanon.  It was provoked by <Col N="1733"/>Hizbollah and accentuated by the harsh and disproportionate Israeli response.  The ceasefire, which we had called for unambiguously from the outset, is holding well but there is no room for complacency and the national Government of Prime Minister Siniora requires, and deserves, the full support of the European Union in the difficult period ahead.  There is now a credible international framework for a stable peace based on Lebanese sovereignty and territorial integrity.  All parties in the region have a role to play in support.  This includes Syria, which has an opportunity now to demonstrate a genuine commitment to the search for regional peace and stability.</P>
        <P>The EU has demonstrated in Lebanon an ability to act with clarity and conviction on its stated intentions.  The member states are providing the backbone of the strengthened United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, UNIFIL, which has, so far, deployed more than 5,000 troops in southern Lebanon, alongside units of the Lebanese army.  This has enabled the withdrawal of the Israeli army and full deployment of UNIFIL will be completed during November.</P>
        <P>Ireland is making an important contribution, building on years of commitment to UNIFIL and to the people of Lebanon.  Following our Government&rsquo;s decision and the approval of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, a contingent of 150 members of the Defence Forces will deploy, as part of a joint Finnish-Irish unit on 31 October.</P>
        <P>The EU will use all of the instruments at its disposal to support the reconstruction of Lebanon and the full implementation of Resolution 1701.  Our Government has responded rapidly and effectively to the needs of the Lebanese people.  During the crisis we committed a total of &euro;1.3 million in immediate emergency humanitarian assistance and we have also pledged a further &euro;2 million for longer-term reconstruction and assistance in Lebanon and the occupied territories over the next two years.</P>
        <P>Our UNIFIL contingent will also engage in humanitarian work, including the dangerous work of clearing unexploded ordnance.  Our Government has made clear its very serious concern at the terrible risk posed to the civilian population of the area by the large number of exploded cluster munitions and we have backed the UN in its criticism of the Israeli army in this regard.  We have also been active on the issue at international level, along with a small group of other states.  At the forthcoming Review Conference of the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons in Geneva we will again call for agreement on the opening of negotiations for a legally binding international instrument to address the humanitarian concerns posed by cluster munitions.</P>
        <P>The violence in Lebanon shocked the world, however it pales in comparison to the daily slaughter in Iraq.  There are no simple solutions to the increasing divisions in Iraq and there is no sign at present that the insurgency and the inter-<Col N="1734"/>communal violence are being brought under control.  The EU continues to support the efforts of the national unity government formed last May on the basis of democratic elections.  The reality is that this government has requested the continued presence of the international force, which is mandated by the UN Security Council, until the end of 2006.</P>
        <P>Iraq has vast reserves of natural resources which should provide the basis for its prosperity and stability and the Iraqi people deserve a better future after years of war and dictatorship.  The historic divisions between the communities of that region of the Middle East are deep.  Nonetheless, the EU remains convinced that Iraq&rsquo;s future will be assured only through its territorial integrity and the development of strong political and economic links with all of the countries of its neighbouring region.</P>
        <P>It is obvious that Iran has a particularly important role to play in relation to Iraq and it can also play a leading role in underpinning regional security.  Iran could be a hugely constructive influence in support of a historic settlement of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the EU wants to develop a closer, more productive, relationship with that country.  We believe it is possible to develop such a relationship through patient and constructive diplomacy on all sides.</P>
        <P>We have, at the same time, serious concerns about Iran&rsquo;s role in the region and about the deterioration in the Iranian human rights situation.  I therefore welcome moves towards a meaningful resumption of the human rights dialogue between Iran and the EU.</P>
        <P>Inevitably, however, our current concerns are dominated by the nuclear issue.  Our Government, in common with our EU Partners, wants to see a diplomatic solution to this serious matter.  We call on Iran, even at this stage, to respond positively to the imaginative and wide-ranging proposals which have been presented to it.  We fully support the efforts of the EU three on behalf of the EU.  We share the disappointment at the lack of progress in the sustained efforts of High Representative Solana to encourage Iran to address the requirements of the International Atomic Energy Agency, IAEA, and the UN Security Council and return to talks on long-term arrangements.  The core issue remains the suspension of enrichment activities.</P>
        <P Just="Left">At its meeting in Luxembourg yesterday, the General Affairs and External Relations Council, at which I represented Ireland, agreed that Iran&rsquo;s continuation of enrichment related activities has left the EU with no choice.  The EU will support consultations in the UN Security Council on further action, including some form of sanctions.  We deeply regret that this impasse has been reached.  However, it is essential that the will of the international community and the authority of the Security Council be respected.  At all stages in this process the preferred option of negotiations will remain on the table.</P><Col N="1735"/>
        <P>The Government shares the grave concern about the continuing crisis in the occupied Palestinian territories.  The situation in Gaza in particular is unsustainable.  Our Government has been among the strongest supporters internationally of the establishment of a democratic, sovereign and independent Palestinian state, living in peace and security alongside the state of Israel.  Since 1993, the EU has taken the lead under the Oslo process in supporting the building of the institutions of a future state.</P>
        <P>The process has reached a critical point this year.  The democratic Palestinian elections in January last gave Hamas an absolute majority of seats in the legislative council.  The Quartet set out clearly the principles which Hamas must adhere to in government if it is to engage with the international community.  There is a strong international consensus that Hamas must complete its transition to politics and commit unambiguously to the peace process.  Despite the efforts of many, it still has not done so.  The terrible violence since last June has further undermined the prospects for political progress.  We continue to give strong support to the courageous efforts of President Mahmoud Abbas to negotiate a Palestinian Government of national unity committed to a two-state solution and reflecting the Quartet principles.  Progress has been slow.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There have been setbacks.  The President&rsquo;s work has been complicated by the recent violence between armed Palestinian groups in Gaza and the West Bank.  However the Government has stated consistently that if President Abbas succeeds in forming a government seriously committed to the peace process and based on an end to violence, Ireland will argue strongly for a positive and creative political response by the EU.</P>
        <P>The political hopes of the Palestinian people have been disappointed repeatedly but it is clear that they remain committed to the vision of a two-state solution.  In Israel the limits of the temptation to unilateralism have been revealed by the dreadful violence of this past summer.  The EU now has a central role to play with its international and regional partners in encouraging Israeli and Palestinian political leaders to take the difficult decisions required for peace in the region.  We want to see an early and substantive meeting between Prime Minister Olmert and President Abbas and an active commitment to a solution based on the essentials of the Quartet roadmap.</P>
        <P>This roadmap, international law and the requirements of peace and security impose obligations on all of the parties.  The Palestinians must ensure an end to violence and terror against Israel and Israelis.  The Israeli Government must end the illegal construction of settlements, stop the illegal construction of the security barrier on occupied Palestinian land and end activities in and around East Jerusalem which threaten the viability of a two-state solution.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1736"/>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>What do we do if they do not?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelTracey"><NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
	<P>We shall deal with that later. The immediate priority must be to end the crisis in Gaza.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>We shall roll over.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelTracey"><NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
	<P>This must involve the ending of violence on all sides, including an end to rocket attacks on Israel and the complete withdrawal of Israeli forces.  The captured Israeli soldier must be freed.  The detained Palestinian legislators must be released from prison.  The closure of Gaza must be brought to an end through the re-opening of border crossing points for people and goods.  The EU has made it clear that it is ready to play its part locally.</P>
        <P>Despite a common misconception that the European Union has cut off assistance to the Palestinians, the member states of the Union are providing essential assistance at higher levels than at any time in recent years.  Community assistance administered by the European Commission stands at &euro;330 million so far this year &mdash; a third higher than the annual total over the past five years.  The EU has taken the lead in establishing a temporary international mechanism to channel assistance directly to the Palestinian people.</P>
        <P>We continue to impress on Israel the urgent need to resume the transfer of taxes and customs revenues to the Palestinian Authority, if necessary through this special mechanism.  The withholding of more than &euro;450 million since April last is the main component in the financial crisis facing the Palestinian Authority.  At national level Ireland&rsquo;s bilateral assistance will rise by about 25% this year to &euro;5.4 million.  I assure this House that the Government remains ready to respond further to the humanitarian needs of the Palestinian people.</P>
        <P>The building of a momentum for peace in the Middle East represents the greatest challenge to date for the foreign policy of the European Union.  The Government and our partners are determined that the challenge will be met in the interests of all the people of the region.  I warmly welcome the opportunity to hear the views of the Members of Seanad &Eacute;ireann here today.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State.  I realise time is short for discussing this important issue so I will try to keep my comments as brief as possible.</P>
        <P>The issues in the Middle East, whether it is the Palestinian conflict or the situations in Iraq or Iran, are all deeply profound and have been debated <i>ad nauseam</i> in this House.  It is regrettable that since we last spoke, all these situations have worsened.  Now the urgency of a response from the international community is more important than ever.  I agree with most of what the Minister of State has said to some degree.  The <Col N="1737"/>question now, however, is where the political priorities lie and what the emphasis will be.</P>
        <P>The conflict in the Middle East over the summer months was tragic and disastrous.  While recognising the right of Israel to defend itself, its response to the initial dispute was very much over the top and has caused very grave difficulties.  We recognise that the two-state solution which we have spoken about so often in this House &mdash; the so-called Quartet roadmap solution &mdash; is the only political show in town.  It is a question of trying to get that process back on the road to have political attention focused on this issue.  Without a permanent political solution, the sad events of the summer will be repeated.</P>
        <P>The Israeli response was excessive, has caused enormous humanitarian hardship and left an enormous level of civilian casualties in its wake.  It has undone much of the good economic work achieved in rebuilding Lebanon in recent years and that is regrettable.  The civil war in Lebanon from 1975 to the early 1990s profoundly damaged that country.  We thought that trend had been reversed but, alas, the tragedy of the summer conflicts has made matters worse.</P>
        <P>Obviously there was a need for the international community and the United Nations to intervene.  Fine Gael is very happy to welcome the decision of the Government to deploy a contingent of the Defence Forces in the Lebanon.  We have a very long and distinguished record in this regard and Irish soldiers will play a genuinely constructive role locally.  Our efforts in this regard will be helpful.  One of the issues which the Fine Gael D&aacute;il spokesman on defence, Deputy Timmins, has raised with the Government is the need for the Joint Committee on Justice Equality Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights to take a much greater hands-on role in reviewing this issue.  He has urged that the committee have its remit considered.  That is something I hope the Minister for Defence will consider.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The situation in Iraq this has been debated in this House on five or six occasions over the past two years.  Sadly, it has become even more tragic.  At a conservative estimate hundreds of civilians lose their lives there every day and it is a civil war situation.  What can be done?  The invasion and what it has caused can be replayed over and over.  A shocking statistic, which claims more than 600,000 people have died as a result of the Iraq conflict, was released last week.  I am not sure how accurate it is &mdash; it is probably being disputed.  Killing on that scale is shocking.  It shows the invasion and its aftermath has not solved a problem but rather made it worse.</P>
        <P>Where do we go from here?  Pressure is mounting for the withdrawal of British and American troops.  I am not a military expert and I am not sure what the immediate effect of such a withdrawal would be.  Someone needs to take charge.  It is now time for the United Nations to call an international conference bringing together all the parties involved to put in place a roadmap that charts the way forward.  We cannot stand by and <Col N="1738"/>leave things as they are.  While it is easy to be critical we must try to be constructive.  There must surely now be political will in both London and Washington to find a solution to this dreadful morass of murder and mayhem.  A UN-sponsored international conference would allow some degree of dialogue and might determine the bones of a long-term settlement.  The number of deaths reported is a human tragedy on an unimaginable scale.</P>
        <P>The other issue that needs to be urgently examined is the reconstruction money committed for the rebuilding of Iraq.  A UN Security Council resolution in May of 2003 established a development fund for Iraq.  This fund was to preside over the spending of moneys from Iraqi oil and other seized assets to help rebuild the country.  There are doubts about how this money is being spent.  There are questions about its practical impact and whether the citizens of Iraq are benefiting from it.  These are significant moneys and their expenditure needs to be investigated.  We must try to ensure some degree of help, hope and confidence is given to Iraqi citizens.  The United Nations should also examine this issue.</P>
        <P>I concur with what the Minister of State has said about Iran.  It is opportune to speak about Iran&rsquo;s nuclear programme when we have seen what has happened in North Korea in recent days.  We can be critical of the United Nations from time to time &mdash; sometimes we can be critical of the critics of the UN &mdash; yet when Iran, North Korea, or rogue states appear to give two fingers to it, it makes the UN look powerless.  We must redouble our political engagement with Iran to ensure its nuclear capability is not used for destructive military purposes.  The region will become much more dangerous if Iran is allowed to develop nuclear weapons.</P>
        <P>The scale of the threat from North Korea must be a lesson to us as to what can happen.  I am unsure of the full military capability of North Korea&rsquo;s nuclear weaponry.  Unless the international community pulls together, what is happening in North Korea today could happen in Iran tomorrow.  The UN is the only hope for taking charge of this process.  It may need reform and more teeth, but it is the only show in town.  Whether it is a conference to deal with Iraq, or a get-together to deal with Iran, the Government must work to have the UN redouble its negotiation and mediation efforts.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>I too welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, to the House.  I am pleased he has returned refreshed from his recent exertions.  The assertion by some elements of the media that Deputy Treacy needed that type of publicity to gain a profile showed an appalling ignorance of the political system and the role he has played not only here and in his Galway East constituency, but representing Ireland as our Minister with responsibility for European affairs in many international fora.  In his speech to the House, he informed us he represented Ireland at <Col N="1739"/>a critical meeting in Luxembourg yesterday.  This perceived lack of profile is more a reflection on the ignorance of those journalists than it is on the Minister of State.  I have wanted to say this for the past week, and I am glad I have the opportunity of saying it in his presence.  He is someone for whom we have great respect and admiration, apart from the affection we hold for him personally in the House.</P>
        <P>I am a member of the Association of Liberal Democrats for Europe within the Council of Europe.  At a recent meeting we listened with great sympathy to the story of Karnit Goldwasser, the wife of Udi Goldwasser, one of the three IDF soldiers kidnapped on 12 July 2006 by Hizbollah.  I have in my hand a photograph of the couple on their wedding day which took place on 14 October last year.  He is still in captivity.  Karnit&rsquo;s story brought home to us the human dimension to the unfolding tragedy of the Israeli-Lebanon war and the impact it continues to have on families in both countries.  Udi Goldwasser is one of three IDF solders kidnapped, the others are Gilad Shalit and Eldad Regev.  The European Union has called for their immediate release and the group of which I am a member supports the call.</P>
        <P>The Israeli army, I am glad to say, has now withdrawn from all of Lebanon.  UNIFIL has deployed 5,000 international troops in south Lebanon alongside units of the Lebanese army.  I welcome Ireland&rsquo;s decision to contribute 150 peacekeepers to the new force.  The first stage has now been completed and full deployment is on course for November.</P>
        <P>Let us not forget that the immediate cause of the recent conflict was an unprovoked attack by Hizbollah on Israeli territory on 12 July.  Official Lebanese figures put the number of Lebanese deaths at 1,191, with 4,405 injured.  The UN estimates that some 30,000 homes were damaged or destroyed, and physical damage amounting to between &euro;3 billion and &euro;6 billion was inflicted by Israeli attacks.</P>
        <P>I am not taking account of the hundreds of thousands of cluster bombs which were dropped almost exclusively in civilian areas&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Will Senator Mooney show us photographs of the children injured by those bombs?  It would be good to see a photograph of the children as well as the photograph of the Israeli soldier.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>Please allow Senator Mooney to proceed without interruption.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Israeli Government and the IDF dropped some 300,000 cluster bombs, mainly in civilian areas.  I understand there is no international legal prohibition on this.  However, there are moves to introduce such a prohibition and it will not be before time.  One could not help but be moved by stories, graphic photographs and <Col N="1740"/>television footage that we have seen of innocent south Lebanese husbands, daughters, sisters and children who have been incapacitated as a result of stepping on these outrageous pieces of ordnance.</P>
        <P>The outcome of the war has been hailed by Hizbollah as a victory over Israel.  This poses a considerable challenge to a weak central government in which Hizbollah holds two cabinet positions.  The society is still marked by deep inter-communal tensions.  The challenge of disarmament remains.  Sheikh Nazrallah claimed at a rally in Beirut recently that the organisation still holds 20,000 rockets.  The United Nations Secretary General has stated that the disarmament of Hizbollah will only be possible as part of the political process.</P>
        <P>There are also territorial disputes remaining, particularly the status of the Shebaa Farms, which the UN has concluded were on Syrian territory, but those and other matters will have to be resolved in the context of a comprehensive settlement involving Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights.</P>
        <P>We must support the efforts of Prime Minister Fouad Siniora and those of our Government as outlined by the Minster of State, Deputy Treacy, in his contribution.  Not only must we support the Prime Minister and his Government but we must support them in reasserting their authority in the wake of the war.  They will require strong international support.  Unfortunately, due to the complex power sharing arrangements between the diverse religious groups in place since the end of the civil war in 1989, successive Governments have been inherently weak and fractious.  That lack of a strong central authority has been exploited both by neighbouring states such as Syria and groups such as Hizbollah.</P>
        <P>I welcome the EU-Lebanon ENP action plan agreed at the Stockholm Conference for Lebanon&rsquo;s early recovery on 31 March, which provides an agreed framework through which the EU can assist the Government in implementing its reform agenda.  The territorial integrity of the sovereign state of Lebanon must be restored and strengthened and the people of all Lebanon allowed to rebuild their lives in peace, security and prosperity, free of outside interference by proxy armies or those who have interfered in the affairs of that country to the detriment of its people and of the wider Middle East.</P>
        <P>In the aftermath of the war, the scale of the humanitarian disaster which has befallen the people of the region cannot be underestimated.  While the majority of internally displaced people have returned to their homes earlier than expected following the ceasefire, the immediate humanitarian concern I raised earlier but want to repeat because it is an outrage to humanity, is the existence of thousands of unexploded ordinance in the cluster bombs, which at the time of my research had claimed the lives of some 12 people and dozens wounded.  The consequences may be even worse now.</P><Col N="1741"/>
        <P>Senior UN figures have condemned Israel for using such weapons and I, too, share that condemnation.  It is unacceptable in any theatre of war, especially when it is directed at a civilian population.  The Israelis say the reason they dropped them in that location was because Hizbollah fighters were operating out of civilian locations.  That is unacceptable.  The vast majority of that ordinance was dropped by the Israeli air force in the final days of the conflict, which makes it even more unpalatable.  Knowing it would have to pull out, that was the legacy it has left to the innocents of south Lebanon.</P>
        <P>Several countries are currently co-ordinating their efforts at the UN and in Geneva for the negotiation of a legally binding instrument that addresses the humanitarian concerns posed by cluster munitions.  I hope the Minister of State, if he has an opportunity to reply, will endorse that Ireland fully supports that initiative.</P>
        <P>The Israeli Government has not yet adequately explained the reason its fighter jets demolished a clearly marked UN observation post in south Lebanon during the war, killing several UN personnel on peacekeeping duties.  That happened despite the urgent appeals &mdash; nine in all &mdash; to the IDF commanders on the day of the bombings informing them of the UN presence.  We await the outcome of the internal investigation by Israel with great interest.</P>
        <P>Ireland has a particular interest in this matter because the urgent appeals that were sent to the commanders on the day came from an Irish UN staff officer who, by the mercy of God, was outside the building.  Had he been inside it he would have been killed and we would have had another State funeral for yet another Irish peacekeeper while the Israelis continue to deny that it was anything other than an accident.</P>
        <P>Any debate on Lebanon cannot ignore the developing situation in Palestine and Israel, to which the Minister of State referred.  The proposed meeting between Prime Minister Olmert and President Abbas is to be welcomed with a view to relaunching negotiations.  There was an announcement by President Abbas on an agreement to form a government of national unity between the Fatah and Hammas factions. However, recent events suggest that President Abbas is finding it extremely difficult to agree on a coalition government with Hammas and he is now contemplating calling early elections to perhaps re-establish Fatah.  If it leads to some political stability, however, it is to be welcomed.</P>
        <P>We should support the Minister&rsquo;s call for a freezing of all settlement activity, including natural growth in settlements.  The decision by Ministers of the EU not to recognise any changes to the pre-1967 borders, other than those agreed by both parties, and the decision by the EU to expand the temporary international mechanisms, again referred to by the Minister, whereby substantial resources have already been channelled directly to the Palestinian people, are to be welcomed.  We call on Israel to resume transfers of <Col N="1742"/>withheld Palestinian tax, as the Minister has done, and custom revenues, some &euro;450 million in all.  Israel should, as a humanitarian gesture, immediately reopen the Rafah and all other border crossings, and allow them remain open.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I also welcome the Minister of State to the House and I welcome the tone of his speech.  It is significantly different from some of the earlier speeches delivered on this subject in this House.  I also welcome very much the balanced speech of Senator Mooney, particularly his condemnation of the use of cluster bombs.  He is right.  That was condemned by the most senior humanitarian official as an international war crime, which is what it is, and those responsible should be brought to justice.  I say that as somebody who has traditionally supported Israel.  I love that country and I love its people, whom I know well.</P>
        <P>I want to make a specific and urgent request to the Minister.  I am proud to say that my former partner, Ezra Yitzhak, is an Israeli born native Jewish citizen of Israel who, like many in Israel, is a man of conscience and who opposes the criminal activities of his government.  He is involved particularly in the building of clinics providing sheltered housing to the indigenous inhabitants, the native people, of the villages in south Hebron, particularly a village called Al Toani.  They have been building facilities for health, sewerage and so on.  It has been announced in <i>Al Haaretz</i>, the Israeli newspaper, that the Israeli Government has been under pressure from the international community to demolish some of the illegal settlements.  It now proposes to do that.  The Israeli military is moving to do that as we speak but for political reasons, in order to counter criticism, the Israeli Government is cynically preparing to instruct the military to demolish clinics and houses in Al Toani.  Those communities are under the most severe threat. I ask the Minister to contact Jerusalem through the Israeli ambassador and urgently request that any such action be halted and indicate to them that any such action, which is clearly illegal, will be regis<Col N="1743"/>tered and remembered, and those responsible held to account.</P>
        <P>I am glad the question of cluster bombs was mentioned.  That was an outrage.  The whole adventure in Lebanon was a disastrous mistake.  I could not understand how the Israelis could allow themselves to be lured in, and the pretext was nonsensical.  Did the kidnapping of two soldiers require the massive invasion, the colossal destruction and the huge loss of life?  That from the people who use targeted assassination.</P>
        <P>Let us hear it for the very considerable number of Palestinian parliamentary representatives who were kidnapped.  They were not arrested or detained.  They were illegally kidnapped.  I regularly attend the interparliamentary union and have been very lucky to be selected many times.  The treatment of parliamentarians, their human rights and their immunity from this sort of action is one of the standard items on the order paper of the IPU yet there was scarcely a peep about it.  I was glad the Minister of State mentioned it in his contribution.</P>
        <P>Senator Mooney mentioned the cluster bombs.  There have been many other events that were clear and gross violations of human rights.  I would like the Minister of State and his advisers to ponder this question because I have raised it in the past 18 months to two years in the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, that is, the matter of the external association agreement between Israel and the European Union.  There are human rights protocols attached to that which are supposed to be triggered by violations of human rights.  Will the Minister of State explain the reason they have not been triggered?  Has Ireland played a role in raising that issue in the forum of the European Union?  We must be honest.  It does a disservice to human rights to attach those kind of provisions to a treaty and then ignore them and treat them with contempt.  Those matters should be examined.  The situation in the Middle East is not confined to Israel and Lebanon, although that is one of the most urgent cases.  The situation in Iraq is very dangerous and is getting worse, as we predicted before the invasion began.  This prediction came not only from the Opposition.  Senators &Oacute; Murch&uacute;, Minihan, Mooney and Dardis stated the same thing.  Coalition forces are now getting ready to withdraw and beat a retreat from Iraq.  The invasion was not programmed; it was brutal, ham-fisted and blunt.</P>
        <P>The withdrawal must be correctly carried out in a regular way.  Otherwise, the catastrophe will be even worse.  The head of the British army, James Baker and others are choreographing the withdrawal.  The old saying in America used to be: &ldquo;If you break it, you take it.&rdquo;  The Americans are now blaming the Iraqis for the mess.  Let nobody forget that they created it.  It is reported that levels of torture in Iraq are now worse than under Saddam Hussein.  Sunni and Shia groups have confirmed this.  How can we be proud of that record and what will we do about it?</P><Col N="1744"/>
        <P>Regarding the ludicrous trial of Saddam Hussein, I opposed Saddam Hussein while Ireland sold beef to him for his army so I hold no brief for him.  I had a row about human rights in Baghdad.  His trial is a farce.  Defence lawyers cannot be protected and every so often another is assassinated.  The trial is grossly prejudiced and could not continue in a European country because the Iraqi Government has already found him guilty in press statements and has decided what to do with him, namely, kill him.  A judge at the trial has been removed because he was believed to be favourable to the defendant.  That will make a martyr of Saddam Hussein and this is nothing other than a botched trial.</P>
        <P Just="Left">What is the point of the war on terror?  I commend to the Minister and his observers an interesting article in <i>The Irish Times</i> by David Keen, of whom I had not heard until today.  The headline states &ldquo;Winning &lsquo;war on terror&rsquo; may be irrelevant&rdquo; and the article confirms some of my nastiest suspicions.  It confirms the accuracy of the prophecy made by President Eisenhower in 1957-58 when he stated that the greatest threat to America was not communism but the takeover of the apparatus of government by the military-industrial complex.  That is what has happened in America under President Bush.</P>
        <P>The operations of the American Government often seem to be counter-productive.  The stated foreign policy aims of the US are being contradicted by results.  We all think President Bush is stupid but he cannot be that stupid.  What is behind this policy is very sinister.</P>
        <P>The article reads, &ldquo;tactics which actively promote the strength of the enemy have been widely adopted; they have also been maintained even when it has become clear that, from a military point of view, they are counter-productive&rdquo;.  The reason suggested is a political one.  As Hannah Arendt confirmed in her analysis of attitudes in Germany after the First World War, it is very politically effective to have a vague, diffuse enemy that one can blame for everything.  It is also usefully economically.  The article states:</P>
        <P LI="1">One key aim has been to make money.  US interest in Afghanistan has been inseparable from the oil and gas fields of the Caspian, just as US interest in Iraq has been linked to the oil.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">Beyond this, there is the vast US military-industrial infrastructure which burgeoned during the Cold War.  In this &ldquo;war&rdquo;, too, the (Soviet) enemy was not engaged directly: that would obviously have been suicidal; instead, the casualties were mostly exported to civilians and soldiers in Third World countries hosting proxy wars and to those Americans (often poor, often black) recruited into the proxy war in Vietnam.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This is what is happening in Iraq.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State must tell us the truth about Shannon Airport.  A number of Senators have consistently raised this matter.  It is unacceptable for the Government to answer <Col N="1745"/>questions that have not been asked and to respond to statements that have not been made.  I never stated I knew that people were brought through Shannon Airport in shackles, although it is possible.  What is incontrovertible is that some kidnapping expeditions, whose ultimate product was to yield innocent people to torture in some of the most barbarous regimes in the Middle East, were assisted by refuelling in Shannon Airport.  Under international law we are complicit.  That was the finding of the Marty report and the Secretary General of the Council of the European Union confirmed it and stated that it was a liability.</P>
        <P>I knew that the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, would state that he knew nothing about it.  I arranged to have the correspondence I sent to the Department of Foreign Affairs and the debates in this House forwarded.  I hope this material was used and that the Government was embarrassed.  It has every reason to be so embarrassed.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnMinihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Minihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I also welcome the Government&rsquo;s decision to participate in the United Nations mission in Lebanon, UNIFIL II, and its continuing efforts to bring about peace in this region.</P>
        <P>We last spoke on the Middle East on 5 July.  We were concerned that the kidnap of an Israeli soldier, Corporal Shalit, by Hamas supporters based in Gaza would lead to an escalating crisis and eventually military conflict between the Palestinian Authority and Israel.  I stated that the Israeli reaction to the abduction was a questionable response to a complex situation by an untried and inexperienced Israeli Government.  Today, Corporal Shalit is still held captive but, I am glad to say, appears to be alive.  In mid-September, Egyptian mediators negotiating with Hamas on behalf of the Israeli Government received a letter from him.  I hope he will be released sooner rather than later.</P>
        <P>I am relieved that wiser heads have prevailed in the resolution of this situation, that the military escalation has been halted and that the two sides are talking, if only through proxies.  It is unfortu<Col N="1746"/>nate though that this moderation has only been achieved as a result of the tragic events that unfolded in Lebanon this summer.  While I do not wish to place the blame for those unfortunate events to one side, it is important to understand them if we are to prevent a recurrence of such bloodshed.</P>
        <P>The trigger for these events was the abduction on 12 July of two Israeli soldiers by Hizbollah.  Hizbollah claims that this action was justified as a response to the Israeli occupation of the Shebaa Farms border area, which Lebanon claims but which the United Nations says is Israeli-occupied Syrian soil.  There can be no justification for the criminally reckless Hizbollah action.  Its leadership knew, or ought to have known, how the untried and inexperienced Israeli Government, already under considerable pressure from its own hawks over missile attacks and Gaza, would react.  That it risked the lives of its own fighters from the inevitable Israeli retaliation is the business of Hizbollah.  That it risked the lives of ordinary Lebanese citizens is unconscionable.</P>
        <P>Israel too must analyse the part it played in the resultant bloodshed.  I do not deny the right of any nation to defend itself against aggressors but those aggressors must be properly identified and targeted.  Indiscriminate, disproportionate targeting of the civilian population and of Lebanon&rsquo;s infrastructure has no part in international relations.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>I echo the comments made by Senator Mooney regarding the Canadian UNTSO officers who lost their lives and the part played by a former colleague, Commandant John Molloy, a UNIFIL liaison officer, who made nine calls.  As a former UNIFIL officer, this process has many unanswered questions.  The UNTSO observation post has been in place for over 30 years.  It was marked on maps, flagged and clearly identifiable.  Military weaponry is so sophisticated that the grid references for any firing in an area are computerised.  If there is any slippage, a firing close comes in, a call is made and the weapons are readjusted.  The fact that Commandant Molloy made nine calls but no action was taken and the Canadian officers lost their lives poses many questions for me as an army officer who has been in the same situation.</P>
        <?oasys _cl11- ?><P>Lebanon and its Government should also examine the part it played in the tragedy and how the situation unfolded on its southern border.  While Lebanon and its people were undoubtedly the victims in the conflict between Israel and Hizbollah, successive Lebanese governments must share some of the responsibility.  Since the final withdrawal of Israeli forces from Lebanon, the disputed Shebaa farms apart, successive Lebanese governments have failed to exercise full sovereignty over all Lebanese territory and have failed to disarm and disband the militias as envisaged in United Nations Resolution 1559.</P>
        <P>Turning to the future, the tragic and senseless killing in southern Lebanon has thankfully ended.  We now have a new UN resolution, 1701, and <Col N="1747"/>a new mandate, known as UNIFIL II.  This new mandate envisages an increase in number of UN troops in Lebanon to 15,000, to include a contingent of approximately 150 Defence Force personnel as part of a joint Finnish-Irish unit.  I understand that our personnel will be tasked primarily for reconnaissance, security and protection duties associated with the engineering works undertaken by the Finnish contingent.  We will also be giving specialised assistance in the area of explosive ordnance disposal and the clearing of mines.</P>
        <P>Cluster bombs have been referred to in this debate and I also wish to echo the comments made in this regard.  A cluster bomb is a most despicable weapon.  It explodes mid-air and spreads small bombs and mines widely over a very large area.  Children pick up these small bombs and mines and people walk on them.  Such bombs are very difficult to control and detect.  I hope the international community moves to ban the use of cluster bombs.</P>
        <P>When Irish troops last withdrew from Lebanon in November 2001, I, like many people, hoped that we would finally be drawing a line under that chapter of the Defence Force&rsquo;s involvement in Lebanon.  It is a chapter that reflects well on this country and its commitment to the UN.  We all believed that we had left Lebanon a better and safer place than when we found it.  Unfortunately, we have been called back to write a postscript, nevertheless, I am sure that this generation of Irish soldiers will rise to the challenge just as successfully as their predecessors.</P>
        <P>I wish to emphasise the value of Irish soldiers in Lebanon.  We have spent a considerable amount of time there and many Irish lives are entwined with Lebanon.  This country has played a considerable part in the affairs of Lebanon.  My first tour of duty in Lebanon was in 1983.  At that time, villages were deserted.  When I returned in 1986, 1988 and 1989, I saw those villages reinhabited,  commerce and local government underway and people being able to go about their normal daily lives.  This is what we achieved.  It was so distressing this summer to see all this work undone.</P>
        <P>I hope this early intervention will enable us to be in a position to again restore this stability.  I conclude by wishing our Defence Force personnel God speed and safe home.  Finally, lest we forget that the three Israeli soldiers at the centre of this summer&rsquo;s events are still captive, I hope it will not be long before they are reunited with their families.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Acting Leader for amending the Order of Business to allow me to make a few comments.  I welcome the Minister of State to the debate.  I apologise to Senator Mooney for shouting at him.  I believe it is unwise to deal in visual images because we could get into a competition over which visual images are worst and such images would get worse and worse.  Many Members from all sides of the House take <Col N="1748"/>great exception to some of the campaigns concerning abortion which involve the use of the most appalling visual images.  Perhaps we use visual images too well in other areas.  </P>
        <P>I do not wish to launch into a denunciation of the Government.  I find what has happened in the Middle East so distressing and disturbing that I move beyond political denunciation.  Since I do not wish to use silly language, I will only say it is a pity we have retreated from a position of independence.  It may be the consequence of EU membership, the collapse of the Soviet Union, affluence or the decline in the influence of the Church and its institutions.</P>
        <P>The timidity of our Government and the EU is, to put it mildly, profoundly disappointing.  Timidity is the only word one can use to describe it.  Intellectual hoops have been jumped through to justify the peculiar and extraordinary treatment of Hamas.  People have spoken about the need to support moderate governments in the Middle East by contrast with governments like the Hamas-led Government in Palestine.  The royal family in Saudi Arabia, which is composed of Wahhabi Muslim fanatics and out of whom comes the ideology of Osama Bin Laden, is deemed to be moderate, while the secularist Baath party in Syria and, formerly, Iraq is deemed to be extremist.</P>
        <P>One ends up in extraordinary moral quagmires if one does not fundamentally state that what we want to see in the Middle East &mdash; Iraq, Iran, Syria, Israel and Palestine &mdash; is a just settlement and that our position is that of even-handedly and carefully supporting justice.  This is why the selective use of language is so bad for our perception of independence.  We use language about Hamas and Hizbollah which is correct but then we look at the deaths of 650,000 people in Iraq.  I acknowledge that this is not a precise figure.  The authors of the report in question accept that there is an inaccuracy of approximately plus or minus 50%.  The figure could be 300,000 or 900,000.</P>
        <P>May God forgive me but I do not think this really matters.  Irrespective of whether the figure is 300,000 or 900,000, it is a blot on the sense of morality of the Western world that anybody could believe that this cause was worth that consequence and that the achievement of elimination of Saddam Hussein was worth this.  Those nearest to us in London and further away in Washington, DC, have effectively said that and, in some cases, have attempted to argue with the figures.  However, on this occasion, it was a half-hearted argument.  We now know the scale of it.</P>
        <P>Today, seven young Americans were killed in Iraq in pursuit of this now impossible target of achieving some sort of stabilisation.  I appeal to the Government to get off the fence and speak for the Irish people about what they see to be the profoundly amoral and dangerously polarised world that is being constructed in which the Western world is ranged on one side and an increasingly alienated, hostile and negatively disposed Islamic world is ranged on the other side.  Islam <Col N="1749"/>is a religion of considerable nobility and generosity.  It has a record of religious tolerance from which Christians could learn.  During most of the existence of Islam, pogroms of Jews or Christians did not occur in Islamic countries.  They were not perfectly treated but a pogrom never occurred.</P>
        <P>The people of this country want something they used to have, namely, a brave and independent foreign policy which calls death by violence and murder &ldquo;murder&rdquo; regardless of who carries it out.  It states to all participants in an horrendous and horrific struggle whatever their position and alliance that when one kills other people in pursuit of a political objective one is profoundly wrong and acting in a manner destructive for the future.  Will the Government resume the position Ireland used to have in the face of horrific abuse by superpowers?  I hope it will result from this debate.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelTracey"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
	<P>I sincerely thank all Senators for their contributions to the debate on the serious situation in the Middle East, which is vital for regional stability and of important strategic interest for the European Union.  In particular, I thank Senators Bradford, Mooney, Norris, Minihan and Ryan, and Senator Henry who is in the Chair.</P>
        <P>We have an obligation imposed by history and geography and a strong interest as Europeans in promoting peace, stability, democracy and respect for human rights for the people of the Middle East.  I assure Senator Ryan our foreign policy is as strong, independent and focused today as it ever was.  We believe in the fundamental rules of human rights, justice, equity, fairness, democracy, independence and sovereignty for all peoples.  We make our position clear in every fora across the world at which we are represented both politically and diplomatically and that will continue.  Ireland&rsquo;s even-handed treatment of all peoples involved in problems throughout the world earned us respect during the past decades.</P>
        <P>The House agrees the interrelated problems of the Middle East cannot be addressed through unilateral or military action by any party or the international community.  The only way forward is to revive the work of developing a comprehensive plan for peace in the region with the negotiation of a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict at its core.  This will require difficult compromises on all sides and the full involvement of the international community.</P>
        <P>The festering of the Palestinian issue continues to generate conflict throughout the region and beyond.  The Government agrees it must be addressed with new urgency in view of the terrible crises of recent months.  The European Union has a particularly important role to play and we fully support the work it does.  The High Representative, Mr. Solana, will be there on <Col N="1750"/>behalf of the EU for the next seven days to attempt to make progress as a result of our meetings during the past two days in Luxembourg.</P>
        <P>I represented the Government at the meeting of the General Affairs and External Relations Council in Luxembourg yesterday.  Member states fully agreed we must continue to encourage President Abbas to negotiate the formation of a politically-based national unity government.  The European Union is ready to respond to the formation of a government which is truly committed to the negotiation of a two-State solution based on an end to violence.  Ireland will argue strongly for a positive EU response and continued EU engagement to support negotiations between President Abbas and Prime Minister Olmert based on the essentials of the roadmap and the rights of the Israeli and Palestinian peoples under international law.</P>
        <P>We firmly believe that following years of diminishing hope in the region revitalising a credible peace process between Israel and the Palestinians would have an important positive effect on the situation in neighbouring countries.  The region has no alternative but to renew negotiations on all tracks with the involvement of all parties on the basis of their acceptance of certain fundamental principles.</P>
        <P>I assure Senator Norris we will raise, through our Ambassador in Tel Aviv, the concerns he raised regarding the reported intentions of the Israeli army to destroy clinics and buildings in a village near Hebron.  We are aware of the valuable work undertaken by his former partner, an Israeli citizen.  It is absolutely clear the dismantling of illegal Israeli outposts must be undertaken urgently and should not be compensated for by the destruction of other properties.</P>
        <P>The use of Shannon Airport by the US military is a long-established practice.  Ireland has made overflight and landing facilities available to the United States for 50 years, during which these facilities have never been withdrawn or suspended.  D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann fully approved the Government&rsquo;s decision not to withdraw facilities following an extensive debate on 20 March 2003.  The legality of the presence of the multinational force in Iraq is assured by UN Security Council Resolution 1546 of 8 June 2004 and 1637 of 8 November 2005 and by the request of the Iraqi Government.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Government received specific categorical assurances from the United States authorities, confirmed by the US Secretary of State, Dr. Condoleezza Rice, that prisoners have not been transferred through Irish territory not would they be without our permission.  No one presented any evidence whatsoever to cast doubt on the validity of these assurances.  It has been the Government&rsquo;s consistent position that we will co-operate fully with the investigations of the Council of Europe, where I attended meetings, and the European Parliament into this matter.  In this context, Senators will be aware the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, accepted an invi<Col N="1751"/>tation to address the European Parliament&rsquo;s temporary committee on the matter, which he hopes to take up in late November.</P>
        <P>I thank the House for its positive debate and continuous interest in the serious situation in the Middle East region.  The Government, along with the full support of the Seanad, is aware of the seriousness of the situation.  We will continue to raise it at every opportunity and give all support possible to the people in the region and to the European Union to ensure that with the United Nations we can work to bring peace, stability and security to the region as quickly as possible.</P>

    <Title>Pre-Nuptial Agreements: Motion. </Title>
      <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I  move:</P>
        <P LI="1">That Seanad &Eacute;ireann:</P>
        <P FLI="0"><Miles com="mdash142" />calls on the Attorney General to request the Law Reform Commission to produce a report examining the current status of Pre-Nuptial Agreements in Irish Courts; and to investigate the consequences of their possible introduction and the impact on the constitutional and legal rights of spouses and children; and that this Report to be laid before the House within a period of 9 months or sooner if possible.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">This issue has interested me for a long while.  It received a lot of publicity through celebrity weddings such as that of Michael Douglas and, more recently, Michael Flatley.  It also received publicity through recent news on the divorce proceedings of Sir Paul McCartney.  However, my interest in this area comes from the angle of the ordinary person who may not realise he or she owns considerable assets prior to marriage.  The average age of brides and grooms has increased from the mid-20s in 1986 to the mid-30s in 2002.  That average age is increasing but they are the most up-to-date figures available.</P>
        <P>It is not uncommon for both members of a young marrying couple to own property acquired independently of each other.  A considerable group of Irish people re-marry later in life.  In 2002, 30,529 such people were in the State.  This figure is set to increase further in coming years.</P>
        <P>Unfortunately, every year 6,000 Irish couples formalise their marriage breakdown in Irish courts either through divorce or a judicial separation.  In Ireland one in four marriages breaks down, compared to one in three on the European mainland and one in two in the United States.  Unfortunately, Ireland is catching up on our European and US colleagues.  It is also worth noting the high rate of marriage breakdown among newlyweds together for less than two years.</P>
        <P Just="Left">At present, 15% of marriages in Ireland are bi-national.  Given that under a EU convention known as Brussels 2 people can shop around jurisdictions for a divorce, regimes operating in other countries have become extremely relevant.  Ireland and Britain are the only countries in the <Col N="1752"/>EU that do not have legislation on pre-nuptial agreements.  Given the significant numbers of Irish citizens marrying outside the State, this could lead to severe difficulties.  For example, if a person signs a pre-nuptial agreement in France, is it enforceable here?  Unfortunately we are in a twilight zone on that issue.  Legislation in this area has also been promised in Britain, and if it becomes law there, we will be the only EU state without it.  In Britain at present, pre-nuptial agreements are being taken into account during divorce cases even though, strictly speaking, they are not legal.</P>
        <P>My motion seeks to clarify the role of pre-nuptial agreements in Irish courts and to investigate any possible downside to their introduction.  Currently nothing prevents couples from signing a pre-nuptial agreement in Ireland but Irish courts are not obliged to enforce such an agreement should the parties divorce or separate at a later date.</P>
        <P>I can see great advantage in pre-nuptial agreements, particularly for those remarrying later in life who have children from a first marriage.  It is logical that ten years after the passing of the divorce referendum, where a couple opts to have a pre-nuptial agreement, the State should recognise it and it should be taken into account in the case of a divorce or legal separation.  A pre-nuptial agreement or statement of assets prior to marriage could help to resolve many difficulties both during and after marriage breakdown.  Pre-nuptial agreements are an integral part of the family law system in many EU states, Canadian provinces, US states and in New Zealand and Australia.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I do not, however, believe pre-nuptial agreements should be legally binding because that would not take into account circumstances changing post-marriage, where one partner could opt out of the workforce to rear children and, therefore, could be at a disadvantage.  At the moment, under the Family Law (Divorce) Act 1996, in section 20, judges take into account during divorce cases and legal separation agreements issues such as income earning capacity, property, other financial resources of each spouse, financial needs, obligations and responsibilities, the standard of living enjoyed by the family concerned before proceedings were instituted, the age of each of the spouses and the physical or mental disability of either spouse.  Provision should be made to allow judges to take into account pre-nuptial agreements, as they do currently with legal separations.  Ideally, pre-nuptial agreements would be entered into following sound, independent legal advice for both parties.  It would also be important that a complete disclosure of assets would take place prior to the agreement being signed.</P>
        <P>Pre-nuptial agreements also have the advantage of protecting many family businesses and farms.  The recent ruling by the British House of Lords, stating that a spouse is entitled to an equal share of the family assets after divorce, has <Col N="1753"/>caused concern here.  They are useful in cases where the parents of a child may have helped him or her to purchase a house and the new spouse has not contributed to the same extent.  Often the parents are more concerned about what will happen to assets if the child divorces.  Such cases are becoming more common as a result of the increasing inaffordabilty of housing for young people.</P>
        <P>By having a pre-nuptial agreement, conflict can be avoided in a marriage breakdown by resolving financial matters both during and after the relationship.  It can help to avoid expense and delay of litigation and the uncertainty of outcome and would offer the ability to protect assets held prior to the commencement of the relationship through specific individual means independent of the marriage partnership.  Many women in particular are earning higher salaries than their spouses so this is an issue that affects both men and women.</P>
        <P>No doubt we will hear people saying pre-nuptial agreements are unromantic and that people who sign them are not as committed to the concept of marriage.  I disagree.  A pre-nuptial agreement is no different from someone taking out insurance on his car or home.  Doing so does not mean he plans to damage either.  If we were to agree that pre-nuptial agreements are unromantic then we could argue that making a will early in life means a wish to die early.  That is clearly not the case.</P>
        <P>The Minister will agree that in the last 30 or 40 years we have seen huge social and economic changes in this country.  It is logical that ten years after the passing of the divorce referendum, the option of having a pre-nuptial agreement should be recognised and taken into account in divorce cases.  Pre-nuptial agreements would help to remove tensions in the relationship for couples who have a disparity of assets.  A pre-nuptial agreement could, in fact, enhance the rights of spouses and children.  We should, however, call on the Law Reform Commission to investigate their possible introduction and I hope this motion will be accepted tonight.</P>
        <P>We are now 30 years a member of the European Union and we should seek to harmonise our laws in this area and prevent Irish citizens married to persons outside the State facing legal ambiguity.  We owe it to the many solicitors in the country who are getting an increasing number of requests from clients concerning pre-nuptial agreements to clarify their legal standing.  The current set-up presents a dilemma for both solicitors and those seeking contracts.</P>
        <P>I hope this debate will stick to the issues involved and not stray into a debate about romance.  I firmly believe that the State should recognise pre-nuptial agreements and that if couples opt to have such an agreement, Irish courts will be able to take them into account.  Alan Shatter, a leading expert on family law, recently wrote about the &ldquo;chaotic and dysfunctional&rdquo; state of Irish family law, which often leads <Col N="1754"/>to a &ldquo;judicial lottery&rdquo;.  By recognising pre-nuptial agreements, we would have a system whereby couples could regulate to some degree the contingency of marriage breakdown and which would allow them to write a road map for their marriage.</P>
        <P>I hope sincerely that my motion is accepted and, if so, that the Seanad will take a leading role in this area.  I hope that when the Law Reform Commission publishes its paper the Seanad will be in a position to bring forward legislation on this area, which may only involve adding in the words &ldquo;and or pre-nuptial agreement&rdquo; into section 20(3) of the Family Law (Divorce) Act, or may involve amendments to other legislation as well.</P>
        <P>I thank my Fine Gael Seanad colleagues for allowing me the opportunity to debate this issue, and those outside the House, such as Geoffrey Shannon and Muriel Walls, who have written extensively on this area.  I hope that we will begin the process of clarifying the role of pre-nuptial agreements and their possible introduction in Ireland in tonight&rsquo;s debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I second this motion.  I thank Senator Browne most sincerely for giving us the opportunity to debate this matter, he has been a lone voice on this issue in recent years.  It highlights the importance of this House in responding to an issue that some people feel should be addressed by way of legislative change.  It is clear that the other House does not frequently have time for such debates because of the bear pit atmosphere that exists there.  We have more time and the Seanad should be used to address such issues in a thoughtful and mature way.  Senator Browne has made his case well and I thank him for doing so.</P>
        <P>The Government amendment, which Senator Browne is happy to accept, is useful and I congratulate the T&aacute;naiste for allowing the establishment of the high level group under the chairmanship of a senior counsel.   That is a positive development whereby a body can produce a report after a time reflecting all the issues that will be raised during this debate.  It can report to us and to Government on areas where the law must be changed, if necessary.</P>
        <P>I fought my first campaign when I was 16, during the divorce referendum introduced by Dr. Garrett FitzGerald in 1986.  The na&iuml;vet&eacute; of the notion that a snotty-nosed 16 year old could lecture anyone about marital bliss is something I readily concede but that referendum was defeated because of opportunistic tactics on the part of the Opposition and because the ground was not clearly laid out in advance.</P>
        <P>That mistake was put to one side during the first Labour-Fianna F&aacute;il Government from 1992 until 1995, when there was significant change in divorce legislation, particularly the Judicial Law (Separation) Act, which was put in place before the issue of divorce was dealt with in the subsequent constitutional referendum.  The Act <Col N="1755"/>introduced the principle of no fault divorce for the first time, albeit in the area of separation.  This fundamental change in the law, the removal of the need for people to bear all before a judge to allow the court to determine whether they had a right to legally separate, was introduced by the then Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Mr. Mervyn Taylor.  The only outstanding issue was addressed in 1996 when the constitutional prohibition on the right to remarry was changed by a slender majority in a referendum.</P>
        <P>In changing the law in this area it is important to tread carefully because the principle of marriage enjoys a significant level of support.  Divorce rates here are much closer to those in ostensibly Catholic countries such as Italy and Spain than those in other northern European countries.  I am glad the suggestion made by many opponents of divorce more than ten years ago that the introduction of the Divorce Acts would open the floodgates has not materialised.  Instead, people have come to use the law as a means of regularising their circumstances and, as such, securing a second chance.</P>
        <P>The issue in this debate is whether two individuals entering marriage may make arrangements in a pre-nuptial agreement and ensure that the provisions into which they have freely entered are upheld in the courts in the unfortunate event that their marriage breaks down.  This is the legal doubt which must be addressed in the review about which Senator Browne spoke.  It would be worthwhile to determine once and for all the answer to this question.</P>
        <P>Notwithstanding the romantic notions a couple may have, parties to a marriage must enter into it with their eyes open.  Given the cost of property and the extensive assets some parties may bring to a marriage, it would be sensible to provide legal certainty for pre-nuptial agreements to ensure people do not have the rug pulled from under them, as it were, in the High Court or Supreme Court.  The principal point in this debate, as set out by Senator Browne, is that people who choose to enter into pre-nuptial arrangements require guarantees that the arrangements they have made will be upheld by the courts in the unfortunate event that their marriage union breaks down.</P>
        <P>I welcome this debate and look forward to Members&rsquo; contributions.  I thank the Government for the measured response it has taken in the amendment.  Together, we can address this issue to determine if the law needs to be changed, the scope of any such change and when it is to be brought about.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Pre-nuptial agreements between two persons who intend to marry each other are intended to settle, in advance of their marriage, financial and property matters as well as other issues, including child custody arrangements, both generally and in the event of the breakdown of the marriage.  The motivation for the parties to a pre-nuptial agreement may be to make a pre-marriage contract for the division of assets to ensure some certainty for both parties as to property rights in the event that the marriage fails.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I agree with Senator Browne and Senator Brian Hayes that this discussion is not about whether the House is concerned with romantic or less romantic marriage.  We live in a society which is very different from the one in which I grew up.  When Senator Brian Hayes referred to planning his first campaign in favour of divorce at the age of 16 or 17 years, I was struck by the fact that when I was of the same age, people tended to get married at the age of 18, 19 and 20 years.  In particular, the have nots, those with few assets, frequently got married at that age.  Demographics have changed completely and, as Senator Browne pointed out, people do not now get married until well into their 30s when many of them have already accumulated a considerable degree of wealth.</P>
        <P>A further issue to arise in this context is second marriages as people who have had a marriage may wish to remarry.  People are now in a much different position from those in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s who married in their late teens or early 20s with no assets to their name and saved for years to buy a wedding ring.</P>
        <P>Whatever their motivation, pre-nuptial agreements were traditionally held by the courts to be void on public policy grounds on the basis that no contract envisaging the dissolution of a marriage should be enforceable.  The removal of the constitutional prohibition on divorce has weakened that public policy justification for obvious reasons.  Nonetheless, the treatment of pre-nuptial agreements in law must still be considered in the context of the constitutional provisions relating to marriage.</P>
        <P Just="Left">When contemplating this debate I was struck by the Supreme Court decision in 1993 on the Article 26 reference to legislation on the matrimonial home.  It will be remembered that at that stage, the Government proposed that, henceforth, family homes should be automatically shared between husband and wife on a 50-50 basis.  The Supreme Court stated &mdash; this was <Col N="1757"/>before divorce was introduced &mdash; that couples getting married had autonomy in these matters and it was not open to the State to presume to tell them how they should divide their principal asset, their matrimonial home.</P>
        <P>Although the constitutional matrix has changed because the Constitution makes provision for divorce, which is made contingent on proper arrangements being made for dependent spouses and children, if any, nonetheless one must ask whether it is not implicit in the 1993 decision of the Supreme Court, which struck down the Government&rsquo;s Bill as unconstitutional, that the State recognises people have the right, in entering a marriage, to make arrangements and agree to share, at that stage, the family home in a particular way and that they cannot be dictated to by legislation.  A further question then arises.  Is it the case that arrangements made before a marriage are to have no value attached to them because of an early 20th century view of where public policy lies?</P>
        <P>There is good reason for people to enter into a pre-nuptial agreement and it has nothing to do with whether they are romantic or unromantic.  In many cases both parties to a marriage have their own set of assets.  Frequently, both will have a house or apartment &mdash; I have seen this myself &mdash; and must decide what to do with them, for example, whether to rent out one and live in the other.  It is perfectly reasonable for people in those circumstances to come to a clear and explicit understanding about the extent to which they are pooling their assets in the context of their marriage.  There is nothing unwise or foolish about such an approach.</P>
        <P>Senator Brian Hayes and Senator Browne referred to the question of no fault divorce.  The courts are not, either in the context of separation or divorce, focused on the issue of who is to blame.  This is an advance on one level because it means that these things are not pitched battles of the worst kind in which moral blame is established on the part of one person or the other.</P>
        <P>However, if one has no fault divorce as well as the right for a court to make major decisions regarding the assets of the parties, a second question arises which we cannot pretend away.  If one person is manifestly responsible for the end of the marriage, should he or she profit by his or her actions or behaviour?  We have, largely speaking, swept this issue under the carpet because it is politically correct to state we want no fault divorces and fairly simple rules as to what happens when a marriage breaks down.  The conduct of the spouses is an issue that can be brought onto the playing pitch when deciding how assets should be divided if it is such that the court finds it would be unjust to disregard it.  That is fair.  A no-fault divorce goes in one direction, but where serious assets and wealth division is taking place between spouses, conduct must be a relevant issue, and we cannot pretend otherwise.</P>
        <P>Under the Constitution the function of a court in a separation or divorce is to ensure there is <Col N="1758"/>adequate provision made for each spouse and the dependent children of a marriage.  All property is made available to the court for that purpose, including contingent interests and pensions.  We are discussing whether the intentions of the parties going into the marriage should be capable of being taken into account and, if so, what weight should be given to them.  I agree with Senator Browne that it would be wrong to have an absolute rule that in every circumstance, no matter what, a pre-nuptial agreement excludes all rights to maintenance or custody.  The current situation is unhappy and increasingly untenable.  It seems to imply that the views prior to marriage and the understanding of people who marry each other as to what they intend to do with their property, and the extent to which they want to make a community of property between them and have their assets available to each other in the event of a breakdown, should be ignored or regarded as irrelevant or void on grounds of public policy.  Between the extreme of the public policy prohibition of having regard to pre-nuptial agreements and that of saying they must be in all cases and in every way determinative of the issues regardless of the merits and justice of the situation, most people would see there must be a middle course.</P>
        <P>This brings us to the issue of what we should do.  The motion suggests the Attorney General should ask the Law Reform Commission to inquire into the matter.  My Department examined that proposal and for practical reasons, including the fact that the Law Reform Commission is busy with other work, decided it would be better to establish our own process.  That is the reason for the Government amendment.  I want to establish a small, but experienced and well-endowed committee, the purpose of which would be to examine this issue, find the middle territory, see where we should allow the pendulum to rest between the two extremes and work out the best way forward.</P>
        <P>I agree with Senators Browne and Brian Hayes that we cannot run away from this issue because it is unpleasant to publicly contemplate the reality of marital breakdown or division of assets.  While it is nicer to talk in public about dewy-eyed romanticism and optimism in the context of a conjugal relationship, that is not the role of legislators.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>That Mills &amp; Boon function is for the artists and authors in our society.  Legislators have to deal with reality.  My Department&rsquo;s aim is to deal with this expeditiously, to establish this group, to have a highly-qualified chairman, to set a reasonable timeframe for a report and to allow the Minister and the Department to bring <Col N="1759"/>that report to the Oireachtas for consideration in short order.  As Senator Browne said, the situation is unsatisfactory.  Between the two polar extremes of possible values to be attached to pre-nuptial agreements there must be a middle way.  It is not clear everybody has thought through all the implications.  I do not criticise anybody.  There are issues to which one would instinctively attach more weight than others.  It is easier to attach weight to a pre-nuptial agreement on property than on custody rights because in guardianship and custody issues the interest of the child is paramount.  Therefore, a pre-nuptial agreement is probably not worth the paper on which it is written.  The court has to make a decision primarily in the interests of the child.  When we talk about pre-nuptial agreements we should bear in mind that they are not limited to deciding property issues.  Sometimes they purport to extend to other issues.  These are the kinds of issues an expert group would have to examine.  It would have to decide which categories are most important and whether we would ask a court to attach much weight to a pre-nuptial agreement that stipulated that in the event of a divorce the father should have custody of the children.  What value would such an agreement, made before a marriage or a child even exists, have?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is a dewy-eyed romantic.  Children often exist before the marriage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>That is true.  And in the case of second marriages there may be children who are outside the marriage.  This is recognised in the Constitution.  Their parents may want, when entering a marriage, to keep their assets available for their children and there may be good reasons for that.  In some cases I can imagine it would lead to disharmony in a family if the main asset, for example a farm, was to go into a common pool while there were already 17 and 18 year old children farming it in the expectation they might succeed to it.  We must consider many issues.</P>
        <P>I thank the Senators for raising the issue.  As the Law Reform Commission is not in a position to do an urgent report on this matter, the Government amendment is offered to make rapid progress on this issue and to enable the Houses to deal with it.  It will not go away.  The absence of pre-nuptial agreements is a social issue.  Different demographic patterns, people marrying later in life with more assets, re-marriages and dependent children of the partners of marriages are phenomena of the early 21st century.  They were not phenomena of the 1920s and 1930s when much of our pre-divorce jurisprudence emerged.  I urge Senators to adopt the Government amendment as the fair way forward on this issue.  I reiterate my thanks to the Members for the way this matter has been raised and dealt with.</P>

	<P>Is that agreed?  Agreed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank and congratulate Senator Browne for putting down this important motion.  The Minister&rsquo;s points are well made.  In approaching this issue I was instinctively and clearly in favour of the concept of pre-nuptial agreements.  That was until I examined the issue and read and thought about it.  The more I did that, the more confused and uncertain I became.  I accept the points the Minister put forward.</P>
        <P>I have examined the Brehon laws and how they dealt with this issue.  It is always good to see how matters were dealt with in earlier times.  Under the Brehon laws there was the concept of a trial marriage for a stated period, at the end of which the marriage could either be dissolved or formalised.  In general, the woman remained the sole owner of property that had been hers prior to the marriage, regardless of what happened.  In cases of legal separation for good cause, the wife not only took all her marriage portion of gifts but an amount above and beyond that for damages.</P>
        <P>The laws recognised various levels and degrees of marriage but the theory on which they worked in cases involving property was that what people owned before the marriage remained theirs in the event of a dissolution.  What was created in the currency of the marriage was available for division.  It is a sensible basis to be kept in mind when examining this matter.  It does not answer all the questions put forward by the Minister or deal with the scenarios put forward by Senator Browne.  However, it is a basic point to move towards in terms of how we should approach the issue.</P>
        <P>The weakness of the pre-nuptial agreement is that it only anticipates one circumstance, a dissolution.  It does not anticipate the circumstances relating to children or property beyond that.   There could be a situation where a couple enter into such an agreement and buy a property.  Subsequently they buy a second property, for example, because one of the spouses, the wife, suffered from arthritis so it was necessary to get a single storey property.  Let us say it was agreed in the pre-nuptial agreement that this woman would always retain in her family, to be passed on through her children, the four acres behind the house that she got from her father.  In the case of dissolution there could be a situation where the husband would be left with two houses that were hugely encumbered with big mortgages and no assets.  That would clearly be unfair.</P>
        <P>In the pre-divorce situation, when marriage was indissoluble under the Constitution, would it not be fair to describe a pre-nuptial agreement as contrary to public policy?  I believe it would have been.  This is irrelevant in the current situation except with regard to gaining an understanding of <Col N="1761"/>the situation.  We must have an understanding of these things so we can move forward.  The law has made marriage a simple but solemn contract.  It is entered into optimistically, despite the risks, and in a spirit of equality.  Perhaps it should be a guiding principle that if this is an equal contract, people should also emerge from it with equality whatever the reasons for the dissolution.</P>
        <P>We made marriage a simple contract because the most simple people can enter into it.  It is perhaps the most important contract people enter into and, in many ways, it is the contract that most people understand.  It must, therefore, have ease of access and ease of general understanding for ordinary people.  A democracy has a judiciary in an effort to provide the wisdom of Solomon.  When a judge has a marriage dissolution before him or her, he or she must make their decision taking account of the various issues listed by Senator Browne and which are required under legislation.  They include any arrangements arising from a separation.  The list does not mention pre-nuptial agreements.</P>
        <P>Where should a pre-nuptial agreement fit in the scheme of things?  The legislation states that the judge must make proper provision for all the people involved, that is, the two partners, the children and any other dependants.  If the pre-nuptial agreement cuts across proper provision for the people involved, reason would dictate that it should not take precedence.  On the other hand, if there is a pre-nuptial agreement that was entered into fairly and honestly by both partners and which allows for proper provision, therefore not requiring the judge to go against the legislative requirement to make proper provision, it could be taken into consideration.  That would be an acceptable position.</P>
        <P>The pre-nuptial agreement anticipates only one circumstance.  It is basically an insurance policy against falling out of love.  An honest conclusion would be that account is taken of the importance of the point made by Senator Browne as well as the great number of variables that must be considered, all within the context of making proper provision as is required by the law and anticipated by the Constitution.  One of the matters to be taken into consideration would include the pre-nuptial agreement.  It should be taken into consideration but it should not be able to over-ride all the requirements of making proper provision.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank my colleague, Senator O&rsquo;Toole, for sharing his time with me.  When I looked at this matter, I thought it was another facile idea of the Government to amend it.  I did not see the point in the amendment.  Now I do, having listened to the Minister.  The Law Reform Commission is over-burdened.  The Minister has commissioned a special report and I take it that this is in response to the debate in the Seanad and the call from Senator Browne.  I congratulate him on it.  It does the Seanad a great deal of credit <Col N="1762"/>and there was considerable coverage in the political columns of this move.</P>
        <P>It shows how our society is changing and becoming more sophisticated in its response to change.  Until recently, marriage was indissoluble.  If that was still the situation, this agreement would undermine it because it involves making an agreement before the marriage in anticipation of its potential dissolution.  The pre-nuptial agreement protects people.  We have seen the reports in the media about people of substantial wealth both in America and Britain who make these arrangements before marriage to protect themselves against the attentions of gold diggers.  That is understandable.</P>
        <P>However, we must examine marriage as a whole rather than pick at things piecemeal.  Senator O&rsquo;Toole said the most simple people are entitled to marry.  They are not.  I am not.  Gay people are precluded from marrying even though we are part of the human spectrum.  There is also the issue of foreign divorces whereby Irish citizens can be, and are being, disadvantaged.  There is an ongoing case at present in which an Irish woman is being divorced by her husband in France.  Her husband is a French citizen.  She was starting proceedings here but he gazumped her and got into the French courts.  The reason is that French courts have a tradition of protecting the male interests more effectively than the interests of the female spouse.  We may well be seeing a type of cherry picking taking place, whereby European citizens can move their domicile and can decide, for their own advantage, to initiate proceedings in a court where they would get more favourable treatment.  We must examine this situation.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>My final point about the amendment is that it contains a final surviving absurdity, that is, it states that the law already gives some recognition to pre-nuptial agreements.  However, I heard the Minister say that pre-nuptial agreements are traditionally held to be void by the courts.  The Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, is signalling otherwise so perhaps the Minister said that they were previously held to be void.  Perhaps the position has changed slightly.</P>
      <?oasys _cl11- ?><P>I thank the Chair for allowing me to contribute to the debate.  I would prefer this issue, which involves marriage, divorce, pre-nuptial agreements and the rights of same-sex couples, to be dealt with in its entirety.</P>

        <P>We all agree that this is a complicated and complex matter that needs to be carefully examined and that we must look before we leap.  At an instinctive level &mdash; it is not my total response &mdash; I come at this issue with considerably less enthusi<Col N="1763"/>asm than Senator Browne.  Earlier in the debate, there was an atmosphere that evoked the line: &ldquo;Romantic Ireland&rsquo;s dead and gone.&rdquo;  I had visions of a castle in west Cork&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and to parts of which a spouse, after a relatively short marriage, might not gain access as a result of a settlement.</P>
        <P>Let us be brutally clear.  In whose interests are pre-nuptial agreements?  Basically, they relate to people who are better off and who have more assets and financial resources.  They represent a way of cutting back on the legal and equality requirements in cases involving separation and divorce.  One could argue that the underlying tone of the motion is far from progressive and that it is really in the interests of asset-holders.  There are many high-profile cases involving celebrities where such matters arise.</P>
        <P>I am aware that a pre-nuptial agreement was enforced in 1950.  This agreement did not relate to divorce or what would happen to property following a separation, rather it involved how children should be brought up in a religious sense.  I refer here to the famous Tilson case and the pre-nuptial promise to bring up a child in a particular way.  In Protestant circles, the case is not one of good reputation.  The agreement related to a period when denominational influence was at its height and should never have been legally enforceable.</P>
        <P>I foresee many problems with what Senator Browne is attempting to achieve.  With the exception of what occurs in short marriages, people&rsquo;s situations develop and change so much and children may be involved.  In many cases, the balance of power often shifts &mdash; this may take some time &mdash; after people are married.  Somebody who may, for whatever reason, be in a much weaker position prior to marriage and who is keen to be married might subsequently find themselves in a much stronger position.  Such a position might not be one of dominance but it could be one of equality and they might come to regret what they had agreed to pre-marriage.</P>
        <P>I am not hugely enthusiastic about the motion because, at its core, it detracts from people&rsquo;s rights.  People would be obliged to sign away or renounce their rights well in advance of marriage.  With the exception of marrying a serial monogamist who changes spouse every two or three years, one cannot possibly foresee how matters might develop.</P>
        <P>Senator Browne suggests that there should be clearly enforceable mechanisms in this area.  I disagree with him in that regard.  A previous speaker referred to Alan Shatter stating that the family courts are in some way dysfunctional.  As regards enforcement, judgments are made, often on the basis of incomplete information regarding people&rsquo;s assets, their move to Spain or whatever, and people do not actually do what is required <Col N="1764"/>of them by the courts.  In that context, adequate enforcement mechanisms do not exist.  Separated spouses might obtain what, in theory, appear to be generous settlements but their solicitors and barristers then take a large slice and they are left with much less than they might have imagined.</P>
        <P>Before we discuss enforcing pre-nuptial agreements, would it be possible to have more effective enforcement in respect of divorce and separation settlements and the payment of maintenance?  The law in this regard is very unsatisfactory and people are being left in difficult situations.  In theory, the law functions but much of the time it does not do so in practice.</P>
        <P>I agree with the carrying out of a study.  We should, however, be slow to legislate in haste and repent at leisure.</P>

	<P>I commend Senator Browne on bringing forward the motion and I welcome this useful debate.  This issue is worthy of further study.  Like Senator Mansergh, however, I have concerns regarding how what is being sought in the motion would work in practice.  That is why I would welcome the compilation of a further study on the matter.  My initial reaction is one of concern in respect of the rights of, in the main, female spouses in the event of pre-nuptial agreements taking precedence over existing family law provisions.  Senator Mansergh outlined many of my concerns in this regard and I thank him for doing so.</P>
        <P>A legal expert, Mr. Geoffrey Shannon, was quoted recently in the newspaper as saying that the pre-nuptial agreement is &ldquo;an idea whose time has come&rdquo; and the Minister referred to it being a feature of early 21st century Ireland.  We have reached a stage where more people own more property and the issue of the ownership thereof arises in the context of marriage.  If, however, we consider this matter in that light, we must discuss the concept of &ldquo;what is yours is yours and what is mine is mine&rdquo; and people entering marriages with that being understood.  I could not support such a concept.  Like Senator Mansergh, I would be obliged to question whether such an approach would be progressive.</P>
        <P>As the Senator has pointed out, circumstances change even in the context of a short marriage.  People enter into marriage in particular financial circumstances and with a particular relationship.  However, people, times and situations change.  While the context in which a pre-nuptial agreement might be arrived at &mdash; possibly for many good reasons &mdash; can change very quickly, such a pre-nuptial agreement would still remain.  Senator Browne&rsquo;s aim is that such pre-nuptial agreements should have the recognition of a court.  The question then arises as to what status they would have in respect of existing law.  I refer to the Family Law Act, which is designed to protect the interests of all spouses and children and, in particular, the need for women to be supported in the event of a family breakdown.</P><Col N="1765"/>
        <P>Senator Mansergh referred to this issue and all Members are familiar with it.  Women at the end of their tether have approached me in an effort to secure the enforcement of maintenance agreements.  In many cases, such agreements are with men who are self-employed and whose assets cannot be assessed satisfactorily from the court&rsquo;s perspective.  Frequently, an attachment of earnings cannot be made regarding such people because they are not PAYE earners or are not in employment in which there is access to such an arrangement.  Such women are often left to raise children on their own and to live off the State, having been abandoned, effectively.  I have encountered some cases in which former spouses or husbands who no longer live with or support their wives have used their own resources to go to court to find all means of ensuring such support would not be forthcoming and to ensure the wives would not get their hands on their spouses&rsquo; property.  Members are aware this is happening and it is very difficult.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Family law and managing marital breakdown is a seriously difficult area.  While I did not work directly with the former Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Mr. Mervyn Taylor, I did work with a Minister who served in that Government.  Consequently, I know major discussions took place at the time in an attempt to cover every scenario.  Members should consider an example in which a couple who marry have equal earning power and continue to earn after marriage.  Subsequently, they separate and a settlement is reached.  Thereafter, one of them wins &euro;10 million in the lottery and a different scenario arises.  One spouse is now in an entirely different position regarding the maintenance or support of the other spouse and any children.  What would happen under such circumstances?</P>
        <P>Circumstances change constantly and, while the aforementioned example might sound wild and wonderful, people inherit property, become ill, lose their jobs or can no longer work.  All sorts of scenarios arise, such as having children or having a child fall ill.  Consequently, the pre-nuptial agreement exists in the context of the time before people became married.  However, when people marry and move into a new situation, life turns up in many weird and wonderful ways and the context can change entirely.  These are some of the matters that would require extremely careful management.  A situation in which a pre-nuptial agreement is recognised by the court is in itself problematic and must be carefully considered and managed.</P>
        <P>Court judgments and settlements in the area of divorce and family law are still in a state of evolution in this jurisdiction.  In recent times, two major judgments have been made in Britain to which Mr. Geoffrey Shannon&rsquo;s article refers, namely, the Miller and McFarlane cases.  Senator Browne is probably familiar with them.  While neither case involved a pre-nuptial settlement, the courts continually make judgments on family law cases and issues in respect of property and <Col N="1766"/>marriage even before the question of pre-nuptial agreements is raised.  It is not a simple matter of having them recognised or otherwise by the courts.</P>
        <P>While I welcome this study, with Senator Mansergh I must place my own concerns on record.  As a legislator, I would not support the idea of pre-nuptial agreements being recognised by the courts unless I was totally assured the interests of all spouses and children are maintained.  Some recognition of changed circumstances between the establishment of a pre-nuptial agreement and a post-wedding scenario would be essential, particularly in the event of major change taking place.  It would be necessary to put in place such a structure to ensure fairness and equality apply and all spouses are protected.</P>
        <P>I join Senator Mansergh in taking this opportunity to appeal to the Government to do more to ensure maintenance agreements are upheld and to make resources available to family law courts or wherever such resources are required.  Many spouses, predominantly women, are treated extremely badly and are left with little or no resources to pursue an errant spouse.  Members cannot continue to tolerate this.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>I listened to the Minister&rsquo;s contribution and felt he struck the right note of balance.  Based on his own legal background, it underlined many of the complexities involved and the harmonisation that must occur between the exercise of pre-nuptial agreements and the law as it exists at present.  That note has been also struck by Senators O&rsquo;Meara and Mansergh, which may be important at the beginning of the debate.</P>
        <P>Nevertheless, I compliment Senator Browne on putting his head above the parapet, as this is a debate that should take place, particularly in the context of some recent high-profile weddings in Ireland.  Members will have read about the pre-nuptial agreements involved.  People are debating and discussing the question of how the law of the land stands regarding pre-nuptial agreements.  If Members look back on one of the referenda on divorce, they may recall that inheritance rights set off alarm bells for women in particular that, to some extent, sounded the death knell of that referendum.  It is now accepted inheritance rights are protected and this must be Members&rsquo; primary interest.</P>
        <P>I am unsure whether Senator Browne contributes to <i>Hello</i> magazine.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not.</P>

	<P>One can hardly go into any doctor&rsquo;s surgery at present without being faced by a copy of <i>Hello</i> magazine.  As one flicks through the pages, one can read about the marriages and divorces of celebrities, and there is generally an article on their nuptial agreements.  Recently, I read of one well-known female film star who announced that she intended to marry <Col N="1767"/>for the ninth time.  While I am unsure how much she has amassed or lost over the years as a result of pre-nuptial agreements, a note of added complexity is introduced when one begins to consider multi-nuptial agreements.  Hence, Members must be particularly careful from the outset.</P>
        <P>An aspect of the debate about which I have concern is that, in some way, the message might go out that Members are opening the door for the acknowledgement and legislation for pre-nuptial agreements.  This would not be the correct thing to do because until very recently, pre-nuptial agreements were fantasies that took place in the international theatrical or film star world.  Members may not have envisaged them in an Irish context and were always focussed on protecting the family inheritance and ensuring the weaker person would be protected by the State.</P>
        <P>I listened to the Minister and I am certain he did not suggest legislators were not romantic.  I understand his point to have been that their job is not to legislate for romanticism.  However, that is a debate for another day.  In fairness, one could also state that the time one makes a nuptial agreement is a time of emotional intensity in people&rsquo;s lives.  Without being overly frivolous, one could go so far as to question whether some people are of sound mind when they enter nuptial agreements.  I believe this is an issue that could come to the courts.  We have seen the law become flexible, with parameters removed we thought would never be removed.  We must remember that people in such circumstances are vulnerable, particularly those who may not have the wealth of the other party involved.  Emotional intensity means people may be inclined to trust one another based on the concept of love, as Senator O&rsquo;Toole put it.</P>
        <P>A strange thought entered my mind.  Do coalition parties have pre-nuptial agreements for when they fall out of love?  I suppose that is the programme for Government.  However, I do not wish to be frivolous. Many speakers referred to the situation that exists before and after a marriage, especially if rancour and bitterness are involved.  Lawyers will get involved at this point, as they invariably do.  We never considered pre-nuptial agreements for people with small amounts of wealth; we always thought they applied to those with with great wealth.  To an extent they were seen as protection against gold diggers.  I am concerned at the idea of broadening the legislation to cover ordinary people with houses, good jobs and pension rights.  It is not far fetched to imagine this could become part of our culture. We need to examine all the complexities if we are to endorse pre-nuptial agreements.</P>
        <P>Issues other than wealth determine our concept of pre-nuptial agreements, one of which relates to the instability of marriage.  This is particularly true in the United States where close to 60% of marriages end in divorce and some people enter second and third marriages.  I do not think that culture exists here even though we have divorce <Col N="1768"/>legislation.  We are discussing a small number of people who want to reconcile their agreements with the law, yet we may make this appear to be the norm.</P>
        <P>The Minister is correct on the subject of setting up a specialist group, possibly headed by a person with legal experience.  We are not suggesting this body will receive a definitive role, this is a preliminary discussion.  There may be eminent people involved in this group and, no doubt, it will be driven, to an extent, by the media.  This subject, by its nature, extends almost into the realm of fantasy and therefore opens itself to the cult of personality regarding who has entered into a pre-nuptial agreement.  I am concerned that the impression might be given that we would automatically give credibility to the findings of this body.  When the Minister is examining this matter he might consider the group as a stepping stone to providing us, not with a Green Paper or White Paper, but with a discussion document to allow us consider the complexities involved.</P>
        <P>The Minister pointed out some of the contingencies that are embedded in the 1993 legislation and how the divorce legislation has broadened the concept of marriage breakdown and the acceptance by judges of the idea of the division of property in cases where a marriage fails.  All of these issues are present but not necessarily used in a focused way, as might happen were we to talk in terms of recognising pre-nuptial agreements.</P>
        <P>The tone has been set, although Senator Norris has expanded it too much for my liking because he has taken the issue into other areas, which he is entitled to do.  Trying to control the racehorses after the race has begun is not always easy and most people would sound a note of warning in that regard.</P>
        <P>Senator Browne, while not acting as devil&rsquo;s advocate, presented a case for debate rather than a definitive argument suggesting we must enact legislation on pre-nuptial agreements.  I welcome this debate and agree with the cautious approach taken by the Minister.  I hope there is unanimity on this issue while I also hope it will not be seen as something we are pre-disposed to accept.  I would welcome interim reports from the aforementioned group which might tease out some of the legal complexities regarding protection of vulnerable parties, such as children.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank those who have spoken during this debate and I thank the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform for his frankness.  At times we may become disillusioned with politics, but today the Seanad has justified its existence as we have taken a lead on an issue that has not been addressed elsewhere.  </P>
        <P>There have been huge social and economic changes in the past 30 to 40 years.  I am not sure when the late Charles Haughey introduced the Succession Act but it was appropriate in its time and still is in many cases.  However, it has become outdated because it does not take account of the huge wealth possessed by some people today.  I <Col N="1769"/>welcome that this concept is going forward with a working group as recommended by the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, though I recommended it go forward with the Law Reform Commission.  It makes little difference in either case as both will allow people to make submissions and the points made here and elsewhere can be made again to the working group.  We have started the debate tonight.  Ireland was a different country 40 years ago at the time of the Succession Act.  Who would have thought we would have the wealth we now do?</P>
        <P>The debate tonight has been honest and frank.  If those opting for pre-nuptial agreements had the same frankness and honesty prior to marriage, fewer would break down.  I see great advantages in pre-nuptial agreements and I make no apology for that.  Imagine a couple, both remarrying in their 60s and financially independent, who will not have children but may have children from their first marriages.  A pre-nuptial agreement could clarify potential problems and tensions at a later stage.  A pre-nuptial agreement could be also useful in the case of a marriage that lasts only six months.  Unfortunately many marriages break down within the first two years.  I know a lady whose marriage broke down on her honeymoon.  Such situations occur.</P>
        <P>I accept that complexities arise in the case of marriages that last ten, 15 or 20 years and where children are involved.  I am keen to stress that if pre-nuptial agreements come into law they should be taken into account by judges using their discretion.  I would not like to be a judge in a family law case as they can be very difficult with so many factors involved.  Under the current divorce legislation, the judge already takes into account numerous factors.  I suggest a pre-nuptial agreement should be another such factor, though it should not be legally binding.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It was thought the weak person in a relationship might get a raw deal.  In my view, as I have said, if pre-nuptials were to come into a play, they should be signed only following sound independent legal advice.  As with any legal document, one does not rush in and sign it.  It is imperative to get good independent legal advice.  By taking such agreements into account the option is left open to a judge to hear somebody&rsquo;s case who might plead that he or she signed a pre-nuptial in a haze of love, under pressure or whatever.  The option is available down the line to minimise the weight of a pre-nuptial.  That is why I would not favour the legally binding option, which is just not relevant.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I have a question to pose, which no one in the House can answer.  How many people in the country are reluctant to get married because of the absence of pre-nuptials?  Perhaps there are persons who have been married and are now living with partners whom they would like to marry, but are reticent and reluctant because of past experience.  If pre-nuptial agreements were introduced in Ireland, one might see an increase in marriage.  This is not entirely impossible.  I accept <Col N="1770"/>the point made by Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; to the effect that the opposite might happen.  We do not know.  That said, when the divorce referendum was initially being spoken about, I presume people painted a picture that if it were introduced there would be chaos and marriages would be broken up and so on.  In so far as I am aware marriage breakdowns have not gone through the roof and I believe many marriages are now far healthier because of the option of divorce.  Many modern wives and husbands will not put up with the nonsense with which married people had to live in the past, when they had no option but to stick with it.  I put this forward as a counter argument.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I shall conclude by referring to Senator Mansergh&rsquo;s contribution.  A recent case in England concerned a marriage which had lasted three years, with no children involved.  The wife brought no material benefit to the marriage, yet when it was dissolved she was entitled to 50% of her husband&rsquo;s assets.  That is not equality.  She did not contribute to his assets in the first place.  She certainly deserved a share of them, but not 50%.  I see equality working both ways and the Minister referred to that in his speech.  I have spoken about the judge having the discretion to weigh up pre-nuptial agreements.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I fully agree with the Minister in relation to no-fault divorce, but that is an argument for another day.  However, I genuinely appreciate the support given to the motion by the House.  I have the impression that it was more acceptable to the Progressive Democrats Members on the Government side than their Fianna F&aacute;il colleagues.  Nevertheless, I look  forward to the working group setting about its difficult task.  We all accept it will not be easy, but certainly we have justified our existence in the Seanad  today and begun a process which hopefully will be concluded in the next few months.  There might be time to legislate on it in this Seanad, if not, the next.</P>

	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  Glenma housing estate in Croom, County Limerick, has 43 houses which were built by the National Building Agency in 1973.  Some 35 houses are privately owned and Limerick County Council owns the remaining eight, of <Col N="1771"/>which five are occupied, while three remain unoccupied.  That these have remained unoccupied for a period of time has led to a variety of problems. </P>
        <P>The houses are of flat roof construction with metal cladding.  Recently I called there and met many of the tenants.  They are extremely annoyed and disappointed that no work has been carried out even though approval has been granted by the Department since 14 May 2002.  Many of the private owners are understandably furious because they have had them for a considerable period of time and now are being forced to take out loans of up to &euro;100,000 to carry out appropriate repairs.  They have good cause to be annoyed because of the defects in the houses.  The works will include new pitched roofs to replace the existing flat roofs, the recladding of external walls, rewiring, installation of central heating as well as improvements in windows and doors.  Not all the purchasers of these houses are interested in availing of the refurbishment work.  The deterrent in some cases is the prohibitive cost involved.</P>
        <P>I believe the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, in conjunction with Limerick County Council, should review the prohibitive financial demands on the residents.  Concern has  been also expressed that the works carried out could mean some rows of houses in the estate will have pitch roofs, while others will retain flat roofs.  This will not add to the visual attractiveness of the estate.  The original individual design of the houses, and the inherent defects, are the fault of the National Building Agency.  Can it walk away from this?  The Minister should bring the agency to task.  It should be made account for its work rather than placing a cruel financial burden on those who were encouraged to purchase their houses.</P>
        <P>It was obvious the estate infrastructure was neglected.  The road structure is particularly defective.  I understand Limerick County Council has stated it will not carry out these works until the houses are finished.  This is unfair.  There should be no impediment to road resurfacing works being carried out in the estate.  I will press the council on this issue and look forward to the Minister of State&rsquo;s reply.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I am pleased to have the opportunity to take this matter on behalf of my Departmental colleague, Deputy Noel Ahern.</P>
        <P>Glenma housing estate is a private estate of 43 houses built by the NBA in 1973.  Of these, 35 are privately owned; they were sold as private purchases when the estate was originally built.  Limerick County Council owns and rents the remaining eight houses.</P>
        <P>The houses were constructed with flat roofs.  The first floor is finished with a metal cladding fixed to a timber stud wall which forms the internal frame of the houses.  There are various defects with the houses and these include leaking <Col N="1772"/>roofs and poor quality external cladding which is, in general, no longer weatherproof.  Limerick County Council submitted a proposal to my Department to refurbish the estate under the improvement works in lieu of housing scheme and the remedial works scheme.  The proposed works include the provision of new pitched roofs to replace existing flat roofs, the recladding of external walls and the upgrading of windows, external doors and external finishes, rewiring and installation of central heating, and some site development works.</P>
        <P>The improvement works programme allows local authorities to improve or extend privately owned accommodation occupied by households who are assessed to be eligible for local authority housing as an alternative to being rehoused by the local authority.  While this scheme would not be normally used to upgrade an entire estate, this is considered to be an exceptional case and my Department agreed in principle on 14 May 2002 to have the improvement works carried out under it.  Under this scheme the householders will be required to make repayments for the cost of the works to the local authority, based on the ability of households to pay.  The scheme also provides that a local authority and the private resident must enter a legal agreement which will go as far as possible in protecting the expenditure of public funds on private property.</P>
        <P>I understand extensive discussions have been held between the county council and the local residents and that 23 of the households in private ownership are fully supportive of the council&rsquo;s plans for refurbishment in the manner proposed.  I also understand that, at this time, the remaining nine residents are not interested in having refurbishment work carried out on their homes.  The plans as they now stand are for works to 23 private residences and eight local authority owned residences.  The remaining 12 houses are situated in one block and all are privately owned.  I understand three of these houses are unoccupied and that the council would consider purchasing the units should the remaining nine householders agree to participate in the scheme.  My Department issued approval to the council on 20 July 2004 to progress the refurbishment works to the eight council owned houses under the remedial works scheme.  The cost of the works was determined at &euro;818,464.</P>
        <P>My Department also issued approval on 20 July 2004 to the external and internal works proposed under the improvements in lieu scheme for the 23 privately owned dwellings, and a budget cost of &euro;1,837,386 was determined for these works.  It is understood delays have occurred due to agreements being obtained on the deed of charge whereby the cost of the works to private houses are charged against the folio.  This enables the council to recoup the cost of the works in the event of the property being sold on.  However, the council has obtained agreements in respect of one entire block which comprises six units &mdash; three private and three local authority owned.  It is <Col N="1773"/>anticipated work will commence in early November on this block, subject to agreement with the contractor.  It is understood from the council that discussions are ongoing in respect of the deed of charge for the remaining units.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like the Minister of State to bring my concerns to the NBA who originally built the houses.  I do not think the NBA can walk away and I would be interested in hearing its reaction to this.  An unfair financial burden is being placed on many elderly people in this estate regarding the cost of refurbishing the private houses.  This is acutely unfair &mdash; the problem was not of their making.</P>

The value of a house went from &euro;400,000 to almost &euro;700,000 following improvement works carried out in an estate in my old constituency,</P>
        <P>It is to the benefit of people to have these houses upgraded.  It will enhance the value of the houses and make them more comfortable.  We have specified that account will be taken where householders cannot afford to pay for these works.  The council will deal with them as fairly and practicably as possible.</P>

	<P>I express my gratitude to the staff of the House.  I had not anticipated this debate would be called so early.  Like everyone else, I had expected a vote at 7.15 p.m. and I was meeting a guest when they managed to contact me.  I am grateful for their usual efficiency.</P>
        <P>The matter I wish to raise has been advertised in <i>The Irish Times</i> and elsewhere.  Regrettably, as a result of human error, a considerable number of electors in my constituency have been disenfranchised.  A register is kept in the alumni and Seanad electoral offices and information is gathered on an annual basis.  The alumni file is used to generate the Seanad electoral register and contains information such as the name and address of the elector, degrees held by the elector, the year in which the first degree was conferred and the elector&rsquo;s Seanad electoral number.</P>
        <P>Seanad electoral claim forms are routinely given to graduates at their graduation ceremonies.  If my recall is correct, I was responsible for introducing this.  It used not to be automatically given and graduates had to claim it.  I ensured these would be given to graduates automatically as I felt it was in my interest to see the constituency growing.  The constituency has grown for a number of years.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Candidates complete the forms and submit them for processing.  This is done in a small <Col N="1774"/>cramped office by a small and dedicated staff who have done a pretty good job over the years.  They first check the eligibility of claimants, they then check the student identification number corresponds to the alumnus ID number, create an electronic file, enter the alumnus ID number into it, and enter the claimant&rsquo;s communications preference &mdash; whether they wish to be included in the edition of the register available to the public for commercial use &mdash; and then provide the details of the file to the information system in the college with a request to generate the file in order that the Seanad electoral claim flag is populated in the appropriate records.  Those are then coded for inclusion in the next publication of the register.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Not later than 31 May this year the Seanad electoral register was published.  It is normally published on the weekend preceding 1 June.  That is the legally valid register for the election.  This year, a situation arose where the person principally responsible had an accident, a file was left on the desk and somebody came in and tidied it away.  It was not until the first person returned to the office that she realised something had gone wrong.  The reason it was not noticed, because it normally would have been noticed, was that the number of additions in 2006 were 1,361 and they exceeded by 300 the numbers of admissions for the previous year.  It appeared, therefore, to be all right.  In other words, there was nothing to automatically alert the authorities that something was wrong.  They quickly came across the situation, however, realised a regrettable error had been made and did everything they could to rectify it.  I understand they took a certain amount of advice, spoke to the Department and came back with the notion that it was not possible.  I believe it is possible.  The college has said a new system is being put in practice which will be fully operational in 2008.  That may be too late for the 700 out of 2,000 people who were left off the register.  It would be intolerable to allow the accidental disenfranchisement of one third of those who were entitled.</P>
        <P>If the Taoiseach sticks to his guns and does not call the election until the very last moment, they may just squeak on but the register comes out on 1 June and if the election is held in April or earlier, they will not have a vote.  Thus the question remains, what is to be done?  This is a Legislature.  In an extreme situation an emergency Bill could be rushed through each House in half an hour.  That is a possibility and I ask the Government to consider everything to enfranchise those people.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Something else can be done for which there is a precedent, to which I draw the Minister of State&rsquo;s attention.  In 1997, a similar difficulty arose which was generated by the post office not delivering a large number of ballots.  An instrument was unearthed, SI 321 of 1997 &mdash; Seanad (University Members) General Election (Special Difficulty) (No. 2) Order, 1997.  What is this other than a special difficulty?  I am sure the Minister has possession of that statutory instrument and knows what it is about.  The statutory instrument states <Col N="1775"/>that the Minister, notwithstanding section 21 of the Seanad Electoral (University Members) Act, 1937 and paragraph 2 of the Seanad (University Members) General Election Order, 1997, can override that and personally, as Minister, direct that those persons should be enfranchised.</P>
        <P>I have given the Minister two suggestions.  The first should be to resort again, as was done in the past, to a special order of the Minister varying the Bill, powers which he clearly has, to allow these 700 people to vote or, alternatively, provide special legislation.  It could be a short Bill which I have no doubt would be passed unopposed in this House.  I appeal to the Minister to do that on behalf of my electorate, and as a politician he will understand the urgency of allowing people to vote in the next general election.  That is within the power of this Minister and this Government and I ask him to do it.</P>

	<P>I make this reply on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche.  I thank Senator Norris for raising this matter and for giving me an opportunity to set out the position on an issue which I know is of particular interest to Members of the House.</P>
        <P>In accordance with section 9 of the Seanad Electoral (University Members) Act 1937, a registration officer for each of the university constituencies is appointed by the appropriate university governing body and is responsible for the annual revision of their respective registers.</P>
        <P>I understand that, due to an administrative oversight, more than 700 valid applicants for inclusion on the current Trinity College register were omitted from it.  Under the provisions of section 6(2) of the 1937 Act, only those on the register are entitled to vote.  The subsection states, &ldquo;No person shall be entitled to vote at an election in a university constituency unless he is registered as an elector in the register of electors for that constituency&rdquo;.  The 1937 Act does not provide for a supplement to the register.  The register is operative from 1 June 2006 to 31 May 2007.</P>
        <P>It is clear in the circumstances that the persons omitted from the present register would not be eligible to vote in a Seanad election while that register remains in force, that is, up to and including 31 May 2007.</P>
        <P>In light of the situation, the Minister, Deputy Roche, asked the college to submit a report on the issue and that has now been received.  The college has investigated the circumstances involved and has reviewed the existing arrangements for compiling the register.  On foot of that review, the report details changes that are being implemented in procedural and administrative practices to ensure an administrative error of this nature will not happen again.  The university also confirms that the 700 or so persons involved will be included on the new register which comes into <Col N="1776"/>force on 1 June 2007 and will be eligible to vote in any Seanad election subsequent to that date.</P>
        <P>In this regard, it is relevant to note the Taoiseach has made it clear on many occasions that this Government has every intention of completing its full term in office.  Under Article 18.8 of the Constitution, a general election for the Seanad must take place within 90 days of the dissolution of the D&aacute;il, therefore, in all probability, we are looking at a Seanad poll not earlier than July 2007.  On this basis, the register on which the next Seanad general election will be held most likely will be the new register that comes into force on the 1 June next year and not the current register, which is giving rise to the present debate.  There is no question but that the omitted names will be included on the new register.</P>
        <P>Members of the House will be aware of the work of the all-party group on Seanad reform, which is chaired by the Minister, Deputy Roche.  One of the current agenda items is the register for the election of Seanad university members.  The Minister, Deputy Roche, this afternoon attended a meeting of the group where the matter was discussed.  The group provides an ideal forum in which to consider these kinds of issues.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Senator Norris and others have suggested use of powers under section 164 of the Electoral Act 1992 to attempt to rectify the situation with the current register.  Having considered the matter, the Minister, Deputy Roche, is satisfied that, on the information available, the present circumstances are not such as are contemplated by section 164 and therefore he is not in a position to make an order along the lines suggested.</P>
        <?oasys _cl11- ?><P>In any event, as the Minister has already made clear, the current register is unlikely to be used for the Seanad general election next year.  On the timescale as set out, the new register will be used for that purpose and will include the names of those omitted in error this year.</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister of State for providing us with the Minister&rsquo;s response.  I do not find it entirely satisfactory because it is a type of wing and a prayer response.  We hope the election will not take place early, a hope I fervently share, and that these people will be on the register.  However, the Minister of State said that the 1937 Act does not provide for a supplement to the register.  It does not exclude it.  There is nothing legally to prevent it.  He states baldly he is satisfied that on the information available, the mechanism I have suggested does not seem to him to be operable.  I would like to have a meeting with the Minister to discuss this issue with him face to face.  I hope that can be arranged because it is a very important matter.  If there was an election, 700 people would be excluded from an electorate of 50,000.  That is a lot of people, almost 2%.  I seek a meeting to address the two points I made.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share time with Senator Ulick Burke.  </P>
        <P>There was great shock in the Kinvara area on 12 October when the Mercy Order announced it was withdrawing as a provider of education in the Kinvara area and that it would close Seamount College, Kinvara.  The order stated it would not take first year students in September 2007.  Why have the trustees decided not to appoint a new board of management?  Must the Department of Education and Science give permission to disband a board of management?</P>
        <P>This matter was decided by the Mercy Order without consultation, an issue raised at a meeting with public representatives last Friday in Kinvara.  That 243 girls are attending the school proves it is viable.  If the Department believes the number of students is too low, I could give examples of schools in the constituency in which I reside with fewer students that still manage to cover a broad curriculum.  St Cuan&rsquo;s College in Castleblakeney has 220 pupils.  Some years ago sisters teaching there had to return to France but a lay school was able to function under the patronage of the bishop.</P>
        <P>The Department may believe male students in the area are attending Gort community school.  The capacity of that school is 600 but more than 730 students are now attending it and the school has to rent rooms from the VEC.  Gort is some 12 miles from Kinvara.  Calasanctius school in Oranmore is another one without further capacity.</P>
        <P>There must be a school in Kinvara.  I seek breathing space for the school, to allow enrolment to continue in September and for an alternative to the convent to be found.  I cannot pre-empt what the local community may say but it is in shock at this decision.  The Department did not know of this decision until 12 October and there was no consultation by the Mercy Order.  Few girls from the area attend Gort community school and they wish to attend the local school, Seamount College.  With breathing space we will be able to comply with the wishes of the parents and the community in Kinvara.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Kitt for sharing time.  We have previously spoken on school trans<Col N="1778"/>port difficulties regarding Seamount College, Kinvara.  The suddenness and secrecy of this decision has shocked the community, the teaching staff, the board of management and parents.  Today, the Department of Education and Science informed me of confidential negotiations between the trustees of the college and the Department in April.  It is unacceptable that the Minister for Education and Science was not informed of the decision.  Likewise, the people whose livelihood and education are affected by it were not informed.  It is regrettable the decision was announced during the last days of office of the board of management.  As a result, the trustees appointed a single manager, a retrograde step given that all partners in education agreed it was best that every school have a board of management.  That has been ruled out, an unnecessary caveat.</P>
        <P>The most important point to be communicated to the Minister for Education and Science is that continuation of intake to Seamount College next September must be allowed.  The urgency of this cannot be over-emphasised.  From next month until Easter schools will hold open days for prospective students.  If the cycle is broken, there will be a gap in attendance at Kinvara.</P>
        <P>Regardless of involvement of the current trustees in future education in Kinvara, a second level school in the area is important.  The Department&rsquo;s projected numbers are ill-informed.  The Department&rsquo;s first communication to the school principal, the board of management and staff stated there were 150 students in Kinvara.  As Senator Kitt stated, 243 are enrolled in the school.  Trustees had sought projected figures from the Department over the years.  It is detrimental to the future of education in the area for the Department&rsquo;s figures to be accepted.  The two nearest schools, in Gort and Oranmore, are full to capacity.  Last night in the D&aacute;il it was suggested those schools could accommodate the low intake and low projected figures of Seamount College.  Nothing could be further from the truth.</P>
        <P>The liaison group is trying to meet all the relevant bodies and to reopen negotiations.  It is unbelievable that any group of trustees would seek to close the school without consultation with relevant groups.  We seek continuation and intake of students in the coming year.  This will provide space for reasonable, transparent negotiations.  A total of 14 young teachers who have proved themselves by their capacity to produce some of the highest examination results in the country, as per the 2004 assessment of examination results carried out by <i>The Irish Times</i>, together with seven other temporary teachers, will be without a job.  That someone can make a decision like this so callously is unacceptable and unfair to teachers and their families and friends.  They have a contribution to make to the community.  Seamount College was as much a part of the heritage of Kinvara as any school in any other town.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1779"/>
      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. B. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I am making this reply on behalf of the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Hanafin.  At the outset, I thank Senator Kitt for raising this matter and Senator Ulick Burke for his contribution to the debate.  The Department of Education and Science fully appreciates the impact and importance this decision has on the local community.  I emphasise that Seamount College is a voluntary secondary school and decisions such as the one which is the subject of this debate are within the remit of the patron body, that is the Sisters of Mercy.</P>
        <P>Seamount College, Kinvara, is a girls secondary school with a current enrolment of approximately 240 girls.  I understand that boys from Kinvara, in the main, attend Gort community school, which is a co-educational facility.  On 12 October 2006, the school trustees &mdash; the Sisters of Mercy, western province &mdash; announced their intention to withdraw as providers of education in the Kinvara area and to close Seamount College.  They informed the Department of Education and Science that they had taken this decision following a comprehensive review of the voluntary secondary schools within the western province of their order.  They decided the closure would be on a phased basis with no intake of first-year students in September 2007.  The annual enrolment of first-year students stands at approximately 40.</P>
        <P>As part of the implementation process following from this decision, the trustees have decided not to appoint a new board of management and to appoint a single manager to manage the school in the interim and to oversee the phased closure process.  The term of office of the existing board of management expired on 14 October 2006.  Again, this is primarily a matter for the trustees.  The trustees have written to the Department of Education and Science concerning the appointment of the manager and the Department will respond to them in due course.</P>
        <P>In respect of a decision by a patron body to close a school, the Department&rsquo;s concern is to ensure there are sufficient pupil places to meet demand in a given area.  From a school planning perspective and based on data available to the Department, there appears to be an already well-established trend of boys from the Kinvara area attending the neighbouring Gort community school and, more recently, there would appear to be an increase in the number of girls also attending Gort community school.  Gort community school is a co-educational facility and, at present, the Sisters of Mercy also serve as trustees of this school.  The school was built in the mid-<Col N="1780"/>1990s with an overall capacity of 800 and I understand that enrolment as at September 2006 stood at just over 730 students.</P>
        <P>I can assure the House that the Department is examining the implications of the phased closure with a view to ensuring the educational needs of the children in the area continue to be met.  The Sisters of Mercy have a strong record of educational achievement at Seamount College over many years and the decision to close the school is regrettable.  However, the order will maintain an educational presence at second level in the area as they are still trustees of Gort community school.  The order and the trustees have also indicated to the Department that they intend to liaise with the County Galway Vocational Educational Committee in respect of provision at Gort community school.  I again thank Senator Kitt for raising this matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelKitt"><NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State.  He spoke about the increasing number of girls attending Gort community school.  It is only right that I should point out that I understand that only four girls from the parish attend that school.  Will the Minister of State raise this point with the Department of Education and Science?  I do not see this as evidence of an increasing trend and it is certainly not an increase in the number of girls attending Gort community school.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>The figures used by the Department of Education and Science to date are, for want of a better word, questionable.  I ask that the view of the local committee, which knows best about the population, intakes and projected figures in that catchment area for the future, be taken into account before any decision is taken to close the school.  The figures at both ends of this stick are unreliable and will definitely be contradicted by the real figures.    </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Mr. B. O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>Obviously, I am willing to take the concerns of both Senators back to the Department of Education and Science.  My understanding is that the enrolment of 240 is the accurate figure.  I also understand there is capacity for 800 in Gort community school and that its enrolment of 730 allows for further expansion of the number of pupils it can accommodate.  That being said, if additional information is available through the parish records or any developments that are likely to take place, the Minister of Education and Science would be delighted to obtain it and this information should be furnished to her.  </P>
