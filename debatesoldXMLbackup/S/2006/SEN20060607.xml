	<P>I have notice from Senator John Paul Phelan that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
    <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Agriculture and Food to outline the current position with regard to the allocation of compensation following the cessation of sugar production and the closure of the sugar industry in Ireland.</P>
    <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Dooley of the following matter:</P>
    <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Finance to outline the current status of the development of a search and rescue facility at Doolin, County Clare.</P>
    <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Browne of the following matter:</P>
    <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Finance to clarify the tax relief available to those paying maintenance towards the upkeep of their children and if the same tax relief applies to married people who may be paying maintenance for children born outside the marriage.</P>
    <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

   <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>Last week, following the public outrage and political confusion as a result of the Mr. A. case, this House played a proper and leading role in trying to respond to the situation in a positive fashion. The House sat until late on Friday evening to pass, with some reluctance, the emergency legislation which the Government introduced.</P>
    <P>We are advised, arising from last week&rsquo;s political crisis, that the Taoiseach will outline a series of measures to the other House. In view of the role played by this House it would be appropriate that the House be briefed on the Government&rsquo;s proposals at the earliest possible opportunity. Certainly there is a need to have a full discussion on whatever measures are proposed. We have heard that the Taoiseach will announce an inquiry by an official of the Department of Finance into the role played, or not played as the case may be, by the Attorney General&rsquo;s office. Fine Gael demands that any inquiry into the performance of the Attorney General&rsquo;s office be transparent, public, independent and forensic.</P>
    <P>Some Members will recall that in 1994, arising from the Brendan Smyth case, there was a requirement to have a full investigation into the performance of the Attorney General&rsquo;s office on that occasion. Fine Gael will insist that the same type of thorough investigation take place on this occasion. We recall also that recommendations were put in place in the spring of 1995 and if those recommendations had been fully acted on, perhaps we would not have the problems we now have.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge that the Taoiseach is indicating that problems need to be addressed and changes need to be made. That admission by the Taoiseach that things have not happened as they should have happened is welcome. Once again it appears that while the Taoiseach and the Government admit problems exist, political responsibility is not being taken by anybody. That is disappointing. Political responsibility needs to be taken for what happened last week.</P>
    <P>Arising from the ongoing public fear, outrage and political difficulties caused by the Mr. A. case, we are still unclear as to where exactly we stand. We are advised that there are 17 persons in prison arising from convictions under the 1935 Act but we have no idea as to the status of these convictions or what appeals may be under way that could be successful. Those grave issues which concern not just the House but deeply concerned the country and, particularly parents, last week are still with us and need to be fully debated in the House at the earliest opportunity.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Following from what Senator Bradford said, I agree we should continue to examine this very important area of public life. Although it was an important debate in its way, this House was prevented last week from fulfilling its constitutional role as the amending Chamber by virtue of the fact that the D&aacute;il was <Col N="1847"/>allowed to evaporate and there was no possibility whatever of amendments being taken. That clearly undercuts the role of this House. We were also faced with what amounted to a guillotine. That is very regrettable. I call on the Acting Leader to ensure, through his good offices, this never happens again in this Chamber.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask that we secure copies of the Marty report and have it circulated it to all Members and have an early debate on this matter. The subject of CIA rendition flights has been ventilated in the House already. The report was published in Paris this morning. What people like myself have been saying for the past couple of years has been absolutely vindicated. Ireland has been, to use a phrase sometimes employed on this side of the House, named and shamed. It has clearly been stated that we have been implicated. I was able to do that by an analysis of the flight paths of the aeroplanes and use the information supplied by courageous people such as Tim<?oasys _jy ?>Hourigan and Ed Hogan in Shannon. It was perfectly clear that whatever else, on a number of occasions, aircraft were used illegally to kidnap and transport people illegally to places of torture and then we facilitated them knowingly on the return journey by refuelling them. It is a cause of shame and the response of the Department of Foreign Affairs is inadequate, pusillanimous and contemptible. It says there is nothing new in it. If that is the case why did they not face up to this? I call upon the House to reinstate the commission which collapsed due to lobbying from Clare County Council. It is time this Parliament took responsibility and exhibited its authority by refusing to be dominated by people who, though elected in a local area, are not elected to this national Parliament. This network of torture facilitation throughout Europe has been described as a spider&rsquo;s web.</P>
    <P>I request a discussion on the development of the new children&rsquo;s hospital. As a resident of Dublin&rsquo;s northside I am, in one sense, pleased that this facility should be hosted by the Mater Hospital, it is a fine hospital with new development proposals in process. However, it has been suggested in the media that the location of the new children&rsquo;s hospital was chosen because it is located in the Taoiseach&rsquo;s constituency. Such matters must be addressed to set the minds of the general public at ease. Strong cases are also being made for other hospitals, such as St. James&rsquo;s so we need the full facts. Professor Drumm, the chief executive of the Health Service Executive, has indicated that criteria such as public accessibility, speed of construction and so on were taken into account. If this is the case we need to clearly place this matter on the record so we know the best services are being provided on behalf of the children of this country.</P>
   </Speaker>
<Col N="1848"/>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Through what forum will the Attorney General be invited to explain what happened in his office in the period leading to the events that transfixed the nation last week and the week before last? Those with political accountability will have to submit themselves to questioning in these Houses. There seems to be a blanket of silence descending around the Office of the Attorney General which has insisted he will neither comment nor resign. The office merely states it will not happen again, it was a communications problem.</P>
    <P>This was not a communications problem, it was a fundamental policy failure. We are entitled to know what happened in the Attorney General&rsquo;s office on this issue, otherwise the parents of this country may feel they cannot trust that office to take every action necessary to defend children.</P>
    <P>Yesterday it was announced that the north-eastern area of the Health Service Executive was implementing cutbacks of &euro;10 million. This news comes a week after the State announced it has a budget surplus of &euro;1.8 billion. I estimate that &euro;10 million is roughly equivalent to 4,000 to 5,000 people not having access to hospital services over the next 12 months. This is a profound and fundamental issue.</P>
    <P>There is an increasing body of evidence that suggests we are not spending enough on our health service. The ideological incantation is that we cannot just throw money at the issue. We all know this is true, it is not just throwing money at the issue. However, this does not mean that money is not part of the problem. We need a serious debate in this House on the funding of the health service. It is time we stopped repeating the same arguments. We know there is waste, we know there is inefficiency, we know all these things, notwithstanding the 100 plus people being paid &euro;100,000. If they were doing their jobs I would not begrudge them &euro;150,000. The problem lies in the number of people in the HSE being paid &euro;100,000 and doing a job equivalent to &euro;25,000.</P>
    <P>I fully agree with Senator Norris. We have endeavoured to drag this House into confronting one small but shameful episode in this country&rsquo;s history, from which the entire establishment averted its eyes and which it pretended was not happening. We are now in effect condemned by the body responsible for ensuring human rights in Europe are defended, a body set up after the Second World War to ensure that the sort of atrocities which happened would never happen again in Europe. We decided that in this case, apparently, we were not going to ask the questions, were not going to look in certain places and were going to pretend for as long as possible that nothing happened. It is a shameful position for a country which makes human rights one of the platforms of its foreign policy that our response on the first occasion when confronted by a scandalous abuse of human rights, by the most powerful country in the world, was to pretend it <Col N="1849"/>did not happen. When some of us, including some on the Government side of the House, tried to get an agreement to investigate the matter as well as we could, we were told it would not be appropriate. I choose to believe the Members opposite have better reasons than the fact that Clare County Council was upset. I hope there was a better reason, but I have not heard it yet.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Ryan is looking for a debate.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am most assuredly looking for an urgent debate on the report. which is now being made public. about our complicity in extraordinary rendition of people who ended up being tortured.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Ms White</NameTxt>
	<P>I support what Senator Norris has said about the treatment of this House last Friday. This side of the House was valiantly led by Senator Walsh, and Senator Cox pleaded that her amendment be listened to. How correct she proved to be at the weekend. When I was entering the House, I saw Members of the D&aacute;il leaving because the D&aacute;il had been adjourned, so I realised before we sat here last Friday that we were just a rubber stamp for legislation. I would like the Leader to request the T&aacute;naiste and the Taoiseach to ensure such disrespect will never be shown to this House again.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Ms White</NameTxt>
	<P>I also call for a debate on the role of the Seanad in legislation, following the disrespect shown.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>There should also be a call for the Taoiseach&rsquo;s resignation.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I support what Senator White said, along with the comments of Senators Bradford and Norris. It was most unfortunate, and contrary to the tradition and the recent history of this House, that there was a guillotine. Section 5 was the meat of that flawed Bill. It is regrettable that Members were offering and were not listened to in this House last Friday. I am sure the Leader will comment on the matter.</P>
    <P Just="Left">I congratulate the State&rsquo;s legal team on arguing successfully, as the Supreme Court decided, that Mr. A be returned to prison. However, the initial failure in the State&rsquo;s argument, which led to this crisis, needs to be urgently, forensically and transparently investigated, as Senator Bradford said. While I welcome the Taoiseach&rsquo;s admission of failure, if that is what it is, and the fact that he will make an announcement to the other House, we need to hear something about the matter in this Chamber, and this House should debate it too.</P>
    <P>Can the Acting Leader tell us how many other cases in the judicial system based on the 1935 Act will be affected? A series of questions arises, of <Col N="1850"/>which that is only one. This Government has had nine years to deal with the matter and as Senator Bradford said, we thought that following the Brendan Smyth case, failsafe systems were put in place, which patently failed in the current instance. If, as has been suggested, matters are to be referred to an all-party joint committee, we need a timeframe for that, because we know what can happen when matters go to all-party committees. I call on the Acting Leader, whose comments will be greatly respected, to outline what he knows of the Government&rsquo;s position and to arrange a debate on the matter in this House.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnMinihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Minihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Ryan raised the issue that the country is confronted by a scandalous abuse of human rights. I want to raise another scandalous abuse of human rights. I have always argued that the killing of Detective Garda Jerry McCabe was intentional, calculated and cold-blooded.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear. The Senator is absolutely right.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnMinihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Minihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Last night&rsquo;s programme on RTE confirmed this. Mr. Gerry Adams said the killing was wrong and the operation was sanctioned by an authorised person at a lower level, yet he refuses to name that authorised person. This morning on Radio Kerry, Deputy Ferris said he would not describe the killers of Jerry McCabe as criminals. He went on to say that he could not encourage anyone with information on the killing to contact the Garda. I ask all Members to join with me in expressing revulsion at the attitudes adopted by Mr. Adams and Deputy Ferris. People must take responsibility on this issue. Those who form and influence public opinion must apply the necessary pressure on Sinn F&eacute;in to name the authorised person in question and to encourage people who have information on the killing to contact the Garda.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Minihan&rsquo;s words must be supported by all Members. I support all those who have called for a debate on rendition flights through Shannon Airport. The Marty report presents a serious issue for the State.</P>
    <P>I have two issues on which I ask the Acting Leader to invite the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children to address in the House. The first concerns the abuse of alcohol by young people. Every year the director of the sexual assault unit at the Rotunda Hospital claims that in 60% of the cases of rape or sexual assault presented at the hospital the individuals concerned are drunk. I want the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children to explain why the Government has abandoned its policy regarding drink and young people. The advertising code is to be brought forward by the drinks industry on a voluntary basis and not in the manner recom<Col N="1851"/>mended by the expert report the Department produced.</P>
    <P>Second, in Tuesday&rsquo;s edition of <i>The Irish Times</i> a letter by ten orthopaedic surgeons at Tallaght Hospital was published. They claimed that, between the ten of them, they only have access to 20 beds for elective surgery. Over the past several years I have been repeatedly contacted by surgeons and anaesthetists about the cancelling of elective operations because there were not enough beds for patients. This is a terrible waste of time and money. The National Treatment Purchase Fund brings the same patients to private hospitals for operations while publicly paid surgeons, anaesthetists and nurses stand beside empty operating theatres because there are no public beds for these patients. It is a shocking waste of money.</P>
    <P>It is mad that the National Treatment Purchase Fund does not allow public hospitals to tender for more than 10% of its work. We cannot find out what fees are being charged by these private hospitals for the various operations because the fund claims it is commercially sensitive information. Yet we are all paying for this. It is crazy that medical professionals &mdash; surgeons, anaesthetist and nurses &mdash; are willing to work but cannot because there are no beds. The same patients are being taken to private hospitals where there are beds for which the taxpayer pays.</P>
    <P>The payments being made by the National Treatment Purchase Fund to the private hospitals for various operations must be explored. We must ensure these operations are done at public hospitals, which we are funding and the facilities of which are sitting idle.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn"><NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
	<P>I call for a debate on rheumatology services. The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children, of which I am a member, recently received a deputation which outlined the shortcomings in the area of rheumatology. It is clear that the appropriately trained personnel and resources are available and the waiting time for treatment for those suffering from rheumatism and related conditions is totally unacceptable. I would ask that we debate this matter as soon as possible. The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, is generous with her time in coming into the House and I am sure that debate will take place within a reasonable period.</P>
    <P Just="Left">I commend the Garda on its success in apprehending the gang of seven eastern Europeans. I know I might offend some people by saying they were not Irish because we have many such gangs of our own. This gang abducted two persons in Mullingar and was successful in extorting a sum of &euro;5,000 for their release. The Garda apprehended that gang. This begs the following questions. Were they legal or illegal immigrants? If they were illegal immigrants, what is the process involved?</P>
<Col N="1852"/>
    <P>I commend the Garda&rsquo;s equal success in Cork in apprehending the gang indulging in a credit card scam. Clearly, all involved were also non-nationals. As I stated already, we have plenty of such gangs of our own. What sort of screening is done?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Is Senator Glynn pressing for a debate?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn"><NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes. Such a debate is needed urgently. As I stated in this House previously, it is clear that there are organised criminal gangs coming into this country for the purposes I outlined. I want to know what sort of monitoring is done on the people coming in here. If they are coming to do what some of them are obviously doing, then it is best that they stay away.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>The report on a study carried out by three medical practitioners in the west at centres caring for the elderly, both private and public, clearly shows an abuse in the use of anti-psychotic drugs in the treatment of the patients who have some symptoms of dementia. It is appalling that there is inappropriate use of these drugs in controlling the patients. When the authorities of those institutions were asked, they stated they were using them to control restlessness, tendencies to wander and shouting and disruption of that kind of a minor nature. It is important we immediately take action to ensure constant monitoring for such abuse in both private and public facilities which care for the elderly. If these are the methods being used, it is not good enough to call this caring for the elderly.</P>
    <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The report showed that of the 80 patients surveyed on the prescription of regular anti-psychotic medication, 51% were receiving inappropriate drugs. That is an alarming statistic. I ask the Acting Leader to immediately contact the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, to ensure that proper guidelines are put in place on the use of such drugs for the elderly. I am told that some of those drugs cause a risk of stroke. If those institutions are using drugs that will cause further illnesses, it is an alarming issue which must be investigated as a matter of urgency so that the elderly will be cared for properly in institutions, both private and public.</P>
     </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DrMauriceHayes"><NameTxt>Dr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator White&rsquo;s remarks about the treatment of the Seanad on Friday last. We all came to do our parliamentary duty to find that no word or comment of ours could possibly make the slightest difference to the legislation as it was passed. The Seanad has been taken for granted and we should not accept that. We were told at one stage there would not be a guillotine and the debate would not be curtailed. As a result, section 5, which was the nub of the matter and which will continue to cause confusion and perhaps challenge, was never discussed.</P>
<Col N="1853"/>
    <P>I also support Senator Norris&rsquo;s call for the publication of the criteria relating to the decision to site the national children&rsquo;s hospital at the Mater Hospital. I have no interest in any of these hospitals and I have no doubt from what I have read that the judgment was made on objective grounds.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid=""><NameTxt>Senators</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DrMauriceHayes"><NameTxt>Dr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I have been involved previously in such matters and I know one gets very little thanks for it. The issues involved in making such decisions are most complex. It is important to show there was not political influence, as I believe was the case. This would be in the interests of the Health Service Executive and the hospital. A case has been made and criteria have been set down and it would clear up much confusion and help public confidence in the decision-making process if these were published.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>Those of us who saw the television programme last night on the death of Detective Garda McCabe were not surprised to hear the refusal to condemn such killing. What does astound me is that, according to Senator Minihan, an elected Member of the Oireachtas stated this morning on Kerry Radio that he would urge those who have knowledge of this matter not to go to the Garda. That is overstepping the mark.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I wonder to what extent it is possible to have this matter forced out into the open. If the electorate was made aware of this proposal it would change many attitudes. Having watched that brave lady, the widow of Detective Garda McCabe on television last night, I am saddened to hear of this report from Kerry Radio this morning.</P>
    <P>I ask the Acting Leader to draw the attention of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to the sad deaths last weeks due to the tragic drownings in County Cork. Although there is no connection with that incident, I understand that the Garda water unit, which is the recovery unit of the Garda, is seriously undermanned. I am not sure why this is the case. Perhaps the unit depends on voluntary effort. Following a recent incident, it was five days before the water unit could search for a body as it was engaged on a case in another part of the country. I ask the Acting Leader to draw the attention of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to this matter to see if something can be done about it.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>I join with other Senators in calling for a debate on the report of the Council of Europe into the issue of rendition. I have only had a brief opportunity to go through the documentation that has been released today but I believe the report lacks credibility.</P>

	<P>Why did Senator Dooley oppose our own inquiry then?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Dooley should be allowed to speak without interruption.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>No evidence is provided to back up the allegations. Emotive language is spattered throughout the report, such as phrases like &ldquo;spider&rsquo;s web&rdquo; and &ldquo;collusion&rdquo;. This clearly shows the report lacks objectivity.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>It does not show that to me.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>It is evident that Senator Marty has come to this matter with a biased opinion and created a report around it. I strongly reject the use of the word &ldquo;collusion&rdquo; in reference to the Government.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>It is nothing else.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>If one gets a dictionary definition of the word &ldquo;collusion&rdquo;, it refers to a secret agreement between two or more parties for a fraudulent, illegal or deceitful purpose.</P>

	<P>That is not the question.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>It has been given assurances that no prisoners have been brought through the airport.</P>
    <P Just="Left">We talk about indictments and the way in which Ireland has been besmirched by this issue. In the report I have received there are three lines which use the emotive language of collusion and makes reference to the preponderance of evidence gathered. It lists Shannon Airport as being among those airports used for rendition flights and goes on to state these airports are points at <Col N="1855"/>which aircraft land and refuel, mostly on the way home.</P>
    <P>The major debate in both Houses has concerned the passage of prisoners through the airport. The report found no evidence that prisoners were being transported through the airport but we are now changing the dynamics of the debate.</P>

	<P>Senators on this side of the House can fully understand the frustration and anger voiced by a Government Senator this morning about the manner in which the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Bill 2006 went through the House last Friday. Nobody has assumed responsibility and there is no political accountability in respect of this crisis. It was decided that several amendments tabled by Senators from both sides of the House could not be taken.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed with the actions of the Leader and I would voice my disappointment if she was here today. She promised us that a Bill would never be guillotined in this House in her term as Leader so she must answer for her actions in respect of this issue.</P>

<Col N="1856"/>
    <P>The Leader should invite the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to the House for a debate on the inadequacy of housing grants for elderly people, namely, the essential repairs and disabled persons grants. These grants have not kept pace with inflation. I know an elderly person who was quoted &euro;48,000 for necessary repairs to his house but the maximum grant he can receive is between &euro;18,000 and &euro;20,000, depending on the local authority.</P>
    <P>These elderly people are unable to afford this kind of money for repairs. At a time when, as the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government recently noted, the country is awash with money, he should be ashamed of himself. I call on him to come to this House to debate the grants available to our elderly people because such a debate is urgently needed.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I concur with the comments of Senator Bradford. To its credit, the House sensibly focused on the serious issue before it last week, rather than succumbing to the temptation to play politics, as happens elsewhere. However, it is important that this spirit is maintained and I support Senator Bradford&rsquo;s call for a debate at the earliest opportunity. I have heard reports about measures which will be announced by the Taoiseach in the D&aacute;il today. Such measures are commendable and we should have the opportunity to contribute to them because they are a step in benchmarking legislation in other countries to ensure that best practice applies in this country.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that calls made by me in the past have not resulted in a debate on ongoing tribunals of inquiry. Some form of accountability by way of progress reports on tribunals of inquiry is needed. The work carried out by the tribunals is laudable but has been achieved at very high cost. Since their establishment eight or nine years ago&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>Senator Jim Walsh, without interruption.</P>

   <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>Since their establishment, new legislation has been introduced which allows these issues to be addressed in a more expeditious and less costly way and still be as effective. This is an important development.</P>
    <P>I am appalled to think that the tribunals will operate to a completely different standard to that of our courts. Hearsay evidence is not permitted in our courts. However, such evidence is not only accepted in tribunals of inquiry, it is encouraged. People who have done wrong should be held accountable but they should not be held up for public ridicule for such a prolonged period without an adjudication being made. Their good names should not be besmirched before the reports of the tribunals are published.</P>
<Col N="1857"/>
    <P>Justice delayed is justice denied. It has been eight years since some of the tribunals were established and the situation is wholly unacceptable. The time has come to have a rational debate on how best to bring the tribunals to a satisfactory conclusion without concealing anything they must investigate.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I join with my colleague, Senator Bradford, in asking for a full, open, transparent and independent inquiry into the inaction of the Attorney General&rsquo;s office last week and the preceding week. The Taoiseach will make an announcement, in anticipation of which Senator Jim Walsh expressed his views, but it is vital that such an inquiry would be independent. This side of the House hopes that will be the case.</P>
    <P>I did not hear the interview given by Deputy Ferris referred to by Senators Minihan and Quinn in respect of the killing of Detective Garda McCabe. It is shocking and repugnant that a Member of the Lower House would make such a comment. His comments on local radio and how unacceptable and inappropriate they are should be brought home to everyone. This House should call on him and anyone with knowledge of what occurred this day ten years ago to make contact with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as soon as possible.</P>
    <P Just="Left">Senator Norris raised the important issue of the national children&rsquo;s hospital, as possible political interference has been mentioned in the media.  Irrespective of whether there was any, we must be clear about the criteria on which the decision to locate the hospital at the Mater Hospital was based. The site at St. James&rsquo;s Hospital is four or five times larger and better suited to future expansion and improvement than the site at the Mater Hospital. The primary reason the latter was chosen was because the project could be done more quickly. There is some merit in this criterion, but serious questions have been raised. We should debate the reason the site was chosen.</P>
    <P>It would be remiss if no Senator from either side of the House took the opportunity to wish the best to those people who are sitting their leaving certificate and junior certificate examinations in 25&deg; heat. I remember where I was this day nine years ago and am glad I do not have to face it again.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MargaretCox"><NameTxt>Ms Cox</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to address two points. Will the Acting Leader arrange for a debate on the situation in which we found ourselves last Friday? On the Order of Business, it was clarified by the Leader that no guillotine would be applied to the legislation. Everyone with whom I spoke also had this impression. The House faced a great emergency and the legislation was one of the most <Col N="1858"/>serious Bills to be passed since 2002. I was under the impression that a guillotine would not be applied and, unlike in the D&aacute;il, Members would be able to examine all of the issues. However, this did not happen.</P>
    <P>During the Order of Business, Senator O&rsquo;Rourke clearly outlined the situation to the leader of the Opposition when she stated: &ldquo;We should play it as it goes. We will see how the debate proceeds, who contributes and what time we have available.&rdquo;</P>

   <Speaker pid="MargaretCox"><NameTxt>Ms Cox</NameTxt>
	<P>If Ministers for Justice, Equality and Law Reform are to appear before the House and treat it like a rubber stamp, I want to speak on the importance of the Seanad. Previously, someone described the position of a Cathaoirleach as that of a eunuch. Many Senators have been elected. We traipsed around the country, sought mandates from the people, were each elected to do a job and are all paid salaries by taxpayers. Last Friday, our rights were taken away. The Minister came into the House determined not to accept any amendments.</P>

    <P>When is it intended to bring the legislation we passed last week back to the House? We did not have time to debate section 5 properly. Constitutional lawyers are now raising concerns that the section may be unconstitutional.</P>

	<P>I am entitled to speak about forthcoming debates and legislation. It is not acceptable that these Houses passed legislation, under duress, that makes boys less equal than girls. We cannot allow this legislation to remain on the Statute Book. The Taoiseach may deal with the issue in the D&aacute;il and pass it to an Oireachtas com<Col N="1859"/>mittee. I appeal for the Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to set a time limit to address the legislation so that everyone in the State is equal in the eyes of the law and the Constitution.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>The national pay talks resume this afternoon in Government buildings. While broad agreement has been reached between the social partners on pay and employment standards, pensions are proving to be a stumbling block. I welcome the fact that the Irish Congress of Trade Unions is at last paying attention to the issue of pensions in light of one of the biggest banks in the country stating that new entrants will only be on defined contribution pension schemes instead of defined benefit schemes, as enjoyed by current employees.</P>
    <P>After many debates in the House and my pressing the Minister, I have finally secured information from the Department of Social and Family Affairs that there are 50,000 on deferred frozen benefits. Those are people who paid into pension schemes over the years and whose pensions have not been revalued.</P>
    <P>I am not sure how the Acting Leader could deliver a message to the Taoiseach&rsquo;s representative at the social partnership talks today to say that where an employer fails to give a guaranteed pension benefit, the employees should be allowed to opt out of the company pension scheme and receive the benefit and financial incentive instead. The time has come where we must admit that when pensions are not delivering, employers must pay up and instead give the remuneration to the employees.</P>
    <P>It is a good thing that pensions are finally being recognised as a major problem. The pensions industry has ripped people off while the Government did nothing to prevent it taking money from people with no guaranteed return. This could be a good opportunity for people to get what they deserve. If the pensions industry and employers cannot deliver guaranteed pensions, they should give the employees remuneration instead.</P>

Notwithstanding these facts, I have witnessed a creeping and sinister movement in operation on this island since the Good Friday Agreement was signed.

	<P>I share speakers&rsquo; views on section 5 of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act, the most anomalous part of the legislation. Last week, the House was not afforded an opportunity to debate this section. I agree that many Senators on the Government side also offered to contribute to the debate but the House was prevented from holding such a debate by the use of a Government guillotine, a most unfortunate decision. What steps, if any, does the Government intend to take to test the constitutionality of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act? How does it intend to ensure that the errors which occurred in the Office of the Attorney General and, possibly, elsewhere will be addressed? Does it intend to establish an all-party committee to deal with the many aspects of law pertaining to the protection of children?</P>

	<P>I support Senator Henry&rsquo;s call for a debate on alcohol abuse, as I have supported her on this matter in the past. The issue of alcohol abuse periodically moves centre stage before disappearing from the radar screen. We have evidence to show that it lies at the root of most anti-social behaviour and crime, including murder, sexual assault and domestic violence. We all express shock and horror when we see the results of this problem, as it is appropriate to do, but we are not prepared to delve deeply into the issue to determine the direction in which society is moving.</P>
    <P Just="Left">A series of programmes entitled &ldquo;Boozing Britain&rdquo; is being shown on television. Perhaps Senators have seen it. It is unbelievable that the events portrayed on our screens should occur in a civilised society. These people fear neither God nor man. It is not something that is happening in the dark &mdash; the television cameras went into pubs and showed some of the most outrageous things one could possibly imagine. There are reasons we will not delve deeply into this matter.</P>

	<P>Many Senators have referred to last Friday&rsquo;s sitting of the House. It is not ideal for the Houses of the Oireachtas to sit on the same day as a major court case. The courts and the Oireachtas are separate and we should not be seen to compete with each other. Thankfully, last Friday&rsquo;s court case concerning Mr. A went the way everyone hoped it would. Had it gone wrong, I imagine it would have had implications. We should learn lessons from that and not necessarily sit on days of major court cases.</P>
    <P>I am seeking a debate on the Health Service Executive, which was established nearly 18 months ago. It is amazing to think that the chief executive of the HSE recently received a bonus of &euro;34,000. There are over 100 managers earning salaries of over &euro;100,000 each.</P>

	<P>As Government Whip, I cannot accept much of what was said about the debate on the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Bill last week. Any Member who wished to speak on the legislation on Second Stage was allowed to do so, after which we took Committee and Remaining Stages. The Leader twice extended the time for Committee and Remaining Stages and it should be appreciated that she did her utmost to facilitate everyone. I presided as Acting Chairman for part of the debate during which there was an amount of discussion. I compliment the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, and the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, on the detailed explanations they provided for every point that was raised on all Stages. I have yet to see legislation that was not revisited at some stage.</P>
    <P>A Motion for Earlier Signature went to the President. I have no doubt that if the President thought the Bill was in any way unconstitutional, she would not have signed it. Members wanted to make points about particular sections but that happens with every Bill. We should not point the finger at the Leader and the Government who did their utmost to afford Members every opportunity to contribute.</P>
    <P>I accept the point that perhaps the D&aacute;il should not have adjourned until such time as this House had completed its deliberations on the Bill. As Government Whip, however, I am defending the conduct of last Friday&rsquo;s debate.</P>

	<P>The Acting Leader of the Opposition, Senator Bradford, together with Senators Norris, Ryan, White, Coghlan, Maurice Hayes, Bannon, Jim Walsh, John Paul Phelan, Cox, Browne and Moylan all referred to the handling of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Bill, as well as the legislation itself. They also mentioned matters concerning the Office of the Attorney General and the conduct of the debate. I endorse what Senator Moylan said with regard to the conduct of the debate. On the question of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform treating the Seanad as a rubber stamp, the Minister, more than most members of the Government &mdash; in my recollection, more than any &mdash; has come to the Seanad and always engaged fully and comprehensively on every Bill he has introduced. He has dealt in great detail with the questions raised.</P>
    <P>Some of the contributions I listened to on Committee Stage were Second Stage speeches. On Committee Stage, Members are meant to talk to and stick to the amendments, although it is a matter for the Chair to decide. Increasingly, it seems Committee Stage is used by Members who did not take the trouble to speak on Second Stage. I cannot recall some of those who had much to say in this regard contributing to the debate, although I may be wrong on that.</P>
    <P Just="Left">Given all the circumstances, the Leader gave as much time as possible. The Bill had to go for signature because it was urgent. With regard to its constitutionality, the Government does not take constitutional cases. It is for the President to decide whether she wishes to refer the Bill and it is for any aggrieved citizen who or group which thinks the Bill is unconstitutional to take a case. It is for the Government to defend such cases. In the event the Act is struck down, we must come back to the issue, as happened in the case at point, which is why the legislation was necessary.</P>
    <P Just="Left">I understand the Taoiseach will make a statement today in the other House with regard to the way forward on the matter in terms of the all-party committee which I expect will be established. That is the way to deal with the matter. It is important there be a consensus. I agree that there should be a timeframe. I also agree with <Col N="1864"/>Senator Bradford that these matters should be kept under review and that the House should debate them as and when required on the basis of that review.</P>
    <P>I reject any proposition that the Attorney General would do anything to put a child in this society at risk.</P>

   <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>I cannot contemplate that this would be the case. If there were deficiencies, a procedure will be gone through to identify them. That procedure is a reasonable one which will establish what happened in the Attorney General&rsquo;s office. To make a connection between the most recent case and the one of 1994 is wholly invidious. Procedures were put in place within the Attorney General&rsquo;s office on the basis of the earlier case. Those systems have worked and have been updated. They are quite different in nature and scope, and deal with different issues, from those which arose in the most recent case. That is as it should be.</P>
    <P>I take the point made by Senator White and others with regard to the role of the Seanad, an issue which has been debated comprehensively. An all-party group considered the role of the Seanad and produced a report, and the issue is being considered at present. Perhaps we can return to it at a later stage and debate it in some depth. I accept the proposition made by Senator Bradford that the matter should be kept under review. I will try to ensure that all Members are briefed fully on the Government proposals when they come forward in the other House, as I expect they will.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has at all times been available to this House. In trying, difficult and busy circumstances, he came to the House last Wednesday and dealt comprehensively with many of the issues before we received the Bill. That was helpful in the context of our discussion of the Bill.</P>
    <P>On the matter of CIA rendition flights raised by Senators Norris, Ryan, Henry and Dooley, Senator Dooley made the important point that there is no evidence of prisoners being transferred. I accept the Senator&rsquo;s point that if language is used such as &ldquo;spider&rsquo;s web&rdquo; and &ldquo;collusion&rdquo;, it paints the matter in a particular way. I reject a point made by Senator Norris, who said it was clear the aircraft were used illegally to kidnap people. I do not know of any clarity with regard to that matter. In fact, I reject that proposition.</P>

This matter was dealt with by a group within the HSE which acted independently and reached a decision which, I agree with Senator Maurice Hayes, was objective. Obviously, some will not be pleased with the decision but it has been made. The most important aspect of this matter is that it needs to be dealt with quickly and efficiently. We need the new hospital as soon as possible, wherever it is located.</P>
    <P>Senator Browne referred to the HSE. I agree that we should have a general debate on the HSE. However, with regard to the matter of the HSE north-eastern area, if a body overspent by &euro;10 million, I do not understand how it can be represented as a cutback if the body had been asked not to use funding in a certain way. It seems that over the years the health boards which were the most prudent in managing their funds were most heavily penalised while those which acted irresponsibly and overspent got away with it. There is something to be considered in that respect. A matter arises with regard to funding in general, which can be dealt with.</P>
    <P>I commend the makers of the television programme screened last night on the murder of Detective Garda Jerry McCabe and the attempted murder of Garda Ben O&rsquo;Sullivan because it shone a light where it needed to be shone, and did so in a professional, non-speculative way. It produced facts, unlike some of the comments we have heard today, which were in the realm of speculation. Senators Minihan, Henry, Quinn, John Paul Phelan, Fitzgerald and Cummins are correct on this matter. It is astonishing that the so-called authorised person cannot be identified and it was astonishing to hear Mr. Adams and Deputy Ferris speaking out of both sides of their mouths.</P>
    <P>One of the most chilling moments in the programme was when Ann McCabe stood up bravely at the meeting in America, which was attended by the president of Sinn F&eacute;in-IRA, and asked him the question about the unauthorised person. She was virtually shouted down. That was a chilling moment in terms of people&rsquo;s attitudes and their belief in the peace process. We must make sure democratic politics reclaims that space and that we, as was famously stated on one occasion, stand by the republic, and that we are republicans.</P>
    <P Just="Left">Senators Henry and &Oacute; Murch&uacute; referred to the abuse of alcohol, a matter we have debated in the past and should debate in the future. Senator <Col N="1866"/>Henry made hard statements with regard to number of rape cases involving drink. In the context of last week&rsquo;s debate, there is an odd disconnection. It seems to be in order to abuse alcohol while under age but when it comes to sexual activity between young people, the whole country becomes hysterical. I do not understand these two poles within our opinion on the matter. Surely both activities are wrong, and that is the end of it.</P>
    <P>I am not sure of the answer to Senator Henry&rsquo;s question on orthopaedic surgeons but it is a matter we can debate. Other Senators also commented on the health service, including Senator Browne, Senator Glynn, who referred to rheumatology, and Senator Ulick Burke, who referred to the issue of anti-psychotic drugs. The statistic Senator Burke quoted is frightening. It seems to be a matter of regulation within the institutions concerned, although there is an inspection service. The best way to deal with these matters is to include them all in one subject grouping in a debate on the health service. The T&aacute;naiste has always been amenable to coming to the House to examine these matters in detail.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Glynn&rsquo;s comments with regard to the apprehending of those involved in kidnapping people and in credit card scams. However, there is no evidence of any more or less illegal activity in the migrant community in this country than there is in the native population. Both communities have equal numbers of people who are prepared to act illegally.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn spoke about the recent drownings. It was a tragic situation. The words uttered over the weekend about respect for water and water safety are most important. I will make inquiries about the Garda water unit; I am not sure what is the answer to the Senator&rsquo;s question.</P>
    <P Just="Left">Senator Bannon spoke about the essential repairs and disabled people's grants schemes. The local authorities have a role in this area. A hugely increased amount of money was allocated to them recently. They should examine how they disburse those moneys and the speed with which it is done.</P>

	<P>Senator Jim Walsh referred to the tribunals. He is correct that they have been ongoing for a long time but they were established by a resolution of these Houses. He also made a reasonable point with regard to the rules of evidence, which appear to be different from those of the courts, whereby people&rsquo;s good names can be brought down on the basis of hearsay evidence.</P>
    <P>We join Senator John Paul Phelan in extending good wishes to students sitting the leaving certificate examination. Being young, he can remember doing his leaving certificate. Perhaps all of us can remember doing it, irrespective of age.</P>
    <P>Senator Terry referred to the national pay talks. I agree that pensions are an important aspect of the talks and I am glad attention is <Col N="1867"/>being paid to the issue. I am not sure about permitting opt-outs. Experience shows that where they are allowed, people are not inclined to take up pensions. It is most important that they have pensions and, for that reason, the State has an obligation to try to ensure that they do. It is an issue that can be debated in the wider context of, hopefully, the successful outcome of the partnership talks which will no doubt be debated in the House.</P>

   <Title>Health (Repayment Scheme) Bill 2006: Second Stage.</Title>
  <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
   <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>I am very pleased to introduce the Health (Repayment Scheme) Bill 2006. A significant and long-standing feature of our health system of publicly funded long-term care has been the principle that it is fair and reasonable that people should make some contribution to the cost of their long-term care. The Government, however, accepts fully the Supreme Court decision which found as unlawful the retrospective imposition of charges on fully eligible persons for their publicly funded long-term care.</P>
    <P Just="Left">This Bill provides for the legal framework for making repayments to those wrongly charged for inpatient services in publicly funded long-stay residential care. This legislation must be passed at the earliest opportunity by the Oireachtas to ensure that those due a repayment receive it as soon as possible. We are also proposing legislation to regulate patient private property accounts. It is considered efficient to address both issues in the same Bill.</P>
    <P>Charges for publicly funded long-stay residential care have been raised by health boards from people under two sets of regulations, namely, the Institutional Assistance Regulations 1954, as amended in 1965, which applied to all, including <Col N="1868"/>those with full eligibility, and the Health (Charges for ln-Patient Services) Regulations 1976, as amended in 1987, from which medical card holders and those with dependants were exempt.</P>
    <P><?oasys _dc28- ?>The Supreme Court judgment in the Mclnerney<?oasys _dc0- ?> case in 1976 narrowed very significantly the grounds on which a charge could be raised for institutional assistance. It could only be made for shelter and maintenance without any medical or nursing care being provided. A circular from the Department of Health to the health boards in 1976 authorised a practice by which the CEO of a health board could regard patients as not meeting the criteria for full eligibility while being maintained in an institution, since necessary general practitioner and surgical services were being provided for them, and so withdrew their medical card. The withdrawal of full eligibility in this way allowed a charge for inpatient services to be raised.</P>
    <P>The health boards, with the knowledge of the Department of Health and Children, continued to raise charges under both sets of regulations up to 9 December 2004. On the basis of advice from the Office of the Attorney General, the Department instructed the health boards to cease charging all fully eligible persons in receipt of inpatient services in public long-stay institutions and in contract beds in private nursing homes, solely by virtue of a contractual arrangement with a former health board, with effect from 9 December 2004. By way of a goodwill gesture, the Government agreed to have <i>ex gratia</i> payments of up to &euro;2,000 made to those wrongly charged and who were alive on 9 December. 2004. The Health Service Executive made payments in excess of &euro;21 million to approximately 10,800 individuals.</P>
    <P Just="Left">The Health (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2004 was passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas on 17 December 2004. The purpose of the Bill was to provide a statutory basis for the imposition of charges on those to whom inpatient services were being provided in public long-stay institutions. It also contained a retrospective element which provided that charges levied prior to the enactment of the legislation were also lawful. This Bill was referred to the Supreme Court for a decision on its constitutionality. The retrospective element provided that a relevant charge levied under section 53 of the Health Act 1970 for long-stay care prior to the enactment of the legislation was lawful. The Supreme Court decision of 16 February 2005 found this retrospective element of the Bill to be unconstitutional because of the property rights of citizens.</P>
    <P>The charging for long-stay care was put on a statutory footing under the Health (Amendment) Act 2005 and is being implemented by way of the Health (Charges for ln-Patient Services) Regulations 2005. These regulations were signed on 14 June 2005 and reinstated charges for inpatient services and provided for the levying of a charge in respect of the maintenance of persons in receipt of inpatient services. The regulations were <Col N="1869"/>prepared following extensive consultation with the HSE and others.</P>
    <P>The Supreme Court in its decision of 16 February 2005 did not consider the exposure of the State or the magnitude of the sums involved to justify the extinguishment of a property right. A Cabinet sub-committee was subsequently established to consider the implications of the Supreme Court judgment. It was agreed that money which was received by the HSE as a result of the imposition of unlawful charges would be repaid.</P>
    <P>ln light of the amount of repayments which would be due to individuals in certain cases and the overall amount of money involved, it was agreed a repayment scheme to repay fully eligible individuals, who paid inpatient charges while in publicly funded residential care, would be established and placed on a statutory basis. On 11 May 2005, the Government agreed the key elements of the scheme for the repayment of these long-stay charges, one of the key considerations being to ensure that those eligible for repayment received them as quickly as possible with the minimum possible imposition of bureaucracy. It is regretted that, due to the detailed and complex nature of the issues involved and the need to consult with a broad range of agencies and interests, the drafting of this Bill has taken longer than anticipated.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that up to approximately 20,000 people who are still alive and a further 40,000 to 50,000 estates will benefit from repayments under the scheme. The overall costs arising from the long-stay charges repayment scheme have been estimated at approximately &euro;1 billion and an appropriate allocation for 2006 will be made when the legislation is passed by the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The unfortunate reality is that a high proportion of those patients due a repayment have varying degrees of mental impairment, meaning that any scheme would clearly require appropriate safeguards to be put in place to prevent fraud and exploitation of those who receive repayments and are not in a position to manage their own financial affairs. ln these instances the legislation will allow repayments to be placed in patient private property, PPP, accounts. These PPP accounts need to be regulated given the significant amount of money which may be in these accounts as a result of repayments of long-stay charges.</P>
    <P>Patients&rsquo; private property refers to money and personal possessions that patients have with them on admission to care. In the case of long-stay patients, the property also includes regular pension payments. Patient private property accounts are operated by the HSE, and formerly by the health boards, in supporting clients in managing their financial affairs and assisting them in dealing with various aspects of daily living. The patient private property account system manages the private money of long-stay patients, which may <Col N="1870"/>include pension income, maintenance charges, spending money, comfort payments to patients-clients and lodgements to clients accounts.</P>
    <P>This account provides the patients with an ability to exercise their autonomy through such activities as choice of clothing, recreational activities and so on. The account may be administered by an institution as a service to patients who are not in a position to administer the property themselves or have a relative or other person do it on their behalf. The Department of Health and Children accepts the need for clarity and consistency in the area of patient private property accounts and is introducing a statutory framework for these accounts to protect patients interests, particularly in the context of large repayments under the scheme being placed in these accounts.</P>
    <P>Due to the nature, volume and complexity of the repayments involved, it was decided, in line with the Government decision, to appoint an outside company with appropriate knowledge and experience in dealing with mass repayments. Such a company is being engaged by the Health Service Executive to manage the repayment scheme within the agreed Government parameters. This company will also provide an independent assessment of the amount of repayment due to each applicant under the scheme, which will help to reassure the public that the scheme is being operated in the most equitable and effective way possible.</P>
    <P>The HSE has supported the decision to engage an outside company as the nature of the work is not one of its core functions and in any event, it would not be in a position to administer a repayment scheme of this magnitude within existing resources without having to divert staff from their normal function of delivery of health services. The HSE is already committed to providing resources for the implementation of a unitary system for the delivery and management of health services at local, regional and national level following its establishment in January 2005.</P>
    <P>An initial procurement process undertaken by the HSE in the latter half of 2005 resulted in 11 expressions of interest being received for the design and administration of the repayment scheme and these were short-listed to three. Following consideration of all the issues, the initial procurement process was terminated in December 2005, as the HSE considered the tenders were unsuitable for a number of reasons, including value for money.</P>
    <P Just="Left">The HSE decided that in these circumstances it was necessary to put a new procurement process in place and subsequently placed a further advertisement in the <i>Official Journal of the European Union</i> on 2 February 2006. The public tendering process has been implemented and the HSE decided on the appointment of a preferred service provider at a meeting of the board on 1 June 2006. No information can be made public on the preferred service provider until an interval of 14 days has elapsed and there has been no sub<Col N="1871"/>stantial query or objection from any of the unsuccessful bidders, that is, there is no impediment to appointing the preferred bidder.</P>
    <P>Consideration bad been given to the involvement of public sector staff to assist in administering the scheme. However the HSE informed the Department that the time constraints of the procurement process and the potential for significant logistical difficulties and protracted delays, with consequent implications for the commencement of the repayment scheme, did not allow for this option to be implemented. There would also have been a requirement to assign dedicated HSE resources to train and supervise such staff thereby removing them from their normal duties with a subsequent effect on service provision.</P>
    <P>However, in recognition of the importance of progressing repayments, the T&aacute;naiste has asked the HSE to identify all those living patients who were wrongfully charged and to calculate the details of the repayment due to them in as many cases as possible during the period prior to the selection of the outside company. This will ensure that a significant proportion of patients should receive their repayments within a short period of the company becoming operational. The HSE has indicated that the details of 7,600 living patients have been calculated by the appointment date of the outside company. In addition, the HSE will also have completed 3,500 calculations in respect of those who are deceased, making an overall total of 11,100 calculations.</P>
    <P>Extensive discussions have taken place with the Office of the Attorney General, the Department of Finance, the Office of the Revenue Commissioners, the Department of Social and Family Affairs, the probate office of the High Court, the office of the wards of court, the Law Reform Commission, the Office of the Ombudsman, the Courts Service, the Data Protection Commissioner, the Mental Health Commission and the Health Service Executive on the provisions contained in the Bill. The T&aacute;naiste appointed a national oversight committee, representative of service users, including Age Action Ireland and the Irish senior citizens parliament to provide an independent input into the design of the repayments scheme and to monitor the operation of the scheme in order to ensure it is being implemented quickly and in the most equitable and effective way possible. It is chaired by Professor J. Bernard Walsh, consultant physician, St. James Hospital, and reports directly to the T&aacute;naiste.</P>
    <P>The committee usually meets on a monthly basis and has examined such issues as mental capacity, appropriate appeals systems and the protection of patient private property. The committee is also in the process of obtaining independent legal advice to assist it in its task. The chair of the committee has met with the director of reform and development, the Courts Service, to discuss in detail a possible framework for making <Col N="1872"/>repayments to persons with diminished capacity. The committee is fully briefed on all aspects of the scheme and has provided valuable input into the legislative process at each Stage to date. The draft Bill has been agreed with the oversight committee. The first report from the oversight committee to the T&aacute;naiste which confirmed the committee&rsquo;s satisfaction with all aspects of the processes and procedures undertaken by both the HSE and the Department of Health and Children to date on the establishment of the repayment scheme was submitted on 25 April 2006.</P>
    <P>The Health (Repayment Scheme) Bill 2006 provides a clear legal framework for a scheme to repay recoverable health charges for publicly funded long-term residential care and also regulates patients private property accounts. All those fully eligible persons who were wrongly charged and are alive, and the estates of all those fully eligible persons who were wrongly charged and died since 9 December 1998 will have the charges repaid in full.</P>
    <P>The decision to limit repayments to estates of those who died since 9 December 1998 reflects the reference in the Supreme Court judgment to the possible application of the Statute of Limitations, namely, &ldquo;The State has available to it a defence of the Statute of Limitation, that is, a six year limit&rdquo;. The Government has a responsibility, in view of the very substantial sums involved, to have regard to what the Supreme Court said about the Statute of Limitations in order to place appropriate limits on the scale of total repayments which today&rsquo;s taxpayer will have to fund. I am satisfied that the scheme strikes a fair balance in this regard.</P>
    <P>The national repayment scheme will refund all those fully eligible persons who were incorrectly charged for publicly funded long-stay residential care. Medical card holders, and those aged over 70 with effect from July 2001 are considered to be fully eligible for the purpose of this scheme. Given the vulnerability of those in long-stay care, and cognisant of the fact that the former health boards did not make a determination on eligibility status in many instances, based mainly on the incorrect assumption that full eligibility could be removed from long-stay care patients as set out in the Department of Health circular 7/76, it has been agreed that those not having a medical card on admission but who fell within the income-means threshold for a medical card, that is, those in receipt of the non-contributory old age pension, will be regarded as having full eligibility for the purpose of this scheme. This will ensure that the scheme is broadly inclusive and is implemented in a fair and equitable manner.</P>
    <P>All those wrongly charged for in-patient services will be repaid in full. For the purpose of the scheme, community hostels which provide either medical or nursing care on a rostered basis are considered inpatient services, and residents will have any unlawful charges repaid in full.</P>
<Col N="1873"/>
    <P Just="Left">Priority in making repayments will be given to those who are still alive to allow these people to benefit from the repayment, by availing of comforts which they may not otherwise be able to provide. In the case of estates, those who actually paid the charges will not receive any benefit from the repayment, due to their death. Many of these living patients have already been identified as a result of the <i>ex gratia</i> scheme which was announced in December 2004. As mentioned earlier, at the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s request, the HSE has already begun proactively calculating the amount of repayments due to living patients in advance of the selection of an outside company. This will allow prompt repayment to begin in many cases following the appointment of a company.</P>
    <P>The repayments will include both the actual charge paid and an amount to take account of inflation by reference to the consumer price index. The consumer price index is a widely accepted tool for monetary calculation over an extended period of time. Consumer price index data is also available on a regular basis thereby facilitating a match with periods when payments are due. The consumer price index isalso used by the Department of Social and Family Affairs in dealing with underpayments of social welfare entitlements. Under current social welfare legislation, any moneys received by non-contributory pensioners and other social assistance recipients are assessed as capital, subject to the existing disregard of the first &euro;20,000 of all capital owned. Repayments to some living patients, depending on the amount of repayment due, could therefore have significantly reduced their entitlements. In the case of those who were wrongly charged and are still alive, or their spouses, repayments under the statutory scheme proposed in this Bill will be exempt from tax and will not be taken into account in assessing means for health and social welfare benefits.</P>
   <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
    <P>The normal tax and means assessment arrangements will apply to those who benefit from repayments to estates. Currently beneficiaries of the estates of others are, for social welfare purposes, assessed with the value of inheritance received from the estates, regardless of the original source of any of the capital or property inherited. It is consistent with existing provisions to treat repayments in the hands of beneficiaries of estates as inheritances and assessable in the normal way.</P>
    <P>The procedure for obtaining a grant of probate in the case of an estate of a deceased person can be arduous, time consuming and expensive with the process taking in many instances up to 18 months to complete. For the purpose of the repayment scheme, a streamlined procedure is being developed in conjunction with the probate office of the High Court for a person applying for repayment on behalf of the estate of a deceased person. This procedure will allow an individual to obtain the documentation necessary to receive repayment in a timely, cost-effective and efficient <Col N="1874"/>manner. This process is solely for the purpose of receiving repayment under this scheme. Where there are other assets of the estate involved or where disputes arise among potential recipients, the normal procedures and requirements for obtaining a grant of probate will continue to apply.</P>
    <P>The scheme will include an independent, transparent and user-friendly appeals process which will be independent of the HSE and the company engaged to administer the scheme. The Minister will appoint suitably-qualified independent appeals officers to consider appeals and the appeals process will allow both written and oral submissions to support an appeal. Applicants to the scheme will be advised of the outcome of their application as soon as possible and will be provided with details of their entitlement to appeal, if their application has been rejected or if they dispute the amount of the repayment. Applicants will also be informed of their right to bring a complaint to the Office of the Ombudsman. The legislation allows for regular reports on the operation of the appeals process, which will be laid before the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The scheme will include a provision to allow those eligible for a repayment to waive their right to all or part of the repayment, and have the money donated to fund one-off service improvements for older persons and persons with disabilities. Many people may feel that their mother or father was well cared for, and as a result might wish to donate their payment to help those less fortunate. The fund will be specifically established for this purpose to ensure any money donated will be expended for the purpose for which it was intended. This fund will be audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General and the HSE will submit an annual report to the T&aacute;naiste on the operation of the fund. The individual, when making a donation to the fund, can specify how he or she would like the money to be applied within the health services. The HSE will have regard to the wishes of the person making the donation, but due to practical and administrative difficulties, the HSE cannot provide an assurance that the money will be used for the specific institution requested. However, it can provide an assurance that the money will only be used for service improvements in the area of older people or the disability sector.</P>
    <P>The HSE, in association with the scheme administrator, will operate a helpline and advice centre to deal with queries and correspondence from patients, relatives, estates, members of the public and so on. Advertisements highlighting the establishment of the scheme and where to apply or seek advice will also be placed in the media and arrangements will be made to ensure that all information relating to the scheme will be available in the Irish language.</P>
    <P>An area of particular concern in the drafting of this legislation and in the administration of this repayment scheme relates to those patients who <Col N="1875"/>may have mental capacity issues. The unfortunate reality is that a high proportion of patients in long-stay care have varying degrees of deteriorating mental impairment and special arrangements are required for such persons given that they will be in receipt, in certain cases, of significant amounts of money but may not have the capacity to manage their financial affairs. As part of the legislation, a statutory framework is being put in place to protect patient interests, particularly regarding the receipt of substantial repayments. Where doubt may exist about the capacity of an individual, a certificate issued by a registered medical practitioner who has examined the relevant person in the past six months prior to the application, will be required to be submitted with the application form.</P>
    <P>In developing the framework for protecting vulnerable patients, consideration was given to the work of the Law Reform Commission, which is currently preparing a comprehensive report on vulnerable adults and the law, which it expects to publish later this year. The provisions were also discussed with the Courts Service and the oversight committee devoted extensive time and input to the drafting of these provisions. Where a doubt exists as to the capacity of an individual, repayments can only be made into that individual patient&rsquo;s private property account, pending a decision on the capacity of that individual. Clearly, this would only apply where the patient is not already a ward of court, or has no other legal representative.</P>
    <P>Moneys lodged to these accounts will be used specifically for the benefit of the individual patient. In order to protect these moneys, in the case of persons with mental capacity issues, no moneys in excess of &euro;5,000 per year can be used for the benefit of the patient without the payment being approved by the Circuit Court. Day-to-day expenditure for personal purposes can be made without the necessity of court application but the expenditure of large sums of money will be regulated. Moneys may also be invested by the HSE, on behalf of the patient, in financial institutions authorised by the Financial Regulator.</P>
    <P>The legislation also provides for the appointment of an independent person to be appointed by and to report to the Minister for Health and Children on patient private property accounts to ensure that these accounts are administered in an appropriate fashion and that any moneys expended are for the benefit of the patient. Patient private property accounts will be administered in line with national guidelines, which are to be developed by the HSE, to ensure consistency in their application throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Section 3 of the Bill allows the Health Service Executive to enter into an arrangement with persons to provide services on their behalf, which will enable the HSE to engage an external company to administer the repayment scheme within the agreed parameters. The Government decision <Col N="1876"/>indicated that an outside company with experience in dealing with mass claims would be engaged to manage the scheme. I have already referred to the tendering process currently being undertaken by the HSE in this regard. As I have outlined, the HSE has decided on the appointment of a preferred service provider and it is anticipated that the company will begin work on the scheme before the end of June. This company will also provide an independent aspect to the validation of claims and to the repayment scheme generally.</P>
    <P>Section 4 of the Bill outlines the type of forms and other documents which the scheme administrator may require for the purposes of the Act. Section 5 outlines the application process for a repayment using the forms mentioned in section 4. It also outlines the grounds for refusing an application and the closing date for receipt of applications. The legislation allows for applications to be accepted until 1 January 2008. This date can be extended by regulation if required.</P>
    <P>Section 6 sets out the process for determining if an applicant is entitled to a repayment and the amount due. In the event of there being insufficient information available on the amount due for repayment, the scheme administrator can make a determination on repayment, based on a formula linked to the patient&rsquo;s non-contributory old age pension for the period in which the patient was in care. However, a separate lower or higher rate would be fixed in cases where there was evidence that a reduced or increased charge was paid. It has been suggested that a deadline of 28 days be allowed for the determination of eligibility under the scheme, and consideration was given to the inclusion of a deadline in the legislation but was not included for practical reasons. In terms of eligibility under the scheme, many patients did not have a medical card on admission to long-stay care but fell within the income means threshold for a medical card and to ensure equity will be regarded as having full eligibility under the scheme. In certain instances determination of eligibility may not be straightforward.</P>
    <P>Section 7 allows for applications from living persons to be prioritised over those from estates of deceased persons. This is designed to allow patients to benefit from repayments while still alive.</P>
    <P>Section 8 is designed to make the repayments scheme more beneficial to the applicant than litigation, and relates to other legislation on which the proposed legislation impinges. This section allows for repayments to a living person or his or her spouse to be disregarded for income tax purposes. It was suggested that a deadline of 28 days should be included for making repayments following receipt of an application. A deadline was not included with regard to making repayments, as some patients may have been in a number of institutions over an extended period <Col N="1877"/>of time, and in these circumstances a 28-day deadline may not be practical.</P>
    <P Just="Left">Applicants will also be given the opportunity to appeal the determination of an application before a recoverable health charge is repaid. Applications will be processed as quickly as possible after they are received and the uppermost consideration will be to ensure that relevant persons receive the full amount of repayment due to them. The section also allows for repayments under the statutory scheme to living persons or their spouses to be disregarded in means assessments for health or social welfare benefits. It also allows for any tax relief claimed for medical expenses in respect of payments, or for any probate tax liability that may arise to be disregarded. Repayments under the scheme will not be considered when assessing entitlements to subvention. The section allows for a streamlined process for the normal probate requirements for estates, for the purpose of facilitating repayments through the statutory scheme. It also provides that a final repayment will be net of any <i>ex gratia </i>payment made or any outstanding charges due for long-stay care arising from the imposition of the charges for inpatient services in 2005.</P>
    <P>Currently, beneficiaries of the estates of others are, for social welfare purposes, assessed with the value of inheritance received from the estate regardless of the original source of any of the capital or property inherited. The scheme will be consistent with existing provisions, to the effect that repayments to beneficiaries of estates, as inheritance, will be assessable in the normal way.</P>
    <P>Section 9 regulates patient private property or PPP accounts. These accounts consist of money and personal property managed on behalf of the patient by the HSE. Where there are no legally appointed representatives for a patient with capacity issues, the repayment due will only be paid into a PPP account, which will be administered on the patient&rsquo;s behalf by the HSE. This is to protect patients who may be in receipt of large sums of money and who are not in a position to manage their own financial affairs. In other cases, the money may be lodged with a financial institution or may, at the patient&rsquo;s request, be lodged to a PPP account.</P>
    <P>This section allows the Minister to appoint a person to oversee the administration of PPP accounts and to report to the Minister on these matters. It allows the HSE to invest money in PPP accounts on behalf of patients. It also allows the HSE to use money in these accounts for the benefit of the patient and provides for the HSE to make an application to the Circuit Court to use sums in excess of &euro;5,000 per patient in any calendar year for such purposes.</P>
    <P>Section 10 provides that persons who accept repayments under the scheme waive the right to sue for recovery of that charge. Persons who have received a court settlement in respect of a repayment are disallowed from making an application to the scheme. It allows the HSE to make a lodg<Col N="1878"/>ement to court of the amount rejected, or any other amount that the HSE deems appropriate, if an applicant decides to reject repayment under the scheme and pursue action through the courts.</P>
    <P>Section 11 allows for the HSE to establish a donation fund to enable those due repayments under the scheme to donate all or part of the repayment, and such donations will be used specifically for improvements in public health services for elderly persons and persons with disabilities, the costs of which are non-recurring.</P>
    <P>Any such donations will be exempt from capital acquisition tax or from any probate tax liability. The HSE has provided initial broad indications of how it proposes to administer this fund. For example, any funding allocation by the HSE will, in so far as is possible, seek to assign funds in accordance with the wishes of the applicant subject to legal and practical constraints. The fund will only be used to provide for improvements which would not otherwise have been met by an allocation from the Minister for Finance or other Minister. It is the intention to specify this on the application form.</P>
    <P>Section 12 will facilitate the operation of the scheme and allows the HSE, or any person administering the scheme on behalf of the HSE, to have access to the records required to enable it to process claims. It protects those to whom the records relate by providing for the imposition of penalties on those who breach confidentiality around any aspect of the scheme. It prohibits the disclosure of information except for the performance of the functions of the relevant person under the Act. It also compels publicly funded bodies to co-operate with the scheme through the provision of relevant records. The Revenue Commissioners may request the scheme administrator to provide them with details of repayments made.</P>
    <P>Section 13 provides for the establishment of a special account to facilitate repayments being made under the Act and to ensure transparency regarding the repayments or any costs associated with implementing the scheme. The account shall only be used for this purpose and funds will be issued by the direction of the Minister for Finance. All repayments will be paid out of this account, which will be subject to audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>
    <P>Section 14 provides for governance arrangements for the repayment scheme. It allows for reports to be submitted to the Minister by the HSE, on request or at regular intervals, on the operation of the scheme and the operation of PPP accounts, and allows the Minister to lay such reports before each House of the Oireachtas. It also requires the chief executive officer of the HSE or a representative of the scheme administrator to give evidence on the scheme before any Oireachtas committees. It also details the information to be kept in respect of applications for repayment.</P>
    <P>Section 15 provides that the scheme administrator will inform the applicant of the outcome of <Col N="1879"/>the application as soon as possible and will give applicants notice of the reason for the decision and their right to appeal. The notice will also include a summary calculation of the total repayment due to an individual.</P>
    <P>Section 16 provides for an independent and transparent appeals process by allowing the Minister to appoint suitably qualified persons to determine appeals. It also outlines the grounds on which a person may appeal. The Minister may request reports on the operation of the appeals process and copies of these reports shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas. The process also allows for appeals to the High Court on a point of law. Applicants will also be informed of their right to bring a complaint to the Office of the Ombudsman.</P>
    <P>Section 17 allows for the recovery of any overpayments and payments fraudulently obtained under the scheme. Section 18 provides that the accounts of the scheme administrator in so far as they relate to the scheme may be audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General. The accounts of the special fund established to make the repayments, patient private property accounts, and the fund established to receive donated payments can also be audited and reports shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Section 19 outlines the penalties and offences which can be imposed on persons who make fraudulent applications or on persons who disclose confidential information. Section 20 allows for regulations for the purpose of administration of the scheme and the administration of patient private property accounts. Section 21 allows for regulation to remove any impediment or difficulties which may emerge, within a year of commencement of the Act, which may prevent or delay any provisions of the Act from becoming functional.</P>
    <P>I now wish to outline some of the major developments the Government is pursuing to improve services for older people. It has been the policy of successive Governments to endeavour to help older people maintain themselves in the community while at the same time providing for residential care which is not prohibitively expensive. The policy of the Government on the development and delivery of services for older people is to maintain them in dignity and independence at home for as long as possible in accordance with their wishes.</P>
    <P Just="Left">The last 12 months have seen an increased focus on services, particularly regarding long-term care, whether residential or community based. Additional funding for services for older people and palliative care of &euro;150 million has been allocated in the last budget. A total of 1,366 home care packages is currently in place, 249 of which have commenced since January, 2006. The Health (Nursing Homes) Amendment Bill was also recently published, which will ensure that the existing subvention scheme for private nursing <Col N="1880"/>home care is grounded in primary legislation and will help the HSE to implement the scheme on a standardised basis across the country. This Bill is currently on Second Stage in the D&aacute;il.</P>
    <P>The general scheme of the Health Information and Quality Authority Bill will also be published within the next few weeks as part of a public consultation process. The draft heads provide for the establishment of the Health Information Quality Authority, HIQA, the establishment within the authority of the office of the chief inspector of social services and the establishment of a registration system for residential services for children in need of care, for persons with disabilities and for older people. The establishment of HIQA and the office of the chief inspector of social services demonstrates the Government&rsquo;s commitment to the health service reform programme. A working group has been established to develop standards for residential care for older people, which aims to have draft standards available in July.</P>
    <P Just="Left">The T&aacute;naiste, together with the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, established last year an interdepartmental group to examine the whole area of long term care for older people. The group included senior officials from the Departments of the Taoiseach, Health and Children, Social and Family Affairs and Finance. The group was chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach. The group had a number of reports available to it including the Mercer report on the future financing of long-term care in Ireland which was commissioned by the Department of Social and Family Affairs and was published in 2002. Having examined the range of benefits and services currently in place and also examining various issues regarding the financing of long-term care in residential and community settings, the group has now reported to the Government, which is currently considering the report.</P>
    <P>The issue of funding long-term care needs for older people, both residential and community-based, is among the most difficult and complex areas in the health sector. The demographic challenges facing all countries must be tackled and sustainable programmes put in place. While many different approaches are taken by governments in addressing these challenges, no easy or simple answers to these matters exist. The pace of change from a demographic, social and clinical aspect, requires of society generally and the Government to respond in a coherent way so that appropriate funding and service delivery programmes can be implemented.</P>
    <P>The Bill will provide an appropriate mechanism to allow for repayments in an uncomplicated manner to those wrongfully charged for publicly funded long-term care. The Bill&rsquo;s provisions will significantly reduce bureaucratic imposition on patients. The oversight committee has made valuable inputs to the scheme and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future to ensure the scheme is implemented quickly and in the most equitable and effective way possible. The committee will <Col N="1881"/>submit reports at regular intervals to the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children on the scheme&rsquo;s operation. I am confident the safeguards put in place with the regulation of the patient private property accounts will prevent the exploitation of those who receive repayments and are not in a position to manage their affairs. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

   <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I will not go into the background of the disgraceful events surrounding the Bill. It is amazing that a year and seven months later we have returned to the matter. There is, however, still no idea of when exactly these payments will be made to those affected. Many will have passed on in the intervening period. The Fine Gael Party welcomes the Bill but has reservations about its implementation. The Government&rsquo;s tardiness is shocking particularly when one considers the Supreme Court&rsquo;s ruling on the Health (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2004. It read:</P>
    <P LI="1">The Bill will affect very many people who are old, or poor or disabled, mentally or physically, or in many cases all of these. As already stated, persons so situated will almost certainly have had little or no capacity to understand their rights under the legislation or to protest at the unlawfulness of the charges.</P>
    <P FLI="0">It is shocking that a year and seven months after that, the Health (Repayment Scheme) Bill 2006 is just being introduced but the Minister of State can give no indication as to when those affected will get the money into their hands. What do these lovely phrases, such as &ldquo;shortly&rdquo;, &ldquo;imminently&rdquo; and &ldquo;in the near future&rdquo;, actually mean? At a health committee meeting a suggestion for an interim payment was made. All the patients affected were wrongfully charged and they are owed these moneys. Many of them would have used it to go Lourdes or Medjugorje for a last trip before they passed on. Many cannot now do that and will unfortunately be dead before the payments are made available.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State did not refer to the time bomb of those who were unable to secure a long-term public nursing bed and, as a result, went into private nursing homes. I understand several court cases are pending in this regard. If the courts rule in favour of the people affected, this issue will be more explosive and affect far more people. Ultimately the taxpayer will end up paying for the Government&rsquo;s incompetence. Will the Minister of State clarify the status of those who are querying whether they should have had to pay private nursing home charges when public beds were not provided?</P>
    <P>The Government has a bad record in schemes similar to the repayment one. Its response to the matter was lethargic. It was warned in September 2005 of the issue but only rushed through flawed legislation against which the Supreme Court ruled in December. Shortly after this, the fiasco of the PPARS emerged which involved &euro;150 mil<Col N="1882"/>lion of taxpayers&rsquo; money being squandered on a computer system that did not work. Has the Government learned lessons from this, particularly concerning the administration and distribution of the refund scheme? How can it be ensured that what happened with PPARS will not happen with the nursing home refunds system?</P>
    <P>Recently, there was the example of the Health Service Executive using some creative accountancy when it threw &euro;50 million from capital funding into current expenditure. It did not inspire confidence. The final example is the disastrous deal negotiated by the former Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Woods, for the residential institutions redress scheme. Initially it was to cost the taxpayer &euro;200 million and the religious orders &euro;100 million. It will now cost the taxpayer &euro;1.1 billion. A series of mistakes has been made. I appreciate everyone can make a mistake. If the Fine Gael Party is in government in a year&rsquo;s time, I accept it will make mistakes. The challenge, however, is to recognise when a mistake is made and to learn from it. I am not convinced the Government has that capability. Will the Minister of State reassure this side of the House that it has learned from past mistakes in schemes?</P>
    <P>The explanatory memorandum was too short, particularly in comparison with the speech of the Minister of State. A more detailed memorandum would have assisted Members to a better understanding the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated the tendering for the contract for the design of the repayment scheme system was advertised. I have received information that there were serious difficulties with the process. I have made a freedom of information request on the process but I have to see whether it will reveal much. The Health Service Executive advertised in the latter half of 2005 with 11 expressions of interest received for the design and administration of the repayment scheme. This was short-listed to three. Following consideration of all the issues the initial procurement process was terminated in December 2005 as the executive considered the tenders unsuitable for several reasons, including value for money.</P>
    <P>It was re-advertised and today the Minister of State informed the House that on 1 June a contract was awarded to a particular company. Will that company come in cheaper than the three short-listed companies? If it does not, a serious question hangs over the process. This is not just a concern on this side of the House. Deputy Glennon has put down a parliamentary question on the matter. There is much unease about why the procurement process was advertised, applications received, a shortlist of three created but then scrapped. I have made a freedom of information request but I am not confident about its results as FOI does not work well in the health area. There is an innuendo that one company, which the Health Service Executive preferred, did not apply initially. By cancelling the initial <Col N="1883"/>process, it may have suited that company. I will be pursuing this matter.</P>
    <P>Could the tender process be open to a court challenge? Will there be a repeat of the events surrounding the awarding of the second mobile telephone licence to Esat? Those unsuccessful licence bidders challenged the basis of the award in court. A similar course of action in the repayment scheme would delay its administration and expose the taxpayer to further fallout.</P>
    <P>I was amazed to hear the Minister of State say in the opening paragraph of his speech &ldquo;This legislation must be passed at the earliest opportunity by the Oireachtas to ensure that those due a repayment receive it as soon as possible.&rdquo; It is amazing that 19 months later we are debating the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State explained some of the preparatory working under way at present, even in advance of the firm getting the contract. Can he ensure that people who have applied for a refund would receive a simple letter acknowledging receipt of their claim and explaining the process to date? That should not be too difficult to organise. I receive many telephone calls, as I am sure does everyone in the House, from people who have applied for the funding who are not too sure where exactly they stand. At this stage I ask the Minister of State to ensure that those who have applied would get a letter updating them on the following: the appointment of a firm from 1 June; the preparatory work done by the Department; and the fact that priority will be given to those still living. Even that information would be of considerable benefit to those awaiting funding under the scheme.</P>
    <P>It is shocking to think that people in their twilight years are being treated in this way by the Government. If this was any other scheme one would state that it was fair enough because people have time on their hands, but the people concerned are those in their twilight years, who do not have much time left and many will have passed away by the time they are awarded final compensation.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister of State to explain why it has taken over a year to prepare this legislation, particularly in light of the fact that in December 2004 the Government was capable of bringing in legislation overnight. As it happens, that legislation was flawed. The Government was capable of rushing that legislation through, yet it has taken it over a year to bring forward this legislation.</P>
    <P>It took the HSE five months to advertise for the first tender for the provision of these services. Fine Gael has questioned why the HSE is unable to do so. Although the Minister of State skirted over that issue in his speech, it shows that the Government does not have confidence in the HSE administering the scheme. The HSE should be well able to perform this function. In his speech the Minister of State admitted the HSE <Col N="1884"/>has already managed <i>ex gratia</i> payments of over &euro;20 million. Therefore, the Government is contradicting itself again, as usual. The Minister of State might refer to this in his reply.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State spoke of this being a simple scheme and being user-friendly. I hope it will be but we must ensure that elderly people who apply&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>To what contradiction is Senator Browne referring?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Browne without interruption.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The contradiction is that while the Government is not allowing the HSE to administer the scheme, to date the HSE has administered &euro;20 million in <i>ex gratia</i> payments to 10,000 people. I am normally used to Senator Minihan heckling me.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnMinihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Minihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am waiting. I have been listening.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Another contradiction is that sections 5(3)(<i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>) provide that applications made after 1 January 2008, or such later date as the Minister may prescribe, will not be considered. That is fair enough and I understand its logic, but the Bill does not contain a specific date putting pressure on the HSE or the Department of Health and Children to pay up. While the Government is telling people they cannot apply after a certain date, it is not giving them any indication of when they can expect a repayment and that should be rectified in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Can the Minister of State give any indication of exactly how many people are involved in the scheme? We have heard numbers, ranging from 60,000 to 80,000. Can he give us an accurate figure at this stage? He mentioned social welfare and the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997. I am a little confused by the Bill because while the Minister of State is stating that people who get the payments will not be liable for tax, the information is being passed on to the tax authorities. Why is that being done?</P>
    <P>I have made my party&rsquo;s case. I welcome the Bill but I am concerned about the Government&rsquo;s ability to ensure that the payments are managed correctly. I wonder if this will be another example of what occurred with the redress board where the bill will increase five-fold during the administration of the scheme.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn"><NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">F&aacute;iltim an Aire St&aacute;it go dt&iacute; an Teach. I welcome this Bill which is putting right something that should not have happened in the first place. While it may have taken some time, in this case we should not sacrifice accuracy for speed. It is important that we get it right.</P>
    <P>I welcome the <i>ex gratia</i> payments made, which are a gesture of goodwill on the part of the <Col N="1885"/>Government to address the matter. Listening to Senator Browne, one would swear on a mass book that his party had never been in Government. Convenient amnesia is a wonderful state of mind and a marvellous defence mechanism, which I suppose we all should employ from time to time.</P>
    <P>Getting back to the reality of the matter, I welcome the Bill. I hope that, with the co-operation of all concerned and with mature debate in this House, we will be able to tease out what various contributors view as not in the best interests of those concerned and find a consensus on how to address the issue.</P>
    <P>I preface my remarks with the following. We are speaking in the main about people who have spent quite a long time in institutions. As one who in a former occupation would have had quite a good deal of contact with such people, nothing I have heard and experienced over quite a long number of years has changed my view. Although I recognise it is not the purpose of the Bill, I would dearly like to see something done about regular visits to patients in long-stay institutions. I recall that in my time working in long-stay wards, months and years would pass in which many of those patients never received a visitor. The rest of what I have stated about certain relatives is on public record.</P>
    <P>I strongly applaud those who regularly visited their relatives in an institution. In many cases, but for the activities of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, patients would never see a face other than those of the nursing, ward and catering staff, or indeed their fellow residents. I put on record my sincere appreciation of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul whose members unselfishly gave of their time to visit such people.</P>
    <P>The Health (Repayment Scheme) Bill will provide for the repayment of public nursing home charges to all those who were wrongly charged and are alive, and the estates of all those who were wrongly charged and died since 9 December 1998.</P>
    <P>This scheme will be simple to use and has been designed following consultation with and input from the oversight committee, which played a pivotal role in the compilation of this Bill and the process of ensuring that those repayments are made with the optimum effectiveness and efficiency.</P>
    <P>The general scheme of the Health Information and Quality Authority Bill, which will be published in a few weeks&rsquo; time, will also be part of a public consultation process. That Bill will provide for the establishment within the Health Information and Quality Authority of the office of the chief inspector of social services and a registration system for residential services for children in need of care, for persons with disabilities and for older people.</P>
    <P>As I may have mentioned previously in other contributions, we are speaking of people in public institutions who were charged and whose charges <Col N="1886"/>were found to be illegal. We must put up our hands and say <i>nostra culpa</i>, and this Bill is all about addressing that irregularity.</P>
    <P>However, there were other people who, because they could not find a bed in a public institution, had to go to a private institution. I have met quite a number of people in such circumstances who have come to my office stating that they had to use scarce resources. In one case, the total gratuity an individual received from a local firm was spent on paying for a private nursing home for his late wife because a place was not available in a public nursing home. A test case has been taken, or is due to be taken, in this regard and as the matter is <i>sub judice</i> I do not wish to muddy the waters. This matter must be addressed.</P>
    <P>The establishment of the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, and the office of the chief inspector of social services demonstrate the Government&rsquo;s commitment to quality patient care as a key driver of the health reform programme. Part of the work of the chief social services inspector will be to inspect for the first time, public nursing homes as well as private nursing homes, which are currently inspected by the HSE. Clear and uniform standards will be set down for all nursing homes and inspections will be based on compliance with these standards.</P>
    <P>Many of our nursing homes, both private and public, provide an extremely high standard of care. However, I regret that in some cases making money has been the main objective. I do not have to remind Members what I am talking about. In some instances, standards were found to be at an outrageously low level. The local councillor or health board member provided a great service in those institutions. I previously made this point to the T&aacute;naiste. It was a great opportunity for them to visit people known to them who were in nursing homes or hospitals and it was a familiar and friendly face for the patients concerned. Perhaps the Minister of State could re-examine this matter.</P>
    <P>The repayments will include both the actual charge paid and an amount to take account of inflation. That is only correct. Otherwise it would be a case of giving with one hand and taking back with the other. All repayments to living persons will be exempt from income tax and repayments will not be taken into account in assessing means for health and social welfare benefits. This is to be welcomed. The normal tax and means assessment arrangements will apply to those who benefit from repayments to estates.</P>
    <P>The scheme includes a provision to allow those eligible for a repayment to waive their right to a repayment and have the money assigned to fund one-off service improvements for older persons and persons with a disability. That might appear to be a nonsensical provision but a number of people have approached me and stated they do not intend to claim any money back. I admit there <Col N="1887"/>are not many people in this category but they do exist.</P>
    <P Just="Left">The application process will be as simple and user-friendly as possible while also providing appropriate safeguards against fraud and preventing the exploitation of those not in a position to manage the repayments which they will receive. The scheme has been designed and will be managed with the aim of ensuring that those who are eligible for repayments receive them as soon as possible. Priority will be given to those who are still alive, and the HSE has begun proactively identifying and drawing up details of repayments due to living persons to enable prompt repayments to be made.</P>
    <P>Even when the deduction scheme obtained in long-stay institutions, the portion of the pension or social welfare benefit that was retained was to provide for extra comforts for the patient or resident. The utmost speed should apply in the making of payments so as to ensure the maximum number of living persons are compensated. The application process for estates has been streamlined with the assistance of the probate office. We should applaud the probate office for stepping into the breach as it will help to ensure repayments are made with the utmost speed.</P>
    <P>Senator Browne inquired about the number of people involved. It is estimated that approximately 20,000 people who are still alive, and a further 40,000 to 50,000 estates of those who have passed on to their eternal reward, will benefit. The scheme will cost approximately &euro;1 billion and an appropriate allocation for 2006 will be made when the legislation is passed by the Houses of the Oireachtas. There will be an independent and transparent appeals process. I do not know how the appeals process will deal with those people who had to send their relatives to a private nursing institution because they could not get a public bed but I hope a sympathetic view will be taken of the matter.</P>
    <P>The Minister may appoint an independent overseer for the administration of the accounts of people who are not in a position to administer them. The governance of the scheme will allow the Minister to receive reports on the operation of the scheme, the appeals process and the fund established to receive donations. These reports shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas. Legislation also provides that all accounts and funds related to the scheme may be audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General. The system cannot be more transparent than that.</P>
    <P>The oversight committee appointed by the T&aacute;naiste to provide an independent input into the design and monitoring of the scheme has been fully briefed on all aspects of the scheme and has provided valuable input into the legislation to date. The committee has approved the contents of the Bill. The establishment of the Health Information and Quality Authority on a statutory basis was one of the recommendations of the health <Col N="1888"/>service reform programme announced in June 2004. It was also proposed in the health strategy &mdash; Quality and Fairness: A Health System for You. That is another promise on which the Government has delivered.</P>
    <P>The general scheme provides for the establishment of the office of the chief inspector of social services as a statutory office within the HIQA. This meets the commitments made in An Agreed Programme for Government in 2002, the health strategy and Sustaining Progress to establish the social services inspectorate on a statutory basis. The office will also monitor standards, except those set in regard to the personal social services which will be monitored or inspected by the Chief Inspector of Social Services. The office is being given the powers to investigate, at the request of the Minister or the executive, the safety, quality and standards of any service, except those registered and inspected by the Chief Inspector of Social Services and the Mental Health Commission, provided by or on behalf of the executive and to make any recommendations it deems necessary.</P>
    <P>The office will also have the role of accrediting services and will be able to provide an accreditation service for the private sector. The HIQA will also advise the Minister and the Health Service Executive on the effectiveness of health technology. In addition, the HIQA will have a role in setting standards in regard to information and data on services provided by the Health Service Executive and on its behalf, and the health and welfare of the population, as well as identifying deficiencies in such information.</P>
    <P>The chief inspector will continue the social services inspectorate&rsquo;s work of inspecting the child welfare and protection services. It will also be assigned responsibility for the inspection of residential services for persons with a disability and for residential services for older people, including private nursing homes.</P>
    <P>I accept that 19 months have passed but it is never too late to do the right thing. This matter has dragged on for 30 years. Various arguments have been made about what was known but as far as I am concerned it was one of the best kept secrets in the public service. In any event, the legislation is before us and we must deal with it. We should try to deal with it as quickly as possible so that the people who were wrongly charged in our institutions &mdash; the people who built this State, namely, the elderly &mdash; receive the appropriate refunds as soon as possible.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister of State to the House. It must be somewhat embarrassing for the Government that, for the second successive <Col N="1889"/>week, this House is considering a Bill the purpose of which is to undo a mistake which could have been avoided in the first place. While I have no particular wish to create more embarrassment for the Government, I would like to focus my contribution on the somewhat creaky nature of the administrative machine that seems to operate in this country.</P>
    <P Just="Left">This Bill became a necessity because of a serious and long-standing administrative failure, a failure that went on for a much longer period than that covered in the redress scheme created under the Bill. Since the 1970s, the twilight years of many old people were made more difficult than they needed to have been because they did not get their due entitlements under legislation. Very many of these people are long since dead and there is nothing we can do to redress the wrong that was done to them.</P>
    <P>I wish to be precise about the nature of this wrong. I would never argue that older people in State care should not contribute to some extent to the costs of their maintenance if they are able to do so. This is not the issue. However, what was wrong in this case was that money was taken from people illegally. Not to put too fine a point on it, this money was stolen from them. Even worse, the entity which stole from them was the State itself, the very body that should have been standing up for them and defending their rights.</P>
    <P>I am profoundly worried by this blatant instance of the State breaking its own laws because I think it has the direst implications for the health of our democracy. Above all else, a democracy essentially concerns rule by law, a rule which should apply to the State as well as the citizen. The principle that the law applies to everyone is the strongest defence of all the freedoms we hold dear.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting that any member of the Government or these Houses wishes to set aside the law or act contrary to it but the fact remains that in this case all the powers of the State were harnessed over a period of many years to break the law. What made it even worse was that the people who suffered under this illegal activity were among the weakest and most vulnerable in our society. We know about this so I am repeating what has been said before.</P>
    <P>We should be so concerned about this lapse that we should take very good care that it never happens again. Yet, I see no evidence of any action that will ensure this outcome. The Bill before us seeks to make redress to some of those who were offended against but it does nothing to reduce the possibility of a similar mistake happening again. I would like to hear the Minister of State&rsquo;s views but it appears that this is the case.</P>
    <P>This was basically an administrative error and much of it was compounded over the years by political neglect from successive Ministers. We have a mechanism in place that is meant to address such errors and prevent their recurrence, namely, the Office of the Ombudsman. To their <Col N="1890"/>eternal credit, this particular problem was identified by more than one Ombudsman and signalled to the political establishment and to the public in the appropriate way. Yet, despite all this signalling, no notice was taken of it by anybody and so, year after year, the State went on blithely breaking its own law.</P>
    <P>The fact that this happened and was allowed to happen surely reveals a fundamental defect in our system. We have burdened the Ombudsman with the responsibility for identifying administrative defects but, incredibly, we have burdened nobody with the responsibility for seeing that such defects are speedily addressed once they have been identified. I would like to hear the Minister of State&rsquo;s views on this matter. We can and, hopefully, will pass this Bill but we cannot buy our way out of this problem so easily. Until we address the issue directly, we are just asking for the situation to happen again and again.</P>
    <P>I look forward to hearing the Minister&rsquo;s response and will listen intently to it. The Bill must and, I hope, will be passed but I would like to find out how we can take steps to ensure such a scenario never happens again.</P>

	<P>I thank Senator Quinn for allowing me to share time with him. I welcome the Minister of State to the House and welcome this legislation. I was surprised that the Minister of State&rsquo;s speech contained no expression of regret because, as Senator Quinn noted, this was an illegal action on the part of the State that, in his words, amounted to theft by the State from the most vulnerable. Despite the fact that most of provisions in the Bill are purely technical, there was room in it for an expression of regret.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State also detailed arrangements for the appointment of an outside company to administer a repayment scheme. I understand that there are possible legal reasons why information on the company appointed on 1 June cannot be made public until an interval of 14 days has elapsed, presumably to allow complaints and for the Minister of State to tell the House today the name of the company. I expect that it will be a reputable company.</P>
    <P>I am not entirely sure if the decision to appoint an outside company is correct because other Departments have been successfully involved in the repayment of other moneys. I am aware that the amount of money in question is approximately &euro;1 billion, which is a very significant amount, and that there may be up to 60,000 or 70,000 recipients, both living and deceased. However, in light of the fact that there are over 100 administrators in the health services receiving salaries of over &euro;100,000 and that many of them are duplicating work, it does not seem beyond the bounds of possibility to properly employ them in administering this scheme. I do not think there is very much else for these people, or at least, those individuals who are duplicating work, to do.</P>
<Col N="1891"/>
    <P>The Minister of State also referred to a consultation process and listed the various people, including the Ombudsman, with which he, very appropriately, has consulted. The Ombudsman has, obviously, been very unhappy with the situation for a considerable period of time. I also noted that Age Concern is not among the non-governmental organisations consulted. Would the Minister of State consider including this very valuable group in this process?</P>
    <P>Yesterday, the Office of the Ombudsman published on its website a reprint of an article that appeared under the name of Emily O&rsquo;Reilly &mdash; the Ombudsman &mdash; in <i>The Irish Times</i> on 5 July 2005. The title of the article was &ldquo;A system that leaves the door open to injustices&rdquo;. In the article, the Ombudsman listed three specific cases. According to the article:</P>
    <P LI="1">Several factors are common to all three. The mothers were placed in nursing homes only when they had become so ill that not even assisted home care could meet their needs. All three have medical cards and were therefore entitled to public care. In each case, no public bed was available and all three were effectively forced into private care, with fees of up to &euro;3,500 per month.</P>
    <P FLI="0">These were caring families whose mothers possessed medical cards and were, therefore, entitled to public care. No public beds were available to them and they were forced to go into private care. The article then goes on to state:</P>
    <P LI="1">In all three cases, the value of the mother&rsquo;s residence has been taken into account by the health authorities as it assessed the level of State subvention to be provided, a relatively small fraction of the cost in most cases, but of critical importance to families struggling to pay the huge private fees.</P>
    <P FLI="0">The Ombudsman described how in one case, the mother&rsquo;s house remained the only home of her single middle-aged son. This is a very human situation yet the house was taken into calculation. She wrote that if the house was sold to help defray the nursing costs, he would be forced into the private rental sector. This is not a socially constructive approach. According to the article:</P>
    <P LI="1">In another case, the mother part owns the home with her son. It has been suggested that he might &ldquo;buy out&rdquo; the mother&rsquo;s share in order to increase the subvention, but this could bring his borrowings to an unmanageable level.</P>
    <P FLI="0">This, again, represents a very severe squeeze of an innocent individual.</P>
    <P>The third case involved a relatively recent transfer of the ownership of the family home, which allowed the authorities to assess its value. This was a mean-minded way to approach the situation.</P>
<Col N="1892"/>
    <P>Subsequently, the Ombudsman investigated the subject and indicated that the reason was the unusually large and steady flow of complaints. More than 150 had been received since the commencement of the scheme in September 1993. She made the serious point that the complaints received since then &ldquo;reflect not just the actions of individual offices or public bodies; rather they reflect the corporate response of virtually an entire sector&rdquo;. We are not talking about mavericks or an unrepresentative situation. Instead, there has been a concerted approach.</P>
    <P>Under the Act of 1970, every citizen has the right to avail of legislation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <P FLI="0" el="5" Just="Left">If the Government tried to change the Order of Business, might we be notified in a meaningful way? Recently, a cross-party delegation travelled to London at the invitation of the Irish part of a consortium. Our delegation included members of Fine Gael, the Progressive Democrats, the Green Party and the Labour Party, namely, me.</P>
    <P>We were invited to view a &pound;60,000 house. As part of a consortium, the Irish based company, Kingspan Century, developed a house that was short-listed by a unique British Government design to manufacture competition to develop a &pound;60,000 house, which would help to create affordable housing for sustainable communities. The competition was run by English Partnerships and the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister and brought to the fore the issue of creating affordable housing for sustainable communities.</P>
    <P>Many developers sought to rise to the challenge of creating the optimum &pound;60,000 house. From discussions with people while I was in London, a certain prestige was pursued by those who tendered for the project. More than 80 developers sought the contract to build the house, which indicates that the principle is innovative and commendable and an Irish company fought off stiff competition to win the overall cotract. This speaks volumes about the company.</P>
    <P>The project presented strong challenges to the construction industry and its ability to design and manufacture a range of houses using modern methods of construction is commendable. A house worth &pound;60,000, or &euro;90,000, is relatively affordable. After recent debates on prices, it was refreshing to consider that an idea could be pursued and a project put together involving different strands across the divide.</P>
    <P>The competition was instrumental in encouraging the industry to take a fresh look at its approach to design, construction and partnership. <Col N="1894"/>The level of interest was clear, as more than 80 developers tendered for the contract. Each company was willing to recognise the need to evolve and adapt to the ever changing housing demands and the growing demand for affordable housing in particular.</P>
    <P Just="Left">There was a consensus among the members of the delegation that this was a good idea and it would be difficult for a reasonable person not to understand this point of view. We do not lightly say that there is no reason the project cannot be replicated in this country. The only requirement is political will. We have the expertise, trades and people capable of doing this, as borne out by the fact that an Irish-based company won the contract. If the Minister of State takes anything from this motion, I hope it is this idea. He should take it with a view to move from inspiration to action.</P>
    <P Just="Left">While it was a cross-party delegation and invitations were issued to Fianna F&aacute;il, that party did not send any representatives for some unknown reason. An important body of knowledge would not have been lost on the major Government party if a Fianna F&aacute;il representative had been in attendance. I say this as an observation rather than a criticism.</P>
    <P>In recent years, the Labour Party has been to the fore in providing ideas and policies in this area. We firmly believe everyone has the right to a home and it is the duty of the Government to ensure everyone has a home sufficient to his or her needs. Everyone should be enabled to buy a home. In a buoyant and prosperous economy, with an Exchequer surplus of more than &euro;1 billion, the country is awash with money. Matters were different when economics did not allow us to make such statements, but there is plenty money now. As home ownership is the normal form of house tenure, every working family should be enabled to buy within reasonable distance of work and family, which is the kernel of my statement.</P>
    <P>We are committed to ensure affordable housing schemes deliver a minimum of 5,000 homes per year. Under Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000 and the partnership agreement, 40,000 homes should have been delivered. To date, only 2,000 have been delivered. These figures speak volumes about the inertia in fulfilling this promise. It is a measure that received much fanfare during its announcement.</P>
    <P>I am bound to give credit where it is due. In west Cork, the State donated land to the local authority by virtue of Clonakilty community college to build affordable housing. It would be remiss of me were I not to point this out. I was more than surprised that the project was obstructed at local authority meetings because house prices are particularly high in that area. I give credit where it was due, this was pursued by a Government Deputy, the land was made available and the affordable houses can now be built. I would like to see that happen everywhere. It <Col N="1895"/>is happening in Clonakilty to the credit of those involved but was opposed at council level.</P>
    <P>We propose ensuring that all those on the council list can secure a home at a reasonable cost. The NESC in a recent report stated that by 2012, 73,000 additional houses will be required. Given our current rate of delivery, we cannot be optimistic about realising that objective. The All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution, which was chaired by Deputy Denis O&rsquo;Donovan, recently recommended that in major urban areas, the local authority would have a publicly controlled land bank on which affordable housing can be built. That decision would end speculation in building land. We have all seen the battles at council meetings to rezone tracts of land. Zoned land, if it continues to be subject to speculation, will not relieve the huge demand on local authorities for social and affordable units. At the current rate of delivery, however, the Government will miss out on its own targets on social and affordable housing in spite of the &euro;100 million announced by the Minister of State at the weekend. The money is significant and welcome but the caveat is that the Government is spending more on delivering fewer homes.</P>
    <P>Before Christmas, a family came into my constituency office in Bandon, a husband and wife with two young children. At that stage almost 800 people were on the housing list in the western division of Cork County Council area, which does not include major urban centres such as Bandon and Kinsale. The couple have been on the housing list for four years but I could not look them in the eye and tell them their requirements would be met in the short term. Half of that family&rsquo;s disposable income was going towards rent and child care costs. They are an example of the new working poor falling into a poverty trap.</P>
    <P>In recent weeks, the quarterly report on house prices from <i>daft.ie</i> gave the lie to the myth that has been put forward by those who know better, including in the Government, that the housing market has calmed. The figures confirm what everyone has known for months &mdash; the housing market has shown no sign of slowing down, with house prices escalating ever upwards. House prices are now 13.8% higher than this time last year and 5.5% higher than in January. Clonakilty was the most expensive town in Munster, where a three bedroom semi-detached house now costs &euro;350,000, an astronomical sum for those on the lower end of the salary scale.</P>
    <P>The European Central Bank is expected to increase interest rates by 0.25% soon, again in September and perhaps again before the year is out. Those are measures where we have no control but they have an effect on affordability. If the increase is only 0.25%, it will add about &euro;28 to the average mortgage payment. When first-time buyer couples in Dublin are spending a third of their combined income on mortgage repayments, <Col N="1896"/>an increase from 29% last year, it is a huge amount for a double income couple.</P>
    <P>The affordability index I referred to was completed by EBS Building Society and DKM economic consultants. It shows that the average mortgage in Dublin for first-time buyer couples is almost &euro;1,700 per month and &euro;1,300 in the rest of the country. We have heard about economic prosperity since 1997 but since 1996 house prices have quadrupled in Dublin and trebled in the rest of the country, fitting in with the tenure of the Government. The expected increase in interest rates will have an adverse impact on affordability. Coupled with the fact that increases are also likely in September and December, this highlights the difficulty faced by those in that trap.</P>
    <P>It would be remiss not to mention homelessness during a debate on the provision of social and affordable housing. In February, the Government reviewed the homelessness strategy. At the time we called for practical measures recommended by the review group to be accompanied by a Government commitment to enshrine the right to own a home in law. I cannot see any problem with that. Given the wealth of modern Ireland and the boasting of the Government, it is a scandal that homelessness is still rampant. One does not have to go far from this House to see it.</P>
    <P>Rent supplement now costs &euro;400 million per annum. We have created a new form of social housing that is not readily visible. The social housing units do not exist and while people are in need of housing, the State is simply directly transferring &euro;400 million to private landlords. That must be reviewed. The Minister of State knows this because Deputy Gilmore has flagged it during Private Members&rsquo; business in the D&aacute;il. Approximately 60,000 tenants in private rented accommodation are in receipt of rent allowance. Almost all of these tenants are on social welfare and receive an allowance of up to &euro;1,000 per month. The poverty trap exists whereby if some of these people go into full-time employment, they lose their rent allowance.</P>
    <P>I will reply on this motion. I hope the Minister of State does not bombard us with figures from his glossy press release at the weekend. He must sit down and examine this issue and the innovative idea that now works perfectly in Britain. All that is missing in this country is the political will, we have everything else.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and second the motion. I thank the Labour Party for giving us the opportunity to discuss this vital issue this evening.</P>
    <P Just="Left">Shelter and access to suitable housing are two of the most basic human needs. This area of social policy, however, is being wilfully neglected and mismanaged by the Government. There is a housing crisis where first-time buyers are now paying an average of &euro;257,000 for their first home, with the average house price rising by 10.2% in the past year. The average house price nationally now <Col N="1897"/>stands at &euro;287,664. According to the ESRI-Permanent TSB house price index, the average house price in Dublin is &euro;384,247 &mdash; up almost 5% this year alone. The price of a house in 1996, the last full year during which Fine Gael was in office, was approximately &euro;88,000 in Dublin and &euro;75,000 nationally.</P>
    <P>Earlier this year, official statistics showed that, on average, first-time buyers are paying over &euro;250,000 for their first home. Young couples are forced to spend almost one third of their combined income on mortgage repayments, up from 29% this time last year, according to an EBS Building Society and DKM economic consultants affordability index.</P>
    <P>As Senator McCarthy stated, first-time buyers in Dublin are spending almost &euro;1,700 a month on their mortgage repayments, while those outside the capital are spending more than &euro;1,300, which is equal to 27% of a couple&rsquo;s combined monthly income. To cap it off, interest rates are due to rise tomorrow, with the European Central Bank expected to set the increase at 0.25% or 0.5%. The rungs of the property ladder are getting further and further apart for young first-time buyers. It is a small step for the wealthy but a giant leap for the average young, first-time hopefuls whose dreams are being shattered by the inaction of this uncaring Government.</P>
    <P>Affordable housing is virtually non-existent throughout the country, although the need for such provision is acute in certain locations, such as Dublin, Cork and Galway. Some 100,000 individuals are still awaiting local authority houses. The voluntary sector is underdeveloped and there are still enough homeless people in Ireland &mdash; more than 5,500 &mdash; to fill the Point Depot twice over. This is scandalous at a time when, as the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government said, the country is awash with money.</P>
    <P>The biggest problem facing young people today is the complete and utter failure of the Government to get to grips with the housing crisis. Its approach to rocketing house prices has made Opposition Members of this House sick, as they witness the knock-on effects of the Government&rsquo;s right-wing policies. The average price of a new house stands at &euro;287,000. Some 42,500 people aged over 30 are still living with their families. Some 50,000 families are on local authority waiting lists. Manifesto promises of more houses and a reduction in waiting lists are now a distant memory.</P>
    <P>This disaster has been met by a Government response which included the abolition of the first-time buyer&rsquo;s grant, an increase in VAT on housing, and development levies. There have been so many taxes and charges that much of the price paid for a new house goes directly to the Government, particularly in stamp duty. Stamp duty is a regressive tax. It is perceived as a money-making exercise for the Exchequer.</P>
<Col N="1898"/>
    <P>Approximately 108,000 houses are sold in Ireland each year and every day we spend an amazing &euro;85 million on house purchases, which works out at &euro;31.5 billion per annum. Stamp duty made &euro;2 billion last year for the Government from a total tax take of &euro;40 billion. This is a stealth tax aimed at young people &mdash; a section of our society that is struggling on an unequal playing field.</P>
    <P>The Government has engineered one of the biggest movements of wealth from the young to the middle-aged in our history. It should be thoroughly ashamed of itself. This Government likes to accuse Fine Gael and the Labour Party of having no policies. That is not true, as the Government will know to its cost when the next general election comes.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael has already developed a three-point plan for first-time buyers and is committed to implementing it. The plan consists of the following: a house deposit savings scheme, similar to the SSIA scheme, to help young people who are saving for a deposit for a new home; the abolition of stamp duty on second-hand homes up to &euro;400,000 bought by first-time buyers; and the front-loading of mortgage interest relief for first-time buyers to the first seven years of the life of a mortgage, thereby giving first-time buyers help when they most need it. This plan has been established Fine Gael policy for two years but we will not rest there.</P>
    <P>We need to examine how the shared ownership scheme operates. Put simply, it is too hard to qualify for that scheme, as it is for the affordable housing scheme which was first announced amid great pomp and ceremony over seven years ago. We must ensure that more people can qualify for these schemes and can afford to make the necessary payments.</P>
    <P>We need to deal with the pathetically low eligibility rates for these schemes. Currently, if one earns &euro;37,000 or more one will not qualify. According to the Bank of Ireland, someone earning &euro;37,000 per year qualifies for a mortgage of &euro;175,000 which is nowhere near enough to buy a property in any city and certainly not Dublin, as the Minister of State knows. That has been the case almost since he came into Government.</P>

	<P>Even a couple on a combined income of only &euro;50,000 are considered too rich for the shared ownership and affordable housing schemes. In addition, we need to make it easier and fairer for people who are sharing ownership with local authorities. At the moment, we have a crazy system under which one not only pays a mortgage for the portion of the house one owns under the shared ownership scheme, but one also pays rent on that share of the house owned by the local authority. As the State will recoup the value of its share of the home when it is sold, the Minister of State knows the current system is grossly unfair.</P>
    <P>The Housing Finance Agency says it has the borrowing capacity to provide more money than local authorities can spend on constructing new houses. The private sector is ready and willing to build them, while the National Building Agency can provide the expertise. The Centre for Housing Research is charged with identifying obstacles to housing output and longer-term trends. However, not enough affordable houses are being built. It is time to bring all these agencies together and provide one integrated, streamlined body to facilitate the construction of new social and affordable housing.</P>
    <P>While local authorities remain best equipped to ensure that social and affordable housing is built, it is clear that we need someone to step in where they have failed. That is why Fine Gael recently proposed to merge the Housing Finance Agency, the Centre for Housing Research and the National Building Agency, empowering the new agency to step in where local authorities are not meeting social and affordable housing needs.</P>
    <P Just="Left">The new agency, to be known as Housing Ireland, will be empowered to work directly with the private sector in tandem with local authorities to get houses built. It will be permitted to provide funding not just for new housing construction but also for services such as roads, water, sewerage and communications which are vital to ensuring that new housing comes on stream. Housing Ireland would also lend directly to voluntary housing agencies and would provide funding for <Col N="1900"/>land purchase and seed capital, based on a value for money audit.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael will also end the practice of selling valuable State land when it could be better used to provide social and affordable housing. We will instruct housing Ireland, in tandem with the Office of Public Works, to conduct a full audit of State-owned lands to identify whether or not that land is necessary to the further development of the Department or the agency. If not, and if it is suitable for housing development, it will be developed for a mix of social, affordable and private housing by the State or through public private partnerships. The Government would do well to listen, for once, to what the Opposition is saying on this vital matter. People need and deserve a roof over their heads and, as I said, they deserve a strong Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, not a Minister for philosophy or, perhaps more aptly, empty words. The Minister should take note and act.</P>

    <P FLI="0" el="5">I welcome the Minister of State to the House. I welcome the opportunity to speak on this matter, which arises as a direct result of the success that the Government and the previous Government have brought to the country. The issue is not about supply but about demand. The figures suggest that in the last quarter of 2005 alone, 26,563 houses were built, with 81,000 built in the full year, which is a 5% increase on the previous year. Some 248,100 people are now employed in the construction industry. These figures are phenomenal and do not only apply to Dublin.</P>
    <P>Yesterday we welcomed the Minister&rsquo;s announcement of the financial allocations for local authorities, which will be in excess of &euro;1 billion, and include &euro;942 million for the provision of housing, &euro;45 million for Traveller accommodation and &euro;48 million for remedial works. This constitutes an increase of over &euro;100 million on last year&rsquo;s allocation. We are dealing with supply issues but demand continues to grow. Population growth and the influx of workers from abroad feed into that demand. These issues must be managed and, to be fair, the steps we have taken recently will deal with these demands in time.</P>
    <P>The local authorities will build or acquire 6,000 units this year alone. My experience is with Dublin City Council. I take this opportunity to congratulate the housing section of the city council, which is one of the most progressive councils in the country and has done great work in the north inner city in particular. The Minister will refer to Ballymun and other areas but my experience in the north inner city is that there has been significant change. Through proper planning and investment, all the work done by Dublin City Council has paid off. In Dominick Street and Mountain View Court, the council plans to demolish decrepit flat complexes which, while they served their purpose, have become uninhabitable over time. The council has taken a policy decision to replace these complexes with state-of-the-art housing, in many cases with own-door housing. I have encouraged city officials to continue down that road because the more own-door housing that is provided in the inner city, the better. We do not want to go back to the 1950s and 1960s, when people were literally put in boxes and left there for many years. That practice has changed.</P>
<Col N="1902"/>
    <P>I have studied the plans for places such as O&rsquo;Devanney Gardens, where a major public private partnership is planned and about 800 units will replace 1950s and 1960s flat complexes. This will feed into the issues concerning the supply of houses in Dublin.</P>
    <P>Successful projects have been undertaken in the city, particularly the inner city. Much of the co-operative housing that has been provided has proven successful. Killarney Court in Killarney Street was probably one of the most notorious flat complexes for drug dealing and so on but it has been completely turned around. There is now a settled community with all necessary facilities, security and local schools &mdash; children are feeding into Larkin community college. This is a major change for that area, given the problems it had during the heroin epidemic of the 1980s and early 1990s. That change came about through proper planning and investment. If we continue with such programmes, particularly with regard to housing, including local authority housing, and associated facilities, matters can only improve.</P>
    <P>The management of social and affordable developments is essential. We could rush into this process and provide boxes left, right and centre but that is not sustainable. Communities need schools, access to transport and services. Whether in the inner city or the suburbs, if these issues are not dealt with properly at the planning stage, significant problems will result. Therefore, management and planning is essential.</P>
    <P>A development is under way at Spencer Dock on the north quays, in the area of the Irish Financial Services Centre. Discussions on this development began a number of years ago, which resulted in a new school for the North Wall area to deal with the influx of residents who will move to the area. The discussions at the planning stage considered family housing, including not only apartments for individuals but two and three-bedroom apartments, as well as the provision of shops, cr&egrave;ches and leisure facilities. This approach will pay dividends.</P>
    <P>Mistakes have been made in the past, from which we must learn. In the past, Cherry Orchard had no facilities &mdash; not a shop, a school or a telephone box. That has changed. Dublin City Council recognised the challenges. It accepted that issues had been neglected over a long period and decided to tackle them. As a result, areas have been transformed. There are now football pitches, schools, leisure facilities, clubs and organisations in places like Cherry Orchard, which had been neglected for many years.</P>
    <P>I have visited cities such as Glasgow to study sustainable models of high density urban housing, from which we must learn. It is possible to balance development with the right of people to an acceptable quality of life, which is what we must aim for.</P>
    <P>The issue in this country is not with supply but with demand, with which we will have to keep up. Major initiatives have been put in place, including <Col N="1903"/>with regard to affordable housing and shared ownership schemes. In north County Dublin, thousands of private and public housing units are being built. Many of the Part V houses will only come on stream this year and next year, and the Dublin Docklands Development Authority will have an input into the location of such houses.</P>
    <P>I support the amendment and welcome the opportunity to discuss the issue.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share time with Senator Norris.</P>

	<P>Is that agreed? Agreed.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not understand how anybody with sympathy for the young people of this country could disagree with the sentiments expressed in the motion. It is one of the great problems of the success of the Celtic tiger that the property market has taken off to such an extent that so many people cannot afford to buy houses. It is an issue the Government has been unable to address successfully. The motion expresses an aspiration which everybody in the nation has to own their own house, regardless of whether it is cheap or expensive. That aspiration is difficult to fulfil in this booming market.</P>
    <P>I understand the sentiments of the Labour Party, particularly given the figures that were released today in a report by DKM and the EBS. The report showed that the proportion of people&rsquo;s income going to pay their mortgages was continuing to rise and that the amounts being paid are unparalleled. The motion identifies and addresses the problem very successfully but the difficulty is how it will be solved.</P>
    <P>It is important to note that it is not just people on the modest incomes mentioned in the motion who are excluded from the housing market. It is also people with middle and high incomes. There are people at every level of income who cannot get on the property ladder. The problem here is not necessarily one which the Government can immediately resolve.</P>
    <P>People are using the most extraordinarily devious means to get on the property ladder. These means are forced on them by the price of houses. They include going to the bank and telling a pack of lies about their incomes and expenses. The banks accept those lies, knowing quite well that they are lies, and give them the loans. There is massive competition for mortgages, which means the housing boom is being fuelled by the banks.</P>
    <P>The main problem is not the Government which, to a large extent, is sitting back and letting the market operate. One of the great problems is that the banks are bending over backwards to lend money to people who cannot afford it. The rise in interest rates in the last few days signals the beginning of a difficult period for many young people in this country whose mortgage repay<Col N="1904"/>ments will become far more difficult to pay. Then the banks will demand payments which people will be unable to pay.</P>
    <P>I do not blame the Government for the boom in the property market but, to some extent, those who are lending money recklessly to people who, one day, will be unable to afford to repay that money. All sorts of bogus stress tests are conducted on people. We know these are bogus because the amounts that the banks are prepared to lend to people to get into the property market are now from six to nine times their income. In more prudent days, the amounts were two or three times their income. The banks pick out those to whom they lend but some people cannot borrow from lending institutions at all and cannot get on the housing ladder as a result.</P>
    <P>We are dealing with a pretty unscrupulous industry. We should not necessarily seek increased taxation and I note the motion does not mention that. It refers to control over development land so perhaps it is implied in that regard. It would be dangerous to increase taxation. In particular, it would be dangerous to increase the level of capital gains tax. However, it should be acknowledged that the Government has an interest in the property market continuing to boom. It takes an enormous amount of money from it through capital gains tax, stamp duty and VAT. Could the Government examine ways &mdash; and I do not believe the stamp duty argument &mdash; whereby it could reduce taxation and thereby free up property in the property market?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I am grateful to Senator Ross for sharing time. I, and probably all Members of the House, share the Labour Party&rsquo;s concerns about the enormous increase in house prices. The house my father bought in Ballsbridge in 1946 and where I was reared was recently on the market. It was withdrawn at &euro;3.5 million and the sale was negotiated for a substantially higher figure. It probably was sold for more than &euro;4 million.</P>
    <P>Senator Ross is correct about young people spending disproportionate amounts on mortgages. Approximately 33% or one third of their income goes on repaying mortgages. A rise in interest rates is expected on Thursday from the European Central Bank. That is likely to be not 0.25% as originally expected but 0.5%. It will add several hundred euro to the mortgage repayments of the average family. We might eventually reach the point indicated by Senator Ross, where banks will start to repossess properties. That will lead to the problem that arose in the British market some years ago, negative equity.</P>
    <P>However, that might not reduce the price of houses in Dublin. According to the construction industry there is still a substantial under-supply of houses in the Dublin area. The market, therefore, will squeeze the price further up. There is also the problem of gazumping, where people make an offer for a house which appears to be accepted but, within a matter of days, the price <Col N="1905"/>increases in a fashion that is difficult to justify morally, whatever the legal constraints might be. An interesting case of gazumping was aired recently on Joe Duffy&rsquo;s &ldquo;Liveline&rdquo;. The person involved was absolutely adamant and eventually secured the apartment at the original stated price.</P>
    <P>There is enormous pressure on young people who cannot afford to acquire a house. Communities are being destroyed because young people cannot afford to buy houses in the areas in which they were reared, where the prices have been forced up not just by market forces but also by people coming into the area and investing in the housing market for profit. One good feature of the market is the exemption from certain types of duties for first-time buyers. That is a good idea. Affordable housing is also a means whereby young people might be able to get on the property ladder. However, even then it is difficult because they must get sufficient money together for a deposit.</P>
    <P>It is worrying that so many builders have managed to get around their obligations by making payments. The Government should insist on the correct proportion of affordable housing. The greed of the construction industry has been clearly signalled by the fact that among the people with enormous incomes who have been under investigation recently by the Revenue Commissioners for non-payment of tax, a significant proportion of them generated these enormous sums from the housing market. However, that was not enough for them. They also sought to fiddle the banks.</P>
    <P>While Senator Ross took on the banks, in which I am usually happy to join him, on this occasion I concentrate my fire on the construction industry. There are practices in the industry which must be examined. The price of housing in this country is absurd and will only lead to misery for young people.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment. The subject of the motion, like many of those before us in recent weeks, reflects a source of genuine anxiety and concern among the public, not just among first-time buyers but also their parents and families, and among the many people coming to live in our country. The Labour Party motion is welcome in that it provides an opportunity to discuss this serious topic. I would have preferred the motion to be a little more extensive. To compare it to a story, the Labour Party motion presents only &ldquo;the middle&rdquo;, says little about &ldquo;the beginning&rdquo; and worst of all does not even suggest &ldquo;the end&rdquo; or a path towards it.</P>
    <P>It would be useful to set out some of the context to the problem of land and house prices. The House should be aware that the overall objective of Government policy on housing is to enable every household to have available an affordable dwelling of good quality, suited to its needs, in a good environment and as far as possible for the tenure of its choice. In general, the principle <Col N="1906"/>applied is that those who can afford to provide for their housing needs should do so either through home ownership or private rented accommodation. In tandem with this, supports should be available and targeted to others, with due given regard to the nature of their need. I doubt there is much disagreement on either side of the House &mdash; even from the Labour Party &mdash; with that approach.</P>
    <P>This policy objective has to be pursued in a demanding environment. A person&rsquo;s home is his or her castle, so to speak. It is people&rsquo;s shelter and is where they and their families grow and share in the experiences of life. Whether for historical, social or cultural reasons, Ireland has a high rate of home ownership and Irish people see owning a home as an important element in their lives. There are other less obvious considerations. The provision of quality housing is fundamental to our economic development. In the past the Minister has outlined how housing is an important element of our national infrastructure and thus has a key role to play in maintaining Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness. As a quality of life indicator, good quality housing is a factor in inward investment decisions for example.</P>
    <P>The most pressing demand comes from our expanding population and thriving economy. After a slight fall between 1986 and 1991, the upward trend in population resumed in the early 1990s. This trend has strengthened further still in this decade, with the 2002 population being the highest recorded since the census of 1871. Our economic performance must also be taken into account. The national accounts for the end of 2005 show GNP to have increased by 7% since the same period in 2004. The figures point to an economy that is performing well and better than some had previously thought. The ESRI believes this strong performance will continue into 2006.</P>
    <P>People are showing an increasingly positive perception of their current environment and their economic expectations. Despite the recent spike in fuel prices and well-aired concerns about personal borrowing, the overall consumer sentiment index published by the ESRI was 98.8 in April compared to a figure of 92.3 in March. Consumer optimism is strong.</P>
    <P>When these population and economic factors are added to the aforementioned mix of high rates of home ownership and our age demographic, the result is similar to that reflected in the Educational Building Society and DKM economic consultants&rsquo; report published yesterday. Its housing study has found that couples buying a house for the first time spend almost one third of their monthly income on mortgage repayments.</P>
    <P>The affordability index also found that Dublin buyers spend at least 32% of their income on mortgage repayments, an increase of three percentage points since last year. Spending across the rest of the country averaged at 27%. As a proportion of disposable income, mortgage repayments are at an historic high. There is also the <Col N="1907"/>likelihood of a large interest rate increase tomorrow, perhaps as much as half of 1%, double what many expected. This could add &euro;56 to the repayment cost of a typical first-time buyer&rsquo;s mortgage, on top of the &euro;56 increase already levied this year.</P>
    <P>Immense pressure is being put on the housing market. More important, immense pressure is being felt by people across the country and young people, in particular. The Government&rsquo;s policies are having a positive impact but in the face of the sheer demand, relief is difficult to identify. We know that tinkering around the edges of the problem achieves little. This was tried in the mid-1990s, but it was only when we started to get serious about supply that progress was made. A massive number of new houses are being constructed. The total number of house completions for the first three months of 2006 was 22,000, an increase of 15% nationally. Contrary to the impression given in the Labour Party&rsquo;s motion the figures show that Government policy continues to facilitate strong housing supply.</P>
    <P>The Government has, correctly, made clear that the focus is and will continue to be on maintaining the high levels of housing supply for all members of society, in tandem with targeted policies aimed at increasing the provision of social and affordable housing. On this front, I commend the Minister and the Government on the announcement yesterday of record funding of more than &euro;1 billion for social housing and an extra &euro;100 million for the main housing programme. Contrary to the thrust of the Labour Party motion, this announcement will provide &euro;942 million for local authority housing, &euro;45 million for Traveller accommodation and support, and &euro;48 million for remedial works to local authority dwellings, all of which is necessary, welcome and commendable.</P>
    <P>On maximising the monetary value and value to the public of publicly-owned land, it would seem wise that the State, <i>via</i> each local authority would have a comprehensive and up-to-date inventory of lands owned, or in any way controlled, by local authorities. I suggest that a full audit of such land, its use, and its zoning would help to inform proper planning decision making. It would at least ensure that local authorities can honestly say they are using all appropriate resources available to them to fulfil their duty in regard to providing housing.</P>
    <P Just="Left">The Opposition motion refers to the successful provision of affordable housing by Irish firms operating in the UK. They are not the first to recognise this. I understand an Oireachtas committee made a visit to one such scheme in recent weeks. I also understand that work is being done to look into how schemes and practices abroad can be adopted and adapted for use in Ireland with a view to having the same benefits accrue to Irish home buyers. The Progressive Democrats firmly support this work.</P>
<Col N="1908"/>
    <P>There is no doubt that we have some way to go in addressing the problem of house and land affordability. The National Economic and Social Council has said that given the remarkable strength of demand, a significant increase in house prices is inevitable. This is no comfort to those first-time buyers, their parents and families, the many new people coming to our country and the groups I referred to at the outset of my contribution. Neither is it any comfort to them to hear that house price increases have moderated greatly since annual house price inflation peaked at an incredible 48% eight years ago. They will not be impressed by the fact that the quality of Ireland&rsquo;s housing stock is high. The vast majority, 92%, of households surveyed during the national survey of housing quality expressed satisfaction with the general condition of their accommodation, their area and their neighbourhood.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, the achievements did not happen by accident. It has taken policy and action by Government, over years rather than months, to provide the conditions for greater housing supply, increased construction employment, moderated house inflation, &euro;1 billion funding for social housing and good quality housing. Further steps are needed as is clear from the Labour Party motion. However, it is a pity its motion was not more comprehensive and constructive.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Noel Ahern, and look forward to what he has to say on this subject and how he will apologise for the shortfall that exists in this most basic provision. There is an obvious truth in the Labour Party motion. There is no doubt about the continuing rapid rise in the price of new houses and the failure to take effective measures to control the price of building land. While I am not sure how it could be done effectively, something should be done in that area. The motion also expresses concern about those on modest incomes who are effectively excluded from the housing market or, at a minimum, find it increasingly difficult to get on the first rung of the housing ladder. There is a need, as the motion suggests, for a radical solution from the Government on the home ownership crisis. I look forward to hearing what the Minister of State has to say on that aspect.</P>
    <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The right to a home is a basic right. In regard to affordable and social housing, I support Senator Brennan&rsquo;s call for a full audit of local authority lands. However, I suggest that all lands in State control should be included in such an audit. A debate took place here recently, in which I did not have the opportunity to participate, on hospital lands. The pros and cons of the rush to sell off all those vast acres that surround some hospitals and other institutions were aired. The State, especially the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, should ensure that many <Col N="1909"/>acres of those lands be made available to local authorities because there are huge housing waiting lists in every local authority area. A full inventory should be done as soon as possible to facilitate what is necessary to meet the evident demand.</P>
     <P>The number of homeless people on the streets of Dublin is appalling. What agency is grappling with this problem, tending to these poor, unfortunate people who are begging on the streets at night? The State is now very well off and surely hostels could be provided to allow these people a place to stay at night where they would get a meal and shelter.</P>
    <P>I strongly support Senator Bannon&rsquo;s assertion that the Government should urgently examine the removal of stamp duty on houses at the lower end of the market. This could cover houses valued at up to &euro;400,000, perhaps, and if the Government could make a start on this it would be welcome.</P>
    <P>Senator Ross expressed his sympathy with young people trying to enter the housing market and I would like to hear the Minister of State address the subject. Our sympathy could be demonstrated in a practical way by removing the ban on stage payments. I do not understand why the Minister of State has not acted on this since he expressed his intention to do so when he spoke on the topic in the Seanad in May 2004. There is no uniformity on this issue across the country; I do not believe it exists at all in Dublin, and that is why it should be abolished. It seems to apply mainly in Cork and some other counties.</P>
    <P>Why should young people, or anyone for that matter, have to pay up to 90% of the price of a new house before it is completed? They could be out 90% of the cost over the course of a year, they cannot get a proper mortgage and are subject to bridging finance &mdash; they are being screwed, let us be honest. Banks and other institutions are prepared to make the money available. People engaging in this type of purchase run a frightful risk of ruin should the builder go bankrupt, although that is unlikely to happen nowadays. In the last year I have heard of cases where such buyers believe they are about to move in to the house only for snags to arise which render it impossible. It is an appalling mess to which the Minister of State can no longer turn a blind eye. It is an unnecessary burden on first-time buyers that forces them to begin mortgage repayments months before occupying their home. This system is of no benefit to the buyer and is designed solely to accommodate the builder or developer. The economy is going well, from which builders are the first to benefit, and no builder needs this practice in the counties that it exists.</P>
    <P>In today&rsquo;s Ireland there should be no need for a buyer to foot the costs of building materials for a new house. This is an outdated method of payment and provides no protection to the consumer. The Minister of State surely believes that this is an unacceptable practice and I would like <Col N="1910"/>to hear his opinion on it. I do not want to go into the Peelo &amp; Partners report but it showed that consumers are paying an extra &euro;175 million because of this practice. This figure has probably increased because that report dated from 2004. I look forward to hearing the Minister of State address this sore point.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to outline the Government&rsquo;s approach to housing and to point out progress and achievements in this important area. The Government&rsquo;s strong record on housing is proven and stands in contrast to some of the superficial and unfounded comments made this evening and enshrined in the motion.</P>
    <P>House price increases reflect, primarily, intensified demand for housing resulting from unprecedented growth in Ireland&rsquo;s population and economy. Both of these factors have had a major impact in the last year. A report referred to 90,000 extra jobs in the economy and 50,000 extra people in the country. We await the new census figures, but one of the most striking statistics in the last census showed the number of people in the 25-34 year old age bracket had increased by 18%. This increase is extraordinary as this cohort represents the bulk of people buying houses and setting up homes.</P>
    <P>It is not true that first-time buyers have been priced out of the market. The number of first-time buyers in recent years is higher than ever before. It is estimated that approximately 45% of all new house purchase loans taken out last year were attributable to first-time buyers. They may be under pressure, depending on their income bracket, but they are buying, they are getting by and they are a significant part of the market.</P>
    <P>The Government has taken action to respond to increased housing demand, particularly through measures to promote an adequate supply of housing. There is clear evidence that this policy is having an effect. Last year was the 11th year of record house completions with nearly 81,000 finished. Ten years ago that figure was under 31,000 and in the early 1990s it stood at just 21,000 to 22,000. It has gone up by 400% since then. Senator Norris said these figures hide the fact that building on such a scale is not going on in Dublin. It is, last year 18,000 of the overall figure of 81,000 were in Dublin and approximately 28,000 were in the greater Dublin area. I accept that over ten to 12 years Dublin was slower to get running but the figures in more recent years have been significant and that is where the affordability problem lies. We are providing new homes at a faster rate than any other country in Europe. Such statistics are maintained in an international table. We are currently at an output figure of 20 new houses per year per 1,000 of population, while the UK figure is about five, and Sweden is about one. We are way ahead of other countries regarding output, based on demographics and the increased number of young people in the country.</P>
<Col N="1911"/>
    <P>Senator Bannon said there are more people than ever before living with their families, more 30 year old sons and daughters. There may be, but 15 or 20 years ago they were not living with their families because they were living in Australia, America and elsewhere throughout the world. Which way does one want it? Certainly such people who might be ready to leave the nest are still living with their parents &mdash; we might all have that problem to some extent &mdash; but in many regards it is a good problem to have because 15 or 20 years ago such people were living abroad.</P>
    <P>Our achievement has not happened by accident. One of the central roles of Government is to facilitate the provision of housing, and our record speaks for itself. Since 1997 we have improved the planning regime to ensure it operates in full support of housing policies, and have invested in serviced land to the extent that we now have some six years supply of serviced residential land nationally. We will continue to support investment in infrastructure to deliver high levels of housing output and improve affordability and availability of housing for first-time buyers.</P>
    <P>A number of concerted measures have been taken through targeted affordable housing programmes to increase the availability of affordable housing. These include the shared ownership scheme, the 1999 affordable housing scheme, affordable housing under Part V of the Planning and Development Acts 2000 to 2004 and the affordable housing initiative agreed as part of Sustaining Progress.</P>
    <P>Politicians and media people continually misquote, deliberately or otherwise, our output of affordable houses per year. We have four schemes &mdash; which is perhaps part of the confusion &mdash; but the output of affordable houses last year was just 2,900, which is very significant.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a figure of 2,900 out of 81,000.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes. It is very significant, yet people just quote a figure from one of the four schemes, and there is no need to do that. Senator Bannon spoke about prices. The 200 or so houses we got as part of the Harcourt Square land swap &mdash; I do not know if they are all sold yet &mdash; were selling just a few weeks ago at prices of &euro;142,000 for two-bedroom homes and &euro;172,000 for three-bedroom homes. This is in Dublin. Of course there is a clawback involved, but that does not matter if one is looking for a home. We hear of all these average prices, which mean nothing because they are average prices of very expensive homes. There are homes out there for first-time buyers. Indeed, many first-time buyers do not even bother with our affordable homes because they feel they can make a normal purchase.</P>
    <P>Last year we provided 2,900 affordable homes and over the next three years we expect the total <Col N="1912"/>will reach approximately 15,000, an average of 5,000 per year. We will not reach the figure of 5,000 this year, but I hope we might reach a figure of 3,500 to 4,000, perhaps 5,000 next year and maybe 5,500 the following year. That output will increase considerably, particularly as the output from Part V comes along. Earlier this year, we improved some of these schemes by increasing the income eligibility limits and the subsidy levels. Currently, we are further developing schemes in order to simplify and streamline arrangements.</P>
    <P>There are affordable homes in many areas. Senator McCarthy spoke earlier about Clonakilty and I am grateful for his comments. I am sorry I will not accept the Labour Party motion but I thank Senator McCarthy for his comments and his support for those Clonakilty homes, because the Labour Party&rsquo;s would-be partners in Government have been acting disgracefully in this regard. The NESC report already referred to has shown that Clonakilty is the town in Munster with the highest house prices, yet the local Fine Gael representatives want to see them stay that way.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not know if the Labour Party will be able to sort out Fine Gael. I wish it luck, because historically, the interests of the Labour Party and of Fianna F&aacute;il are much closer.</P>

	<P>I am all for affordable housing. That is what I am arguing for.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>It is hard to listen to some of what Senator Ryan says.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I would not blame the Minister of State for everything done by Fianna F&aacute;il councillors.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>Allow the Minister of State to continue without interruption.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>A significant amount of the expanded output of affordable housing over the coming years will be delivered through the affordable housing initiative. A key factor in meeting the 10,000 units proposed for this initiative has been the release of State and local auth<Col N="1913"/>ority lands. More than 70 projects planned for State and local authority lands together with the 2,500 affordable housing units under Part V of the Act will deliver this targeted number of units. All projects are now being progressed as a matter of urgency through procurement options that seek to deliver quality housing at reasonable prices as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Part V is an important instrument, and will continue to be in the future, in expanding the supply of affordable housing. The NESC report, which was quoted extensively, suggested that Part V was &ldquo;the single most important policy development in recent decades&rdquo;. Output under Part V is dependent on the level and commencement of private sector residential development, but will be significant in the future. The old planning permissions which are there are fading out, though some of the big ones with ten-year permission will obviously take some time. However, with regard to Part V, some people take a simplistic view, just using arithmetic, 20% of 81,000, coming up with a figure of about 16,000. This was never meant to apply to one-off housing around the country or to developments on unzoned land, but applies to developments of a minimum of four units. Part V was always meant to apply to a segment of the total output, not the entire output. However, its output will increase over the years.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>Its application is uneven.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Increasingly, that will no longer be the case. Output is now gathering momentum. Last year, 1,400 units came under Part V, 600 the year before, and the total to date is about 2,100. In addition, local authorities, using the various flexible options now available to satisfy Part V obligations, have acquired land, or partially or fully serviced sites, and funds which will assist in the delivery of social and affordable housing options in the coming years.</P>
    <P>All developers are now fulfilling their legal obligations in this regard. I do not mind if they do so by means of cash or sites or whatever, as that is part of the law. Developers can offer anything they like to the local authority but the authority decides, and such authorities know it is houses that people want. However, if a local authority decides that in accordance with its housing strategy, it will allow a developer to fulfil his or her legal obligations otherwise, so be it.</P>
    <P>The Government has been alive to the particular affordability issues in the greater Dublin area and has responded comprehensively. A key initiative in that regard was the establishment of the affordable homes partnership last year, with a focused mandate to co-ordinate and add impetus to the delivery of affordable housing in and around the capital. We can talk about the Kenny report until the cows come home, and the all-party committee&rsquo;s comments last year, but it is a case of spending one&rsquo;s life in the Supreme Court arguing a case or getting on with it.</P>
   </Speaker>
<Col N="1914"/>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Just once.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>One can either do that or get on with the job of providing houses. That is what we are doing under the affordable homes partnership, because that group, chaired by Des Geraghty, is making good progress on the implementation of its work programme, including advancing certain affordable housing initiative projects on State lands. I mentioned Harcourt Square in that regard. Given that the pilot project has yielded value for money, and resulted in significant time savings in the delivery of completed affordable units, the partnership will be employing the swap mechanism in further areas.</P>
    <P>At national level the Department initiated a comprehensive programme of active land management by local authorities. The affordable homes partnership invited submissions last November from parties interested in providing and developing land primarily for affordable housing. Several of the submissions received are considered to be appropriate from a planning point of view. The partnership is now engaged with the promoters of these proposals in order to work up more detailed development agreements. The basic purpose is that land will be made available at a cheaper cost per site.</P>
    <P>I accept Senators&rsquo; remarks on house prices and there is no doubt they have risen sharply. In the past several years I noted a 10% rise in one year and then 7.5% in the following, with experts declaring the rise would be further reduced to<?oasys _jy ?>5%. In the middle of last summer, house prices took off again. We are in a spiral of increased house prices which I am concerned about. Depending on who one listens to, the rise varies between 13% and 15%. I hope this upward spiral does not last much longer. I agree with Senator Ross that much of it is due to the financial institutions. In Ireland many people borrow from the banks when in other countries they do not. The institutions are shovelling money at people.</P>
    <P>Senators referred to the affordability index contained in yesterdays&rsquo; newspapers. Although it is difficult for many people now, homes were less affordable in 1992. It did not last long as the punt was devalued and homes subsequently became more affordable. Another factor that must be remembered is that people have eased their affordability problems with 30-year old and 40-year old mortgages. All the extra gimmicks offered by the institutions such as 100% mortgages, interest-only and inter-generational mortgages, can help someone&rsquo;s affordability problem in the short term but they add a large amount of debt in the long term. I no longer blame the developers for increased house prices. It is the fault of the financial institutions. If people can secure larger mortgages, they would be foolish not to avail of whatever is going. I am concerned about the annual house price increase of 15%. I hope this spiral will end quickly. A 0.25% or 0.5% increase in mortgage interest may bring <Col N="1915"/>people to their senses. That should not create large difficulties if these mortgages have been properly stress-tested. All along we are told they have been but I sometimes wonder.</P>
    <P>I announced yesterday that funding of &euro;942 million, an increase of &euro;100 million, is to be provided for local authority housing. Senator McCarthy referred to the difficulties with social housing in Bandon, Schull and Skibbereen. It is up to the local authorities to bring forward housing schemes which the Department will fund. However, many local councillors want their areas to remain exclusive and are not proposing local authority housing projects to the Department.</P>
    <P>Much cheap social housing was built in the 1960s and 1970s. I refuse to take that route. Every year &euro;250 million is spent on remedial works and regeneration schemes, trying to put right many of the problems in these older estates. In the 1970s vast estates, some with up to 500 units, were built on greenfield sites with no proper facilities, such as a footpath to a bus stop.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>That was an awful mistake.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Good homes are now being built. I am not passing comment on any houses that people went to in London. I am resisting the temptation to build cheap social housing. While it would bring the waiting lists down and make me look good, it would not be a sustainable and long-term answer.</P>
    <P>Approximately &euro;50 million is spent each year on homelessness. It is a much more complex issue than having a roof over one&rsquo;s head or money.</P>

   </Speaker>

	<P>That is another matter. Many of them have addiction or psychiatric problems and will not take up accommodation. There will always be homelessness. The real answer in dealing with&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>There is an agency to deal with homelessness.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes there is. The real judge of the effectiveness of Government policy is how quickly one can turn these people around. Homelessness is the safety net for every other situation in life. It is not whether there are 50 or 150 persons sleeping rough in Dublin city, it is about how quickly they can be turned around and brought off the streets. Much good work is being done in this area. In a time when there is an increase in the house-buying age group, we are bound to be <Col N="1916"/>under pressures. With the policies the Government is pursuing, we can get on top of the matter.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>My problem is that I like the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Noel Ahern, and will, therefore, be inhibited in what I say on the motion. I always find him to be a man who responds to what one says. He does not just recite his script and ignore the issues raised. He seems to come from a family where the senior members are more left-wing than the younger members. Socialism seems to be generally popular in the Ahern family, judging by some of their utterances.</P>
    <P>Listening to the EBS spokesperson yesterday, the most telling remark she made was when the building society switched from measuring affordability per individual to per couple. If it had stayed with affordability for the individual, the market would have gone through the roof. Affordability is now based on the combined income of two people. The problem with this is that couples tend to have children. The purpose of many relationships is to have children. The affordability measure, however, cannot be separated from that consequence. If both partners must work, they will inevitably have child care costs. This is the fundamental flaw in the methodology used for measuring affordability. If one is to measure housing and affordability, one either factors out a significant part of one partner&rsquo;s income or factors in the indisputable fact of high expenditure on child care. The figures quoted of 29% to 32% exclude an inextricable link between child care and housing.</P>
    <P>I am intrigued that no Member has addressed the fact that most of our ambitious city and county managers have a singular desire to get out of the house-renting business. I am not sure whether it is because they believe they are bad at it, it is a distraction or whatever, but it is difficult to accept that city and county managers, who are notoriously uninterested now in expanding the stock of rented housing within their area of responsibility, will suddenly line up, as the Minister of State suggested, to take up all these opportunities to provide more non-ownership based social housing.</P>
    <P>It seems that a large part of our current devices are to do with avoiding the possibility of local authority rented accommodation. There may be good arguments for that. If the Minister of State does not have a strategy constructed, however, one may end up with gaps such as the 40,000 or 50,000 households who are now on local authority housing waiting lists and who are condemned to remain so.</P>
    <P>The issue of the cost of building land arises continually. Nobody objects to compensating people for the value of their property to the extent that they are responsible for that value. One can understand the position of people who work in agriculture. There is the idea that the for<Col N="1917"/>tuitous fact that one happens to own land which turns out to be rezoned for housing transfers one from a position of minimal compensation to one of a spectacular return which will make oneself and one&rsquo;s family rich forever, is inevitable and a consequence of the market. It is not a consequence of the market. It is a consequence of public policy, which, by a deliberate decision, makes some people rich at the expense of others.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, commented to the effect that one wanting to go the route of the Kenny report may look forward to spending long hours in the courts. Of course Part V, which we all agree was a significant development to be welcomed, was challenged in and singularly and vigorously vindicated by the courts. This made it quite clear that on an issue as fundamental as the provision of housing and shelter for our citizens, the exigencies of the common good would override any special claims of property. Incidentally, there are no rights of property in the Constitution. What the Constitution contains is a right to property. Property is not mentioned as a thing of itself, other than as something that individuals have the right to own. If we want to go the route of the Kenny report, of course there will be a court challenge. There will be one court challenge, just as there was one court challenge to Part V. I believe, more than I did 20 years ago, that such a court challenge would be thrown out, in which case we could deal with the issue.</P>
    <P>I am deeply concerned about homelessness. While it is not directly adverted to in the motion, Senator McCarthy and the Minister of State mentioned it. Voluntary organisations are entering into commitments to provide high-quality services for homeless people. Without breaching confidence, all I will say is that I would appeal to the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ahern, who is present, and to his colleague, Deputy Noel Ahern, who was present up until a minute ago, to keep their promises and ensure, in particular, that the HSE keeps its promises. When the HSE agrees to provide multiannual funding on a particular level, it cannot suddenly discover a budgetary problem and retreat from that agreement. That is a recipe for enormous problems for well-intentioned and honest voluntary organisations and there are unfortunate suggestions that there is some sliding from what are meant to be multiannual commitments, particularly to fund services. The Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, was correct in this much at least. Homelessness is not just about housing. One cannot deal with homelessness without providing shelter and housing, but one will not deal with it just by providing shelter and housing. That is where the funding, not just on a capital basis but on a current basis, is needed and unfortunately there is evidence that there is some retreat from that.</P>
    <P>I will really believe the Government is facing up to the issue of extraordinary profits in housing when Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s tent at the Galway races <Col N="1918"/>closes down and the assembled rich builders are not welcomed into that hospitality, as they have been every year as long as I can remember.</P>

   <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I remind Senator Ryan that the party which brought in Part V, which was probably the biggest imposition on developers that I have seen in legislation or, indeed, in taxation, came about through Fianna F&aacute;il and the last Government. Therefore, his point does not stand up to any great scrutiny.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, outlined the number of house completions in 2005 at 81,000. The rate of house completions is four times that in the rest of our EU partners, which is a phenomenal output. I recall the time when we stated there would be a massive improvement if we could increase the output to in excess of 50,000 or 55,000. It is significant that we have reached 81,000 house completions.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly, it must be recognised that there is a problem of affordability. The Government has striven to tackle this issue by increasing the output. This, to some extent, has addressed the issue. It has not addressed it completely and we must recognise that.</P>
    <P>As the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, correctly stated, this matter is a product of the economic success that we have been enjoying &mdash; immigration, more people at work and the demographic changes of people moving into the age bracket where they are looking to purchase a home. Those issues are positive. We should recognise them as such and then attempt to deal with the difficulties to which some of that success gives rise.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with the ideological argument on controlling the price of building land in the motion from the Labour Party and the Fine Gael Party. That is the same type of argument we heard when an innovative decision was made by the former Minister for Finance, Mr. Charlie McCreevy, to reduce capital gains tax from 40% to 20%, which released large parcels of land which would not otherwise have been released for development and which significantly enhanced the Exchequer returns. While those who were hung up on these historic ideological philosophies view such measures as negative, in <Col N="1919"/>fact, the effect of the measure to which I refer has been very positive.</P>
    <P>Many issues arose in the past about the controversies over rezoning land. There were councillors of certain political parties who made a virtue of opposing all rezoning. They contributed enormously to the current problem because insufficient land was zoned to meet the housing demand, even in the 1970s and 1980s, and it certainly did not meet the growing demand that appeared in the 1990s.</P>
    <P>I very much welcome the investment now being made in servicing land. That is really the way to meeting the growing demand for housing which will exist for a considerable number of years to come. There are those who predict that our population will grow to in excess of 5 million by 2015 or 2020, and we must now be putting in place the infrastructure which will be able to deal with the housing requirements of the predicted population.</P>
    <P>One issue that concerns me somewhat is that to some extent Ireland&rsquo;s GDP is becoming attached to the construction industry, which is notoriously cyclical.</P>
    <P>The scale of development is now having a greater impact on GDP. Any change in the cycle for whatever reason could impact on the economy and we must be mindful of this.</P>
    <P>The cost of housing is probably reflected in inflation, particularly with rising interest rates, and in wage demands, which all affect competitiveness. All these issues are connected to our overall economic well-being. I welcome a debate on this area to ensure the issue is managed carefully and that we avoid some of the pitfalls that have occurred in other countries as a consequence of negative equity, to which some Members referred. While no economist has predicted this will happen, nonetheless we should be mindful of the dangers and risks in this area.</P>
    <P>I very much welcome the Minister of State&rsquo;s commitment that we will not return to the policy pursued in the 1960s of providing cheaper houses. What we need is better value in the housing market, not cheap houses. The cost of subsequently having to renovate and modernise substandard housing is something we should avoid.</P>
    <P>The Department is seeking to increase housing density in rural areas. From a social perspective it is important to have sufficient space. Ultimately, we will pay a price if we confine people in small spaces with inadequate play areas for children.</P>
    <P>Although I supported the introduction of Part V, I would welcome a review of it. A certain amount of housing has resulted from it but we should examine to what extent it is impacting on housing inflation, particularly for first-time buyers. We must ensure our policies are geared towards facilitating people with reasonable incomes to access housing.</P>
<Col N="1920"/>
    <P>In the past, a low-rise mortgage scheme was developed and we should consider reintroducing it. I do not remember in detail how it operated but after a local authority approved a loan, one gradually paid an increased amount over a 12-year period until one was eventually paying full interest. It was feasible to do this as one&rsquo;s income had increased in the meantime.</P>
    <P>The shared ownership scheme should be revisited. The price of the portion owned by the local authority should remain static with interest being paid on it and, subsequently, people should be allowed to buy their homes from the local authority at the original price. The fact that the price escalates has led to the scheme not realising its full potential.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to have an opportunity to speak on this motion. I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ahern, to the House.</P>
    <P>Housing is one of the most interesting political topics with which we are faced. Regardless of what Government is in power or what resources are available, the Government of the day always has a choice when it comes to housing policy. Within the next 12 months or so the country will elect a new Government. We do not yet know the hue of that Government but housing will again become one of the top political issues, not just of the election campaign but, I hope, one of the main political priorities of the new Government.</P>
    <P>I hope the next Government will provide a full Cabinet portfolio for a Minister for housing. I am like a long-playing record on this issue as I have referred to it on numerous occasions in this House and elsewhere. Senator Jim Walsh referred to our huge economic dependence on housing. Approximately 240,000 people work in the construction sector. It is important from a social as well as economic point of view that housing is given top priority at Cabinet level.</P>
    <P>We still have a housing crisis although it is not the same as that experienced in the 1970s and 1980s. The issues that currently arise in this regard relate to land use, house design, rural planning, land zoning and affordability. All of these issues must be addressed in the next five to ten years by a Cabinet Minister. Currently, the Minister of State with responsibility for housing is part of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government but given the importance of housing, a full Cabinet Minister should be appointed for at least a five or ten-year period.</P>
    <P>The Government often refers to the record supply of housing stock, which is laudable. New housing construction is evident in every townland, village and town around the country. In spite of that, significant housing problems remain. Local authority housing waiting lists are still a fact of life. Social and affordable housing schemes assist persons to purchase houses but these schemes require streamlining.</P>
<Col N="1921"/>
    <P>I agree with what the previous speaker said about the shared ownership scheme. That scheme is in place for the past ten or 12 years and, although it was slow in taking off, it has worked well. It was initially difficult for public representatives to explain to their constituents but it is now a popular scheme that allows people to get on the property ladder. After three or four years the vast majority of people take out a bank or building society loan to purchase their property outright and leave the shared ownership scheme.</P>
    <P>Senator Jim Walsh&rsquo;s point about the local authority&rsquo;s share of the equity is valid. It is a penalising factor and must be examined. The income limits and some of the other rules must also be examined. We must encourage the maximum possible number of people to avail of the scheme. The combination of shared ownership loans and affordable housing can contribute positively towards addressing the housing needs of thousands of people if we can get the equation right. Not enough is done by local authorities to sell the housing policy. Staff shortages mean that insufficient people are available to do this work. We must ensure there is always an adequate response to social housing needs, but social and affordable housing and shared ownership must be seen as the route forward for many people on lower incomes. Minor adjustment to some of the rules governing the scheme is required.</P>
    <P>Another issue which I would urge the Minister of State to examine is a throwback to the mid-1980s &mdash; the housing reconstruction grants and loans scheme, which became a prisoner of its own success. A small number of units of accommodation are still occupied by people who are probably on a local authority waiting list and whose needs could be looked after in a more constructive way, if one will pardon the pun, if a grant scheme or favourable loan scheme were available. Tens of thousands of people qualified for the house improvement grants scheme of the mid to late 1980s. The problem on that occasion was that the scheme was not means tested. If we could revisit this scheme and possibly examine means testing it, it might take care of the housing needs of a certain number of people. All of our individual housing policies have a role to play. Where we fall down is in co-ordinating these policies and piecing the jigsaw together. This is why we need a more streamlined and politically stronger machine driving housing policy, which is why I return to my earlier suggestion that the post of Minister for housing be created. Having said that, I appreciate the work being carried out across the country. Private developers are carrying out outstanding work and local authorities are beginning to make an impact. I accept that Part V is now about to come into play and produce the numbers we need. We must continue this work because given our booming Celtic tiger economy, it is unforgivable that tens of thousands of people have no prospect of housing themselves without State assistance. We, as State representatives, <Col N="1922"/>must come to their aid and try to ensure that the basic right of housing is made available to all citizens.</P>

	<P>Is that agreed? Agreed.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="EamonScanlon"><NameTxt>Mr. Scanlon</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad to have the opportunity to comment on this issue. I acknowledge the allocation of housing grants to Sligo County Council and Sligo Corporation in recent days. Sligo County Council received &euro;11.6 million, while Sligo Corporation received &euro;11.5 million. This is a total of &euro;23 million for house construction and purchase. In addition, Leitrim County Council received &euro;6 million. I understand that the phenomenal grants received by both Sligo and Leitrim County Councils are the highest ever received by both.</P>
    <P>I concur with Senator Coghlan&rsquo;s point about stage payments, which usually relate to first-time buyers. I am aware that it was a very common practice at one point but this is certainly not the case in my county of Sligo. Today, somebody will pay a booking deposit, a 10% deposit upon signing the contract and the remainder of the money when the house is completed. This practice should be the norm across the country. A system of stage payments is hard on young couples who must pay these payments because they probably have a 90% mortgage and must pay rent as well. This system is unfair and the Government should insist that people should only pay a booking deposit, a 10% deposit and the remainder of the money when a house is completed.</P>
    <P>The shared ownership scheme is an excellent scheme and I know of many young couples who have benefited from the scheme and got on to the housing ladder. I noticed that after a year, these couples bought out the council&rsquo;s share, which usually involved remortgaging the house. This scheme should be encouraged more. I agree with Senator Jim Walsh&rsquo;s argument that the council&rsquo;s share of the mortgage should remain static because the scheme is slightly restrictive at the moment in respect of the price of the house and the qualifying income.</P>
    <P>I do not believe county council housing lists are accurate. I know of large numbers of people who are on housing lists to get rent allowance. Many of these people will never look for a local authority house. An audit should be carried out of all county councils to ascertain the true numbers on county council housing lists because they are inaccurate at the moment. I am aware the Minister of State does not fully agree with 100% mortgages. I know of certain people who have qualified for such mortgages who would not otherwise have been able to get on to the housing ladder.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MargaretCox"><NameTxt>Ms Cox</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Scanlon for sharing his time with me, given that it was so short. I am <Col N="1923"/>delighted to have the opportunity to bring certain issues to the attention of the Minister of State. It must be admitted that there is a crisis in respect of housing. Many people around the country do not have the opportunity to buy their own homes, nor do they know when they will be in a position to do so. In that context, it is important to drive home a very focused and joined-up approach to the provision of proper housing for these people.</P>
    <P>I have previously addressed a number of issues relating to housing, the first of which is rent allowance. It is wrong for the State to pay out rent allowance on a weekly basis to private landlords throughout the country in order to allow people to live in their properties. Such a policy creates profit for private developers. We should use the money spent on rent allowance to finance the purchase of houses through local authorities. These houses can then either be rented out from the local authority&rsquo;s housing stock or used in joint ownership schemes or new schemes which could be developed to give people a chance to buy their own homes through partnership with the local authority.</P>
    <P>My second point concerns an idea which I understand is credited to Fr. Se&aacute;n Healy. He argued that if the &euro;600 million currently being put into SSIA accounts was unilaterally funnelled into our housing budget for the next five years, it would make a considerable difference to the people of this country. This is a very genuine idea which should be examined.</P>
    <P>We must introduce a process between county and city councils in areas such as Galway which permits joint ownership in respect of buying houses for the affordable housing scheme. Under such a process, Galway City Council could buy a house from Galway County Council and <i>vice versa</i>. We should buy new houses and transfer them under the social housing scheme.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Mr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>I will make some points which I did not get a chance to address in my initial contribution. A retrograde step taken by the Government over the past few years, which I believe was intentional, was the abolition of the first-time buyer&rsquo;s grant. We had many debates in this House about this step. The &euro;3,800 which was available under the scheme went some way towards providing a deposit or easing the financial burden on the thousands of young people who availed of it.</P>
    <P>The impact of increased development charges on developers has also added to the burden on house buyers who must pay these charges. I have consistently made the point that there has been a massive increase in development charges for houses in rural areas. As a result, the development charges of some one-off rural houses on grant of permission are now between &euro;4,000 and &euro;6,000. Before the former Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, announced the increase in <Col N="1924"/>development charges, such charges in rural areas would have been significantly lower. If one factors in the abolition of the first-time buyer&rsquo;s grant and the increase in development charges, one is talking about figures of between &euro;6,000 and &euro;8,000, which represents a considerable amount of money for someone who is just starting out and is already under pressure to put together a deposit and obtain a mortgage.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Scanlon&rsquo;s argument that the 100% mortgage is necessary to allow people to borrow the levels of money now required to enter the housing market. One does not need to be a housing consultant to know this. I am aware that it raises genuine concerns in some quarters. However, if this mortgage product was not on the market, many more young people would have featured in the house price affordability index for the last few days. It is a necessary evil.</P>
   <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
    <P>The emergence of management companies is another recent development. While such companies are needed to run apartment blocks, they should be abolished in housing estates. There should be an outright ban on management companies for housing estates and stricter limits put in place to enforce the workings of those in apartment blocks. They are charging residents annual fees of thousands of euro in some instances to provide services such as roads and water, which are normally the responsibility of local authorities. This places an extra financial burden on people who already find themselves in considerable debt. The management companies should not be charged with responsibility for services that were heretofore those of local authorities, namely, roads, water, sewerage and public lighting. The Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ahern, will be familiar with these issues in his constituency of Cork East. This matter must be addressed.</P>
    <?oasys _cl11.5- ?><P>Senator Cox made a good point in respect of rent supplement, as I did in my initial contribution. Rent supplement costs the State &euro;400 million per annum. Approximately 60,000 tenants in private rented accommodation avail of this payment. It is a direct transfer of money from the State to private landlords, some of whom have received generous concessions via tax breaks. They are benefiting twice. We have continually fought to abolish the rent supplement and allowance and replace them with a genuine housing benefit. Senator Coghlan&rsquo;s point on abolishing stage payments was excellent. As the Minister of State knows, stage payments are rampant in the Cork area. Operating the system in one area but not in others is unfair.</P>
    <P>I wished to ask the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, a question on the extension of the tenant purchase scheme to occupiers of two-bedroom houses, which is welcome. Recently, there have been media reports in this regard. While I was in my office, I listened to the Minister of State speak on this issue, which forms part of the <Col N="1925"/>basis of the motion. An Irish-based company has successfully provided affordable housing in the United Kingdom with the construction of a &pound;60,000 house. There is no reason this idea could not be replicated here.</P>
    <P>The company, which brought its expertise and fought tooth and nail with 80 other developers to <Col N="1926"/>win the contract, has won much prestige as a result. Would it not be good if we as public representatives could tell the many thousands of people who are in the trap of being unable to afford homes that they could build homes for &euro;90,000? All it takes is political will.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
   <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State back to the House, refreshed after our short break. In 1990 the Health (Nursing Home) Act was passed by the Oireachtas, coming into force in September 1993. This was intended and proclaimed to be a radical improvement on the old system. The Ombudsman&rsquo;s report contradicts this, however, claiming that the Department and the health boards operated the new system in a way that was against the interests of patients and deprived them of their own money, a serious charge. She also stated that the Department was perfectly aware that its approach was legally unsound. This puts into context the remark on the other side of the House before the break that this was the best kept secret in the Civil Service. It is difficult to believe the political masters of the Civil Service were unaware of the situation, which was so widely flagged and so clear to the Ombudsman.</P>
<Col N="1926"/>
    <P>The doubtful practices listed include the making of regulations containing provisions which are likely to have been against the law, including at least one instance in which the likely invalidity probably had been known in advance. That goes back to the matter I have just raised. Also mentioned is the inclusion in a regulation of a provision which, it appears, was intended from the outset would not be applied. That sounds like sharp practice. A further doubtful practice was the unreasonable prolongation of discussions with the Ombudsman about practices which it appears were known from the outset to be invalid or incorrect. That is unjustifiable prevarication and it is totally disingenuous.</P>
    <P>Finally, there was the failure of some health boards to alter practice, even where the legal advice was that the practice was incorrect and where the Ombudsman had expressed the same opinion. The health boards were advised legally this was inappropriate and the Ombudsman was expressing concern but the practice persists. No defence of ignorance could be entered.</P>
    <P>The Ombudsman&rsquo;s experience of complaints between 1993 and 1999 suggests that the underlying problems of complainants which surfaced prior to September 1993 continued to manifest themselves under this new regime. There were plenty of problems and they were flagged. A serious situation has arisen recently with regard <Col N="1927"/>to the law on statutory rape and at its heart was the question of communication deficits, to put it politely. It seems this also happened here in the Department. That is regrettable and I hope the Bill goes some way towards mending the situation.</P>
    <P>The Bill contains a provision for the recipients of this money to render it back to the State if they do not need it so it can be used by the health service. That may be an honourable thing to do but I hope that no moral pressure will be put on people to do so. I salute those I heard on the radio saying they were grateful to the health services for the way in which their relatives were treated. They also said they would not wish to take this money.</P>
    <P>As I understand it, there is no systematic inspection of public nursing homes for the elderly. If that is the case, such a system should be instituted. While this is not directly germane to the matter, people should be made aware that the development of bedsores among patients in these institutions is absolutely unnecessary and indicates bad nursing practice. Relatives often believe that bedsores are the inevitable consequence of the aged being bedridden but they are not. The matter is a cause for concern and there should be regular inspections of nursing homes.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnMinihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Minihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I join with previous speakers in welcoming the Minister of State and his officials to the House. Just three weeks ago, we discussed ageism. In my contribution, I referred to research that noted the perception that the State does not do enough for older people. I said there was an onus on all of us to take steps to counter ageism, as well as highlighting the positive steps that are being taken specifically for older people. It is hard to know where this Bill and the problem that led to it, fits into all of this.</P>
    <P>The Government fully accepts the Supreme Court decision that the retrospective imposition of charges on fully eligible persons for their publicly-funded, long-term care was unlawful. People with medical cards in public nursing homes, welfare homes or in contract beds which were established subsequently in private nursing homes, were illegally charged. That was the heart of the problem. It is right to establish the legal framework for making repayments to those who were wrongly charged and to pass this Bill as quickly as is reasonable, so that those who are due repayment will receive it as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The unlawful practice that brings us to today&rsquo;s legislation has been rooted in law for over 50 years. Health boards in this country have levelled charges for publicly-funded, long-stay residential care under two sets of regulations &mdash; one dating from 1954 and the other from 1976. Over the years, health boards, with the knowledge of the Department, continued to levy these charges right up to December 2004. At that point, the Department instructed the health boards, on the advice of the Attorney General, to stop these charges on eligible persons.</P>
<Col N="1928"/>
    <P>I commend the T&aacute;naiste on grasping the nettle on an issue that has gone on for decades. Since doing so, the Government has taken reasonable steps to right the wrong. For example, the Government agreed to payments of up to &euro;2,000 to those illegally charged who were alive on 9 December 2004. The Health Service Executive has paid more than &euro;21 million to approximately 11,000 or more individuals under this plan. The Government is to be commended on providing this scheme which is specifically designed to be more attractive than taking litigation in the courts.</P>
    <P>It is correct that repayments to those who are alive, or to their living spouse, will not be subject to income tax, and that those persons in receipt of repayments will retain their current social welfare pensions or allowances and their full eligibility entitlement for medical card status. Furthermore, repayments under the proposed scheme will not be considered when assessing entitlements to subvention.</P>
    <P>Most important is the determination by the Government that the repayment process will be as simple and user-friendly as possible. Ironically, when we were discussing ageism here last month, much was made of the issue of stereotyping. The Irish Senior Citizens Parliament, among others, has warned against any generalisations &mdash; even those motivated by good intentions &mdash; about older people. In considering this Bill, it is difficult not to be mindful of the age and vulnerability of many of those to whom repayments are due. If this makes one guilty of stereotyping, then it is a misdemeanour motivated by a genuine desire on the part of the State to aid vulnerable citizens. One wonders if it is possible to act in such a manner without stereotyping.</P>
    <P>There can be no doubt that avoiding an adversarial, inflexible and enclosed scheme is the right thing to do. Given the circumstances, the State should minimise inconvenience and the legal bill incurred by people wrongly charged. The same consideration should, of course, be given to their families, representatives or estates depending on the circumstances.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that many, if not all, representatives have moved beyond the usual political arguments and have instead focused more readily on the intention of the Bill before us. This is a Bill to introduce a scheme to repay wrongfully imposed charges to eligible persons, and it is right that there is broad political support for it. One aspect that has drawn particular attention is the HSE&rsquo;s procurement process for the logistics of the repayment scheme. The HSE&rsquo;s first procurement process generated many expressions of interest to design and administer the scheme. I understand that the HSE decided to re-run the competition for value-for-money and technical reasons.</P>
    <P>As a public body, the HSE must, and does, manage its procurement processes independently and on objective criteria. A new procurement process was put in place and advertised in the Journal of the European Union last February. The HSE selected its preferred bidder on 1 June and, as we are currently inside the normal 15-day <Col N="1929"/>period when other bidders have the right to lodge objections, I do not wish to comment further at this stage.</P>
    <P Just="Left">Contrary to some views, consideration was given to the involvement of public sector staff in assisting with the administration of the scheme. From what I understand, however, the HSE informed the Department that the time constraints, potential for logistical difficulties and protracted delays made such an option undesirable. Dedicated HSE resources would have to be assigned and HSE staff would have to be specially trained. They would need dedicated supervision and would have to leave their regular duties, which would impact upon regular services. The commencement of the entire repayment scheme could be detrimentally affected, which is something I am sure all Members of the House would rather avoid.</P>
    <P>I welcome the legislation. I commend the Government and, in particular, the T&aacute;naiste on demonstrating the political will and ability finally to tackle this issue, which had rumbled on under a number of Governments. Following the Supreme Court decision, the Cabinet sub-committee considered its implications and correctly decided that money received by the HSE from the unlawful imposition of charges would be repaid. Charging for long-stay care has now been put on a statutory footing under the Health (Amendment) Act 2005, which is being implemented.</P>
    <P>Of great importance to me and my party colleagues is the recognition by the Government that, regrettably, many of those patients due a repayment have varying degrees of mental impairment. It is imperative that the proposed scheme provides appropriate safeguards to prevent fraud. Though unpalatable to conscience, there are those who would exploit persons who receive payments and are not in a position to manage their own financial affairs. In light of this sorry fact, I welcome the legislation&rsquo;s provisions to allow repayments be placed in patient private property or PPP accounts, although this is not the normal understanding of PPPs. I understand these are to be employed to ensure repaid money is used for the benefit of the patient and that the money held in these accounts can be invested on behalf of the patient. The House will no doubt join me in welcoming the statutory framework to protect patients&rsquo; interests, particularly where sizeable repayments are made.</P>
    <P Just="Left">The key, of course, is to simultaneously provide safeguards and autonomy for patients. I was heartened to hear the Department&rsquo;s acceptance that clarity and consistency are needed regarding these PPP accounts and I am interested to hear of Government plans to appoint an independent overseer in regard to the administration of these accounts. I hope the Minister will shed light on this issue. I welcome the Bill and commend the T&aacute;naiste and the Government on their work to address a long-running and thorny problem. I hope that on every Stage it is the concerns and needs of the patient that remain our focus as we progress the Bill.</P>
   </Speaker>
<Col N="1930"/>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Whatever criticisms I might have about the Bill and the mess which preceded it, I sincerely commend the T&aacute;naiste on at least facing the fact and dealing with it. Along the way, we had the less than savoury attempt to hijack people&rsquo;s money through the previous legislation which was struck down by the Supreme Court. Many of us believed at the time that it was unconstitutional and a less than generous response to what was essentially the misappropriation of people&rsquo;s funds, and we welcomed the decision of the Supreme Court to defend what it saw as the property rights of elderly and vulnerable people.</P>
    <P>Lest there be any misunderstanding, I declare a form of interest in that my mother is a patient of long standing in a public hospital for the elderly. She is the possessor of a medical card and is therefore a potential, if the House will excuse the expression, beneficiary of this Bill. I wish to make sure, therefore, that anything I say is not interpreted in any way as being connected to that.</P>
    <P>I previously put on the record my personal view, which is that I see nothing objectionable in asking old people who receive the quality of care that my mother and hundreds of others received in St. Vincent&rsquo;s Hospital in Athy, to make a significant contribution towards the cost of their care if they have some income. That seems reasonable, rational and fair. I have no problem with the principle of the issue. It seems extraordinary that there are some people who have a problem with it, particularly one well-known and noisy late-night radio commentator who seems to believe the idea of asking people to pay was a betrayal of some socialist principle he had discovered but which I never found. I have no problem with the principle. I might quibble with the level of funds left to people, particularly those on the basic level of old age pension, for whom the remaining sum is quite small. While we could have been more generous, that is an issue of detail not principle, and it is not for this Bill.</P>
    <P>In most of the schools of public administration, not just in this State or on this island but perhaps in the English speaking world, this saga will become one of the classic case studies. This country is &mdash; I say this despite all the qualms, quibbles and arguments we have &mdash; governed well in terms of the incorruptibility of public administration, has an extremely effective and functioning democracy, and has a vigorous and assertively independent courts system. How, given all of that, could a debacle of this magnitude have evolved through a succession of Governments?</P>
    <P>The only arguments I have with the present Government in this regard are, first, the extraordinary behaviour of the previous Minister for Health and Children, a matter to which I will return, and, second, the delay in producing the legislation. However, these issues are not central to the point. I question the scale of the debacle and the fact that a major Department, run in those days by a Minister and the health boards, which had well remunerated chief executives, could have been essentially ignorant of the fact that they were extracting vast sums of money <Col N="1931"/>illegally from elderly people, and that nobody noticed for a long time, which I believe.</P>
    <P>I sincerely hope that, since this debacle emerged, the Department of Health and Children and all of the agencies for which it is responsible have taken steps to ensure their charging practices and other legislative functions or activities are grounded in sound legislation. It is the least we can expect from them. It would be nice to hear from the Minister that some systematic adjustment has been made in the Department to ensure such things cannot happen again, and that somebody is encouraged to play devil&rsquo;s advocate and to question in each case whether policy is within the law. That seems a reasonable request.</P>
    <P>That said, I am intrigued as to how we could have had a health strategy which referred to the need for clarity on the question of the entitlements of the elderly while, in the discussions prior to the production of the strategy, the question of how much it would cost to provide proper services for the elderly apparently never arose, or if it did, the question of whether one was entitled to charge them more was never discussed. That is what I must believe. The Minister who was in office at the time assured us that in all the discussions which fed into the health strategy of 2000, the question of the charging of the elderly for services, if it was discussed, was discussed in such a way that the question of whether we were entitled to charge them never arose.</P>
    <P>We then had the universal extension of medical cards to all those over 70 years of age, a decision with which I agree, in spite of some noises from within my own party, apart from anywhere else. It was a sensible decision because the proportion of people over 70 who are outside the means test is so small as to make the process of means testing counterproductive in terms of any kind of cost-benefit analysis. Anyone who listens to older people would know that women in their 70s &mdash; we are referring overwhelmingly to women in this case &mdash; were mostly dependants. They were, therefore, having to manage money in a way they had never had to do previously when their husbands were alive. To add the fear and concern of having to pay for medical bills left people in their later years with an additional and major worry just as their health began to fade a little.</P>
    <P>It was, therefore, a perfectly reasonable policy. However, the fact that it was a good idea does not mean I approve of the bad way it was implemented. Again, I am intrigued as to whether any questions were asked about how much it cost. If no fundamental questions are asked about how much things cost, how in God&rsquo;s name does the Government do its business? If the question of how much things cost arises, the question then arises of where revenue comes from and that should make one look at the legislative and legal basis for charging people. Again, one must express scepticism and wonder that it was not discussed.</P>
    <P>Then there was the Ombudsman&rsquo;s report on charging the children of elderly people for care. This report went to the Department but even it, <Col N="1932"/>which was not directly connected with this issue, did not raise any concerns about the legal basis for charging people. The upshot of all this is that this debacle will become a case study to be examined, parsed and analysed by students of public administration throughout the English speaking world and, perhaps, beyond. There cannot have been many greater debacles in an open and free society where one can readily get information.</P>
    <P>I am intrigued by the determination to have an external agency administer and organise the repayment scheme. The HSE said it would require the diversion of staff and some of its dedicated budget. However, how will the agency or body that has been identified but cannot yet be named be paid? Will some of the money that was due to be allocated to elderly people be used to pay it? If not, will it be paid for with a separate budget? If there is a separate budget, why not give that budget to the HSE to do this job?</P>
    <P>I can only think of one explanation, the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s determined belief that the private sector will always do a better job than the public sector. That belief has driven her for most of her political career. It is regrettable that it is inserted in this Bill. Someday we should have a debate with the T&aacute;naiste about the fact that, despite her ideological determination to foist a privatised health service on us, the most privatised health service in the world is also the most expensive and, in terms of both life expectancy and infant mortality, perhaps the poorest at delivery. I refer to the United States health service.</P>
    <P>I have no hang-ups about who should do this job but I am sceptical about the concept of a non-nationally based agency having some type of mysterious expertise which means it can deal with this issue in a more efficient way than a dedicated group seconded from the HSE. I smell the whiff of ideology running through this. There is a significant, peculiar belief in this country that there are people called experts and that if we could only find them, they would do these jobs far better than the people who are already doing them.</P>
    <P>We deal with this by importing consultants and also in the extraordinary system whereby senior executives of local authorities often must get permission from somebody called &ldquo;the Minister&rdquo;, who in most cases turns out to be a junior official working from the same manual used by the well paid and well qualified local official. However, the Minister is the power and there is a belief that the Minister can do it better. What is needed, in fact, is transparency and accountability at local level and a clearing away of the fog that generally surrounds many local functions, whether they are carried out by the HSE or the local authorities. The excuse one is usually given with regard to any project being carried out by these bodies is that the estimated cost cannot be revealed because the information is commercially sensitive. Later, when it turns out that they got it all wrong, we are told it is because certain things were not adverted to.</P>
    <P>I have long given up on the idea that if a hospital is to be built, we should not have some <Col N="1933"/>idea in advance of the official cost estimate and it should not be published near tender stage because it is commercially sensitive. I believe that is a smokescreen to dilute any level of accountability. It is time we ended it. Instead of going through the rigmarole of two or three levels of approval, we should make the system more transparent and open and, therefore, probably more accountable. In time, it will be more efficient as a body of learning is accumulated at local level, whether it be local authority or health service.</P>
    <P>I wish to comment on the donation of prescribed repayments. There is a valid ethical issue involved in that concept. I am not unhappy that people who have some money should pay for the services being provided to them. The logic of that is that neither the individuals nor their children should benefit from these repayments in terms of their personal affluence. However, the concept of giving money to even a ring-fenced fund to be administered by a HSE that has just awarded its chief executive a &euro;32,000 bonus for running one of the worst health services in Europe is not appealing. Whatever few euro come to my dear mother as a consequence of this and if I and my brothers decide it is to be used for some purpose, we will use it locally and in a way whereby we can ensure it will not add to the already enormous salary of the CEO of the Health Service Executive but to provide a service in the hospital where my mother is receiving care of a quality that would not be available in any privately run institution.</P>

	<P>I am pleased to welcome this Bill. Much has been said about the overcharging of elderly long-stay patients in public nursing homes. Earlier today I watched the debate in my office as I made some notes. It appeared to be a balanced debate. However, I am now of the opinion that it is only somewhat balanced because there is some political point scoring taking place. That saddens me because this issue was a huge political football when it was debated some months ago.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn said the Government was again embarrassed this week with the introduction of this legislation in the House after having been so embarrassed last week. I was away last week on Oireachtas health committee business but I followed what happened. Senator Quinn and other people who think the Government might be embarrassed should note that I sat with Senator Browne on the health committee that considered the Travers report and conducted an intense investigation of its findings. Indeed, the committee sat for months hearing evidence. What I took from Mr. Travers&rsquo;s report was that mistakes were made but that it would be wrong to try to apportion blame to any one particular Government, that the mistake stemmed back over 30 years and all Governments of all persuasions, if one was to apportion blame, would have blame mounted on them. It is wrong to say it is a Government problem and that the Government did not pick up the ball quickly enough.</P>
<Col N="1934"/>
    <P>I take my hat off to the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, who, when she became aware something was wrong, acted quickly and engaged Mr. Travers who worked long hours during the Christmas holiday to provide her with the report. We are at a stage where the Government believes repayment should be made and rightly so. The money illegally taken from elderly patients should be paid back. The amount cited of &euro;1 billion is a large sum in anyone&rsquo;s language, particularly when equated to the overall health budget of &euro;12 billion.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that those persons who were wrongly charged and are still alive, including the estates of persons who were wrongly charged, and have passed on since December 1998, will have every penny taken from them paid back in full. I do not know if account has been taken of inflation or interest paid on the money owed to those involved. Others speakers have said that 20,000 such patients are still alive and between 40,000 and 50,000 will have their estates benefited to the amount outstanding.</P>
    <P>I listened with interest to what Senator Ryan had to say. My aunt died in a public nursing home. Her family has told me that their mother was so well looked after, no money could have bought them the care she got in a private nursing home. They were very pleased. I could say that is one family that will not be looking for whatever money is being repaid to their mother because they were very pleased with the care she was afforded. Where a family does not wish to take the money being repaid for their loved one, it should be able to give it to the institution which looked after that person. Such money would then be given to local institutions in Sligo, Athy, Tullamore, Bantry or wherever the hospital or nursing home is located. I ask the Minister of State to examine that issue because, as Senator Ryan has said, we are putting money back into a big pot and much of it might go on administrative duties rather than helping over-stretched units in which loved ones had been cared for. It is important that local units benefit from whatever money is repaid in the event of a person not taking it, whether the loved one has passed away or is still living and may not need it.</P>
    <P>The important issue is the care of the elderly, and their needs must be to the fore in developing policy in the future. In some cases vulnerable people would have nobody to speak up for them, in other cases where families could speak up, they were afraid to do so in case their loved ones might not get the care and attention they deserved. We should ensure this practice will never happen again. As Senator Ryan has said, other Departments should look at this issue and examine their own codes of practice, particularly payment charges, to ensure they are above board.</P>
    <P>Section 17(2) provides for the recovery of any moneys obtained through fraud or overpayment. Every euro must be repaid correctly and promptly. Given the enormity of the sum outlined earlier, due care must be taken that sums are repaid to the correct person or to those <Col N="1935"/>people&rsquo;s estates. Section 16 which is equally important provides for an appeals mechanism to be put in place for those who believe they may not have been dealt with fairly in the repayment process. Hopefully it will not be necessary to use this section but, if so, at least it exists.</P>
    <P>I am pleased the Bill deals with the unfortunate situation of patients who have a degree of mental or intellectual impairment. It will ensure that where there has been a deterioration in the intellectual capacity of a patient, his or her rights are protected by the use of a patient private property account and that any funds accruing to the patient in this category will be used for the benefit of that individual and that the money can be invested on behalf of the said patient.</P>
    <P>I heard somebody speak of applications made to the agency that will look after the payments that have not been acknowledged. These cases arise where families or people involved in the overcharging are waiting to recoup what has been taken from them. That is wrong because we are dealing with vulnerable people. They should at least be afforded a short letter stating that the application has been received and is being dealt with and that the agency will be contact in due course. Many of those people may have nothing else to worry about and may sit or lie all day long wondering if they filled in the form correctly or if it was received.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill and look forward to the subsequent Stages.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy S&eacute;an Power, to the House to debate this important Bill. That the Bill is before the House is a miracle in itself given the number of major health Bills that go through the House each year. It is amazing that the Minister and her lame-duck Government was able to have it here at all. Apart from amending legislation, on average there has been one health Bill per year over the past three or four years. We waited ten years for the Medical Practitioners Bill, five years for the Pharmacy Bill, and legislation dealing with the HIQA and nursing is pending.</P>
    <P>While waiting for the Minister to publish this Bill we were told the delay was due to the fact that outside companies were quoting &euro;50 million to administer the scheme. I do not accept this argument. Given that it has taken the Health Service Executive five months to advertise for the first tender for the provision of the service, it was a ludicrous excuse for the delay in making the repayments.</P>
    <P Just="Left">What makes the excuse even more extraordinary is the fact that the HSE, despite the Minister&rsquo;s pessimistic and strangely negative views, is quite capable of administering the scheme. By proposing to employ consultants to undertake the repayments and by providing in the Bill for the recruitment of external administrators, the Minister is showing contempt for the HSE. In true Fianna F&aacute;il-Progressive Democrats style the Government is adding &euro;50 million to the list of <Col N="1936"/>incidents of taxpayer&rsquo;s money that has been squandered, including the PPARS fiasco a few months ago. &ldquo;Easy come, easy go&rdquo;, will be remembered as the slogan of the Fianna F&aacute;il-Progressive Democrats coalition. What is it that makes the Government embrace one financial fiasco after another and for how long can we continue to take such wanton and deliberate waste? Considering the repayments will cost the taxpayer in excess of &euro;1 billion, how can the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children contemplate spending an extra &euro;50 million on outside consultants when the HSE is paid, willing and able to do the job? This defies logic and makes the public wonder at the wastefulness of this incompetent Government. The T&aacute;naiste should be here in person to explain why she has squandered many millions of taxpayers money as have other Departments in the Cabinet.</P>
   <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">8 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
    <P>In view of the fact that in February 2005 the HSE began to collect information on those who may be entitled to repayments it is surprising the T&aacute;naiste still seems intent on bringing in consultants to administer the scheme. The HSE has already competently managed the payment of over &euro;20 million in <i>ex gratia </i>payments to over 10,000 people. The information, structure and expertise are all present in the HSE.</P>
    <?oasys _cl10.7- ?><P>The T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s insistence on hiring outside consultants can only be interpreted as a vote of no confidence in the relevant section of the HSE. If it cannot manage a reasonably straightforward task such as this repayment scheme how will it cope with national health emergencies? There is evidence it is not coping with the crowds at accident and emergency units. Moreover incompetence has been exhibited in dealing with other areas of the health service such as providing adequate resources to home help and carers. All of this proves the Government&rsquo;s negligence towards and disrespect for the elderly in our society.</P>
    <P Just="Left">I will not accept the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s word that the HSE is incapable. It is the Government that is incapable. We should point the finger at the T&aacute;naiste, whom the dunce&rsquo;s hat fits well. The T&aacute;naiste, in a burst of uncharacteristic haste, rushed through the Health Act 2004 which established the HSE and we are now paying the price. What was wrong with elected Members, the voice of the people, being on health boards? She has given them a mere talking shop role in the new HSE. People elected to local authorities all over the country are frustrated at the lack of interest shown by the Department of Health and Children in their views. I have received feedback, and I am sure my colleagues on the Government side of the House have heard the same, suggesting local elected representatives feel they do not have a role in the process. They say their piece but officials are anxious to get away and so on. I was a local representative for 19 years and it was always important to listen to the people on the ground, which is something this Government is failing to do.</P>

    <P>There is nothing perfect about this Bill. The explanatory memorandum is totally inadequate and is almost identical to the press release announcing the publication of the Bill. The purpose of the explanatory memorandum is to explain the Bill section by section. Given that the legislation has taken a year to prepare, the lack of clarity in the so-called explanatory memorandum is inexcusable. What chances have the elderly got of gaining information from such a slipshod document? This does not apply only to my side of the House, I know members on the Government&rsquo;s side are very disappointed with it also.</P>
    <P>My colleague Senator Browne has studied the various sections of the Bill that require amendment and, like the explanatory memorandum, are far from perfect. I will not waste time by going over ground covered by Senator Browne, Senator Ryan and other Members from this side of the House. In the interests of the elderly in State care every &ldquo;i&rdquo; must be dotted and every &ldquo;t&rdquo; crossed. Their hard work and sacrifice brought the country to its current position of financial strength and we owe them no less. These are the people who slaved in difficult times rearing large families and they have been treated shabbily. It is important that the Bill looks after them properly. Many of these people experience great anxiety, indeed some went to their graves worrying, and this Government has done little but neglect them.</P>

   <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly"><NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome this legislation and thank the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Se&aacute;n Power, for the interest he has shown in caring for the elderly since his appointment to the office. The Minister had the opportunity to see some of the work relating to this issue in various institutions on a visit to County Clare. He would have been made aware of the dissatisfaction many people felt about this episode.</P>
    <P Just="Left">In a climate of financial buoyancy it is perhaps understandable that we have forgotten that during the period referred to by Senator Bannon many health boards were under severe financial pressure and had overspent on their budgets. At the time the Government made strenuous efforts to deal with overspending by the health boards and there was an outcry from the public. The Government had to do so, however, to deal with the financial crisis in which it found itself. I was in the Government from 1987 to 1989 and I am aware of the problems that were experienced in trying to bring the country&rsquo;s finances under control. It is easy to talk about the success of the health boards today but they ran up huge debts back then and it was in this light that severe restrictions were introduced in order to get them back in shape financially.</P>
    <P>I recall requests from public representatives in many constituencies seeking the abolition of the health boards. They wanted the system to return to the control of the local authorities, where the changes were made in the 1970s. Many people felt there was insufficient local democracy in the health boards. Regardless, a situation developed wherein people were charged for services for which they should not have been charged. I will not go through that area again, it has been debated here previously.</P>
    <P>It is important that we now press ahead with the legislation. I received refund application forms from the HSE during the week for people who contacted me and feel entitled to refunds for some of the payments they made. I recall the small hospital in Kilrush being closed <i>circa</i> 1987 because of the financial constraints on the health board at the time. A committee of local people got together, and with some small assistance from the national lottery, reopened the 21-bed institution and got it back on course again. They now have 55 patients in that hospital, which is run as a charitable organisation by local people, and are looking to extend the facility.</P>
<Col N="1939"/>
    <P>When those efforts were being made by the local voluntary committee to reopen the institution, there was substantial public response and an enormous voluntary effort provided to enable the get the hospital on the way. Televisions were provided by local people, a painting committee painted the entire institution from top to bottom, the building was modernised and with a very small donation by the national lottery, it has been providing a service for people who would not otherwise have been able to avail of such a service.</P>
    <P>People are entitled to their refunds, but they might think seriously now about making donations to various institutions which have provided a very good service over the years. They are still finding things difficult and we all know the great cost these days of providing attention for an elderly person in one of the private or public institutions. Perhaps when the refunds are made, many people entitled to refunds might consider making donations towards the continuation of institutions in their own localities, similar to the hospital in Kilrush. We have many such institutions in County Clare which are dependent on some assistance from the national lottery or from the Department of Health and Children, but which are also greatly reliant on local voluntary efforts, church gate and door to door collections and fund-raising events such as walks, to support the installation of various equipment. When the refunds are made, perhaps some encouragement might be given to people, by tax incentives or otherwise, to make donations to these institutions which would help them to continue providing services at great cost, and provide extra accommodation which will need to be provided, especially in some of the western areas where there will be a continuing need for more beds. Difficulties will arise again. We are currently in a healthy financial position but it might not always be that way, and since we are in such a position, those who benefit from this legislation might consider making some charitable donations towards those institutions to enable them continue the work they are undertaking.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State and the Bill, which seems to set up a model administrative system for the repayments. Undoubtedly there are some uncanny echoes in this episode, now going back a couple of years, of what happened last week, where the constitutionality of a provision that has been there for a long time was called into question.</P>
    <P Just="Left">In politics, one cannot often be responsible for the crises which come at one, but one should be judged on how one handles them. Regarding this issue, the T&aacute;naiste was not long in office when the alarm bells started ringing, and she has handled the matter well. There seems to be a broad consensus in the House that some deduction for payments for care were justified, but equally that they had to be on a clear legal basis. One could not have a situation where payments were being deducted on dubious legal authority. The first Bill <Col N="1940"/>produced was referred to the Supreme Court, a sensible precaution by the President to judge its constitutionality. The thinking then had to be revised and this repayments scheme instituted. Whatever criticisms people may have about practices of successive Governments, I do not think there can be any serious criticism of the system of repayment now being put in place.</P>
    <P>I get a little tired of the rather low level political charges which characterise the contributions of Senator Bannon. I would like to think we could debate these matters calmly, and while I might be tempted, I am not going to go into instances of incompetence, real or alleged, under other Governments. I do not know if the public wants that. It wants a system whereby if something has gone wrong, it will be put right as efficiently and expeditiously as possible.</P>
    <P>I note there is a sort of Pavlovian ideological reaction on another side of the House when there is any question of getting some outside or private firm, with experience in a particular field, to manage a function. I have a pragmatic attitude in most instances, though certain core functions should be left to the public sector, but I do not believe this scheme of repayments necessarily falls into that category. Much play was made of the Government&rsquo;s use of consultants. I regret in some ways &mdash; this is true of all governments &mdash; the loss of confidence in decision-making, or of one&rsquo;s own ability within one&rsquo;s own departmental resources to take decisions without having to bring in consultants to double-check matters. However, fairly large sums of money are involved and I suppose people, especially civil servants, but also politicians, want to be protected from precisely the charges of incompetence which were flung across the House a few moments ago.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, I do not think that employing consultants necessarily protects a government from things going wrong. One can see that in this country and in Britain, with regard to information technology brought in to perform certain tasks, and perhaps being asked to do tasks which are too ambitious for the state of the technology. The marketing people do not honestly admit that. It is a real problem that needs to be reflected upon. If I was in the Minister&rsquo;s position, my instinct would be to employ the minimum of consultants to save the public purse. One must ask if in certain circumstances that might be a false economy. If one makes a decision without full knowledge of the facts it may end up costing more. That is a matter for reflection and self-critical debate in the public service and political system. It must not be simplified by heated political charges about one system or another.</P>
    <P>I liked the devolved system of decision-making of the former health boards, introduced by Erskine Childers in the 1970s. Perhaps it was not functioning efficiently and it was time to change the process. I do not go along with the populist argument that it is wrong for the man who is running the health service on a day-to-day basis to get any kind of bonus. He is running a large and vital public service. The petty begrudgery, loved <Col N="1941"/>by the popular media, will get us nowhere in this matter.</P>
    <P>Senator Daly spoke about the closure of small hospitals in 1987 and 1988 due to financial stringency. Many of them could now have a function as convalescent step-down facilities for acute hospitals. Just as we are reopening railway lines, we could reopen these hospitals for specific functions which they are capable of performing.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome this long overdue Bill which I want speedily enacted so that the repayments scheme can get under way in the near future. I hope the energy put into this debate, with the political excitement and the public anger about nursing home repayments, will be matched in the broader debate on care for the elderly. Care for the elderly is not just about nursing homes or securing a bed for an elderly relative in a local nursing home. We must ensure the elderly can be looked after in their communities and with their families for as long as possible through the carer&rsquo;s allowance and other grants and schemes. A national debate is needed on care of the elderly. Although the Bill is important in righting a wrong that was done, the real wrong is our inability to allow the maximum number of elderly people to reside where they prefer, which is in their communities with their families or in their homes.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>The real wrong that is being done is that unfortunately this money will now be used to facilitate families whose loved ones are deceased. In many cases the money would be better spent in the provision of services and facilities for the care of the elderly. It is the first time since I was elected to the House that I have not welcomed a Bill. While I recognise its necessity to address certain technical issues, it is sad that this kind of money is committed. In some cases, it is seen as a second SSIA. Families concerned are wondering how to split up the proceeds from parents who are long since deceased and where they will take their holidays with the money. It brings out the worst trait in human behaviour. It will work against the provision of the services needed for care for the elderly.</P>

   <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank those Senators who participated in the debate. I welcome the broad support from most Members for the introduction of the legislation. The enactment of the Bill will be a key milestone in ensuring repayments will be made as promptly as possible to all those who were wrongly charged for publicly funded long-stay care. Senator Quinn accused the State of stealing this money. I am not happy with the use of the word &ldquo;stealing&rdquo; in this case. My understanding of stealing is that it refers to someone taking something without the knowledge of the owner.</P>

<Col N="1942"/>
   <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>While there was no clear legal basis for the practice, it went on for a long time. It was done in good faith. The majority of the people receiving care did not object to making the contribution towards the cost of their care and were happy to make that small contribution. The Government fully accepts the judgment of the Supreme Court and on foot of that, the Bill was introduced.</P>
    <P>The legislation will provide a framework to enable repayments to be made to all those alive and the estates of those who died since 9 December 1998. They will be refunded the charges from the time they were charged to 9 December 2004 when they ceased.</P>
    <P>In recognition of the special needs of those in long-stay care, the Bill will put in place appropriate safeguards to protect those who may not have the functional capacity to manage their financial affairs. This will prevent resort to wardship or the use of widespread psychiatric assessments which could substantially delay repayments being made. The scheme will apply to fully eligible people, that is medical card holders and those aged over 70 years with effect from July 2001. To ensure repayments are made in an equitable manner, those without a medical card on admission to long-stay care but who fell within the income means threshold for a medical card, will be regarded as having full eligibility for the purpose of the scheme. It will include those patients in publicly funded long-stay care, in public-contracted beds in private nursing homes and in receipt of inpatient services in community-based facilities.</P>
    <P>The tendering process for design of the repayment scheme was implemented. The Health Service Executive decided on the appointment of a preferred service provider at a meeting of its board on 1 June 2006. No information can be made public on the preferred service provider until an interval of 14 days has elapsed. No substantial query or objection has been made by any of the unsuccessful bidders.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan asked why a private company was appointed. Since it was the State which took the money from these patients, it is important to have an independent party involved in administering the scheme. Not only does it reassure the public but it is important the scheme is introduced quickly. Members have been critical of the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children on the appointment of an outside company. The Health Service Executive indicated it is not in a position to administer the scheme. It is not its core function anyway. Some Members believe 200 people in the executive who could do this task are sitting in a room, scratching themselves, looking for work . It was important to get a company with experience in large repayment schemes. This is the largest repayment scheme undertaken in the history of the State. It is important that the money is given to the patients affected as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>Senator Mansergh summed up Senator Bannon&rsquo;s contribution fairly well. It is with some reluctance that I would even reply to Senator <Col N="1943"/>Bannon, and this notion of throwing out any figure one likes so that it might stick. Senator Bannon wondered why anyone would contemplate paying &euro;50 million to an outside company to administer the scheme. The good news for Senator Bannon is that we are not contemplating it either.</P>
    <P>The application process, as I mentioned earlier, will be as simple as possible. January 2008 is the deadline for submitting applications, not for the making of repayments. Valid applications will be paid until all have been dealt with. Fully eligible persons currently in care and those who have left care recently will be readily identified by records held by the institution. The HSE will ensure applications are submitted on behalf of those in the care of the HSE who are unable to make the application themselves due to a physical or mental disability, or ill health.</P>
    <P>The application process will identify the personal representative in the case of estates and will also provide the necessary documentation to help protect the State against fraudulent claims. Applications will be processed as quickly as possible after they are received and the uppermost consideration will be to ensure that a relevant person receives the full amount of repayment due to him or her.</P>
    <P>Consideration was given to the inclusion of a deadline for making repayments. However, a deadline was not included for practical reasons, especially due to instances where patients were in long-stay care over an extended period of time and possibly in multiply institutions. To date, the HSE has received 22,000 registrations of interest for repayment. In order to ensure that those eligible for repayments are aware of their entitlements an extensive communications process will be developed around the scheme and this will include television, national and local radio and newspaper advertisements including advice and assistance on how to apply.</P>
    <P>The scheme contains a provision to enable those due repayments under the scheme to donate all or part of the repayment specifically for one-off improvements in public health services for older people and persons with disabilities. The fund will only be used to provide for improvements which would not otherwise have been met by an allocation from the Minister for Finance or any other Minister.</P>
    <P>The scheme includes an independent transparent, user-friendly appeals process and the Minister will appoint suitably qualified independent appeals officers to consider appeals. Regular reports on the operation of the appeals process will be laid before the Oireachtas. All applicants will be advised of their right to appeal and how to make an appeal, and applicants will also be informed of their right to bring a complaint to the Office of the Ombudsman.</P>
    <P>The overall cost arising from the long-stay charges repayment scheme has been estimated at &euro;1 billion. An appropriate allocation for 2006 will be made when legislation is passed by the Houses <Col N="1944"/>of the Oireachtas and the balance will be required in 2007 and 2008.</P>
    <P Just="Left">If I have time, I will deal briefly with a number of queries raised. Senator Browne asked about the tendering process and wondered whether the second process would be any better. While I cannot give him figures here today, the HSE has indicated there is a significant saving by having the second tendering process and that it will work out much cheaper than was originally proposed in the first round. On the possibility of a challenge, we live in a democracy and anyone who wants to challenge the legislation is entitled to do so. We are happy that the tendering process was fair and above board.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris expressed concern that we had not used the word &ldquo;regret&rdquo;. We very much regret what happened, that we took money from people without the proper legal framework to do so. We are sorry for that. While I suppose words are one way of expressing regret, repaying them might be appreciated all the more and that is what we are doing.</P>
    <P>The processing of applications will begin this month. There will be no delay. The money is being provided and we have no wish to delay the process of the applicants receiving their money. We hope that this process can be done as quickly as possible. In reply to Senator Feeney, the repayments will also include interest in accordance with the consumer price index. I hope I have dealt with most of the queries raised.</P>

   <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>With your permission, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, I wish to share time with my colleague, Senator Bradford.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Is that agreed? Agreed.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>The purpose of raising this matter on the Adjournment is to get further information on the current position <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> compensation, primarily for producers but also for contractors, for the sugar beet sector. We have had many debates and arguments in this House about how the Irish sugar beet industry ended up going into decline and closing, and we on all sides of the House very much regret what happened.</P>
    <P>It was disclosed a few of months ago that a number of funds would be put in place for distribution from the European Union to those who were involved in the sugar beet industry in this country. There is a fund of in excess of &euro;140 million for restructuring which includes a proviso that a minimum of 10% be given to producers and contractors, and a &euro;45 million fund for diversification. In addition, of course, the single farm payment applies for producers into the future.</P>
    <P>Those involved, as farmers in producing the crop and as contractors in extracting and transporting sugar beet from different parts of the country to the two last plants in Carlow and Mallow, have a considerable interest in knowing how exactly those two funds will be distributed. The Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Coughlan, has tried to say that she is not in full control of this matter but my understanding is that the final decision rests clearly with her. I have been told that in late summer or early autumn a decision will be made and that at present she is in receipt of representations from different interested groups and parties.</P>
    <P>It is my firm view that virtually all of both funds should go to the producers and the contractors rather than to Greencore, which appears to have an entitlement to the restructuring fund of over &euro;140 million. It would be a travesty if the company which has played a major part in the downfall of the sugar industry in this country were to be the main beneficiary of the restructur<Col N="1946"/>ing fund. I urge the Minister to ensure that is not the case, and that the primary producers and contractors would benefit most from any restructuring fund when it is eventually disbursed.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator John Paul Phelan for sharing time with me. I share the sentiments he has expressed in terms of how the compensation should be allocated. The Minister has advised that decisions may not be made before the autumn. The one issue that was clarified by Brussels is that a minimum of 10% of the restructuring fund must be given to producers and contractors. We certainly want to see that 10% more than exceeded and the closer the figure is to 100%, the better.</P>
    <P>I seek clarification from the Minister of State on one issue. The Minister spoke on this point previously, as did the EU agriculture Commissioner when she addressed the D&aacute;il some weeks ago. Under the disastrous agreement signed in Brussels to shut down the Irish sugar industry, we also appear to have agreed to a provision whereby, if the Mallow plant is not physically razed to the ground, the &euro;145 million restructuring fund will not be paid in full and a deduction would be made from it. This is inexplicable and the matter requires to be urgently reviewed</P>
    <P>A declaration was made at the last EU summit by the Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, and his colleagues across Europe that one of their political and economic priorities for the current year would be the support of alternative energy projects. While that statement was laudable, it appears that European Ministers for agriculture have signed up to an agreement to the effect that farmers in the State would be penalised if we tried to use our decommissioned sugar factories for the purpose of producing alternative energy. We could validly ask if some derogation could be provided from this agreement. The majority of the fund of &euro;145 million must be paid to the farming community which produced the sugar beet and the contractors whose livelihoods have been ruined.</P>
    <P>The Mallow plant could be used for the production of alternative energy. This possibility is now being examined by Cork County Council. The IFA has also set up a committee to investigate alternative energy projects. All of this is welcome but it is impossible to defend the decision that in order to claim the full amount of compensation we must not just decommission the factory in Mallow &mdash; which has already happened but raze it to the ground and return the area to a greenfield site. I urge the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, to use his good offices and that of his senior Ministers to try to bring about a change of heart in the European Commission in terms of that particular decision.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State is aware from his current and former jobs that the aim of the sugar proposals was to reduce the production of white sugar in Europe. Ireland is now reluctantly playing its part in that respect. We will no longer produce white sugar and our sugar industry is, <Col N="1947"/>effectively, finished. The factory has been decommissioned for the purpose of processing white sugar but it defies logic that a factory which with a certain degree of modification could lead the production of biofuels in this country must be knocked to the ground in order to qualify for full compensation. I ask the Minister of State to reflect on this matter and see if we could make some sense out of that nonsensical provision.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>On behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture and Food, I welcome this opportunity to give Members an update on the implementation arrangements for the compensation package negotiated in the context of the reform of the EU sugar regime.</P>
    <P>The new sugar regime comes into effect from 1 July 2006. The compensation package as a whole is worth an estimated &euro;310 million to Irish stakeholders. The package is composed of three elements. The first element is the compensation to beet growers of up to 64% of the reduction in the minimum price for beet. This compensation, which is being incorporated in the existing single payment scheme and is payable from 2006, is worth approximately &euro;123 million to Irish beet growers over the next seven years.</P>
    <P>The second element of the compensation package is the restructuring aid covering the economic, social and environmental costs of restructuring the sugar industry, involving factory closure and renunciation of quota. In Ireland&rsquo;s case, this will be worth up to &euro;145 million. The third element of the package is the diversification aid, which is worth almost &euro;44 million in Ireland&rsquo;s case. This will be drawn down in the framework of a national restructuring programme to be elaborated in due course.</P>
    <P>Currently, interest is focused on the second element of the compensation package &mdash; the restructuring aid &mdash; which is to be drawn down by means of an aid application to be submitted by the sugar processor following consultations with the beet growers. Following Greencore&rsquo;s decision to cease sugar production, it is anticipated that the company will submit an application for restructuring aid in the first year of the new sugar regime. The relevant Council regulation requires that such an application, including a detailed restructuring plan for the industry, must be submitted by 31 July 2006. A decision on the granting of the aid must then be made by the member state by 30 September 2006 at the latest. The timescale for implementing the restructuring scheme is very tight where restructuring takes places in the first year of the new regime, as in Ireland&rsquo; s case.</P>
    <P>The Government is committed to ensuring that the restructuring aid is implemented in a fair and equitable manner and strictly in accordance with the relevant EU regulations. The Government has appointed lndecon International Economic Consultants to provide it with independent expert advice on matters relating to the implementation of the restructuring aid. Last month the Depart<Col N="1948"/>ment issued a public call for submissions from interested parties in regard to the implementation of the aid and these submissions will be subject to scrutiny by Indecon. The deadline for the receipt of submissions was 2 June.</P>
    <P>The Council regulation provides that at least 10% of the aid shall be reserved for sugar beet growers and machinery contractors who have worked under contract with their agricultural machinery for the growers. That percentage may be increased by the member state after consultation with interested parties, provided that an economically sound balance between the elements of the restructuring plan is ensured. A decision on the percentage, taking account of all relevant factors, will be made in due course after the consultation process has been completed, the submissions have been examined by Indecon and following the adoption in the near future of the Commission regulation laying down the detailed implementation rules.</P>
    <P>Senator Bradford raised the issue of the decommissioning of the Mallow plant under the terms of the EU package. He is aware that if the plant is not fully decommissioned, 25% of the aid will be lost. There is no consensus to the effect that this is the approach that should be taken.</P>
    <P>While I have not been briefed, I am aware from my interest in alternative fuels that there is a question mark over the viability of sugar beet as a raw material for ethanol production. That is the reason we are losing our sugar industry. We had the option of continuing to grow sugar beet at the new price that would be available to us from the European Commission but it was deemed to be unviable by Irish beet growers. That is why major consensus was achieved in terms of adopting the package.</P>

    <sTitle>Search and Rescue Service.</sTitle>
   <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon. I wish to raise this important matter which I have previously raised in the House. It relates to the provision of a station house at Doolin, County Clare, for the coastguard search and rescue service. This issue was brought into sharp focus last November when four young men lost their lives in the Atlantic ocean off the Clare coast. While it is very clear that the existence of a modern station house would not have saved their lives, it would certainly have helped to alleviate the trauma suffered by the rescue team and the families of the victims who were involved in a very prolonged search for the bodies. This search went on for over a week, creating major difficulties, particularly for the rescue team and the families and members of the public who assisted in the search.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State is aware that there was great momentum to resolve this issue, which has been ongoing for over eight years, in the aftermath of this tragedy. I thank the Minister of State for his involvement, for meeting with the delegation from the group in Doolin and for the interest he has shown in this case. He is aware of the complication that arose in respect of the <Col N="1949"/>identification of a site, which has now been resolved and, more importantly, the purchase of this site. The Department of Finance, through the Office of Public Works, is responsible for the purchase of this site. I understand that the coast guard has already assigned a budget towards the construction of the station house on the site. Therefore, the major issue concerns the acquisition of the site.</P>
    <P>There are a number of volunteers involved in the service who work tirelessly throughout the year. They are called out on rescue missions approximately 30 times a year, which is a fairly high call-out rate across the network of rescue services around the country. The Minister of State will know from his meeting with the group that the current building dates back to the 1920s and contains no toilets, showers or a command station for the effective operation of a rescue mission. The building is subject to flooding and volunteers are sometimes forced to sandbank doors, which is unacceptable.</P>
    <P>Critically, there is no capacity to store the rescue boat or any other rescue equipment on the site. The lifeboat is currently stored one and a half miles away from the launch point in a location that means it must be drawn through the main street. At this time of the year, Doolin is very busy with tourists. It is blatantly obvious that if there was a requirement to launch the boat in an emergency, critical time would be lost in getting it to the launch point. I do not wish to be alarmist but this may lead to loss of life, which might not occur if the boat could be launched from the nearest position. This is probably one of the critical issues. Volunteers are seeking the facilities but the critical factor is the fact that the lifeboat is not located at the launch site.</P>
    <P Just="Left">I am aware that there have been various complications in respect of the identification and valuation of the site. As the Minister of State is aware, a specific site has now been identified. The landowner has agreed to sell the site and I understand that money has been set aside by the coast guard out of its budget to build the facility. All that is needed is for the Department of Finance to purchase the site. I ask the Minister of State to do all he can to create the impetus within the Department to resolve this matter. We are now heading into the summer period. The good weather we have enjoyed, particularly over the last weekend, has brought into sharp focus the dangers that exist, particularly given the greater use of the Atlantic and the central role played by the search and rescue service in Doolin in protecting the people who enjoy the water facilities in this area. I hope that the Minister of State can indicate where matters stand in respect of this project and I thank him for the efforts he has made during his period in office.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Dooley for raising this issue. The Commissioners of Public Works work closely with the Irish Coast Guard service in respect of the provision of suitable facilities around the country. In this regard, they have been seeking a site for Doolin coast guard station <Col N="1950"/>for some time. This has proved to be a long drawn out process due to the lack of availability of suitable sites. A site has now been identified and the Commissioners of Public Works inform me that their valuers are in negotiation with the landowner in question in respect of a conditional offer for sale received from him. It is difficult to predict at this stage how long these negotiations could take. However, I wish to assure Senator Dooley that every effort is being made to bring the negotiations to a successful conclusion.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his reply.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Does Senator Dooley have a question for the Minister of State?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>Depending on which side one talks to, it has been suggested that there has only been vague contact between an individual in the Department of Finance negotiating on its behalf and an agent representing the landowner. I do not know the departmental official in question. Time has elapsed. I am aware that the Minister of State understands the need to ensure that there are no further incidents which could lead to loss of life as a result of the lack of this facility. I am aware that money is involved and that the State has a duty to the taxpayer to ensure it gets the best value for money but what is the best value for money at this stage?</P>
    <P>We are heading into a period where a life could be lost in the time it takes to bring the lifeboat from its current location to the launch point. If such a tragedy occurs, I have no doubt money will be thrown at the problem, the valuers pushed aside and a decision made. Given that he is responsible for the Office of Public Works, I ask the Minister of State to ensure this decision is taken. I am not suggesting he does anything improper in respect of State finances but the matter must be weighed up in terms of the value of a life, the potential for loss of life and the associated costs. I appeal to the Minister of State to work to bring about the acquisition of this site without delay.</P>

    <sTitle>Tax Code.</sTitle>
   <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House. I tabled a parliamentary question through Deputy Paul Keogh last March in respect of the tax relief available for people paying maintenance for their children. I highlighted a case involving a married individual who fathered a child outside marriage and pays maintenance for that child but does not receive tax relief. I am now confused because the reply to my question informed me that there was no tax relief in respect of maintenance payments. However, the <Col N="1951"/>person tells me that friends of his who pay maintenance for their children are availing of tax relief.</P>
    <P>Are these people categorised in different tax bands? Why am I being told on the ground that people are receiving lump sums in the region of &euro;4,000 while I am officially informed that they are not receiving such tax relief? Why is the individual to whom I referred being told that if he was single or separated and paying maintenance, he would be entitled to some tax relief but the fact that he is still married but paying maintenance for a child fathered outside marriage means he cannot receive tax relief? I believed my parliamentary question would clarify matters but it has only confused matters. The Department of Finance is saying one thing but the exact opposite appears to be happening on the ground.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that there is no tax relief for maintenance payments towards the upkeep of children, including children born outside marriage. The effect is that the payments are treated in the same way as if the taxpayer was providing for the child out of his or her after-tax income. The position in respect of the tax treatment of maintenance payments for separated spouses is more complex.</P>
   <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">9 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
    <P>A one-parent tax credit can be claimed by a single parent, regardless of whether he or she is widowed, single, deserted, separated or divorced, who is not living with another person as man and wife and who has a qualifying child resident with him or her for the whole or part of the relevant tax year. A qualifying child means a child who is born during that tax year or is under 18 years of age at its beginning, is over 18 years of age and receiving full-time education or undergoing a full-time training course for a trade or profession for a minimum of two years or is permanently incapacitated, either physically or mentally, from maintaining himself or herself and becomes so before reaching 21 years of age or has become permanently incapacitated after reaching that age but while he or she has been receiving full-time education.</P>
    <P>The payment or non-payment of maintenance by such a single parent is not a determining factor in the entitlement to the one parent family tax credit. Senators may also wish to note that as a result of an entitlement to this credit, a person may also be entitled to an enhanced standard rate tax band valued at &euro;36,000 in 2006. This is &euro;4,000 greater than the standard band for a single person. A person in receipt of the one parent family tax credit in respect of a child who is incapaci<Col N="1952"/>tated may also be entitled to receive the incapacitated child tax credit, which is worth &euro;1,500 in 2006. The latter is not dependent on receipt of the former.</P>
    <P>The tax treatment of maintenance payments for separated spouses is a complex area and I hope Senators will bear with me as I try to explain the position clearly. In general, separated couples are treated for tax purposes as if they are unmarried. However, where a legally binding maintenance arrangement is in place, they may elect to be treated for tax purposes as if the separation had not taken place. This election is not a right of one spouse and must be claimed jointly by both spouses. Where such an election is received, the couple continues to be treated as a married couple for tax purposes and any maintenance payments have no tax consequences.</P>
    <P>The general position in the case of legally enforceable maintenance agreements is that where the couple is treated for tax purposes as if unmarried, a tax deduction for maintenance payments for the benefit of his or her spouse is granted to the paying spouse, but the payments are taxed in the hands of the receiving spouse. However, if the spouses jointly elect to be treated for tax purposes as if the separation had not taken place, the payer does not receive a tax deduction for the maintenance payments and the receiving spouse is not taxable on them. Non-legally binding maintenance payments are not taxable in the hands of the receiving spouse but the paying spouse cannot claim a tax deduction for them.</P>
    <P>The Government acknowledges the continuing cost pressures on parents, particularly those with young children, and that the direct expenditure approach is the main way in which the State provides support to parents. The Government has substantially increased child benefit since entering office in 1997. Senators may be interested to hear that overall expenditure on child benefit has increased by 279%, from &euro;506 million in 1997 to almost &euro;2 billion in 2006.</P>
    <P>A new early child care supplement of &euro;1,000 in a full year for each child up to his or her sixth birthday was announced in the budget. This payment will commence shortly and is exempt from income tax. With the increases in child benefit announced in the budget, this will bring the amount a family will receive in direct financial support for each of the first two children under the age of six years to &euro;2,800 per year, equivalent to more than &euro;50 per week. This will be even higher where a family has more than two children under the age of six years.</P>
