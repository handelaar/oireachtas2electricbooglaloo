	<?oasys _ic14- ?><P Just="Left">Before the House begins its business we will take tributes to the late former Taoiseach, Charles J. Haughey. The Leader of the House will contribute to the tributes, as will Senator Mansergh, because of his close association with the former Taoiseach down the years. The tributes will be confined to those Senators as well as to the leader of each group in the House.</P><?oasys _ic0- ?>

   <Title>Death of Former Taoiseach: Expressions of Sympathy.</Title>
   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for his judgment in this matter. As Leader of the House, I wish, first, to do the proper and homely thing, which everybody does in such circumstances, particularly the Irish, and that is to pass sympathy to Mrs. Maureen Haughey and her four grown-up children, and particularly our colleague in the other House, Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey, on the death of her husband and their father, former <Col N="2"/>Deputy Charles J. Haughey, who was Taoiseach for many years. It is proper that we should do that.</P>
    <P>Writers over the next few weeks, and ultimately history, will balance the scales of justice in respect of the late Taoiseach&rsquo;s career. As someone who served in Cabinet with him for six years &mdash; five as Minister for Education and some months as Minister for Health &mdash; I can confirm that many of the statements made about him in the conduct of his daily business were, quite simply, not correct. It was said that he was autocratic in Cabinet and people were not allowed to have their say. He certainly cut off waffle. If anyone attempted to proceed with waffle, he or she was told where to get off, and why not? Waffle does not serve anybody well. However, he certainly allowed everyone to have a voice.</P>
    <P>For me in particular, the former Taoiseach gave me my political chance. He opened the door. I had no experience of Cabinet. While I had Front Bench experience, I had never served at Cabinet. A fellow Minister who was disquieted by my elevation said to the Taoiseach, &ldquo;But Mary has no experience&rdquo;. He replied, &ldquo;She is sound&rdquo;, and I got my chance to serve in Cabinet.</P>
    <P>There are many other features to the former Taoiseach, which will emerge in the days and <Col N="3"/>weeks ahead. Be that as it may, that is the business of political writers and commentators. I prefer to look at the man in his full rounded personality. For me the good certainly outweighs the not so good. I recall his endeavours when we were in Opposition when he ran the party Front Bench as if it were a Cabinet. We reported on time for meetings and we had our memoranda and ideas ready. He ran matters in same way as he was later to run the Cabinet and it ill-behoved anyone to be late. Matters were conducted quickly, the business was done and we went on our way.</P>
    <P>It was also good that his brother, Fr. Eoghan Haughey, was with him when he died. Death is awful, but it is a fine matter to die surrounded by one&rsquo;s relations and those who love one.</P>
    <P>I think of Charlie Haughey&rsquo;s pursuit of the financial services industry and the legislation pertaining thereto when we were in the shadow Cabinet, as well as his creative activity and his genuine interest in the arts. I think of his interest in education and his interest in the North of Ireland. The beginnings of the boom in Ireland were no doubt sown between 1987 and 1989. Everyone will remember his speech about tightening our belts and wonder if he was tightening his own. That is for others to comment on. There is no doubt that the period from 1987 to 1989 set the scene for the later economic boom.</P>
    <P>I recall personal family matters as well, but at the end of the day, Charlie Haughey and Brian Lenihan shook hands and wished one another well before my brother died. I am happy in my heart that was done and that the ills were forgotten. His head was demanded and was given, but if I start on that I will never stop.</P>
    <P>As Leader, I wish to give public expression to the sympathy on this side of the House for the Haughey family. As was said so eloquently this morning on the radio by Catherine Butler, Maureen Haughey was not just a woman &mdash; she was a lady. She was wonderful to her late husband. They do not make taoisigh, potential or real, like Mr. Haughey anymore. Many will say that that is a good thing, but I do not think so. He showed charisma to people who flocked to him and wanted him. It was another era and another time. God rest his soul.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>On behalf of the Fine Gael group in Seanad &Eacute;ireann, I offer our sympathies to the Fianna F&aacute;il Party and to all colleagues in the House who served with the former Taoiseach, Charles Haughey. Senator Daly was a Cabinet Minister, along with Senator O&rsquo;Rourke and others. Senator Mansergh also served with him in another capacity over many years. They will feel his loss greatly today. I also pass on our sympathies to the Haughey family in particular. I am not aware of any family in Irish public life who have had to suffer the ongoing glare of publicity over 40 years in the way the Haughey family has. They have had to bear the brunt of that publicity, <Col N="4"/>both positive and negative, over those years and they have done it with great dignity. I sincerely sympathise with them today on the loss of a father, husband and grandfather.</P>
    <P>The Leader is right to state that it is too early to judge the political legacy and career of Charles Haughey. He dominated Irish politics for 40 years. It is rare for someone to be elected in the 1950s and work all the way until 1992, serving as Minister for Finance, Health and Social Welfare, leader of his party and Taoiseach. We should not forget that he was elected by the other House as Taoiseach on four separate occasions, which is a seminal honour. Not since the time of de Valera has any Irish politician been elected on four separate occasions by the D&aacute;il to the office of Taoiseach. We need to remind ourselves of that office. I was very happy when the Government offered a State funeral to the Haughey family who graciously accepted it. Whatever one&rsquo;s view of the legacy of Charlie Haughey, the fact is that he was Taoiseach of this country. As Taoiseach, we need to honour the office and those who held it for such a long period of time. It is right, fitting and proper that a State funeral would be offered and accepted.</P>
    <P>It is also right that the funeral mass of Mr. Haughey will take place in his beloved Donnycarney, a part of Dublin I know well, as my godmother lives opposite the church to which he will be brought next Thursday. There is great affection among the people of Donnycarney for the Haugheys, particularly Charlie Haughey, who was one of them, grew up among them and was a local boy who did very well. That he is going home to Donnycarney on Thursday and Friday of this week and that the State funeral will take place there is welcome.</P>
    <P>The Haughey years were defining ones in terms of our attitude to Northern Ireland, the ability of this State to manage its affairs economically in a sensible and sane way, the way in which standards in politics have changed and in which politics is viewed among the Irish population. There is no doubt Charlie Haughey was one of the most talented politicians, if not the most talented one, since the foundation of the State. I say that because he was utterly pragmatic. He came from a community which helped him to understand what ordinary people thought. He understood what people wanted. He had great foresight in trying to see how ordinary people lived their lives and he responded to that. He was a talented politician but, as the Leader said, there was another side to him and that is probably for another day.</P>
    <P>Whatever we say in this House today of the life and times of Charlie Haughey, I am convinced of one thing, namely that the Irish people have made up their minds about Charlie Haughey, be that positive or negative. Nothing we say here today or nothing that is written about him in the weeks and months ahead will change the collective view the Irish people have of this political <Col N="5"/>leader and figure who dominated politics in this country for more than 40 years.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not wish to argue with the Chair&rsquo;s ruling but I would appreciate if Senator Quinn could be allowed the opportunity to speak.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I cannot assist the Senator as I have ruled on this matter.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Our duty here today is to pay our respects to somebody who served the State for a long time as Taoiseach, the highest parliamentary elected position in the country. I believe the words spoken by the previous speakers would be echoed by all of us, the reality being that people will have different views of Charlie Haughey, a controversial and charismatic figure who was perhaps loved and loathed in equal portions but nonetheless whose contribution has been huge in whichever way it may come to be measured.</P>
    <P>Mr. Haughey was unquestionably visionary and had a novel and creative approach to the various Departments in which he served prior to becoming Taoiseach. As Taoiseach, he introduced a presidential style of Cabinet leadership and took an interest in what was going on in every single Department. We saw his novel and creative approach in issues such as the artists&rsquo; tax exemption, the IFSC and Temple Bar and his support for free travel for old age pensioners, many of which initiatives he undertook against the advice of senior officials and others. That must be recognised.</P>
    <P>It must also be recognised that as well as the qualities of statesmanship which he showed time and again and his patriotic zeal for the country, he, like many great historical figures, had a collection of human flaws and frailties to balance all that. That is something on which history will make a judgment and on which, as Senator Brian Hayes said, people have probably already made up their minds. It is not for us to pass judgment on that, rather it is for us to recognise that he made a contribution as Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>At all times he showed absolute respect for every elected politician, irrespective of what side of the House or what House they came from. I heard him say on a number of occasions that somebody who was elected to come in the gate was somebody who demanded respect. He was approachable by people at all levels from all parties or none. In that context, it is fitting that we should recognise his contribution as Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>I should also say, being from Corca Dhuibhne, go raibh dl&uacute;th-bhaint aige leis an taobh sin t&iacute;re. Chaith s&eacute; tamaill&iacute;n i ngach bliain d&aacute; shaol sa taobh sin t&iacute;re agus go m&oacute;rmh&oacute;r in Inis Mhic Aoibhle&aacute;in, sna mBlascoda&iacute;, &aacute;it ina nd&uacute;irt s&eacute; riamh go raibh dra&iacute;ocht speisialta ann. Bh&iacute; dl&uacute;th-cheangal aige le muintir Chorca Dhuibhne.</P>
    <P>We offer our condolences to his family and to Maureen who made a significant contribution. Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a anam.</P>

   <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>On my own behalf and that of the Labour Party Senators, I offer genuine condolences to the family of Charlie Haughey, and particularly to his son, who is a Member of the other House, and for whom most of us have considerable respect and regard. I also extend sympathy to the Fianna F&aacute;il Party which has lost a figure of stature and charisma, one of the dominant figures of Irish politics.</P>
    <P>Like many of us on this side of the House I am conscious of things I may have said but I ought also to respect this man&rsquo;s achievements. He progressed from a background of limited, if not no, privilege to leadership of the country. Whatever one thought of his shortcomings, which we will leave to others and to another day, he had a quality of leadership which was sometimes astonishing in its capacity to deal with the realities presented to him, which often differed from those for which he might have wished.</P>
    <P>If one was not too close to him he was an easy man to like. Those who worked very closely with him were a little afraid of him. For those of us who knew him less formally he was an easy man to whom to talk, one who, more than many recognised, had a fairly sharp wit and a good sense of humour, capable of being expressed in a phrase or two.</P>
    <P>Mar a d&uacute;irt an Seanad&oacute;ir O&rsquo;Toole, bh&iacute; an-bhaint aige le Chorca Dhuibhne. Ba ch&oacute;ir dos na ndaoine a cheap nach raibh s&eacute; d&aacute;ir&iacute;re faoin cheantar sin t&iacute;re &eacute;isteacht le pobal an cheantair. It does not matter what the politics of people there were, they knew that his affection for that part of Ireland was genuine. His affection for the arts was genuine, as was his sense of Irishness. He dealt with the illness he had to confront for the past 11 years with considerable dignity and openness. In many ways he lived out a long illness under public scrutiny with dignity and pride.</P>
    <P>Some time in the distant future the Succession Act, which he introduced as Minister for Justice, will be regarded as the most radical legislation he introduced. It transformed the rights of women such that certain things could never again be done to them. He had, and his family has, good reason to be proud of his legacy in other respects. T&aacute; s&eacute; imithe uainn anois. Go luath, tosn&oacute;idh na stara&iacute; ag caint faoi agus beidh na leabhair &aacute; scr&iacute;obh agus an taighde ar si&uacute;l. Nuair a scr&uacute;d&oacute;far a shaol ioml&aacute;n, beidh lochtanna agus easpanna ann, ach beidh ruda&iacute; eile ann a bheidh in &aacute;r gcuimhne go fad t&eacute;armach, ruda&iacute; a dhein agus a thosnaigh s&eacute; agus an tsl&iacute; a dh&eacute;ile&aacute;il s&eacute; leis an saol mar a bh&iacute; s&eacute;, c&eacute; go mb&rsquo;fh&eacute;idir nach &eacute; an saol mar a theastaigh uaidh go mbeadh s&eacute;. Ar dheis l&aacute;imh D&eacute; go raibh a anam.</P>

	<P>On behalf of the Progressive Democrats I would like to express sympathy to the family of Charles Haughey, particularly his wife Maureen, his children Eimear, Conor, Ciar&aacute;n and Se&aacute;n, our parliamentary colleague in the D&aacute;il. This is a sad time for them, the wider <Col N="7"/>Haughey family and his colleagues in Fianna F&aacute;il. Our party leader said this morning that when Mr. Haughey retired as Taoiseach in 1992, the Government he had presided over had set the foundations for the historic achievements, the economic turnabout in the country and the peace process.</P>
    <P>A number of speakers have referred to the success of Ireland&rsquo;s International Financial Services Centre, which is a living tribute to the boldness and determination of Charles Haughey. He will also be remembered for generating a particular vibrancy in the arts and for the excellence of the renovated Government Buildings which we see as a legacy. Much will be written about him in the days, weeks and months ahead. Today is not the day to judge, but the day to extend sympathy. On behalf of the Progressive Democrats, I express our deepest sympathies to the Haughey family and his colleagues in Fianna F&aacute;il.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>I extend my deepest sympathies to Charles Haughey&rsquo;s wife Maureen and his children. They have much to be proud of as well as to be sad about today. He was a great parliamentarian who had an extraordinary political career.</P>
    <P>Taken in the round, despite the sadness and difficulties of the past few years, he was lucky rather than unlucky. His many acts of charity and assistance will long be remembered by those affected by them. He did not believe there was any such thing as an ordinary person, but that everybody had special individual qualities. He was particularly conscious, because of his background, of the real difficulties and poverty people suffered, whether small farmers, pensioners, struggling artists or people living in the inner city of Dublin.</P>
    <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Three weeks ago I had the honour of sitting with him as he looked back with great satisfaction over the past 50 years. What he was most proud of was the social partnership agreement of October 1987 coupled with the national recovery from which the country has never really looked back. Associated with that was his very constructive relationship with EU President Jacques Delors which let Ireland be included with the Mediterranean countries and benefit from the vitally important Structural Funds over the past 20 years. It was also he who first pulled the threads which started to make up the peace process. In his time he vindicated a vigorous constitutional republicanism. May he rest in peace.</P>

	<P>I have received notice from Senator Bannon that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
    <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to provide an update on the proposed Knockmartin Lane group sewerage scheme.</P>
    <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Kitt of the following matter:</P>
    <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Transport to outline whether he will discuss with Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann the restoration of two train stops at Woodlawn station, Ballinasloe, County Galway.</P>
    <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Morrissey of the following matter:</P>

    <P FLI="0">I regret that I have had to rule all three matters out of order, which I suppose is a record. The matter raised by Senator Bannon is out of order because the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has no official responsibility in the matter &mdash; it is a matter for the relevant local authority.

	<P>I would like to mention an incident that occurred in Dublin last weekend. A young firefighter who works for the Dublin fire brigade service received 35 stitches to the face when a lunatic hooligan decided to throw a bottle at him. Such incidents constitute an increasing trend not only in Dublin but also in other cities. As I said some years ago, emergency workers such as firefighters, paramedics and nurses, who are often attacked by people who are out of their minds with drink, drugs or both, should be given additional legal protection. I understand that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is considering an amendment to the Criminal Justice Bill 2004, which is before the other House, in this regard. I would be grateful if it could be expedited in this House as soon as possible. We need to do something to help those who put themselves in the front line of hooliganism and vandalism and encounter people who are trying to destroy our society. We need to protect such people and the jobs they do. I ask the Government to accept the amendment to the Criminal Justice Bill 2004 as soon as possible. I hope Senators will have a chance to debate this matter if the legislation in question comes to the House before the summer break.</P>

   <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to refer to something I said about RTE last week. I stated, with the support of other Members, that it had not covered debates in this House. Since then, I have been informed that while it had done so, it had changed the broadcasting time, which did not appear in the newspapers. It is important to withdraw that criticism.</P>
    <P>However, I wish to replace it with a different criticism, which concerns the new programme scheduling. It proposes to remove programmes like John Kelly&rsquo;s &ldquo;Mystery Train&rdquo;, which is a distinguished and unique form of broadcasting and which brought people&rsquo;s attention to groups such as the Buena Vista Social Club, of which they would not otherwise have heard. I also refer to broadcasters such as John Creedon, that inimitable voice, Val Joyce, as well as Myles Dungan&rsquo;s arts programme. There is a legitimate interest in this regard, because RTE is a national broadcaster. While I am happy to pay the licence fee, I do not see why I should do so, simply to get another music and blather station.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Members want a real national broadcaster and ought to support RTE in its provision of its traditional kind of distinguished coverage of the arts and other interests.</P>
    <P>I also wish to raise the issue of Guantanamo Bay, especially in the light of the suicides of three inmates. They were astonishingly described by an official &mdash; whose own title, namely, the person with responsibility for political diplomacy, poses some questions &mdash; as a public relations stunt. It <Col N="10"/>was some stunt and I doubt whether the official herself would be inclined to engage in such a stunt. It showed astonishing disrespect to so describe it. Moreover, I was amazed at the governor of the prison, who stated that it was an act of aggression against the United States and that it constituted asymmetrical warfare. He was correct in that the action could not have been more asymmetrical. It involved one imprisoned, shackled and tightly controlled person in his pyjamas against a nuclear power which has no scruples in respect of torture. That is certainly asymmetrical. However, it begs a series of questions and I am glad that the Government has at last woken up to what is happening at Shannon Airport. That issue will probably be a matter for tomorrow night&rsquo;s Private Members&rsquo; debate.</P>
    <P>The Government has called in the American ambassador because a civilian aircraft with more than 100 military personnel and a prisoner in shackles has been discovered. I congratulate the whistleblower, the cleaning lady, who made the discovery. A cleaning lady, or even a garda disguised as a cleaning lady, who boarded some of the other aeroplanes might not have found someone in shackles, but would have found the shackles. I am glad the House will debate this issue tomorrow night.</P>
    <P>In addition, the House should have a wider debate on the Middle East, in the light of the bombing of a beach in Gaza, in which there were seven civilian casualties, as well as the apparent descent of Palestine into civil war. It has been stirred up and is the direct responsibility of all those countries, including Ireland, which meanly held back money from the suffering people of Palestine, although they did nothing whatever about the human rights violations or the implementation of the human rights protocols attached to the external association agreement between Israel and the European Union.</P>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is high time for the House to debate the Middle East. The participation of Ireland, through the European Union, on the assault on the people of Palestine and their elected Government is a particularly shameful moment. Moreover, it is a peculiar and confused morality which lectures one side for firing rockets while asking for restraint when the other side does so, or which is quite correctly horrified when children are killed by one side, but which almost leaves out the killing of children by the other. <Col N="11"/>Apparently, this is because it did not aim at the children, who simply happened to be there.</P>
    <P>This took place as recently as yesterday, when people, including children, were killed. Apparently, if there are children in a building when Israel decides it wants to kill someone, that is tough on the children. This is what Ireland supports when it subscribes to the world assault on the people of Palestine for not electing the Government which some people think they should have elected. Such a debate is desperately needed.</P>
    <P>I would also welcome a debate on public sector broadcasting because those who lobbied me and others in both Houses for a proper licence fee have a right to an explanation. Senator Norris listed the people and a programme that have been dropped. As a friend of mine in Cork said, it appears that RTE Radio&rsquo;s philosophy is that during the day it should have neither culture nor culchies. All those with accents are being taken off the programme to give a bland, Dublin-based succession of people who sound the same, are the same and meet RTE&rsquo;s peculiar criterion.</P>

   <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>There was a report in today&rsquo;s newspaper on the new phenomenon of homeless immigrants. Those who have been here long enough to know how I came to this House will know of my connection with the Simon Community. Although I have been aware of this for a while I was asked not to make a public issue of it, however it has been done. In view of the refusal to give people from accession States access to our welfare system, if their job does not work out they have no recourse to supplementary welfare, rent allowance or employment assistance. If their jobs fall apart they end up on the streets. A disproportionate number are being encountered by those who provide services for the homeless.</P>
    <P>If we are not to create another underclass, one cut off by language and culture, it is time we intervened vigorously. Nobody who comes to this country to work should end up in a state of misery sleeping on our streets. I do not care how it is done, what we do with the law or what are the issues involved. We cannot claim to be a welcoming country for people who come to work here if we allow them to be abandoned on the streets because of the inadequacy of our welfare system.</P>
    <P>I would like the Leader to allow us to have a debate on the international armaments race. Yesterday the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute revealed that last year, the world spent $900 billion on armaments. It is the most astonishing sum, is approximately five times Ireland&rsquo;s annual gross domestic product and dwarfs the international drugs industry by a factor of approximately ten. While the world is in perpetual uproar, correctly, about the inter<Col N="12"/>national drugs trade, the sale of arms to tyrants, dictators and terrorists is tolerated all over the world. The difference is that drugs are made by poor people and sold to rich people while arms are generally made by rich people and sold to poor people. It is overdue for a House of the Oireachtas to debate this issue and the increasing evidence that Ireland is getting tangled up in it.</P>

	<P>I support the statement by Senator Brian Hayes on the unprovoked attack on a member of the fire service. We should have strong laws to protect those working in our emergency services. It is not unusual for false calls to lure Garda cars, fire engines or ambulances into an area where they can be attacked by people. A clear message must go out on this issue.</P>
    <P>I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on education, particularly on the points system. It would not be appropriate to do so now as the exams are ongoing. However there have been calls in the last few days for an examination of the points system on higher level maths and science subjects. This has been raised several times at the Joint Committee on Education and Science. The time has come for a review of the points system. In certain schools and colleges pupils, my son included, are encouraged not to take honours maths because of the amount of time it consumes but to take up other subjects instead. The code for playing the CAO system has been cracked in certain schools. I believe we should have a debate on this in the autumn.</P>
    <P>There are concerns relating to the higher level maths paper but they will be dealt with in the fullness of time. A report today points out that yesterday&rsquo;s higher level geography paper was produced in colour while the ordinary level paper was unfortunately produced in black and white. The colour paper gives a significant advantage to students in analysing graphs and such. We should have a debate on all of these issues in the autumn.</P>

   <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>The cancer strategy was launched yesterday and I request a debate in the next couple of weeks on various aspects thereof. We have no idea of the cost or timescale for implementing the strategy. The T&aacute;naiste made an announcement indicating the merger of cervical cancer screening and breast cancer screening, but we do not know the implications of such a move. Previous debates in the House have shown that roll-outs have been announced but have not happened around the country.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that there has been no initiative on prostate cancer screening. In every debate on health in the House many contributions have been made on the need for men to get regular health checks, yet on this issue the State has failed to implement a screening process. I do not understand why there cannot be a national screening process for prostate cancer. Many men in this House will, unfortunately, contract this in the course of their lives. Indeed it is <Col N="13"/>somewhat topical in that our former Taoiseach, Charles Haughey, died today having fought prostate cancer for many years. I ask the Leader to arrange a debate and have the T&aacute;naiste clarify to this House the costs and timescale for the implementation of the cancer strategy.</P>

	<P>Media reports, especially in <i>The Irish Times</i> last week, referred to the abandonment of the western rail corridor, which represents only 1% of the total budget of &euro;31 billion under Transport 21. I hope there will be a debate on this issue as it is relevant at the moment and it is relevant to a motion I tried to raise on the Adjournment, which the Acting Chairman had to refuse, relating to train stops. If we had that debate I would have the opportunity to say I do not think Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann is fulfilling its role in providing a proper train service in the west. If Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann is behind the attempt to scupper the western rail corridor I will be very disappointed. Dublin Bus receives subsidies and we know what the DART and Luas cost to set up and it would be unfair to leave out the western rail corridor.</P>

Senator Dardis presented it in the past and it provided necessary information to people in the farming community. Will RTE allow this to continue in the autumn schedule?</P>

   <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like the Leader to invite the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children to the House to debate the inadequacy of the nursing home subvention. This might help to relieve the hardship and financial stress imposed on families throughout the country. I know families and relatives that have mortgaged their homes to pay for elderly parents and relatives in nursing homes. The subvention has not kept up with inflation and there has not been an increase in several years and we all know the high cost of private nursing homes. The cost of heating oil, insurance and wages have all risen considerably in the last two years, yet there has been no increase in the nursing home subvention.</P>
    <P>There is a crisis with regard to public nursing home spaces with the result that people are forced to send their elderly relatives to private nursing homes. It is important we debate this issue, as it is a very sad reflection on our society when we see people having to mortgage their homes in a time of plenty in order to look after the people who served this State well over the years. Perhaps the Leader will urgently arrange a debate and try to pressure the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, to increase the nursing home subvention.</P>

	<P>All of us in the Houses of the Oireachtas came into public life in the hope we could give some service to our people. At the same time we hoped to give a voice to those who have none.

    <P>Currently, if a country or person is in the right club &mdash; particularly the club headed by the American Administration &mdash; then anything goes. This is not fair to the American people. They have made it clear in various talk shows we have heard, columns in the newspapers and polls that they are not happy with what is happening at the moment in their name.</P>
    <P>In fairness to the Government, it should be said it has gone out on a limb on many occasions, very often as a lone voice, to ensure that morality would be centre stage. I have said this many times previously. We should be careful to unite our voices here. There is no doubt that what is happening at the moment in Iraq and the Middle East as a whole will come back to haunt us.

	<P>A &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; investigation last night on RTE dealt with the tenth anniversary of the ruthless assassination of Veronica Guerin. It is harrowing and worrying to see that we have regressed in the fight against drugs. Up to 100 drug lords are operating from Spain with impunity. My heart goes out to the families, brothers, sons and daughters who must put up with the serious drugs problem all over the country but especially in inner-city Dublin. There appears to be indecision in Europol which is allowing these drug lords to act with impunity.</P>
    <P>We have had debates on the ever-increasing rate of road traffic accidents. There are extra garda&iacute; on the roads or in the Garda traffic corps. We must have a debate &mdash; a wake-up call &mdash; to seek extra resources to deal with the ongoing <Col N="15"/>drugs problem. The Government should lobby at EU level and try to get a decent agreement which will ensure a proper fight against these drug lords in Spain and around Europe.</P>
    <P>We have a duty in this House to highlight these issues. They are coming down the line very fast, but we appear to be very naive about what is happening. I thank the Cathaoirleach for his indulgence, but we must have a debate on this very soon. It is the tenth anniversary of Veronica Guerin&rsquo;s death and we should remember her. There was much action following her death, such as the establishment of the Criminal Assets Bureau, but we are losing sight of this serious issue, which will affect the youth of our country. We should deal with it sooner rather than later.</P>

	<P>I endorse what Senator &Oacute;<?oasys _jy ?>Murch&uacute; so eloquently stated about Guantanamo Bay and Palestine.</P>
    <P>I rise to support the call by Senators Brian Hayes and Minihan for protection for the emergency services. It is appalling that people whose jobs are vital to life-saving should themselves be exposed to risk and injury. The North has seen a frightening development which may happen here. In some areas these services are called out precisely so they can be ambushed. They provide a type of circus for people who seek a riot. While legal protection is important and should be put in train, these people serve the community and we should call on community leaders and parents. Most of those engaged in these activities are young people. Communities have a duty to protect those people who come out to succour them in their need.</P>

	<P>Almost every night a public meeting is held in a parochial hall somewhere in the country regarding fears about planning applications for telephone masts and other communications equipment. We must live in the real world and agree that from an industrial and communications perspective ongoing progress and development must take place. However, many local communities are scared because of a lack of information and confusion surrounding risks posed by this equipment to the health of their families and children. These masts are erected near schools, community facilities and housing estates.</P>
    <P>We need a national debate and national regulations. Local authorities appear to approach planning applications for such equipment in varying fashions. We should have a streamlined national system which would allow progress to continue but which would also ensure the serious questions asked by citizens are addressed and answered fully and transparently. Will the Leader <Col N="16"/>arrange that the appropriate Minister will come to the House and debate planning for communications equipment? It is an important issue which causes a great deal of concern. It must be addressed at national level.</P>

	<P>I support what was stated about the drugs situation, the death of Veronica Guerin and the brave acts of that girl who, as a journalist took on the godfathers of drug distribution and the drugs trade. Many of the young people who go to discos and nightclubs know the names of those peddling drugs. However, they will not tell because there is a cloak of secrecy over the distribution of drugs. Many people, particularly those in the medical profession, state that cannabis is not only a gateway drug, but has extremely serious side effects, not least mental side effects, yet others, some of whom have been elected, advocate the legalisation of cannabis. If ever society had a death wish that is it. Everybody in society is a referee. The confidential telephone number should be used. If a person has information he or she should blow the whistle. Those people must be put out of circulation.</P>

   <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Brian Hayes, the Leader of the Opposition, raised the matter of the young firefighter who went to do his public service and by way of thanks got 35 stitches in his face from what Senator Hayes described as a &ldquo;lunatic hooligan&rdquo;. While firefighters are paid by a town or city council, much of their work is of a voluntary nature and for that to happen is appalling. Senator Hayes called for additional legal protection for those who work in the public emergency services and asked that, if the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform tables an amendment to his Bill, it be accepted as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris raised the issue of RTE. He said the debate in the Seanad was broadcast last week but that it did not state in the newspapers when it would be shown. Most of us check the agenda in the newspaper if we want to watch a programme. There was a stunning picture of the Senator on the front page of <i>The Irish Times</i> today and he cannot complain in this regard.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris referred to the manner in which some programmes are being displaced by RTE. Myles Dungan was a shining light and his programme &ldquo;Rattlebag&rdquo; is brilliant. On this programme one might hear Peruvian singers or a storyteller from Chile. No matter what one says, this is an island and &ldquo;Rattlebag&rdquo; gives us a chance to hear things from other countries and continents. I do not know why it is being displaced until 11 p.m. &mdash; an amazing decision. It is the quirky voice of John Kelly, who presents &ldquo;The Mystery Train&rdquo;, that attracts one, in addition to his commentary on the music he is featuring.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris also referred to the suicides at Guantanamo Bay, which were described by some PR lady in the United States as a PR stunt &mdash; I <Col N="17"/>ask you &mdash; and by others as an act of aggression. The Senator wants a wider debate on the Middle East.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan called for a debate on Palestine and Israel and agreed with what was said on public sector broadcasting, on which he also wants a debate. He referred to the new phenomenon of homeless immigrants, who are now part of our lives and abandoned on our streets. He called for a debate on the arms industry, which is now worth &euro;900 billion.</P>
    <P>Senator Minihan called for a debate on the education and points systems. These would be suitable for debate in the autumn and it would be wrong to debate them now. Everybody is talking about the fact that one cannot do leaving certificate higher level mathematics. Even the most adept at mathematics in secondary schools say one must spend far too much time on the subject, at the expense of other subjects. Reference was made to the clear mistake in the geography papers at honours and pass levels, whereby the former was produced in colour while the latter was not.</P>
    <P>Senator Browne asked for the details and cost of the cancer report and called for a debate on prostate cancer. On Senator Kitt&rsquo;s point, it is now fashionable to speculate on the western rail corridor. Some are saying it should not go ahead in spite of all the work put into it. People who live in Dublin and use the DART and Luas, for example, forget that a wider part of Ireland needs its rail services.</P>

	<P>The way the media have begun to write about the western rail corridor does not bode well for it. Those concerned would want to get their act together and get stroppy about it again.</P>
    <P>Senator Kitt also referred to the national broadcaster and the future of farming. Senator Bannon asked for the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children to be invited to the House to debate nursing home subventions. We had a very good debate last week on Second Stage of the nursing home legislation. It concerned repayments but was essentially about nursing homes and presented a very good opportunity to Senators to talk about subventions.</P>
    <P>Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; raised the issue of Guantanamo Bay and referred to voices against the war in Iraq. He called for a debate on the Middle East. Senator Feighan referred to the great proliferation of drugs in our community. Senator Maurice Hayes referred to the need to protect those who work in the emergency services. I agree because these are the people we call upon when we need them.</P>
    <P>Packed meetings are again taking place around Ireland on the subject of mobile telephone masts. I believed this subject had passed on. The people at these meetings are sometimes the ones who <Col N="18"/>complain they cannot get a signal or service, but one cannot have it both ways.</P>

    <?oasys _ic14- ?><P>Senators will note four or five short new Bills on the Order Paper for this week and will also note that more are to follow, including the very extensive Criminal Justice Bill.

    <P LI="1">In page 3, lines 17 to 21, to delete subsection (3) and substitute the following:</P>
    <P LI="1">&ldquo;(3) This Act shall come into operation immediately on its passing into law.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P FLI="0">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Se&aacute;n Power, and his officials to the House. I understand my proposal that &ldquo;This Act shall come into operation immediately on its passing into law&rdquo; is the norm. I am not sure why such latitude is being given to the Minister to decide when exactly it will be implemented, especially considering that it has taken a year and a half for her to introduce it in the first place and that she is primarily responsible for having introduced flawed legislation in December 2004, which, I am thankful, was ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court. I hope the Minister of State will look favourably on my amendment.</P>

   <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I do not accept this amendment because it does not allow for a commencement order for a certain section of the Bill. A general commencement order can be made to allow for commencement of all provisions of the Bill. The inclusion of the provision to allow commencement orders will allow, if necessary, the commencement of a provision of the legislation before the legislation is enacted. The company may begin to work on the scheme prior to the enactment of the legislation if a commencement <Col N="19"/>order deemed section 12 to have commenced on a date prior to the enactment of the Bill.</P>
    <P>A similar amendment was proposed by the Senator&rsquo;s colleague, Deputy Twomey, in the D&aacute;il. It was debated at some length and rejected after due consideration.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the amendment. That successive Governments, and not just the present one, have shown such astonishing reluctance to include in legislation a date on which it would come into force serves as the most appalling commentary on the inefficiency of our whole system of government. Governments are most reluctant to deal with amendments that do not cost a lot of money when one tries to get them to agree to a certain deadline for the implementation of the legislation. Even if Senator Browne had included &ldquo;six months&rsquo; time&rdquo; or &ldquo;12 months&rsquo; time&rdquo;, at the latest, the Government would have opposed it. The Government should bring legislation passed by the Oireachtas into force within a reasonable period. It is a great pity the Supreme Court held that essentially the Oireachtas can pass legislation and, provided the clause is included, the Government can sit forever on legislation. That is an appalling reflection on our system of governance.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>I have nothing further to add. There is no need to go over what I said earlier. I outlined the reasons for the delay in bringing forward the legislation.

   <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>A sense of urgency is needed in terms of legislation coming through these Houses because there have been too many examples in the past of something being permitted but nothing happening for a long time. When I first became a Member of this House I sought a date, regarding legislation on authorities that were being established, for the publication of their annual reports and I found there was great reluctance to do that. Now, admittedly, a date is put down each time. This amendment is worthy of support and I urge the Minister of State to reconsider it.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 3:</P><Col N="20"/>
    <P LI="1">In page 6, subsection (1), line 5, to delete &ldquo;including&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;being&rdquo;.</P>
    <P FLI="0">This amendment proposes enabling the Health Service Executive to enter into an arrangement with anybody to carry out the repayment to people of money stolen from them. It is worded in a way to ensure the service can be contracted out to a private body if the HSE so wishes.</P>
    <P>I listened to the Minister of State when we discussed this matter on Second Stage and he said the problem was that the HSE did not have the resources to do it. If a private body is to be contracted to do it, will it do it free of charge? The Minister of State knows that is not the case, therefore, the private body will also have to have resources given to it. From where will those resources come? Will they come from the HSE because the private body will not do it for nothing? It will do it for a fee, which will be substantial and include a reasonable margin for itself. The Minister of State&rsquo;s idea was that if the HSE did it, it would have to take resources away from some other area but will the Government pay for this body? It will not do so. The HSE will have to provide for this out of its budget.</P>
    <P>What we are getting is the belief that the HSE can somehow manage to buy in the expertise cheaper than it can by allocating some of its own resources but that means money being taken from something else. We know the HSE is not exactly awash with money. We only have to ask the people of the north east who are undergoing the prospect of dramatic cutbacks in health services, including the non-employment of an oncologist, which is ironic given the rhetoric about cancer we got yesterday.</P>
    <P>The fundamental question is where the money will come from to pay for this process. Will it come from the HSE, in which case it is simply paying it out, or from the Government, in which case the Government is saying it will give it to a private organisation but not to the HSE?</P>
    <P>My amendment seeks to keep this provision within the public sector. I am not too hung up on the amendment, nor am I too hung up on who does it provided somebody can give me a plausible reason it would be better to have a private organisation do it than to give the HSE the extra resources to do it. That is what I would like to hear an answer on. Why is this way better and who will pay for it?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I listened carefully to what Senator Ryan said and found the case he was making interesting but I cannot accept that he has made a sufficiently valid case. It appears to me, and I am sure the Minister of State will say, that we should leave the door open for whatever is the most efficient, cheap and sensible way of getting it done. If we accepted the wording in the amendment, it would exclude the possibility of looking for the best value and from that point of view, I do not believe Senator Ryan has thought this one <Col N="21"/>through sufficiently. Normally, he speaks with a very level sensible hat on but in this case it does not appear to be&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>The Minister of State should not start. I will take it from my colleague beside me but I might not take it from a Minister.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not accept this amendment because it would not allow for the appointment of an outside company to administer the scheme. The Government decision allows for the appointment of a company to provide an independent input into the process. The public tendering process has been implemented and the HSE decided on the appointment of a preferred service provider at a meeting of the board on 1 June 2006. In accordance with normal tendering procedures, no information can be made public on the preferred service provider until an interval of 14 days has elapsed and there has been no substantial query or objection from any of the unsuccessful bidders.</P>
    <P>The HSE has also stated its support for the decision to engage an outside company as it is not in a position to administer the scheme because the making of repayments on this scale is not its core work and the resources required to administer the scheme are not available within the HSE, given its extensive commitment to the provision of health services without diverting staff from their normal duties.</P>
    <P>Consideration was given by the HSE to the involvement of public sector staff to assist it in administering the scheme but the HSE has indicated that approach was not taken due to the potential industrial relations difficulties. The requirement to assign dedicated HSE resources to supervise these staff and remove them from their normal duties, the time constraints of the public procurement process and the potential for significant logistical difficulties and protracted delays, will have to be factored into the tendering process of the companies who are to take these staff on board.</P>
    <P>The cost of employing an outside company has not been established but the funding will not come from the HSE. The cost of hiring a company will come from a special account which is being established. It is not a matter of taking X amount out of some particular service this year to pay for the hiring of the company. We realised at the start of the year that this cost would have to be met and it will come from the Exchequer. There is no magic wand, as the Senator knows. This is an unusual case. It is the biggest and most expensive repayment case the State has ever undertaken and because of the fact that the State <Col N="22"/>was found guilty, so to speak, of taking money from people without the authority to do so, it was important to have an independent company involved. In an ideal situation we might not have to employ a company but in this case the right decision was made to use the resources of an outside company in assisting us with repayments.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>We now know something. We know that the Government does not know how much this outside agency will be paid. I thought somewhere along the way we had got a commitment that this would never happen again and that we would not allow these sorts of dangerous, open-ended contracts to private sector advisers, supporters, consultants or experts because of what happened with PPARS in particular. We now have a situation where somebody has been chosen by the HSE to do the job. Incidentally, a week ago the Minister said that a fortnight had to elapse. As it was before a week ago that the appointment was made, the 14 days is probably up. Perhaps somebody could tell the House the name of the company.</P>
    <P Just="Left">It would be nice if the D&aacute;il, which will ultimately vote the money, knew to whom it is voting it. I want to know how the HSE picked somebody to do this job without, apparently, the Minister responsible knowing how much it would cost. If ever there was an argument for keeping matters within the tight constraints of the public sector, what the Minister of State just said vindicates it. We know that somebody has been picked to do it and the Government does not know how much it will cost. It was quite clear that whoever is being affected by our present climate, it is not I.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn"><NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the words of the Minister of State and indeed, those of Senator Quinn. Those who will deal with these matters are people who have been involved in the tendering process. As a consequence, it is reasonable to assume that the optimum value will be secured for and on behalf of the State. There is no point in going into histrionics as to why this money has to be paid back. Everybody knows that and all Governments are culpable in that regard. The reality is that this is the way to proceed. I am in favour of the reasons, as outlined by the Minister of State and indeed, Senator Quinn. It is a question of value for money and I believe the measures that have been selected will deliver that.</P>

   <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I was anxious to address this section. I spoke on this issue at a meeting of the Fianna F&aacute;il parliamentary party and the Minister of State, Deputy Se&aacute;n Power knows this. As a former Minister of State at the Department of Health, I do not understand why outside consultants are necessary in this case. I have made the case already that there are hundreds of members of the HSE. I am very surprised that the HSE is not aware of what staff actually do at community welfare office level as regards the assessment of <Col N="23"/>medical cards. I made a simple suggestion to the effect that all reviews of medical cards should be postponed for the period required to assess the repayments to the participants involved in this particular campaign.</P>
    <P>This is not rocket science. I am constrained because of my position as a Fianna F&aacute;il Senator. I may speak on the actual amendment, but when it comes to a division of the House, I must vote in a particular way. That does not stop me, however, as a member of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party from telling the HSE what I believe. I am appalled, incidentally, by the bonuses given to the chief executive, given that we cannot come up with some degree of originality in so far as this issue is concerned. I would say to the staff and officials who are in the House, that I cannot understand why people are reviewed for their medical cards every year when there is no need for it. Nothing new will happen within one year, general speaking, as regards a person&rsquo;s income. Still, he or she has to face this embarrassing medical card review, having to put his or her case every year to the community welfare officer, when circumstances have not changed. The same staff employed in this regard should be located in each county or area to assess the number of people eligible for these repayments, for better or worse.</P>
    <P>I have strong reservations as regards the judgment of the Supreme Court, because I served in the Department as well and I felt that most people were satisfied with the payments, the charges and the services they were receiving. However, the Supreme Court does not seem to have regard for the economic situation in this country or the demands to repay this. I have a constituent who will be receiving a repayment for the last ten or 15 years. He has asked me to check his father&rsquo;s repayments because he was also in a home for a number of years. Between the two of them a nice little fund will be accruing to the account.</P>
    <P>No great rocket science is involved in asking the community welfare officers and the staff dealing with medical cards to process and assess the situation and to let the Department of Health and Children, which seems to be semi-redundant because of the HSE, oversee the situation and come up with the payments required for the individuals involved. It is as simple as that, but it is ludicrous to spend &euro;50 million on a private outside company which knows nothing about the system of operation of the former health boards, the HSE and the Department of Health and Children. I served in that Department in my capacity as chairman of the Western Health Board and as a Minister of State and I would not be giving this role to outside bodies. I see no reason for it. I make this late appeal to the Minister of State.</P>

	<P>I, too, agree with the previous speakers. The Department of Agriculture and Food pays out enormous sums every week to farmers and the Department of Social and Family Affairs makes considerable payments every week as well.

	<P>Here we are in the House, a week later, and we still do not know who has got the contract and neither do we know how much it will cost. Can the Minister of State say what controls and checks are in play? Have we learnt anything from PPARS? Have we learnt anything from the redress board as regards a Bill that was <Col N="25"/>originally to cost taxpayers &euro;200 million and has now risen to &euro;1.1 billion? The argument about the appointment of the outside firm is a somewhat different business, but I am concerned about the checks and balances in place to monitor and supervise this. If it is to be &euro;50 million, what happens if it turns into &euro;100 million? Will someone be culpable or will he or she be reprimanded?</P>

	<P>The HSE had the job of recruiting a company to assist in the repayment scheme and it initiated a tendering process. That first tendering process was terminated because it felt it was not getting value for money. A second tendering process was advertised and a number of companies expressed interest. The HSE indicated that the second batch of tenders was much more competitive than the first. A figure of &euro;50 million has been mentioned. This is a nice round figure and easy to remember, I suppose, but it is not going to be the colour of &euro;50 million. The company has been picked and&mdash;&mdash;</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Minister of State on or off the record?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>I am quite happy to speak on or off the record, but I am giving the Senator the facts. The board met on 1 June and the company was selected. Under the rules that must be observed, there is a 14-day cooling off period to allow other companies to raise objections to the appointment, which will be completed within two days. The name of the company will be made known, as will the costs of employing it. The contract is over a two-year period, but it is not open-ended, and there was a cap on what the HSE could spend on the process.</P><Col N="26"/>
       <P>This is the first time we have embarked on a scheme of this magnitude. The HSE indicated it was not in a position to administer the scheme on its own. There will be checks and balances in place and a number of reports will have to be presented before the Minister. The council will also be audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the amendment being pressed?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I was not going to press it, but I may do so now. We do not know how much this will cost. We do not know what the cap was nor do we know the identity of the company and we have been given spurious reasons for this. As Senator Leyden said very well, there is a myth that the HSE is not involved in any schemes to pay out money, but it is involved in schemes. The Minister of State tells me that the HSE is not able to do something that it is doing. It pays out money for community welfare, it assesses people&rsquo;s means for medical cards and it has been doing this for 40 or 50 years.</P>
    <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>At the back of all this is the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s ideological agenda to privatise the health service and this is a test case. I do not care about that because I can argue with it on intellectual grounds. However, it is offensive to present this House with an intellectually unsustainable argument. If there is a reason for doing this, I will listen to it as I do not have ideological baggage. Like Senator Quinn, I believe that what is most efficient is what should be done. I am singularly unpersuaded that what is going to be done will be more efficient. I am utterly unpersuaded that it will be more cost effective and because of this, I will press the amendment.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>If the firm has not completed the work after two years, will there be another tendering process? The Minister of State spoke about an open book but I am more confused than ever. This tendering process was advertised and 11 expressions of interest were received. These were short-listed to three but were not deemed to be suitable, so it was re-advertised. There was much suspicion about the whole process, especially on the Government benches. Is the Minister of State categorically saying that the firm that won the contract was cheaper than the others? Will the firm turn out to be cheaper in the long term?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>I will not let on that I am familiar with all the details of the companies that tendered. I tried to give the House as much information as possible on the number of companies that tendered for the second process. It is up to the HSE to decide the most competitive, most efficient and the best tender on offer. I assume it will have done the job well and the company <Col N="27"/>chosen will have some experience of large repayments. While I cannot disclose the figure, the sum of &euro;50 million mentioned by a couple of Members in this House and by others last week is wide off the mark. We were told by the HSE that a significantly lower figure was accepted and will be paid to the company. The contract is for a two-year period and we expect that the repayments will be processed during that period.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not want to make the Minister of State&rsquo;s life difficult, but he has been delegated powers in the Department and he has them signed, sealed and delivered by the T&aacute;naiste. However, I am missing a point. Why is this in the Bill if the decision has already been made and the contract awarded to a company? Would it not be more appropriate if the Bill was passed by both Houses, signed by the President and then the contract awarded? That is why I made strong representations to the Government not to go ahead with this. That is my personal opinion and it would be easy for me to sit back and not have any view about it. As Senators from the Government party, we have a right to make our views known.</P>
    <P>Of course I will vote with the Government on the issue, but I am sure the Minister of State will realise that this is our duty and that we can help the Government by pointing out all that can be teased out in this House. I do not want to see a company awarded a contract and then have it taken away because the Bill has not been passed.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn"><NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
	<P>It must be appreciated that the time of HSE personnel also costs money. The HSE has stated clearly that it is not in a position to deliver on this service and that must be respected. I do not believe that utterances are made without due consideration. I agree with the Minister of State and Senator Quinn and I respect the views of Senators Ryan, Browne and Leyden. The time of a public official also costs money. It is a question of the service being delivered within the shortest possible space of time and the optimum value for money given.</P>
    <P>The process which is being embarked upon is the correct one. I respect the right of those who differ from me but as someone who has worked for a long time in the public service, there is a popular misconception that public service time does not cost anything. It certainly does cost money as it is very important time. If the HSE personnel had been involved in this process, they would be neglecting to do other work. The HSE decided &mdash; I am sure after due consideration &mdash; that it was not in a position to do this and advised the Government to go down another route. The HSE representatives have shown honesty and responsibility in this matter. I support the Minister of State&rsquo;s position and that of Senator Quinn.</P>

	<P>I do not wish to stifle debate but we have been on this amendment for over half an hour. There are many amendments to be debated and people will be disappointed if we do not get through them.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>Can I take it that under the two-year rule, the company awarded the contract must finish everything after two years? What happens if the work is not completed after two years? I put in an FOI request on this issue a month ago, but I have yet to receive any information on it. We are working in the dark and it is incredible how clandestine the operation has been. We do not know how much it costs and we do not know who got the tender after a 14-day process. We are led to believe that nobody has objected yet, but we do not know for sure. Will the Minister of State publish the documents in the interests of openness and transparency? He should give Members the information available so that we are in a better position to form an opinion. There is no point in asking this of the HSE because I will not get an answer, despite going down the FOI route. It is utterly frustrating as an Opposition spokesperson.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>The impression could be given that we have staff in the HSE twiddling their thumbs with nothing to do, but nothing could be further from the truth. We have no idle staff in the HSE. We spoke to representatives of the HSE in the early stages and they indicated that they were not in a position to administer this scheme. They stated their support for the decision to engage an outside company to help in the repayments. It was our intention to appoint the company earlier than envisaged but we will not delay the legislation or the repayments. We would appreciate the support of all parties in both Houses and we are keen to pass the legislation as quickly as possible and to begin the repayments at the earliest possible date.</P>
    <P>We are not trying to hide anything, but a certain procedure must be followed for the tendering process when the name of the company is not known. The Senator will know the name of the company involved and the cost of the contract within 48 hours. If there is any other relevant information he wants to know about the company, I am sure the HSE will be prepared to provide it. It is not the case that we are trying to hide anything. A certain procedure must be followed, and we are following it. There is no desire on our part to keep any information from the Senator.</P>
    <P>The contract is for two years and we expect the work will be completed within that period. If at the end of the two-year period it is considered there is further work to be done that would require the advice and assistance of the company, it would have to enter into new negotiations at that stage. The current contract into which the company has entered is for a two-year period.</P>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>Securing value for money was the priority of the HSE when it sought tenders for the appointment of an outside company.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The answer obviously is that it did not.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>The same could be said about PPARS, which was supposed to save money in the long term.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Nothing has been learnt.</P>
    </Speaker><P>Question, &ldquo;That the word proposed to be deleted stand&rdquo;, put and declared carried.</P>
     <P>Amendment declared lost.</P>
  <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 3 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand that everybody who is due to receive a repayment will have been in a public hospital. That represents the overwhelming bulk of those concerned. Therefore, their records will be held by the HSE. An outside body will now have to trawl through those records. It will either ask the HSE for this information, in which case employees of the HSE will have to dig through their records and do the work of this outside agency, or alternatively the body will need to have access to all the records of these hospitals to carry out the work. How will a private body suddenly work from the offices of, say, St. Vincent&rsquo;s Hospital in Athy where my mother is being cared for, as the Minister of State is aware? It is a classic example of a wonderful publicly provided hospital for older people.</P>
    <P>This process is about people applying for repayments and their records being checked. Who will do the drudgery of checking the records? If it is to be the HSE, it will do most the work for which another body will be paid. If it is <Col N="30"/>not the HSE, private individuals, who do not know their way around the town of Athy, not to mention St. Vincent&rsquo;s Hospital, will have to be trained in order that they can trawl through the records. That has all sorts of implications for privacy, data protection and other matters.</P>
    <P>I increasingly believe that this process has not been thought through. What will happen is that an agency will design and issue a glossy form and when the forms are received, the agency will pass them to the HSE which will have to do the drudgery of finding out whether the applications are valid.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand court cases are pending in regard to people who secured beds in private nursing homes who would have chosen a bed in a public nursing home but they were not available and a second choice or last resort was made whereby a son or daughter, for example, secured a bed for their mother or father in a private nursing home. We all know the result of a judgment in a court case being different from what is envisaged. Has the Minister of State provided in the Bill for a successful outcome in those court cases? If a person, whose relative was put into a private nursing home as a last resort, the person having tried to secure a bed for his or her relative in a public nursing home, such as St. Vincent&rsquo;s Hospital in Athy, but was unable to do so because of a lack space, were to successfully challenge the legislation in court, it would have major implications for this Bill. In that event, in regard to section 3, the terms of reference of the agency in charge of administering the scheme would widen considerably. Has the Minister of State taken account of that?</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>In regard to the <i>modus operandi </i>of this scheme, in the case of the Sacred Heart Hospital in Roscommon, the staff have the records of the patients there and will have to give a breakdown of the patients who were there, when they were there, their eligibility to qualify for payment under the scheme and to whom the money refunded should be paid. When repayments are made I hope the recipients will have an opportunity to spend and enjoy it.</P>
    <P>I may have strayed from the issue, but I am speaking on the section and I hope the Acting Chairman will allow me to make this point. In large nursing homes there is not a common room, a canteen where one could have a refreshment, or a shop where one could buy a daily, weekly or local newspaper, or a drink. I know the Acting Chairman may rule out of order the point I am making.</P>

	<P>Will the Minister of State, who has responsibility for older people and for these homes, arrange for a review of facilities available <Col N="31"/>for the elderly in them to ensure that such facilities are provided to enable them to spend the money that will be refunded rather than having to leave it to their families?</P>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>On Deputy Ryan&rsquo;s point, it will be the responsibility of the company to dig out the records. However, as the Senator is aware, under the legislation introduced in December 2004, we included an <i>ex gratia </i> payment of up to &euro;2,000. In that respect, slightly fewer than 11,000 people received that payment, the cost of which amounted to &euro;21 million. We have the number of the records available in that context. It will be the responsibility of the company to access the records and scan them for the purpose of repayments.</P>
    <P>On Senator Browne&rsquo;s point, the Supreme Court decision was quite specific on the people who are entitled to repayments. On foot of that decision this legislation was introduced. We are clear on who will be entitled to receive the repayments.</P>
    <P>On Senator Leyden&rsquo;s point, we will give priority to the people who are living in that we will ensure their claims will be processed first. As to whether some of them will be in a position to enjoy spending the money, I am sure some of them will and some of them will not. We will pay out the money as quickly as possible. The Bill provides for a special facility in terms of people do not wish to claim the money. They can put it into a fund which can be used for the purposes which the Deputy mentioned.</P>

    <P LI="1">In page 7, before section 5, but in Part 2, to insert the following new section:</P>
    <P LI="1">&ldquo;5.&mdash;Nothing in this Act shall be used to deny repayment of recoverable heath charges to any person who has received care in more than one long stay institution if that person would otherwise have been eligible for such repayment.&rdquo;.</P>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>This is an interesting amendment but the Minister of State outlined exactly how the scheme will operate as a result of the Supreme Court decision. As to whether somebody else takes another action in this regard, that is another day&rsquo;s work. People who could not secure a bed in a public institution and had to rely on the local private nursing homes have a grievance. The Minister of State is aware of that because I am sure he has received representations to that effect in his constituency.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not in a position to accept this amendment because under the provisions of the Bill applicants can already claim recoverable health charges from more than one institution. The Bill allows any recoverable health charge to be reclaimed under the scheme. This refers to the amount paid of a charge imposed on a person with full eligibility under the Health Charges for Inpatients Services Regulations 1976, as amended in 1987, or a contribution for inpatient services under the Institutional Assistance Regulations 1954, as amended in 1965.

    <P LI="2">(<i>b</i>) once a determination has been made as to a person&rsquo;s eligibility for a repayment of recoverable health charges, such a payment shall be made as soon as is reasonably possible and in each case no later than 28 days after such a determination has been made.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P FLI="0" Just="Left">This amendment seeks to create a new section which refers to the determination and repayment time limits. This Government does not strike me as being obsessed with deadlines and achieving targets. It has taken a year and a half to reach this stage. We are very quick to tell people when to pay their taxes, or pay back social welfare or agricultural overpayments, yet the State takes no responsibility to pay out on time. If someone owes money he or she should repay it. In this case the State finally and reluctantly admitted it owed money but no one has any idea when it will be paid back, even after determination has been made.</P>
    <P>It is not unreasonable to allow for a payment to be made 28 days after a determination has been made. Not alone have the people in question waited a year and a half for this legislation but in some cases they could have been waiting since 1998. There should be a sense of urgency about this but I do not get that impression from the Minister of State or the Bill. I hope he will accept this amendment.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister of State will not be in a position to accept this amendment because it is not practical. Every case is separate and each application must be properly processed to ensure that the taxpayer&rsquo;s interests are protected. The Minister and the Minister of State, and their officials, have assured me of this point. Private consultants were brought in to speed up the process. Deadlines would make the process more difficult.</P>
    <P>The Minister has also assured me that the &euro;2,000 has been repaid. Has everyone who was eligible received that sum? Nobody has told me he or she has received it, which is interesting. I must check this myself. Senator Browne&rsquo;s amendment, unlike that of Senator Ryan, is not practical.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The House should read section 17 which states:</P>
    <P LI="1">(1) Where it comes to the knowledge of the scheme administrator that&mdash;</P>
    <P LI="2">(<i>a</i>) all or part of the payment of a prescribed repayment to a person has been procured through fraud or misrepresentation, or</P><Col N="34"/>
    <P LI="2">(<i>b</i>) there has been an overpayment of a prescribed repayment to, or in respect of, a person, then the scheme administrator shall make a report thereon to the Executive.</P>
    <P LI="1">(2) Where it comes to the knowledge of the Executive . . . then the amount of that prescribed repayment so procured, or of that overpayment, as the case may be, shall be repayable to the Executive on demand .  .  . </P>
    <P FLI="0">In this instance the State does not delay or say it needs a reasonable time to administer or investigate the repayment. When the executive discovers that somebody owes it money because of a mistake under this scheme it wants the money back immediately. When somebody whose money has been taken by the State makes an application it will not consider any deadline, whereas in the converse situation the State wants the money back on demand or it will bring the person to court.</P>
    <P>That is the content of section 17 which is an example of the way the State, in my 25 years here, has consistently believed that there is one rule for the people from whom it wants something and another when people want something from it. This Bill would have been a wonderful opportunity for the State to say it must deal with the issue efficiently. I thought the objective of privatising the service was to give people efficiency but what we will get is the worst kind of public sector obscurantism, without any attempt to make the State accountable. Section 17 says it all.</P>

   <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>The scheme will be administered somewhat differently from what the Senators indicate. Not alone will the people receive the moneys illegally taken from them but they will also receive interest. Applications for repayment will be processed and the person will receive notification of the amount to be repaid. On receipt of that letter the person has 28 days within which to decide to accept or appeal that decision. If a person feels that he or she is owed more money he or she can appeal the initial decision, otherwise, the cheque is issued immediately on receipt of acceptance.</P>
    <P>We have provided &euro;400 million this year for repayments and if more money is required we will get it this year. We have no desire to withhold the money any longer. Once a decision is made, we hope the money will be paid out as quickly as possible. Apart from the moral issue, the longer we delay payments the more they will cost because interest is also due. Those people who are still alive will receive priority and we hope to process their claims as quickly as possible. I cannot accept the claim the Senator is putting forward.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>One of the greatest crimes of which this Government is guilty is abuse of the English language, in phrases such as &ldquo;shortly&rdquo;, &ldquo;as quickly as possible&rdquo;, &ldquo;imminently&rdquo;. We have <Col N="35"/>all received replies containing these phrases and assume they refer to weeks or days yet months or years later we find ourselves waiting and realise we have been hoodwinked. While I accept the Minister of State&rsquo;s reply, I do not understand why timeframes cannot be set. Senator Ryan brought home how the Government is quick to demand money from people but will not pay it with the same speed.</P>
    <P>It is important to specify time limits in legislation on this issue. I am sick of receiving replies from the Department of Health and Children and the Health Service Executive using the words, &ldquo;shortly&rdquo;, &ldquo;soon&rdquo; or &ldquo;in the near future&rdquo;. Tabling matters on the Adjournment is a joke because we rarely get a straight answer.</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="36"/>
   <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>I cannot be any straighter than I have been. The Senator&rsquo;s proposal is ridiculous. When an application is processed and a figure arrived at, the applicant is notified. It would be impossible to pay the person within the 28 days because he or she has that period to appeal or accept the payment. The Government has no intention of delaying it any longer. If we accept the Senator&rsquo;s proposal and notify someone on 1 June and do not pay until 1 July we could leave ourselves open to a legal challenge. This type of amendment ties us down unnecessarily. We are providing the money and the people to administer the scheme and we intend to process the applications as quickly as possible and to return the money.</P>

   <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
    <P LI="1">In page 9, subsection (2), line 19, after &ldquo;enactment&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or under any other scheme for the assessment&rdquo;.</P>
    <P FLI="0">Unlike some of the other amendments, which I suppose were a little contentious, this amendment and amendments Nos. 6 and 7 represent a simple attempt on my part to clarify something. Amendment No. 5 relates to any assessment of people&rsquo;s means by the State, under an enactment or otherwise. People&rsquo;s means are sometimes assessed when there is no legal or legislative basis for it &mdash; there might be an administrative basis for it. I <Col N="36"/>want to ensure that the receipt of repayments under this legislation will not affect anything when people&rsquo;s means are tested, regardless of how their means are tested.</P>
    <P>I choose to believe at this stage that the Government intends that no means-tested assistance or support of any kind will be affected by the receipt of repayments of this nature. I have often adverted in this House to the fact that if one wins the lotto, one&rsquo;s winnings are not subject to income tax but they do affect one&rsquo;s entitlement to social assistance. While that seems like a peculiar approach, I can see the logic behind it. If one sues for damages following a car accident and is awarded damages as a payment for one&rsquo;s loss, the moneys in question are assessed as part of one&rsquo;s means for the purposes of social welfare assistance. I know about this matter because an aunt <Col N="37"/>of mine, who is now deceased, had her pension reduced in such circumstances. The idea is that the compensation for damage one receives is regarded as part of one&rsquo;s positive income. I have tabled amendment No. 5 to ensure that no form of means-tested payment will be affected by these repayments. I will speak about amendments Nos. 6 and 7 in a moment.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>While I understand the intent of Senator Ryan&rsquo;s amendment No. 5, I am not in a position to accept it, unfortunately. It would allow for prescribed repayments to be disregarded for the purpose of the assessment of means under non-statutory schemes. If I were to accept the amendment, a number of community or non-statutory schemes could be deemed to be covered by this legislation. That could lead to legal or administrative difficulties. Only statutory schemes will be considered for the purpose of the scheme when disregarding repayments for the purpose of the assessment of means.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>My concerns are legitimate. Do I understand correctly that the moneys given to people who receive State payments which are the subject of a means test which is not based on an enactment will be reduced because they receive repayments under this legislation? It seems the Minister of State is saying they want to leave a possibility in place for people who receive payments which are not covered. I refer to payments which are means tested, other than via an enactment. The Bill states that repayments &ldquo;shall be disregarded in the assessment under any enactment of a person&rsquo;s means&rdquo;. It seems to me that it is extraordinarily unfair that when officials are assessing means other than under an enactment, they will be entitled to include this payment in their considerations.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>What we are saying is that only statutory schemes will be considered when disregarding repayments for the purpose of the assessment of means. This provision has been included on the advice of the Attorney General.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>

   <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
    <P LI="1">In page 9, subsection (2), line 22, after &ldquo;benefit&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or assistance&rdquo;.</P>
    <P FLI="0">When I tabled amendment No. 5, I thought I was simply being fussy, but I now realise I was actually raising a serious issue. It seems it is intended <Col N="38"/>that the repayment to certain people of the money that was stolen from them by the State will affect them. I have proposed amendments Nos. 6 and 7 for similar reasons. I would like to amend the reference to &ldquo;a person&rsquo;s entitlement, or level of entitlement, to a health or social welfare benefit (including any subvention to be applied towards any such benefit)&rdquo;. I am concerned because there is a distinction between &ldquo;benefit&rdquo; and &ldquo;assistance&rdquo;. I sincerely hope I am mistaken in suspecting it is intended that the receipt of a repayment will be considered when assessing people&rsquo;s means and, therefore, will affect the payment of moneys to such people for the purpose of any form of social assistance, such as the non-contributory old age pension, which is a form of social assistance, supplementary welfare allowance or unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>When I saw the word &ldquo;benefit&rdquo; in the Bill, I hoped it was not what I thought it was. My amendment will specifically include the words &ldquo;or assistance&rdquo; to clarify the matter. I am gratified by the fact that the amendment has not been ruled out of order, because that means it has been accepted that I am not providing for the possibility of imposing an extra charge on the Exchequer. Perhaps that means I have to accept that the term &ldquo;benefit&rdquo; must include &ldquo;assistance&rdquo;. However, I will await the Minister of State&rsquo;s remarks.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>

   <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>The last part. To put his mind at rest, I am advised that the word &ldquo;benefit&rdquo; will cover &ldquo;assistance&rdquo;. Hence, I am not in a position to accept the amendment. The Attorney General&rsquo;s office is satisfied that the present wording is sufficient for the purpose of the scheme.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Department of Social and Family Affairs should be informed that it is the Government&rsquo;s intention that all statutorily-based social assistance schemes are included within the term &ldquo;benefit&rdquo;.</P>

    <P LI="1">&ldquo;(9) In all cases under this section, a full calculation of the amount of the repayment shall be given to an applicant under <i>subsection (2)</i> of this section, before he or she may give his or her written authorisation to the donation.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P FLI="0">This amendment proposes that before a person gives his or her consent to a refund from nursing home charges, he or she will be given a full calculation as to how the figure was arrived at, in order that he or she will be best informed to make a decision in this regard. Hopefully, it might save time from being wasted on appeals in some cases.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not accept this amendment because section 15(<i>a</i>) already provides that the scheme administrator should give notice in writing to the applicant of its decision and the reasons for its decision. In the case of those receiving a repayment, the reasons for the decision will include a calculation of the amount of repayment. This will be especially important if any <i>ex gratia</i> deductions, or deductions of unpaid charges for long-stay care, are to be taken from the overall sum due. This will be an administrative process and enabling an individual to determine how a calculation was reached for a particular repayment amount will help to reduce the number of potential appeals.

   <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not accept this amendment because the provision of section 15(<i>a</i>) already provides that the scheme administrator will give the applicant notice in writing, as well as the reasons for the decision. In the case of a decision indicating that an award is to be made, a calculation of how the amount of the award was determined will also be provided.

	<P>I move amendment No. 12:</P>
    <P LI="1">&ldquo;In page 19, subsection (16)(<i>a</i>), line 17, after &ldquo;relates,&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or if the applicant had died or become incapable of acting, means a person affected by the decision,&rdquo;.</P>
    <P FLI="0">Section 16 concerns appeals against decisions and begins, &ldquo;An aggrieved person may&rdquo;, before going through a appeals procedure. Section 16(16) then introduces a definition of the term, &ldquo;aggrieved person&rdquo;. Logic would suggest that this definition should have been included before its first mention. However, I must live with my confusion, as the world of parliamentary draftspeople is a world into which I have no insight. Moreover, given my past experiences, the world in which the Department of Health and Children drafts legislation is a world into which I have even less insight.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, the definition of &ldquo;an aggrieved person&rdquo; in section 16(16) states &ldquo;in the case of any decision referred to in that subsection, means the applicant&rdquo;. Hence, if the applicant is deceased or is incapable of taking responsibility for himself or herself, apparently there is no recourse to appeal. This is a good way to invite a court challenge. It will invite trouble to state that no appeal can be made because people are of unsound mind, or whatever the appropriate phrase is, and cannot therefore make appeals themselves. Similarly, the suggestion that the legal representatives of a deceased person cannot appeal will also make trouble.</P>
    <P>I reiterate that the principle of charging people for the use of public nursing homes is perfectly reasonable, although it is a pity that the legislative basis for so doing was not sorted out. I hope that a significant and substantial part of the money which will be refunded will be used to support these services, either through the scheme provided in this Bill or some other. Like all Members I have heard a few unfortunate and regrettable anecdotes pertaining to relatives who had not been seen for years but who came out of the woodwork with the appearance of a sniff of money.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, given my understanding of the law&rsquo;s operation, I propose, in respect of the definition of &ldquo;an aggrieved person&rdquo;, to add to the phrase, &ldquo;means the applicant&rdquo;, and the phrase, &ldquo;or if the applicant had died or had become incapable of acting, means a person affected by the decision&rdquo;.</P><Col N="41"/>
    <P>Can the Minister of State explain how he can be certain this will not be open to significant legal challenge? The applicants will be elderly people and will get to the stage where they are not capable of making the decision. If I wanted to be nasty, I could suggest that it is hoped that frail people will not go through the entire complicated process of appeal and that only a few will so do, or, in other words, the Department is trying to deter people from appealing. I hope this is not the case. Undoubtedly, however, neither someone who is incapable of making an appeal himself or herself nor the estate of a deceased person can appeal. While I cannot guarantee its outcome, I can guarantee that a forceful legal challenge will follow this provision as sure as night follows day. This may give rise to a major delay and perhaps to further costs.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not accept this amendment because the legal advice received from the Attorney General&rsquo;s office indicates that no person not party to a decision can appeal a decision without permission of the courts. The rules of the superior courts make it clear that no person has a right to be joined to an appeal without special permission of the court hearing the appeal.</P>
    <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P Just="Left">To minimise confusion that may arise in respect of this matter, the term &ldquo;aggrieved person&rdquo; is being used to indicate that only an affected party can appeal against a decision. If an applicant dies or becomes incapable, then a valid receipt cannot be obtained for any repayment under that application and no payment can be made under that application and a renewed application will be required. In that instance, as no valid receipt could be obtained and no repayment made, an appeal would not be considered. If a repayment was made, the State may be exposed to valid claims in the future as no valid receipt could be obtained. In the case where the applicant dies and is also the relevant person, a connected person can make an application on behalf of the relevant person. In the case where the applicant dies and is not the relevant person, the relevant person, or another connected person, can make an application. Alternatively, the HSE could make the application on behalf of the relevant person.</P>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">That remains to be seen. Did the Minister of State say a connected person can make the application but cannot appeal? That confuses me. It may be that in my advancing years I am more easily confused than before but in this case I do not think so. I do not have great faith in the constitutional judgment of the Parliamentary Counsel. It has been found wrong as often as it has been found right. Although most Members of the Oireachtas warned it that the <Col N="42"/>previous legislation to this was probably unconstitutional, the Attorney General advised the Government otherwise, and it was subsequently found to be unconstitutional. While I appreciate that the permission of the courts is needed, the fact that we leave it out does not mean people will not seek the permission of the courts and the courts will, as they have done in less obvious cases of injustice, give permission for the cases to be heard. We should legislate to deal with this issue instead of it having to go to the courts. We could have thought of a way to do so.</P>

    <P LI="1">&ldquo;17.&mdash;Before any appeal under section 16 shall be allowed, the appellant shall have the right to employ such local appeals process as are open to him or her.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P FLI="0">That section is ambiguous on what a person is entitled to avail of in terms of appealing a decision which he or she believes was unfair.

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not accept this amendment because an independent, transparent appeals process is to be established for this scheme. The appeals officer or officers will be provided with guidelines on the procedures for dealing with appeals. Having one appeals process for the scheme will ensure a consistent approach to dealing with appeals. All applicants will be advised on their right to an appeal and how to make it.</P>
    <P>A person who receives an award may make an oral or written submission seeking a review of the amount awarded under the scheme and the appeals process will be independent of the scheme administrator and the HSE and will notify the appellant in writing as soon as possible <Col N="43"/>of the outcome of the appeal and the reasons for the decision. When an award is accepted under the appeals process the appellant must agree in writing to give up any rights he or she has to bring a claim for damages in the courts in respect of that repayment. When an appellant decides not to accept the decision of the appeals process, any right to bring a claim for damages to the courts is not affected.</P>
    <P>The person appointed to determine appeals will be independent in the performance of his or her functions and will comply with guidelines prepared by the Minister.

  <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
  <P Just="Center">SECTION 17.</P>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 14:</P>
    <P LI="1">In page 19, subsection (2), line 37, after &ldquo;then&rdquo; to insert:</P>
    <P LI="1">&ldquo;the Executive shall make a decision to that effect, and shall notify the person to whom the payment was made (or his or her estate) of that decision, and the person or his or her estate may appeal to a person appointed under section 16(3) in respect of such decision within 14 days, (on grounds to be specified in a notice of appeal, which may include the ground that a genuine mistake occurred) and in default of appeal, or on the dismissal of such appeal, thereupon&rdquo;.</P>
    <P FLI="0">I should not bother because only the Government will end up in a mess over this. A private body &mdash; this secret agency with its undefined budget about which we will know in two days time &mdash; can discover, after the process has been completed, that it overpaid a person. It can contact the HSE, which can write to an elderly person in a hospital bed and say it overpaid that person and that he or she must pay the money back immediately. There is no appeal and no need for the HSE to explain the reason.</P>
    <P>Cases such as this will go to court. An elderly person would need to go to court to challenge an administrative decision. If one wanted to invite serious constitutional questions about fairness and natural justice, one could not do so better than through section 17. I do not care what advice the Attorney General gave. I have found over the years here that what one regards as reasonable is a good way to judge the way the courts operate. If a private agency of the HSE decides a person is guilty of fraud, notifies the HSE, and the HSE contacts the person and requests the defrauded money be repaid, the scale of the money being repaid to people will be minuscule compared with <Col N="44"/>the scale of what the Government will have to pay in defamation damages.</P>
    <P>Our amendment suggests that where the private operator concludes that there has been fraud, misrepresentation or an overpayment, a simple appeals process using the appeals mechanism already present under section 16(3), would deal with many legitimate questions of natural justice. It is incomprehensible that the Parliamentary Counsel would suggest that a private organisation can decide it made a mistake and can, without apology, delay or explanation, demand it back on the spot. There is no delay, appeal or requirement to explain.</P>
    <P>The Department of Social and Family Affairs would no longer try that, but would implement a process of appeals. However, in this case there is no appeal. It is distasteful that section 17 refers to fraud and misrepresentation, which are legitimate concerns, and overpayment, which is a mistake on the part of the paying agents. To put them in the same clause is nasty because it ties up fraud and misrepresentation by individuals with errors on the part of an agency and handles the three using the same process. That is not nice in a Bill that is meant to repair damage done by the State over 25 or 30 years.</P>
    <P>I move the amendment that there will be an administrative appeals system where there is a suggestion of fraud or misrepresentation or where there is an error.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>Unfortunately I cannot accept this amendment as an appeals officer cannot determine a matter of fraud, under the Constitution only a court can determine if fraud has occurred. The procedure is, if the scheme administrator has a concern regarding a repayment made, he or she should inform the HSE. The HSE would then investigate the matter further and, if it is evident that it may be a case of fraud, bring it to the attention of the person who received the repayment. The HSE would make known its concerns regarding the circumstances in which the money was received and the repayment in question could then be returned to the HSE. If this money were not forthcoming the HSE could seek to recover the money through the courts and the court would ultimately decide if a case of fraud had occurred.</P>
    <P>This is an issue that was discussed at length in the other House. Fraudulent claims are at issue here, where people provide false information when making an application. We have a duty to the taxpayer to recoup payments made that should not have been made. I am not sure there is an easy way to tell somebody, whatever his or her age, that he or she has been overpaid and must pay the money back. It should be dealt with sensitively.</P>

	<P>It is not easy to give bad news and if people have money in their bank accounts there will always be a certain reluctance to repay it.

	<P>It does not say any of this.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>Taking a case to court will be a last resort. If moneys have been received through false claims we have a duty to ensure they are repaid as quickly as possible.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Now I know what they are doing. The reason for conflating overpayment and payment procured through fraud or misrepresentation is to use the latter to justify a brutally insensitive method of recovering money. The Minister for State says such people will receive written notification but there is nothing here to indicate that. The HSE and its various agencies have much to learn and are often not models of sensitivity, one need only consider the cases of people refused medical cards. How can we presume that the HSE will deal with these cases sensitively? Why could it not have been explicitly added to the Bill that the HSE &ldquo;shall write to the individual and ask for his or her comments&rdquo;? I do not know, but it was not included in the Bill. Instead section 17(2) states:</P>
    <P LI="1">Where it comes to the knowledge of the Executive that&mdash;</P>
    <P LI="2">(<i>a</i>) all or part of the payment of a prescribed repayment to a person has been procured through fraud or misrepresentation [there is no burden of proof there], or</P><Col N="46"/>
    <P LI="2">(<i>b</i>) there has been an overpayment of a prescribed repayment to, or in respect of, a person,</P>
    <P FLI="0" el="5"><?oasys _is0p10- ?><?oasys _ix ?>then the amount of that prescribed repayment so procured, or of that overpayment, as the case may be, shall be repayable to the Executive on demand.</P>
    <P FLI="0" el="5">We are in very delicate legal territory here. In my view the HSE will receive legal advice to say as little as possible because the more one says the more one is in danger of offering people reasons to go to court. Instead, people will get a brutal one-liner saying they were accidentally overpaid, that they now owe so many thousands of euro and must pay it back immediately. That is what &ldquo;on demand&rdquo; means and these words were not chosen accidentally. It is an extraordinarily brutal piece of language.</P>
    <P>Fraud and misrepresentation are deliberate deceptions practised by some people which we all condemn. The Bill conflates these issues with overpayment. Overpayment is an error on the part of the super-efficient new private body we are to hear about later in the week which need only tell the HSE if a mistake is made for the HSE to write to the individual demanding repayment.</P>
    <P>In my Second Stage speech I said the T&aacute;naiste deserved credit for facing up to this problem when other people had ducked it. As a tail-end to a sorry mess perpetrated by this State against its citizens, section 17 reflects poorly on public administration and governance and I could not withdraw this amendment.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>We indicated in drawing up the scheme that we were trying to introduce a simple system that would clarify for applicants how to apply and receive moneys in the most straightforward way possible and without necessitating recourse to legal professionals.</P>
    <P>The manner in which people are written to is an administrative matter. Not everything can be put in legislation like the day on which letters should be written or the type of pen to be used.</P>

   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Ryan is convinced they will receive blunt, one-line letters and that is the worst case scenario. In general, Departments dealing with repayments, such as the Department of Social Welfare, do so in a sympathetic and sensitive way. The sheriff will not be called on the first day, though if moneys were paid in error we have a duty to try to recoup them.</P>
    <P>The oversight committee has been involved throughout the passage of this legislation and it aims to ensure that the processes put in place are appropriate.</P>

   </Speaker>
  <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
  <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 17 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Where did the Government get the advice that a bureaucrat can decide that something has been done through fraud? There is no adjudication by any court on this issue, it is not being suggested that an individual will be brought to court in order retrieve the money. What is being said is that some bureaucrat or whiz kid executive of a new agency will decide that the agency has been defrauded. He or she can write to the HSE, which will in turn look at the case and write to another bureaucrat.</P>
    <P>It should be remembered that we are talking about the most obscure agency the State has ever seen. The incapacity of the HSE to provide information should be mentioned if one wants to reduce six Members to foaming incoherence. It does not matter if the Members are from the Government or Opposition side. No agency I am aware of reduces Members to such foaming incoherence as when they are brought together to list the inabilities of the HSE in dealing with people on the most routine matters. We are now supposed to believe that the agency will develop a significant level of sensitivity. This agency has stated it is not competent enough to hand out money, yet it believes itself to be competent enough to make judgments on whether people committed fraud.</P>
    <P>Where is the legal expertise available to the HSE, which has stated it cannot hand back the money which it took off people? It can apparently only deal with money in one direction. It could take money very efficiently and, as it turned out, illegally. Various agencies could do likewise. Although the executive could take money from one channel, it has found itself incapable of sending money down another channel. Nevertheless, it still feels capable of labelling an action fraudulent.</P>
    <P>There is not even a definition of fraud in the Bill. The executive will apparently recognise fraud and ask for the money back when appropriate. It will be up to the individuals concerned to go to court. The people concerned should be noted, who will be older people, their children, or those in charge of older persons&rsquo; estates. They will start with the old people. The executive will tell these people that they defrauded the executive. That is wonderful.</P>
    <P>One would think that in order to avoid the risk of further hurt to older people, we would have put in place some way of ensuring that such action was not taken unless there is proof. There is no proof. The section states:</P>
    <P LI="1">Where it comes to the knowledge of the scheme administrator that&mdash;</P><Col N="48"/>
    <P LI="2">(<i>a</i>) all or part of the payment of a prescribed repayment to a person has been procured through fraud or misrepresentation,</P>
    <P FLI="0">This does not force the scheme administrator &mdash; a private agency &mdash; to prove anything. The term &ldquo;comes to the knowledge&rdquo; is a wonderful phrase which does not often come up. It is a bit better than an opinion.</P>
    <P>The issue will be handled badly by an agency which will not perform nearly as well the Government would have us believe. The matter of the working families tax allowance in Britain is relevant. It is a wonderful idea which has been handled so badly in Britain that it could well cost the British Labour Party the next general election. A number of mistakes were made in the assessment, and six months later people received a brutal letter looking for money to be returned.</P>
    <P>I do not understand why a simple process was not outlined, particularly for cases where mistakes are made by the paying body. A simple stipulation could have been inserted to reassure people that a process exists to get the mistake adjudicated on by somebody independent, and a way of repaying money could be outlined. This does not relate to staged payments of &euro;20 per month. This outlines payment on demand, or else court proceedings will take place.</P>
    <P>I am surprised. I did not follow the legislation through the D&aacute;il, but once I read the section I wondered where our heart had gone.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>I am a little bit confused about Senator Ryan. An hour ago he told us he was very critical of the appointment of an outside company and he indicated that the HSE was the body to deal with this issue as it had the resources. The Senator is now talking of the poor performance it expects from the executive and its inability to carry out certain functions.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am taking the executive at its word.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>
	<P>We set up a system, and it is important that within the system there is some mechanism for recouping moneys wrongly paid out. A fraudulent claim could be from a person or son or daughter of such person. If moneys have been paid out which should not have been, every effort should be made to recoup them. This is the system we have put in place to do so. I do not imagine too many older people will make false claims.</P>

The oversight committee has been involved in all the drafting of this legislation and it is quite happy with the process we have put in place today. The heavy-handedness predicted by the Senator will not happen. The oversight committee, along with Members in this House, will cast an eye on it.</P>

  <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
  <P Just="Center">SECTION 18.</P>
  <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 18 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
   <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>This section deals with the Comptroller and Auditor General scrutinising accounts, but there is no mention of sanctions. The committee structure within the Houses is quite new by comparison with what is established in other Parliaments, but we have all marvelled at the American committee system in the US Houses of Congress, which have real power.</P>
    <P>I watch &ldquo;Oireachtas Report&rdquo; on a Thursday evening, and every week we see scandalous overruns of taxpayers&rsquo; money by different agencies, with the Comptroller and Auditor General bringing forward reports and them to the cross-party Committee of Public Accounts, whose members then express surprise and shock. Everyone then goes home and no sanctions seem to come about. Nobody is held accountable and nobody appears responsible.</P>
    <P>I fear the same will happen here. It is a pity there is no section detailing who would be held responsible. There is a complete lack of democracy in the health service area. If one asks the Minister for Health and Children a simple question it is bounced back to the HSE and it will take months to get back to the person who raised the question, if it happens at all. If the HSE does reply, God knows what type of an answer it will be. It will certainly not be the answer sought, or it will not be complete. This will be another agency outside the remit of the HSE, the Department of Health and Children and the Minister.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about this although I know nothing can be done at this stage. I hope we do not have a Bill like this again, but in future similar legislation there should be sanctions if people fail to meet targets. In the private sector that would <Col N="50"/>not be tolerated, and it should be no different for the public sector. The public sector is very good in Ireland and has been capable of brilliance and great achievements. Unfortunately, at times, it has gone wrong.</P>
    <P>People should be held accountable and made responsible. At this stage, the taxpayer is blue in the face because of this issue. Recently, in Carlow, sports grants were given out for hundreds of thousands of euro. This was fair enough, although some groups did not get any money. These groups do not mind this so much until they see much squandering of public money in other areas. The issue then sticks in the throat.</P>
    <P>We must introduce sanctions and beef up the Committee of Public Accounts and the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General. We should hold people to account, which is not happening at the moment.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="SeanPower"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Power</NameTxt>

   <Title>International Criminal Court Bill 2003: Second Stage.</Title>
  <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
   <Speaker pid="FrankFahey"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The purpose of this Bill is to give effect in Irish law to the provisions of the Statute of the International Criminal Court, done at Rome on 17 July 1998, otherwise known as the Rome Statute. The Bill creates domestic offences and associated penalties for ICC crimes of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. It enables assistance to be given to the ICC by permitting the arrest and surrender of persons requested by the ICC. The <Col N="51"/>Bill also provides for freezing of assets and enforcement of ICC orders for fines or forfeiture of such assets to the ICC and other forms of practical assistance in the investigation of ICC offences. The Bill also provides for sittings of the ICC in the State and related technical matters.</P>
    <P>Members of this House will recall that this Bill is preceded by a constitutional amendment, which was approved by a majority of voters in a referendum held in June 2001. The amendment was enacted in 2002. It ensures that the State&rsquo;s constitutional obligations will not conflict with the fulfilment of its obligations under the Rome statute since submission.to the jurisdiction of the ICC necessitates a partial transfer to the ICC of the sovereign power of the State to administer criminal justice.</P>
    <P>The International Criminal Court is a new departure in the struggle to bring to justice those who commit crimes against humanity. Unlike previous tribunals, it is the first court to be established on a permanent international basis and it will be in the first court to be in existence before a conflict breaks out. This permanency should ensure a proactive rather than reactive response to such atrocities in the future.</P>
    <P>The framework which paved the way for the establishment of the ICC was to create an independent international court but also a court dependent on the executives of the various jurisdictions which it represents for its functioning. As a result, the court is independent in the exercise of its functions but is, at the same time, dependent on assistance from state parties in bringing perpetrators of ICC crimes to justice.</P>
    <P>The establishment of the ICC has its roots in the 1948 Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide and the Geneva Conventions of 1949. These conventions developed the scope of genocide as a crime against humanity and extended international responsibility into situations of international conflict. During the Nuremberg and Tokyo trials, crimes against humanity were linked to armed conflict. The recent tribunals of the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda have now established these crimes as self-standing to be prosecuted even in the absence of armed conflict.</P>
    <P>These tribunals also served to revive the international momentum for establishing a permanent, international, independent criminal court. The work of the International Law Commission, which were tasked with the development of proposals for a permanent International Criminal Court, culminated in a text finalised at a meeting of the international community in Rome in July 1998. The International Criminal Court entered into force on 1 July 2002, by which time 60 states had ratified the statute. To date, 100 states have become party to the statute.</P>
    <P>The court, which has its seat in the Hague, is comprised of four organs: the presidency, consisting of a president and two vice presidents who <Col N="52"/>are responsible for the administration of the court; the divisions or chambers of the court comprising pre-trial, trial and appeal divisions; the independent office of the prosecutor; and the registry with responsibility for non-judicial administration of the Court. An Irish judge at the International War Crimes Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, Ms Maureen Harding Clark, was elected as one of the 18 judges of the court. At subsequent meetings of the state parties, the prosecutor, deputy prosecutor and registrar of the court were elected. Since their appointment, the various organs of the ICC have been active in recruiting staff, drafting regulations and formulating policies to inform their work, in readiness for the court&rsquo;s first cases.</P>
    <P>The ICC is already operational in that it has received referrals from state parties. These relate to the Ugandan Government&rsquo;s conflict with the Lord&rsquo;s Resistance Army, an alleged incident in Ituri in the Democratic Republic of Congo and an incident in the Central African Republic. These have become the court&rsquo;s first cases. Most recently, the UN Security Council adopted Resolution 1593 on 31 March 2005 referring the ongoing conflict in Darfur to the ICC. This case is important to the ICC because it is the Security Council&rsquo;s first such referral and represents a welcome affirmation of the legitimacy of the ICC. It demonstrates the court&rsquo;s authority and the international community&rsquo;s commitment to ending impunity.</P>
    <P>Another important recent development was the arrest and transfer to the ICC of Thomas Lubanga Dyilo, a Congolese national and alleged founder and leader of the <i>Union des Patriotes Congolais, </i>UPC. This arrest was on foot of a warrant issued by the pre-trial chamber dealing with this referral. The chamber found there were reasonable grounds to believe that Mr. Lubanga had committed the war crime of conscripting and enlisting children under the age of 15 and using them to participate actively in hostilities. While not wishing to pre-empt the outcome of proceedings before the court, this first arrest and transfer to the court marks a significant milestone in its development and demonstrates that the mechanisms established by the Rome statute can have real effect in practice.</P>
    <P>The International Criminal Court brings a new sense of individual criminal responsibility to these international crimes. The ICC jurisdiction extends to offences committed by nationals of state parties, or committed on the territory of state parties and non-state parties who consented to the ICC having a role. This individual responsibility is extended to ensure that any diplomatic immunity attaching to a person because of a connection with a state party is not a bar to proceedings. As in the Darfur case, the court also has jurisdiction over crimes committed in situations anywhere in the world which are referred to it by the United Nations Security Council. In addition to prosecuting the perpetrators of crimes, the <Col N="53"/>court may also prosecute those in authority who order crimes to be committed including Heads of State and government officials. This formulation should ensure that people holding state positions who orchestrate such attacks on humanity cannot hide behind their office so as to evade prosecution. Sections 13 and 61, respectively, of the Bill implement this criminal responsibility.</P>
    <P>Apart from these specific ICC provisions, the Irish courts may apply domestic criminal law principles when considering ICC offences. Under section 3 of the Bill, the courts may also take into account the rules of procedure and evidence, the elements of crime and any relevant judgment or decision of the ICC, together with the preparatory background work in drafting the statute and the published views of commentators on the operation of the statute.</P>
    <P>Individual criminal responsibility is grounded on the principle of complementarity of the Statute of Rome. The ICC is not a substitute for national criminal justice systems in that it will only take on an investigation where a state is unwilling or unable genuinely to carry out the investigation or prosecution. As such, it is an institution to encourage states to prosecute such international crimes rather than seek to diminish states&rsquo; domestic judicial authority. Under Article 14 of the statute, any state party can refer a crime to the prosecutor and no state party has a veto over prosecution. In addition, as previously noted, the ICC may consider offences wherever committed, if referred by the United Nations Security Council.</P>
    <P>In terms of the jurisdiction to be taken by state parties, the statute requires that they provide jurisdiction for crimes committed on the territory of the state, or by a national of the state outside the state. A further category of jurisdiction &mdash; universal jurisdiction &mdash; whereby jurisdiction is adopted over any offence committed in any state by a person of any nationality, was previously adopted in the Geneva Conventions Acts 1962 and 1998 in respect of grave breaches under the Geneva Conventions of 1949 and Additional Protocol 1 to the Geneva Conventions of 1977. As many of these grave breaches are comparable with ICC offences, universal jurisdiction is also adopted in section 12 for those ICC offences, which are also grave breaches. It is a matter for Irish courts to decide, depending on the facts on the particular case, whether the ICC offence is comparable with a grave breach for the purposes of exercising such universal jurisdiction.</P>
    <P Just="Left">The creation of a permanent independent prosecutor who can investigate and prosecute ICC offences is yet another strength of the ICC as compared with previous tribunals. This is of critical importance in cases where democracy has broken down and where state institutions may not be available to undertake such investigations. Section 59 implements this provision in the Irish context.</P><Col N="54"/>
    <P>While such stringent measures are necessary in the prosecution of these crimes, the statute is balanced with equally demanding safeguards to protect the rights of the accused and also to reflect state parties&rsquo; genuine concerns for their sovereignty. This is reflected in the Bill in that, although the Irish High Court in considering a request for surrender may not review the grounds supporting the request as authorised by the pre-trial chamber, there is the possibility of admissibility and jurisdictional challenges.</P>
    <P Just="Left">At each stage in the arrest and surrender process established in Part 3, there is a brake on proceedings to allow for the possibility of admissibility challenges before the ICC. Thus, the Minister may postpone the certification of a request for surrender in section 19 until any challenge to the admissibility of the case or to the ICC&rsquo;s jurisdiction is determined. Similarly, the High Court will not make a surrender order under section 25 if there are challenges to admissibility. Additionally section 27 ensures that a person who has been committed under a surrender order may not be surrendered until 15 days after the order has been made or, alternatively, until all appeal proceedings have been determined. Even after the High Court has made the surrender order, the Minister, under section 31, may still postpone the actual surrender pending the conclusion of any admissibility challenges.</P>
    <P>The statute also recognises the rights of the individual by specifying a schedule of entitlements in Article 55, typical of the standards expected in an Irish criminal prosecution. The statute places particular emphasis on guaranteeing the interests of victims of ICC crimes. This complement of rights creates obligations throughout the Bill, and rather than list these at this point, I will make appropriate references to the rights as I elaborate on individual provisions in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The rights of persons coming before the Irish courts in connection with a domestic prosecution of an International Criminal Court offence are similar to domestic rights during any criminal prosecution. The rights of individuals appearing before the ICC are further protected by the administration of the ICC. Before the prosecutor proceeds with an investigation, the pre-trial chamber of the court must be satisfied that the person has committed a crime within the jurisdiction of the ICC and that the arrest of the person is necessary to ensure his or her appearance at trial. The pretrial chamber must also be satisfied that the arrest of the person is necessary to ensure that he or she does not obstruct or endanger the investigation or court proceedings, and to prevent the person from continuing with the commission of that crime which is within the jurisdiction of the court. Thus, the individual&rsquo;s rights are protected by the pretrial chamber before trial and by the ICC during the trial itself.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the specific provisions of the Bill, which is in six parts and has three schedules. Part <Col N="55"/>1 lays down preliminary matters for co-operation with the ICC and for the hearing of ICC offences by Irish courts. It defines key terms and makes general provisions regarding interpretation by Irish Courts of the Act and of the statute. This part also deals generally with requests from the ICC, including the procedures to be followed where the disclosure of information might be prejudicial to the security interests of the State. Expenses incurred in the administration of the Act are also provided for in this part.</P>
    <P Just="Left">On the effect on Irish criminal law, Part 2 has the greatest impact because it establishes domestic jurisdiction for ICC offences. The existing offence of genocide is consolidated in section 7, while in section 6 existing definitions of war crimes under the Geneva Conventions are expanded and a new offence of crimes against humanity is created. Ancillary offences are created in section 8 while new offences against the administration of justice, either before the ICC or before an Irish court considering an ICC offence, are created in section 11.</P>
    <P>Sections 9 and 10 require the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions before initiating these proceedings, while the gravity of these crimes is reflected in the applicable sentences for these offences which correspond to the penalties in the Rome statute, that is, life for murder or where the seriousness of the offence justifies same and, in all other circumstances, imprisonment for up to 30 years depending on the nature of the offence. The courts may also order a fine or forfeiture in accordance with the Article 77 of the statute. In such instances, the Criminal Justice Act 1994 is triggered to facilitate enforcement of the orders.</P>
    <P>Other sections in this part deal with items such as universal jurisdiction, in section 12, the applicable law in determining whether a person has committed an offence under the Act, in section 13, and provisions for the protection of victims and witnesses, in section 14.</P>
    <P Just="Left">Part 3 deals with requests for arrest and surrender of persons to the ICC in connection with the investigation, prosecution of an ICC offence or, alternatively, surrender to a state of enforcement for the enforcement of an ICC sentence. This part implements the requirement in Article 91(2)(<i>c</i>) of the statute that the requirements are not more burdensome than those applicable to extradition requests in treaties to which the State is a party. This part is informed on the basis that it is a matter for the ICC and not either the Minister or the High Court to question the validity or authorisation of a warrant. The Minister may seek further information in support of a request and the High Court may consider the execution of the warrant of arrest and whether the rights of the individual regarding the arrest have been respected. Any matters concerning whether the warrant of arrest has been properly issued are to be considered by the ICC, and Article 59 of the <Col N="56"/>statute provides accordingly. If the request conflicts in any way with the State&rsquo;s obligations under diplomatic immunity, it is presumed that it is a matter for the ICC to resolve these issues under Article 98 of the statute in advance of making the request.</P>
    <P>Sections 16 to 22 establish the basis for receipt of an ICC request for the arrest and surrender of the requested person. The arrangements are similar to those under the International War Crimes Tribunal Act 1998 in that once a request is received and certified by the Minister to be in order, a warrant of arrest is issued by the High Court. It is appropriate that these requests are considered by a superior court because of the serious nature of the crimes within the remit of the ICC and because the ICC may be requesting the surrender of a person who has not yet been charged, much less prosecuted or convicted of a crime. There are also safeguards from an ICC perspective in that the prosecutor must satisfy the pre-trial chamber of the ICC that there are &ldquo;reasonable grounds to believe that the person has committed a crime within the jurisdiction of the ICC&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The other significant difference from domestic criminal investigation and prosecution is that in urgent cases a person may be detained on a provisional arrest warrant issued by the High Court for up to 60 days, as required by the statute, pending the receipt of a formal request from the ICC. While provisional arrest warrants are not unusual in extradition proceedings, this detention period is in contrast to a maximum detention of 18 days in extradition cases.</P>
    <P>Section 18 provides for situations where there is an extradition request competing with the ICC request. If the competing request is received from another state party or from a third state where no international obligation exists to comply with the request, the Bill gives priority to the ICC request. Where there is an international obligation to consider, the Bill lists the factors to be taken into account before any decision is reached.</P>
    <P>Once arrested, sections 23 to 29 require that a person be shown a copy of a warrant of arrest either at the time of arrest or within 24 hours of arrest and also requires that the person be brought immediately before the High Court. The High Court, on being satisfied that there are no outstanding issues of admissibility, may make an order for surrender to take place not earlier than 15 days after the making of the order. In accordance with the rights articles of the statute, the person must also be provided with a competent interpreter and legal aid where necessary.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides that the High Court has the powers of adjournment, remand and bail including, but not limited to, the powers of the High Court in criminal matters. Included in these powers is provision for an appeal on a point of law to the Supreme Court against an order to grant or refuse surrender. The <i>habeas corpus</i> pro<Col N="57"/>cedure under Article 40.4.2 of the Constitution will also be available.</P>
    <P>Once a surrender order has been made by the High Court, it is a matter for the Minister to arrange for the surrender of that person and sections 29 to 33 provide accordingly. The person concerned may consent to surrender in which case the previously mentioned time limits do not apply. Provision is also made for the Minister, in consultation with the ICC, to postpone the making of a surrender order pending the finalisation by the court of any admissibility or jurisdictional challenges or pending the conclusion of domestic investigations or proceedings, excluding extradition proceedings. Where it is necessary in the interests of the person&rsquo;s health, provision is made for alternate custody in a hospital pending surrender. Where it appears to the Minister on the basis of information received that the request for surrender is not being proceeded with, provision is made for the person to be released. In any event, once all appeal proceedings have been concluded and where there are no postponements in place or health considerations preventing surrender, the High Court may order the release of the person from custody if the person is not surrendered within one month of the surrender order being made.</P>
    <P>The final provisions of this part, sections 34 to 36, provide for the possibility of subsequent arrest or surrender following release under this part and also provide for sentence calculation for persons already in detention for other offences at the time of the arrest and surrender. The Minister may also waive the rule of speciality and consent to a person being proceeded against for any conduct committed prior to surrender other than the conduct for which he or she has been surrendered. This waiver may be subject to the receipt of any information or assurances as may be necessary from the ICC.</P>
    <P>Part 4 establishes the co-operative framework to enable compliance with ICC requests to freeze and subsequently confiscate assets of the accused. Article 77 of the statute provides that fine and forfeiture orders may be imposed in addition to prison sentences. The imposition of fines is governed by the rules of procedure and evidence of the court while proceeds, property and assets derived directly or indirectly from ICC crime may be forfeited without prejudice to the interests of bona fide third parties. The statute also envisages the establishment of a trust fund for the benefit of victims of ICC crimes and for the families of such victims. Using this fund, the ICC may order money and other property collected through fines or forfeiture to be paid over to the fund.</P>
    <P>The procedures established in this part follow the precedents established in the Criminal Justice Act 1994 with some minor amendments because the ICC rather than individual states is making the request for freezing or confiscation of assets. There are also some changes in the notification arrangements to reflect working arrangements of <Col N="58"/>the various other organisations involved in the enforcement of these orders.</P>
    <P>Part 5 makes provision for other forms of assistance to the ICC in the investigation or prosecution of ICC offences. With the exception of section 56, which relates to transit of surrendered persons through the State as provided for in Article 89(3) of the statute, the authority for the requests in this part is derived from Article 93. The provisions in this part are again to a large extent modelled on the provisions of the Criminal Justice Act 1994 but are repeated as the requests are originating from the International Criminal Court rather than an individual state as under the 1994 Act. Also, as the requests are from the ICC, procedures are simplified where possible while at the same time affording the individual the same rights as in a criminal investigation in the State.</P>
    <P>The assistance provided in this part ranges from the provision of identification evidence in section 50 to location of persons, examination of sites, including the exhumation and examination of grave sites and provision of documents in section 51. This part also provides further practical investigative assistance in the service of ICC documents, including a summons by the garda&iacute; in section 54. Additional information may be sought by either taking evidence before a District Court judge under section 52 or, under section 53, questioning of a person by the garda&iacute; on behalf of the ICC. Section 55 also provides for the transfer of a prisoner to the ICC for the purposes of providing information.</P>
    <P>The general framework for requests under this part is that the Minister on receipt of a request and having considered the request will forward it to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for attention. The Bill provides for the involvement of the District Court in the authorisation of warrants and orders to proceed in cases of refusal to comply with requests for identification evidence or obstructing the locating of persons or property.</P>
    <P>This framework seeks to establish a balance between, on the one hand, assisting the ICC in the investigation of these most heinous forms of crime and, on the other, safeguarding the rights of those subject to ICC requests. This balance is struck both by reference to the statute provisions and also by way of specific safeguards in the Bill.</P>
   <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
    <P>Where co-operation involves the direct participation of the individual, as in the case of fingerprinting, questioning, taking of evidence, transfer of a prisoner to the ICC and, as far as possible, in connection with searches of property, the consent of the person involved must be sought. In addition to consent, a person being questioned in connection with an ICC offence must be informed of his or her rights under Article 55 of the statute and must be provided with a competent interpreter and legal assistance where necessary. These safeguards also apply to any person giving evidence where it appears that there are grounds for sus<Col N="59"/>pecting that the individual has committed an ICC offence.</P>
    <P>Where a person is being questioned by the Garda, section 53 provides a further safeguard in fulfilment of an ICC obligation, that the questioning be video recorded and the recording forwarded to the ICC. In the case of the person giving evidence before the District Court under section 52, the person will not be compelled to give any evidence to the District Court that he or she would not be compelled to give in criminal proceedings in the State. Where necessary the judge may also direct that proceedings be held in private so as to ensure the attendance and protection of witnesses, and to protect victims, or indeed, persons alleged to have committed an ICC offence. This part also provides for the service of documents. If the document is a summons requiring attendance before the ICC as a witness, section 54 requires that it be accompanied by a notice highlighting that different procedures may apply in the ICC compared with criminal proceedings in the State. The notice must indicate that the ICC has provided, or has the authority under Article 93(2) to provide, an assurance that the person will not be prosecuted, detained or subjected to any restriction of personal freedom by the ICC in respect of any act that preceded his or her departure from the State.</P>
    <P>There are three summary offences created in this part. Section 51 provides for two offences in respect of obstructing a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in carrying out a search or failing to provide such information as is requested by the Garda Commissioner in carrying out the request. Section 52 creates an offence where a person who is giving evidence to the District Court on an ICC offence, without reasonable excuse fails or refuses to comply with a requirement to produce a document or other item to the court. Although the District Court may order the arrest of a person, who refuses to attend a Garda station to provide identification evidence as requested by the ICC, section 49 does not create an offence if that person refuses to give the identification evidence sought. This is in recognition of the person&rsquo;s right to silence under Article 55 of the statute. However, the fact that the person did not consent, will be recorded in the Garda report forwarded to the Minister for transmission to the International Criminal Court.</P>
    <P>Section 57 &mdash; the final section of this part &mdash; provides that the enumerated assistance does not preclude giving any other lawful assistance to the ICC.</P>
    <P>The final part of the Bill, Part 6, deals with miscellaneous matters arising in connection with the ICC sitting in the State to hear cases, immunities and privileges relating to the ICC and technical matters associated with the operation of the Bill. Section 58 takes account of statute provisions whereby the ICC may sit outside the seat of the court in The Hague by providing that the ICC <Col N="60"/>may, while sitting in the State, perform its functions under the statute and has the effect of applying the statute as though the ICC was sitting in The Hague. For this reason, orders made by the ICC during a trial in the State are not reviewable by the Irish courts. This part also provides for investigations in the State by the ICC prosecutor.</P>
    <P>Sections 60 and 61 are concerned with immunity under the statute. First, there is immunity for all the judges, the prosecutor and all other staff and persons as required by the statute and further detailed in the Agreement on Privileges and Immunities signed by Ireland on 9 September 2003. Section 60 limits the application of such privileges by applying them only in so far as is applicable under the agreement and recognises that these immunities may be waived as provided for under the agreement. Diplomatic or state immunity is not a bar to proceedings under the Act. For information, the text of the agreement is included in Schedule 2 to the Bill.</P>
    <P Just="Left">Section 62 provides that Ireland may ask the ICC for assistance in the investigation and prosecution of an ICC offence for which there is a minimum sentence of five years. Finally, sections 63 to 65 provide for technical matters associated with the operation of the Bill. Section 63 sets out the evidentiary standards of ICC documents coming before the domestic courts. Section 64 provides for regulations in connection with the implementation of the statute to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas. The final section of the Bill provides for consequential amendments to other legislation. These are detailed in Schedule 3. The Defence Act 1954 and the Geneva Conventions Act 1962 are amended so as to align penalties available for ICC offences with comparable offences in these Acts. The Extradition Act is amended so as to apply extradition to ICC offences and to exclude such offences from classification as &ldquo;political offences&rdquo;. The Diplomatic Relations and Immunities Act 1967 is amended to make diplomatic immunity under that Act subject to obligations under the Rome statute. Finally, the Bail Act 1997 is amended so as to include ICC offences &mdash; as serious offences for which bail might be refused under that Act.</P>
    <P>This Bill sends a clear message to the perpetrators of these international crimes that Ireland will not shirk our international obligations in safeguarding international peace from atrocities inflicted on innocent persons in war-torn jurisdictions. It adds another voice to that of the international community in seeking to bring the perpetrators of these crimes to justice. It is a statement of our support for the International Criminal Court, and of our commitment to ensuring that it receives the assistance necessary to meet the challenges of the Rome statute in investigating and prosecuting these crimes.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House and look forward to Members&rsquo; contributions.</P>
   </Speaker><Col N="61"/>
   <?oasys _cl11.5- ?><Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State and this Bill to Seanad &Eacute;ireann.</P>
    <P Just="Left">The Minister of State will be aware that my party has long been a supporter of the establishment of the International Criminal Court and has espoused the need for such a body since the issue was agreed in Rome. The establishment of the International Criminal Court is the most important development in international law since the foundation of the United Nations. For that reason we fully support the Bill before the House this evening. It is a Bill that, after ratification, ensures our domestic law is in compliance with the obligations we undertook when we signed the Rome Statute. The International Criminal Court is an important tribunal that will exist so that we as a collective global people can try individuals responsible for the most serious international crimes &mdash; war crimes and crimes against humanity, torture, enforced disappearances and genocide. Through it we can send out a clear message that humanity will not countenance such activities, regardless of who is committing them. When we consider the enormous suffering that has taken place among our continental neighbours, through two world wars and the recent and ever-present conflicts in places such as Bosnia, Kosovo, Macedonia, Serbia and Chechnya, we clearly see the depth of unnecessary suffering and loss of life that has been imposed on our European brothers and sisters.</P>
    <P>Such conflicts are compounded by the actions of a few tyrants at whatever level they operate, when they rape, ethnically cleanse, murder, kidnap and torture. That is just in Europe. When one looks at the wider world, there is a frightening array of zones wherein war crimes are the norm and genocide is occurring as we speak. Those regions include Rwanda, Darfur, East Timor, Tibet, Palestine, Congo and others too numerous to mention. These are the reasons we need a forum such as the International Criminal Court.</P>
    <P>The court has been in gestation for almost a century. After the First World War, the Treaty of Versailles provided for the establishment of an international tribunal to try the German emperor. Kaiser Wilhelm never stood trial, but efforts after the Second World War were more successful when temporary tribunals were set up in Nuremburg and Tokyo to try the major war criminals. In addition, the Nuremburg charter specified areas that are still considered to be key crimes under international law &mdash; crimes against peace, war crimes and crimes against humanity. In many ways these initiatives were the forerunners of the International Criminal Court. In particular, they forever shattered the notion that state sovereignty could be used as a defence for acts that were considered outrages on the consciences of mankind.</P>
    <P>Thereafter, crimes of genocide and the Geneva Conventions were introduced. The General <Col N="62"/>Assembly of the United Nations asked the International Law Commission to examine the possibility of an international criminal court. As an example of how slowly such matters move, that happened over 50 years ago. The Cold War ensured there was no possibility of getting agreement among nations. Nothing much happened after that until the 1980s. A small country proposed that efforts to establish an international criminal court should be resumed. When people argue that a small country such as Ireland has no role on the international stage, I point to the example set by Trinidad and Tobago in the 1980s, a little country of which most people here have probably never heard until this year&rsquo;s World Cup. It got discussions going again.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, there have been temporary tribunals dealing with the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda. The establishment of those temporary tribunals gave a further impetus to the need for an international criminal court. Given revelations in recent times around the world, one sees even more justification for such a court. In Iraq, a good deal of attention is currently focusing on the recent incidents in Abu Ghraib, but let us not forget that over the previous 20 years a dreadful regime of torture was in place under Saddam Hussein and his lackeys. This did not just occur in Abu Ghraib, but throughout Iraq.</P>
    <P>In recent times we had killing fields in Cambodia, Rwanda and even now the way in which the Palestinians are being treated in the Middle East is contrary to international law. That brings me on to the question of the effectiveness of this court. Ireland is, and should be, an enthusiastic supporter of the International Criminal Court. To some degree it is relevant that the entire global village accepts its jurisdiction. It is probably significant that over 100 countries have ratified the treaty at this stage. It is timely to recall those countries which voted against the Rome statute. Seven countries voted against the statute in July 1988, one of which was the United States, a point to which I will return. China, which is not exactly a bastion of freedom and human rights, also refused to ratify, as did Iraq.</P>
    <P>Israel voted against the statute for its own reasons, which one can see when one examines the state terrorism in which it is indulging at the expense of the Palestinian people. Libya, under the leadership of Mr. Gadaffi, is not a prime example of democracy and human rights, although it is fair to say that Mr. Gadaffi seems to have had some change of heart in recent times, which is to be encouraged. The other two countries which voted against it at the time were Qatar and Yemen.</P>
    <P Just="Left">The countries that do not want international inspection of their actions do not support the proceedings of the International Criminal Court. The United States, prime among such countries, signed the Rome Statute in the final days of Pres<Col N="63"/>ident Clinton&rsquo;s time in office, but it has not yet ratified it. The authorities in that country feel that the US Senate would not ratify it. I have never been considered anti-American, but I question the approach of the American authorities in this respect. Every possible pressure should be brought to bear on the US, as the only global superpower, to encourage it to support the International Criminal Court.</P>
    <P>The Americans stated that they are not against the idea of international accountability for war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity, but that they do not agree with the form of the International Criminal Court. That is probably an easy way out for them. The US is happy for other nations to be bound by the court but it does not want to be bound by the court itself, which is an indefensible position. As a friend of the US, Ireland should continue to impose constructively any pressure it can, bilaterally and through international institutions, to encourage the US to support the court. The support of the US is vital if we want the court to be widely accepted in the short term. I do not doubt that it will be successful in the long term and that in years to come it will suit the US to support the efforts of the court. We have a duty to continue to press the issue with the US authorities.</P>
    <P>One should not forget that the court&rsquo;s operations are under way. It is investigating a case in northern Uganda and it has received a second referral from the Democratic Republic of Congo. It is important not only that the court should be fully established, but that it should be fully accepted and recognised as a body that can bring good to the world. The tribunals at Nuremburg and Tokyo were established by the victors at the time. They were established <i>post facto </i>after Nazism and fascism had been defeated. The advantage of the International Criminal Court is that it is in place now. Those who are tempted to indulge in horrific practices are aware of its existence. They know they may be answerable to the body. It is not a question of getting the international community to support the establishment of such a body subsequently.</P>
    <P>The International Criminal Court, which we have supported from the beginning, has started its work. I have a mild criticism in that it is a little late in the day to put in place measures that should have been put in place some years ago. I accept that there was a need for a referendum, which took place a few years ago to the best of my recollection. I also accept that the Bill, which is quite complex, contains a series of sections aimed at ensuring that our domestic law complies fully with our international obligations. I wish the Bill had been in place when we were ratifying the relevant treaty, which would have been the correct procedure. It is good that the Bill is now before the House and that we are in a position to <Col N="64"/>support it, thereby ensuring we will comply fully with the court in every respect, including in our domestic law.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister of State to consider certain aspects of the Bill. Amnesty International produced a comprehensive document on the Bill, including many comments and recommendations. I hope he will assure me in his closing speech that the issues raised by Amnesty International have been taken fully into account. I do not intend to discuss the document in detail because the Minister of State will have read it just as I have. Amnesty International has raised issues such as increasing to 18 the age at which children may be conscripted or enlisted into armed forces. The existing articles provide that it is a war crime to conscript or enlist children under the age of 15 into armed forces or groups, or to use children under that age to participate actively in hostilities. It is not a theoretical problem because young children are unfortunately being drawn into conflicts in many parts of the world. They are generally not involved in the regular armed forces of a country, but many children are actively participating in hostilities with irregular groups, militias and terrorist groups. There is a strong case for raising the age of prohibition from 15, which was set to comply with the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. I support an approach which would seek a higher standard of protection for children. As 18 years is the age of maturity, there is no case for conscription under that age, nor is there a case for drafting children under the age of 18 into militias and groups.</P>
    <P>An issue which one might not speak about with complete certainty is the voluntary enlisting of children under that age into the regular forces of a country. This might not be as clear cut when talking about apprentices into a regular army or something similar. The case made by Amnesty International on that issue is a good one. It also deals with the issue of other crimes under international law that are not contained in its own statute. I would be in agreement with the thinking on that issue.</P>
    <P>The establishment of the International Criminal Court is the most important progress in international law in many years but I hope that, once it is fully supported by the entire international community, the ambit of the court will be extended. I can envisage the International Criminal Court having jurisdiction at some stage in regard to drug trafficking and issues of that kind, which are of major importance today. I realise that may be well into the future but it is possibly a development that will take place once the court is operational and fully supported by all members of the international community.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael is fully supportive of the International Criminal Court. We want Ireland to comply not only with its obligations, but to take the lead and give an example in ensuring the <Col N="65"/>International Criminal Court becomes a permanent successful part of the international architecture. We do not want it to be merely a symbol but a working body that will help to bring to justice those who are guilty of these outrageous crimes. If the court succeeds in the short term, we will all be pleased and we can then hope to extend its ambit and jurisdiction to ensure it will have an even greater role in international affairs in future years.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and also this legislation. The establishment of an independent International Criminal Court at the Hague is to be welcomed. The fact that it is being inaugurated with 18 sitting judges, including an Irish judge, is very much a step in the right direction.</P>
    <P>In 1948, the United Nations was mindful of the war crimes committed in the Second World War, particularly following the Nuremburg and Tokyo trials. It is welcome that an independent body will now pursue such cases because the argument that the victors adjudicated, so to speak, in trial over the vanquished was a faulty principle which was subsequently open to propaganda. It is important, therefore, that this body is independent, acts independently and that these new crimes of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes are recognised.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that it took 50 years until the statute was adopted in July 1998 in Rome because in the interim many such crimes were committed across the globe. We are mindful of many of them, one of the most notable of which was in Uganda where Idi Amin, the dictator, participated in substantial and brutal genocide and lived out his life in freedom, despite the fact that he was exiled. That sends the wrong message.</P>
    <P>Tribunals have been set up to deal with the atrocities that took place in the Balkans, which were much more recent, but very few of the people involved in those atrocities have been brought to justice. Nearer to home, we all remember Bloody Sunday and the various bombing atrocities that took place on that day. Those atrocities, including the Dublin and Monaghan bombings, would have been worthy of investigation by such an international criminal court to bring the perpetrators of those crimes to justice.</P>
    <P>During war, occupying powers in particular operate with certain impunity where they have gained the upper hand and there must be some way of arresting the worst excesses that occur in such situations. The adage that &ldquo;power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely&rdquo; is true. Therefore, I hope that this mechanism will act as a deterrent to people who may be inclined in that direction and that subsequent to a conflict, such individuals can be held accountable in an international court of law, brought to justice and penalised for such atrocities. The establishment <Col N="66"/>of a permanent court with jurisdiction is welcome in that regard.</P>
    <P>It is good that Ireland has played its part and was one of the first 89 countries to sign up to this initiative. It is highly appropriate that Ireland would have been in the vanguard because our population suffered during the early part of the last century at the hands of British occupying forces, more particularly the Blacks and Tans who committed many atrocities. It is regrettable that Britain is still in denial about that, given the criticism that was recently levelled from many in the establishment at Ken Loach on the showing of his award winning film, &ldquo;The Wind that Shakes the Barley&rdquo;. The release of that film was an opportunity for them to address and put to bed that issue. Obviously with the passing of time nobody will suggest that issue will ever be examined by a criminal court, but it would welcome if such atrocities were recognised and an apology given. The ideal opportunity for doing that was the release of that film.</P>
    <P>While the number of countries which have signed up to this initiative has increased to approximately 100, I agree with Senator Cummins that it is regrettable that while the US and Israel in particular have signed up to it, they have not subscribed to the jurisdiction of the court. Given some of the excesses that have occurred in Iraq and the great suffering of the Palestinian people over many decades, it is important that the rule of law would be seen to operate on an even-handed basis across the world.</P>
    <P>As Senator Cummins said, we are a country which has very close ties with the United States over many centuries and in our fight for freedom it was supportive. Given that the United States is now the only superpower in the world, there is probably an additional obligation on it to be seen to operate within the Geneva Convention and the codes of normality that would apply to civilisation in a war situation. An opportunity has been missed in this regard. The fact that we enjoy freedom in Europe today is in no small measure due to the part played by the US in two world wars. I had strong reservations about the US intervention in Iraq but I did not have the same reservations about its intervention in Afghanistan. The latter threat was a major one that needed to be tackled. It would be a major step in the right direction if America fully subscribed to the objectives and the jurisdiction of this court. In that regard, perhaps it is a welcome indication that the UN Security Council recently referred the case of Darfur in Sudan to that court to be investigated, in regard to which the US abstained, which means it recognised the role and part that can be played by the court.</P>
    <P>As the Minister of State said, we had a constitutional amendment which enables us to pass this legislation without fear of it conflicting with our Constitution. He outlined the various provisions <Col N="67"/>of the Bill such as the arrest, surrender of individuals, the freezing of assets and forfeiture of moneys or assets to the International Criminal Court. I also note that within the Bill there is the question of removing any diplomatic impunity people might have. That is necessary because we cannot have a situation where people who commit such war crimes could subsequently claim some sort of diplomatic immunity.</P>
    <P>We need to be reminded that the International Criminal Court is not a substitute for national law but it encourages the authorities within their own jurisdictions to address and prosecute these crimes when they are committed there. However, where the political situation has broken down or where states are unwilling or unable to do so, then the court comes into play.</P>
    <P>The provision to create a permanent, independent prosecutor who can investigate and prosecute greatly strengthens the operation of the court system and the existence of a pre-trial chamber ensures that the system will be implemented to the best international legal standards. The court will therefore command the respect and support of people around the world, which is essential.</P>
    <P>The provision that emphasises guaranteeing the interests of the victims of such crimes is a welcome innovation. Like other Senators, I have often said that our legislation should lay greater emphasis on the plight of victims, making them more central to the operation of our criminal justice system. We should consider including that principle in some of our domestic legislation. We have debated this before and it has not been accepted but many of us feel it should be, and many victims of crime feel they are left to one side or abandoned.</P>
    <P>The introduction of this legislation sends a message to perpetrators of international crime that Ireland will not be found wanting in ensuring that such people are brought to justice for atrocities they commit, wherever they are. I am glad we are playing our part within the court and will continue to ensure that its operations are effective in bringing such criminals to justice. I hope that by imposing the severe penalties available to it, the court will deter armed forces around the world from rape, murder and genocide. That is in the interests of all humanity and the proper regulation of world affairs.</P>

   <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome this Bill and there seems to be a general welcome for it. We have been waiting for legislation of this kind since the Nuremburg trials of the 1940s to which no doubt <Col N="68"/>many other speakers have referred. It is useful to remind ourselves of the expression of principle given when the Rome Statute was adopted. It reads:</P>
    <P LI="1">The States Parties to this Statute. . .</P>
    <P LI="1">Affirming that the most serious crimes of concern to the international community as a whole must not go unpunished and that their effective prosecution must be ensured by taking measures at the national level and by enhancing international cooperation,</P>
    <P LI="1">Determined to put an end to impunity for the perpetrators of these crimes and thus to contribute to the prevention of such crimes,</P>
    <P LI="1">Recalling that it is the duty of every State to exercise its criminal jurisdiction over those responsible for international crimes, . . .</P>
    <P FLI="0">Hear, hear say I. This is an attempt to introduce ethics into the conduct of international relations, including the horrible practice of warfare which has caused so much destruction and loss of life on this small planet over the centuries. It is a move in the right direction that we are to get some kind of international authority and in a direction on which a distinguished former Member of this House, Mary Robinson, has spoken on many occasions when using the phrase &ldquo;ethical globalisation&rdquo;. I would like to think that is what we are doing here.</P>
    <P>I have some reservations about the Bill, some of which have been mentioned. Senator Cummins referred to Amnesty International&rsquo;s submission. I propose to outline some of its concerns.</P>
    <P>This court was founded in July 1998 at a United Nations diplomatic conference and the treaty that emerged became known as the Rome statute. The United States, under then President Bill Clinton, signed this but after his election in 2001, George W. Bush nullified that signature. This was a very regrettable act, although understandable in pragmatic terms because it might expose some significant figures from the recent American past to scrutiny which they probably would not welcome. This exemption of itself and taking to itself of exceptional status by the United States, has been highlighted by distinguished commentators such as Paul W. Kahn who said:</P>
    <P LI="1">The US claim for special status undermines the very idea of the rule of law as a single, principled normative order to which we are all bound. Even worse, it may undermine the great international effort of the last century to subject the use of force to the rule of law. For the United States to take this position is particularly embarrassing, since it, more than any other modern nation state, has held itself out as committed to and constituted by the rule of law.</P><Col N="69"/>
    <P FLI="0">It is regrettable that the American Government has taken the position of trying to water down or tear up the Geneva Conventions. It had a significant input into weakening even the Rome statute. I speak not as one who is anti-American but as one who is deeply committed to the essential principles of liberty and respect for the rule of law which until recently characterised the American political attitude.</P>
    <P>It is a pity that the Government did not take on board the practice of some other countries to have full consultation with various representative groups, women&rsquo;s organisations, people who represent the victims of torture who have come to this country, lawyers&rsquo; organisations, professional legal bodies, academics and groups such as Amnesty International.</P>
    <P Just="Left">That is why it is important to cite some of their reservations, the questions they raise and some of their requests that this legislation, which is good, be strengthened. For example, the Minister of State and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, have spoken about complementarity and the definition of crimes to be covered by this Act. While one welcomes the criminalisation of crimes such as genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes and so on, some sections of the Rome statute are inconsistent with the stronger provisions we have already enacted in Irish law. This is untidy, creates unnecessary confusion and should be cleared up.</P>
    <P>Some of the crimes under sanctions and the definitions of some listed under Article 8 are much weaker than the prohibitions in other international protocols and treaties which we have signed. By incorporating all crimes as defined in the Rome statute in a lump, we have perhaps weakened our situation in regard to other treaties we have ratified. Amnesty International refers in particular to:</P>
    <P LI="1">. . . the Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 and relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts (Protocol l) and Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 and relating to the Protection of Victims of Non-International Armed Conflicts, (Protocol ll), as well as national laws implementing them including the Geneva Conventions (Amendment) Act 1998.</P>
    <P LI="1">In particular Article 57 (2) (a) (iii) of protocol l prohibits &ldquo;an attack which may be expected to cause incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians, damage to civilian objects, or a combination thereof, which would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage&rdquo;. The definition of this crime in Article 8 (2) (b) (iv) of the Rome Statute is much weaker and because at the urging of the United States of America (USA) it <Col N="70"/>replaces the narrow term &ldquo;concrete and direct military advantage&rdquo; with the expansive term &ldquo;concrete and direct <i>overall</i> military advantage&rdquo;.</P>
    <P FLI="0">Amnesty International suggests the incorporation of Article 8(2)(b)(xx) into national law. It states:</P>
    <P LI="1">[This article] includes the war crime of employing weapons, projectiles and material and methods of warfare which are of a nature to cause superfluous injury or unnecessary suffering or which are inherently indiscriminate in violation of the international law of armed conflict. Such weapons, projectiles and material and methods of warfare must be the subject of a comprehensive prohibition and be included in an annex to the Rome Statute by an amendment to it. There are a number of such prohibited weapons ...</P>
    <P FLI="0">Section 6 of our Bill expressly excludes this. The Government&rsquo;s reason for this is that we must wait a period of seven years for the final ratification and definition. However, other countries, notably Brazil, have got round this in their draft legislation. Brazil provides that war crimes cover any weapons, projectiles, material and methods of warfare that are the subject of a prohibition in any treaty ratified by Brazil. We could have done that and it would have strengthened the Bill.</P>
    <P>There are other aspects of war crimes less serious than genocide or the other crimes listed, for example, unjustified delays in repatriating or freeing prisoners of war or interned civilians once active hostilities have ceased. This has been described internationally as a grave breach, but we have not criminalised it. One suspects this may be on account of American pressure. We merely have to look at the situation in Guantanamo Bay to realise how sensitive an instrument this might be. Americans are still interested in this kind of legislation, even though they have opted out of it.</P>
    <P>Senator Cummins raised the matter of the prohibiting of conscripting or enlisting underage children. Amnesty International states that Articles 8(b)(xxvi) and 8(e)(vii) provide:</P>
    <P LI="1">It is a war crime to conscript or enlist children under the age of fifteen years into armed forces or groups or to use them to participate actively in hostilities ... The Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of children in armed conflict which Ireland ratified on 18 November 2002 establishes a higher standard of protection for children.</P>
    <P FLI="0">The protocol provides for the age of 18. We signed that agreement so why do we not have the imagination and wit with this Bill to go for what we have already agreed in other elements of the law? People under 18 need this kind of protection. Amnesty International clearly states that as <Col N="71"/>a result of its research, it believes that voluntary or compulsory recruitment by governments or armed groups of people or children under the age of 18 can jeopardise the mental and physical integrity of these people.</P>
    <P>There are other crimes not contained in the Rome statute, for example, torture, extrajudicial executions, etc. As my time is short I will just list some of the other areas of concern such as the question of jurisdiction over past crimes, the notion of a statute of limitations and the question of command and responsibility.</P>
    <P>With regard to the notion that civilians have less to fear from this Bill, I would call that the &ldquo;Rumsfeld exemption&rdquo; because of people like him who sit at desks away from the armed conflict and protect themselves. I am happy to hand over to my colleague, Senator Henry.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and welcome this Bill which has had a long gestation. It entered the Houses in 2003, so it is good to have at this Stage. I hope the Department will now show a sense of urgency with regard to the ratification of the UN convention on biological weapons, something for which we have been waiting a long time.</P>
    <P Just="Left">I am glad Senator Cummins mentioned the countries that did not initially sign the Rome Statute. I am glad also that everybody hopes that we will use our influence on the United States of America to return to the court. The US belonged briefly to it when President Clinton signed, but unfortunately President Bush removed the country from it.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that the Bill should raise the age of enlisting to 18. This would be wise because of our legislation in other areas.</P>
    <P Just="Left">I have concerns about other aspects of the Bill, particularly Part 5, and intend to put forward amendments to deal with those concerns. For example, section 50(1) proposes that a nail or any material found under a person&rsquo;s nail may be considered a bodily sample. I would be dismayed to think we would remove anybody&rsquo;s nail. It should be a &ldquo;nail clipping&rdquo; which would be just as useful to whoever sought the bodily sample. It would be wrong to remove a nail from someone.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides that a doctor will be someone whose name is on the general register of medical practitioners. That is good, but will people on temporary registers also be included? It is important to clarify that point.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides that identification evidence may include a fingerprint, palm print, photograph or bodily sample from a person or any related records. We should include photograph of the iris in this section as these records are frequently used as a final method of identification.</P><Col N="72"/>
    <P>With regard to sending samples of hair, other than pubic hair, for identification purposes, cut hair may be useful for matching hair, although if the hair has been dyed it is more difficult. However, it is important to realise that plucked hairs may be what is required, because material from the hair follicle is necessary for DNA matching.</P>
    <P>These are some areas on which I will propose amendments, but in general I welcome the Bill. Although there has been some criticism of it, it fits in with our legislation and I hope it will be enacted as soon as possible.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="TonyKett"><NameTxt>Mr. Kett</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House. I also welcome the ratification of the International Criminal Court and its responsibilities as outlined by the Minister of State. The enactment of this legislation will ensure that Ireland can now comply with its obligations under the Rome statue to which we have signed up. We will now be able to co-operate with the International Criminal Court in ensuring that those responsible for atrocities will be held responsible. This a landmark development and should probably have taken place many years ago. It has become more possible as a result of the development and enlargement of the European Union and through greater co-operation between the nations of the world.</P>
    <P>At times we have all watched in horror as events unfold on our television screens. Senators Cummins and Jim Walsh mentioned some of those events in Rwanda, Yugoslavia, Bosnia and more recently in Iraq. We can only hope that lessons have been learned by the leaders who replaced the former leaders in these countries and that they will see that as a result of this type of legislation, they can no longer operate in the manner of their predecessors. Legislation and statutes such as this will ensure that such actions will not be accepted by civilised society.</P>
    <P>The Irish people should be commended for endorsing these proposals in 2001. The horrible torture of prisoners in recent times, particularly associated with Iraq, has brought the issue of impunity for war crimes into sharp focus. The disappointing element with regard to the legislation is that we cannot go after these criminals retrospectively. I wonder whether there is a way that we can work within the laws existing at the time to chase them down. The number of countries signing up to these proposals makes the will of the majority of the international community clear. All nations must now ensure that there are no exceptions or exemptions from this type of prosecution. Regardless of position or rank, if people fall foul of the system, it must meet them head on. It is imperative that no one should be deemed to be immune from the rigours of this type of legislation. If the International Criminal Court is to be taken seriously, to be effective and <Col N="73"/>to operate as a legitimate instrument for good, it has to be seen to be applicable across the board. In the past, people in authority, including Heads of State and government officials, have ordered their minions, for the want of a better word, to commit atrocities on their behalf. However, they were happy to hide behind these &ldquo;lesser mortals&rdquo; when the time came to pay the price for their actions. I hope the formation of the court will ensure there is no hiding place for such individuals.</P>
    <P>When one considers that a statute of this nature was first suggested in 1948, following the terrible atrocities of the Second World War, it is hard to believe that Ireland and other countries have not implemented it before now. The designation of crimes of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes followed the terrible events of the Holocaust. We did not have to wait until the 1940s to bear witness to atrocities of that nature. Such crimes were also committed during the First World War and during various instances of colonisation in the 19th century. We can find examples of such activities closer to home, for example during the plantation, when people were removed from their homes to facilitate planters. I do not doubt that atrocities about which we are not fully aware were probably committed during that time.</P>
    <P>It is somewhat disappointing that the United States of America has chosen not to sign up to this agreement, which is something to which other Senators have alluded. The US is a superpower, as we know, but it can sometimes be deemed to be a superbully. I speak as someone who supports the US and feels that the world is a safer place for its efforts, despite some of its behaviour in certain regions. I hate to think of the unsavoury outcomes in some countries throughout the world if the US had not been of assistance. The US has the might and it has the mien, but it also carries a major responsibility. That is something it has not lived up to in recent times as it did in the past.</P>
    <P>There is an overriding need to ensure that the International Criminal Court upholds the highest standards of justice and fairness. If we address today&rsquo;s atrocities, we will deter tomorrow&rsquo;s killers. The court faces a considerable challenge from the United States, as I have said, because that country has refused to ratify the treaty creating the court. I assume the US believes its domestic legislation is sufficient to deal with its needs. It is refusing to subject its citizens to this international standard. Perhaps it sees it as a European standard rather than as an international standard.</P>
    <P>The US also seems to have decided that the court is an instrument of unchecked powers. My reading of the matter is that such a claim is totally untrue. The US frequently lambastes other countries for human rights violations. It smacks of double standards that while the US has often sup<Col N="74"/>ported war crimes prosecutions against the leaders of other countries &mdash; the prosecution of Saddam Hussein is a prime example &mdash; it is now seeking immunity for its own leaders.</P>
    <P>The International Criminal Court is accountable to an assembly of member states. The assembly chooses its own prosecutors and judges. Ireland is happy that one of its own judges, of whom we are extremely proud, is now working with the court. It is not surprising that the court consists mainly of democratic states which are deeply committed to the values under which the court was founded. Similarly, it is not surprising that the countries which have not signed up to the treaty under which the court was established are, by and large, among the worst violators of human rights in the world. It is a poor show that the Bush Administration has suggested that the US will withhold military aid from countries which have joined the court but have not signed an agreement with the US stating that they will not extradite US citizens to the jurisdiction of the court. That very punitive policy is aimed at countries which are trying to protect the human rights of their citizens. It shows the US in quite a poor light. I have heard it stated that the US will veto any extension of that country&rsquo;s peacekeeping mission to other areas unless the US armed forces receive guarantees of immunity.</P>
    <P>The introduction of this Bill is a good move on the part of the Government. I wish the Minister well with this legislation, which will be very effective.</P>
   </Speaker>
   <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the International Criminal Court Bill 2003. I find it hard to understand why it has taken so long to bring the Bill to the Seanad. As Senators have said, the statute of the International Criminal Court concluded in July 1998. We had a referendum in 2001 and the Constitution was amended in 2002. This Bill, which was published in 2003, was debated on Second Stage in the D&aacute;il in May 2004 and on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il more than a year after that. It has taken more than two years for the Bill to move from Second Stage in the D&aacute;il to Second Stage in the Seanad. I find it hard to understand why such delays were necessary. I propose to tease out some of the issues arising from this Bill on Committee Stage, as appropriate.</P>
    <P>I join other Senators in referring to the United States of America&rsquo;s refusal to recognise the International Criminal Court. Senator Kett mentioned that the US has asked countries like East Timor to declare their support for the US position if they wish to receive aid from that country. A couple of speakers highlighted our support for the US. We should make our support for the US and our relationship with that country conditional on its signing up to the International Criminal Court. Tomorrow evening, the House will debate the problems with Ireland&rsquo;s policy on extraordi<Col N="75"/>nary rendition flights, which is an issue that was highlighted in a recent report prepared by the Council of Europe. It is very disingenuous of the Taoiseach to say things like &ldquo;show me the evidence&rdquo;. It is quite obvious and logical that the Council of Europe means that Ireland is not doing its basic duty as a democratic country, which is to vindicate human rights &mdash; and the various conventions on human rights to which it has signed up &mdash; by putting in place certain practices and procedures relating to the use of its airspace by foreign aircraft, etc. Ireland is colluding with the US by failing to put in place the procedures which should be in place. If Ireland and other European countries do not stand up to the US on issues like the recognition of the International <Col N="76"/>Criminal Court and the continuation of extraordinary rendition flights through our airspace, it will not be a surprise if the US continues to rest on its reputation of being a democracy and having good relationships with European countries.</P>
    <P>That is all I would like to say on the International Criminal Court Bill 2003 at this stage. As I have said, I will tease out the various issues on Committee Stage.</P>
