	<P>I have received notice from Senator Henry that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Health and Children to outline the continued delay in the long-awaited report on the fortification of bread and flour in Ireland with folic acid.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Browne of the following matter:</P>
      <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Transport to outline if he has made inquiries with Ryanair regarding the recent flight that was directed to Prestwick due to a bomb scare.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator McCarthy of the following matter:</P>
      <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Finance to furnish a report on the up-to-date progress of the much-promised and long-overdue refurbishment works at Dunmanway Garda station, County Cork, and to outline when the works will commence.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Ulick Burke of the following matter:</P>
      <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to indicate when she will approve the finance for the extension to the Mercy College secondary school, Woodford, County Galway, which is grossly overcrowded.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment. I have selected the matters raised by Senators Henry, Browne and McCarthy and they will be taken at the conclusion of business. Senator Ulick Burke may give notice on another day of the matter he wishes to raise.</P>

    <Title>Order of Business.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>The Order of Business is Nos. 1, 2 and 24, motion 23. No. 1 is a sessional order <Col N="674"/>as agreed by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and will be taken without debate; No. 2, statements on the peace process in the Middle East, to be taken on the conclusion of the Order of Business and to conclude not later than 5 p.m., spokespersons have ten minutes, other Senators have six minutes and Members may share time, the Minister shall be called upon to reply not later than five minutes before the conclusion of the statements; and No. 24, motion 23, shall be taken from 5 p.m. to 7 p.m.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>We agree to the Order of Business. Since the House last met before Easter there have been two significant developments with regard to the peace process in Northern Ireland. Earlier this week we saw the first positive engagement by the Democratic Unionist Party with the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body, which I warmly welcome. Many people never thought they would see the day when the DUP would meet with British and Irish parliamentarians in such a friendly and cordial way.</P>
      <P>The other development occurred today with the publication of the IMC report. It is the most positive report to date on the issue of removing the paramilitary threat from this island. Clearly, work remains to be done and there are outstanding issues but both developments point to a positive few months ahead. All Members of the House hope that circumstances will be such in October or November next to allow the full restoration of the institutions under the Good Friday Agreement.</P>
      <P>As somebody who was mildly sceptical of the 1916 commemoration, I was very proud of the Irish Army on Easter Sunday and of its contribution and role. I was proud to see the Army demonstrate, and to see the Irish people recognise, that it is the legacy of the 1916 Rising. Was it not great to see, for once, the goose stepping black beret brigade put into the second division on that day?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I believe the involvement of the Democratic Unionist Party with the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body, even if only as guests and visitors in Killarney during the week, was a very significant step which has been understated to a significant extent by the media. People appear to have forgotten that no Unionist party has previously involved itself with the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body. This is a major step forward and should be seen as such. We hope the party will move further.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I also wish to refer to the Easter Sunday commemoration and to build on the point made by Senator Brian Hayes. There was an even more significant point to the occasion. For the first time ever, Sinn F&eacute;in was on the reviewing platform outside the GPO on Easter Sunday acknowledging the members of the Irish Army marching <Col N="675"/>down O&rsquo;Connell Street, wearing their cap and lapel badges, as &Oacute;glaigh na h&Eacute;ireann. It is the first time since 1926 that Sinn F&eacute;in acknowledged &Oacute;glaigh na h&Eacute;ireann as being the Irish Army. That is the truly significant issue.</P>
      <P>I also agree that the second parade of balaclavas, black berets and so forth looked tired and very yesterday, as it were, and that is how it should be seen. That day has passed and we have moved on. I welcome the fact that Sinn F&eacute;in acknowledged &Oacute;glaigh na h&Eacute;ireann on O&rsquo;Connell Street on Easter Sunday as the true and absolute successors of the patriots of 1916. I speak as somebody who also wanted the parade to involve more than the Army.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>It would be churlish not to acknowledge the progress that has been made. However, I hope that those who now recognise that the Army of this State is &Oacute;glaigh na h&Eacute;ireann will sometime soon recognise that they do not own the word &ldquo;republican&rdquo; either. A prominent member of Sinn F&eacute;in said he could not be at the GPO because he had made an arrangement with republicans in Cork. There are two republicans from Cork sitting on opposite sides of this House and he made no arrangement with us.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P Italics="Y">(Interruptions).</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Order, please.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is the only word I would dispute with our friends from the DUP &mdash; their willingness to allow one party to take over that word. It is time we took it back from them.</P>
      <P>I would be reluctant to cause the slightest bit of rancour about the 1916 commemorations, even though I recorded a slightly dissenting view in one of the newspapers recently. Like others, I have received an invitation to attend a solemn requiem mass for the souls of those who died for Ireland in the 1916 Rising.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>That is the Army one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Some 90 years on we could offer the mass for everybody who died, not just those who took a particular view. It is long enough behind us now to recognise that civilians were also killed, who did not think they were dying for Ireland at the time, in addition to policemen and British soldiers. A mass for those who died in 1916 would be a small gesture in the direction of that word &ldquo;inclusiveness&rdquo;, although I suspect we will end up with the exclusion of a worthy priest from this island for a while, but that is a separate issue.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to cavil about 1916 but I and other members of the Labour Party are more than a little surprised that the biography of James <Col N="676"/>Connolly on the Taoiseach&rsquo;s website forgets to mention that Connolly founded the Labour Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>He is a socialist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarcMacSharry"><NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad the Senator is looking at the Taoiseach&rsquo;s website.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>Did the Senator not know he is a socialist?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I was half expecting to see that somehow or other James Connolly had founded Fianna F&aacute;il, given that party&rsquo;s inclusiveness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>That will be on the website.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Perhaps one of my colleagues on the Government benches will draw the Taoiseach&rsquo;s attention to what I am sure was an accidental omission, or perhaps the Labour Party just cannot get on the Taoiseach&rsquo;s website.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator should speak on the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am seeking a debate on the prohibition of religious advertising on the Irish broadcast media. It seems to me that every crackpot superstition can be advertised, including tarot cards or psychics live. Recently, I heard one of the Sunday newspapers advertising somebody who was going to tell us all about angels in two parts. I do not know whether the angels were in two parts or the article. It is astonishing that any kind of crackpot superstition can be advertised on our broadcast media but rational &mdash; although people may disagree with my use of that word &mdash; religion is prohibited. That is a daft and ludicrous situation. It is the direct opposite of any kind of genuine pluralism.</P>
      <P>I am most disappointed at the closure of St. Michael&rsquo;s school in Inchicore. I chaired the task force which began the process of regeneration of the St. Michael&rsquo;s estate. An independent chairman was needed and since I was from 162 miles away nobody could believe I had any vested interest. It was a difficult but satisfying task.</P>
      <P>It was clear that in addition to housing, the local community needed educational and other services. To deprive that community of any such services will undermine the regeneration process. I appeal to the Minister for Education and Science in that regard because the issue is about resourcing. The school was not satisfied that it was getting sufficient resources so I appeal for them to be provided.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Perhaps somebody can tell me whether we have abolished the common travel area. At the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body meeting in Killarney, an irate member of the British House of Commons said he had been asked to provide identification on arrival in Ireland, although he thought he was within a common travel area. He had his passport, as it happened, but he was told <Col N="677"/>he would not be let in unless he produced some form of identification. That is not what we understood a common travel area to be. If it has been abolished, that fact should at least be announced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>On the last point, over the years many of us had to present our travel documents when we got to the other side.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Ms White</NameTxt>
	<P>We still do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>Perhaps, therefore, it is not inappropriate. It has nothing to do with a common travel area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I was asked for my boarding pass, that was all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Order, please.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I join Senator Brian Hayes and others in welcoming the developments taking place in Northern Ireland. I particularly welcome the findings of the Independent Monitoring Commission that the IRA has turned its back on paramilitary violence, and is not training or preparing for action. That is a significant step forward that underlines the capacity to build an executive and assembly.</P>
      <P>I also agree with Senator Brian Hayes&rsquo;s point about the presence of the Democratic Unionist Party at the meeting of the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body in Killarney. That was a positive development, as was the presence today of Prince Philip at the President&rsquo;s award, Gaisce, and that he stayed for lunch in Iveagh House.</P>
      <P>In light of these developments one hopes we will reach the point at which the executive will be established after the assembly meets in mid-May, which would be a good time for us to debate these matters, rather than in the immediate future. I hope relations with Britain are becoming so normal that we can look forward to the arrival of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth in this country where I am sure she will receive a good c&eacute;ad m&iacute;le f&aacute;ilte.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>As one of those who thought it appropriate that the army of the sovereign state should march in commemoration of the 1916 Rising, I was glad to see the Irish Army on O&rsquo;Connell Street. I do not disagree with Senator Ryan&rsquo;s comments about inclusiveness, and remembering all those who died in the service of the State, but we do so on the national day of commemoration in Kilmainham, which has been inclusive for a considerable time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>Some time ago in Limerick there was significant fundraising activity to establish a private facility for cancer sufferers. This is on the campus of the regional hospital and has been quite a success. It is staffed by a private hospital <Col N="678"/>group providing a very effective service in the area.</P>
      <P>A few months ago in this House I requested of the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Tim O&rsquo;Malley, that the Health Service Executive provide appropriate funds to the private facility for public patients attending there. A promise was made at the time that this funding was on its way. I am disappointed it has not materialised. Will the Leader ask the Minister for Health and Children to ensure this happens as soon as possible?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Ryan reminded me of what must have been a sight to behold when the deputy leader of the Labour Party, Deputy McManus, recently dressed up as a founding member of Fianna F&aacute;il, Countess Markievicz.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>She did that the day after the parade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator should speak on the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sorry we missed the sight. I hope we can see a video of it somewhere. It must have been wonderful indeed to see a wolf dressed in sheep&rsquo;s clothing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>We are very inclusive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator should confine himself to the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>It was hard to resist that.</P>
      <P>On the Order of Business, will the Leader consider holding a debate on waste management? There is a seminar on this topic today in north Donegal. The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government could update us on Government policy. This is an important issue, in which we can play a role.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>Does that include waste of public money?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>As waste and energy are the major issues of the day, could we also have a debate on energy policy to discuss the use and lack of energy, the importation of fuel, our own resources, utilisation of wind and wave power, the growing of rapeseed and so on? We should work on this and have a full debate with the Minister who could outline the policy and plans for use of the ground. Senator Callanan made a good point in that regard in the House recently. It would be worthwhile if both Ministers made themselves available to come to the House for a detailed debate on energy policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>A report has been produced by the Departments of Social and Family Affairs, the Taoiseach and Finance on proposals for assisting lone parents. When the Minister for Social and <Col N="679"/>Family Affairs was in the House dealing with the Social Welfare Bill I asked if we could debate that report as soon as possible because it contains many useful suggestions. The Minister is meeting lone parents and people from agencies who are trying to help lone parents with families. I ask the Leader to provide time to debate that report as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>If there was one over-riding message that came out of recent Northern Ireland related events it was one of unity of purpose, people coming together for a common cause. That common cause had nothing to do with sectional interests; it was about Ireland. If one considers the different elements of what we have been discussing here today, the attendance of the DUP members at the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body meeting in Killarney was an acceptance by them that their democratic mandate was respected and that people expected them to act on that, in the same way the IMC report has underlined clearly that republicans have committed themselves to the Good Friday Agreement and their responsibilities in that regard.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The 1916 commemoration was very important for all people of a republican outlook because in many ways it showed the legitimacy of our aspiration and indeed the legitimacy of the 1916 Rising. From now on we must in some way engage on a daily basis, not just in formal meetings or commemorations, to highlight the issues that have divided us in the past and the wrong perceptions that were put out, often for political expediency. We must examine the ways in which the formal and other elements on this island can interact because I have no doubt that we are very close to the endgame. Thousands of people have made a contribution to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Ms White</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>Many made that contribution when all seemed helpless and they should be remembered but I have no doubt that at this time the main focus is Ireland&rsquo;s welfare and potential. This is a good day for this House and a good era for the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Over the past four or five months, oil distribution companies in the west have been taken through the courts by the Competition Authority with regard to price fixing. Thankfully, they have been dealt with appropriately but it appears now that that idea is being taken up in the waste collection area. Allegations were made against five refuse collection companies in the west and it is regrettable that the Competition Authority had to raid premises to get the facts. Those companies had agreed to divvy up the business among themselves in one county in the west, denying competition within the service. <Col N="680"/>It would be unfortunate if the allegations that the local authority has given its blessing to that activity were correct. In the case of County Galway, one private company, Greenstar, having taken over a whole facility in County Galway is now denying individuals the right to use that facility and will only allow registered waste contractors access thereto. Indeed, most people from County Galway who have to dispose of waste privately must go to Athlone and in terms of the journey from Clifden to Athlone, we might as well go from Athlone to Dublin with it. Senator Leyden is correct in calling for a debate on waste management because it is urgently needed. The Senator spoke about Government policy on waste management but it does not have such a policy.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has stated that an incinerator will not be located in his constituency, while the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government will not allow an incinerator in his constituency in County Wicklow, despite the fact that the majority of illegal dumps are found in that county.</P>

	<P>Name and shame.</P>

	<P>Fine Gael does not want an incinerator in County Roscommon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>Would Senator Ulick Burke like an incinerator?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>It is important that we have a debate to resolve these difficulties and discover whether the Government has a policy on waste disposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrMauriceHayes"><NameTxt>Dr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I was also lucky enough to attend the meeting of the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body in Killarney as an observer. Like other Members, I welcome the developments which took place at the meeting. We should not underestimate the political fortitude of the members of the DUP who attended the meeting and the measured way in which they put their case. The fact that they wanted, and were willing, to share power in government gave me some hope. They wanted, and were prepared to be convinced. The IMC report is extremely important but a second clear report would be crucial.</P>
      <P>For the next month at least, we should concentrate on getting the parties in the North into double harness. We should be careful not to introduce extraneous demands which might frighten the horses. I ask the Leader to offer our best wishes to the Taoiseach in the negotiations he is about to undertake with the parties in the North. I would also remind him that while everyone recognises that the main protagonists are <Col N="681"/>clearly the DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in, it is important to also recognise the part played by other parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Mr. Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I also welcome the IMC report. However, I noted with alarm the fact that a young man who had driven through a checkpoint in County Down was shot dead over Easter. Such a response is not appropriate in peacetime when there are alternative responses available, such as slowly bursting the tires of cars so as not to endanger anyone. It is sad to see a young man die in peacetime for the sake of a car and a joyride. The response taken was unnecessary. In light of further confirmation from the IMC, armed forces in the North could be stepped down and take a less belligerent approach to anyone who drives through a checkpoint. I acknowledge that driving through a checkpoint is a serious matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrMauriceHayes"><NameTxt>Dr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>What do we have a police ombudsman for?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Hanafin, without interruption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Mr. Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Maurice Hayes is correct.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I also believe that advertising for religious purposes in broadcast media should be permitted. Such advertising is necessary in today&rsquo;s climate. This is because a deluge of information about misconduct and mistakes within religious institutions over 60 years has rightly been divulged over the past few years. Young people, who are very impressionable, might receive the wrong slant as a result. Allowing advertising for religious purposes might bring people back to religion. I do not care what religion we are talking about. I share Senator Ryan&rsquo;s views on allowing advertising for religious purposes in broadcast media. Tarot readers, various helplines and expensive lines which charge &euro;1 per minute are permitted to advertise in such media but churches and religious orders are not.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>The land area off our coasts is three times that of this island. Given the amount of blocks which have been given to exploration companies, the Government should ensure that these companies either use or lose them. The price of oil is increasing continuously, yet we have a considerable bank of reserves off our coasts which must be explored and brought on shore.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>The largest ever nuclear disaster took place 20 years ago today in Chernobyl, Ukraine. I thank the Cathaoirleach for giving me the opportunity to recognise what the people of Ukraine and Belarus have suffered since then and will continue to suffer for generations to come. It is a good reminder when we speak about nuclear energy, in particular because the Sellafield site is adjacent to Ireland. We must empathise with and learn from what occurred at Chernobyl. In recent <Col N="682"/>years, I had the honour to visit Belarus and be allowed into the exclusion zone. I saw the stark reality of the disaster&rsquo;s impact. I also recognise the generosity of Irish families and people who, over the past 20 years, have extended the hand of friendship to Belarussians in particular by bringing their children to Ireland for health reasons and rest periods. This is a wonderful service to the people of Belarus and the Ukraine and I hope it will continue.</P>
      <P>The Irish people are noted for their generosity to people in need but I will compare this example to the racism we are tolerating in parts of Ireland towards individuals who have come to live here. In my area of Dublin 15, the racism and discrimination that people who have been living there for many years and whose children were born in Ireland and are Irish citizens must tolerate is a shame on all of us.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Leader ask the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to outline for the House what he will do to allow people to live safely in their homes? These are people who have settled here but must put up with dreadful intimidation because of the colour of their skin or country of origin. The situation is not good enough. While the majority of Irish people are very good in welcoming people to this country, a small minority causes mayhem. Not enough is being done by the local authorities and the Garda. The Minister has a part to play and it would be a welcome debate.</P>

In a society in which we are trying to involve ethnic groups in the entire democratic process, I was disappointed that the Taoiseach did not include anyone from such groups in the task force on active citizenship. His policy and objective is to achieve far higher standards than heretofore and to recognise what can be done. I believe he will welcome the opportunity to come before this House.</P>

In so doing, I wish to pay tribute to the Christian Brothers and to the staff who taught in that severely disadvantaged area for the past 70 years. It would be a pity to see that area without a school. Members have seen villages and other areas without post offices and banks and it would be a shame if the recently refurbished St. Michael&rsquo;s estate was now to be without a major piece of <Col N="685"/>social infrastructure in the form of a local school. A school in such an area could not and cannot survive without a working principal.

Unfortunately, this happens every so often and the current crisis looks set to worsen before it improves. It is envisaged that a litre of <Col N="686"/>petrol will shortly cost &euro;1.25. We must cap the amount of VAT taken on fuel.</P>
      <P Just="Left">At present, it is ridiculous that as fuel prices increase, the Government also receives increased VAT. If the Government parties are genuinely interested in having a proper tax policy, they should cap the amount of VAT taken on fuels to allow for such cases when fuel prices increase. While we cannot control the fuel costs coming into the country, we can control the amount of VAT charged on the fuel. I challenge the Government parties to implement this policy with immediate effect in order to help hard-pressed motorists who are being crippled because of increased costs.</P>

      <P Just="Left">Could a debate on Dublin Airport be organised? I am amazed that Senator Morrissey did not mention it in his earlier comments. Some 120 short-term car park spaces will be lost at Dublin Airport in order to erect a marquee to cope with the summer traffic through the airport, which is farcical. Passengers are now paying for the Government&rsquo;s incompetence and inaction in regard to the airport. Anyone who has been to the airport recently will be aware that it is almost impossible to get car parking space. This is now being reduced by 120 and temporary accommodation will be provided in a marquee on the roof of the car park. It is time we had a proper debate on facilities for passengers and workers at Dublin Airport. As a former Minister for Public Enterprise, I urge the Leader to ask the Minister for Transport to come to this House for a debate on the matter so we can determine if the Progressive Democrats back the policy.</P>

	<P>This House has a proud tradition of acknowledging and recognising commemorative days, one of which we have referred to today. As yesterday was ANZAC Day, I am pleased that a commemorative event took place in Grangegorman war cemetery where 17 Irish soldiers who fought in Gallipoli and elsewhere for ANZAC, the Australian and New Zealand forces, are buried. I am glad to say the Government was represented and that members of the Royal Dublin Fusiliers commemorative association were there to represent the soldiers who died.</P>
      <P>Members of both Houses have relatives who fought in the ANZAC forces. The uncle of my friend and colleague from Kildare, Deputy Durkan, fought for those forces but sadly did not return. Deputy Durkan and I had the dubious pleasure of seeing his name on the wall at Ypres, a very emotional moment, representing our shared heritage.</P>
      <P>I endorse what has been said about the historic events which took place in Killarney. Along with Members of this House, I was privileged to be there on behalf of the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body when the DUP made its historic entrance. The Leader might consider some way of allowing Members of the House who are not members of that body to engage in a dialogue on the extra-parliamentary activities taking place within this island and between the two islands at a parliamentary level. I will not say the British-Irish Council operates secretly, but we do not get much information on what goes on there.</P>

	<P>The British-Irish Interparliamentary Body has meanwhile grown in stature and its <Col N="689"/>credibility has been considerably enhanced as a result of the events of this week. The Good Friday Agreement and subsequent agreements entered into by all parties on this island also allow for the establishment of an all-island parliamentary tier, a type of institution on an all-island basis to which, following the events of Monday, I believe the DUP would be very responsive, so long as it was consulted with and agreement was reached on how the institutions would proceed. The Leader might reflect on how, in this House, we might expand these roles so that all Members can feel included in terms of what is going on, rather than have to read it in the newspapers or hear it from us.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>In its legislative programme, the Government seems to have abandoned plans to introduce a new gaming and lotteries Bill which would amend the completely outdated 1956 Act. In 2000, an interdepartmental group made a number of excellent recommendations. It is a pity this report is gathering dust as the Government does not seem to be doing anything about it.</P>
      <P>Recently, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform again indicated he intends to close the loophole in the law which allows private members&rsquo; card clubs to operate as casinos. He indicated he might do so in the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill but I have read through it and there is no mention of this. I ask the Leader to ascertain the Minister&rsquo;s intentions in this regard.</P>

	<P>I join those who have made favourable comments on the solemn occasion of the Easter 1916 commemoration. I was pleased to be there and all fair-minded people would agree it was a great success.</P>
      <P>Every time we pick up a newspaper or hear or see the news, we are told of terrible criminal atrocities being committed with knives and guns. Though we have debated the matter before on many occasions in this House, it is again opportune for the Leader to invite the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to attend the House for a debate. He has always been responsive to such calls. The situation is very serious. Hardly a day passes when someone is not shot or killed in a knife attack.</P>
      <P>Over the past few years, we have seen a great increase in the population of this country. That is the result of a number of factors, not least because emigration has all but ceased, while for the first time we have immigration. That is enriching, but there are difficulties with regard to school places. I congratulate the Minister for Education and Science for the great strides she is taking in addressing the problem.</P>
      <P>However, those who are making large profits through development will have to come on board and assist in addressing this matter. There are large tracts of land being developed for housing. Those developers should make the appropriate <Col N="690"/>contribution for services. To a large extent that is not happening. In one context it is happening, in another it is not.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Senator Brian Hayes raised the matter of the engagement by the Democratic Unionist Party with the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body in Killarney. It engaged with us in an open fashion. That was a positive and far-reaching development but we should not hold our breath as it will take time for this to work itself through. The deputation would have gone further if it had the authority to so do. Given that it has to report back there was a wariness on its part. The Senator referred to the IMC report, which was positive.</P>
      <P>Senator Hayes also said he was proud of the Army on Easter Sunday, as were we all when we reviewed it on the platform. It was marvellous to be a Member of the Oireachtas and to be invited to such a wonderful occasion.</P>
      <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole rightly said that two prominent members of Sinn F&eacute;in were on the reviewing platform, one of whom is a Member of the other House and the other an elected member from the North. Therefore, there was full participation.</P>
      <P>Senator Ryan said he did not like the way in which the word &ldquo;republican&rdquo; was used in the Cork context as he and his fellow republican were sitting in another bench. He raised the issue of the Army invitation for next week. Senator Dardis answered that point by saying we go to Kilmainham for a day of overall commemoration. Senator Ryan asked that we inform the Taoiseach about the website to which he referred and said that the Taoiseach has forgotten to note that James Connolly started the Labour Party. The Labour Party is the oldest political party in the State.</P>

He also raised the closure of St. Michael&rsquo;s national school in Inchicore, as did Senator Morrissey, and the common travel area. <Col N="691"/>Recently when I travelled to London I had to produce my passport and got very cross about it and said I would not. The official then said that I would not go anywhere. We are asked for our passports even though we should not be asked.</P>
      <P>Senator Dardis welcomed the positivity of the Independent Monitoring Commission and the presence today of a prince from across the water &mdash; we are not allowed mention names &mdash; at the President&rsquo;s award, Gaisce. He was right to bring to our attention the national day of commemoration.</P>
      <P>Senator Finucance raised the issue of fundraising for cancer sufferers. He said the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Tim O&rsquo;Malley, had agreed to look into the matter and to provide the necessary funding and wondered why that had not happened.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>I will take up that matter with him. Senator Leyden called for a debate on waste management and a debate on all kinds of energy. Senator Henry asked about the report on single parents. The Minister for Social and Family Affairs has agreed to come into the House for statements on the matter. The difficulty is in trying to get a date but he is willing to come. We hope a date can be arranged in May. He sent the message to the House because following the previous debate the Senator asked him to attend another one.</P>
      <P>Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; raised the issue of unity of purpose with regard to the North and said we should all move together, given all the positive developments, including the attendance of the DUP at the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body, the Independent Monitoring Commission report and the 1916 commemoration. The Senator made a fine point about the legitimacy of the 1916 Rising. We are having the conversation about the rising which the Taoiseach requested. The answer to questions about its legitimacy, which are often raised, has been set out.</P>
      <P>Senator Ulick Burke noted action taken by the Competition Authority in the west against cartels operating in the sale of oil and diesel and indicated a new cartel is now operating in waste collection, with one company, Greenstar, taking over an entire facility in County Galway. We, in County Westmeath, do not want County Galway&rsquo;s waste but it keeps coming.</P>
      <P>Senator Maurice Hayes referred to the positive nature of the DUP&rsquo;s visit to Killarney and asked that the House offer warm wishes to the Taoiseach. Senators would clearly wish to do so.</P>
      <P>Senator Hanafin raised the case of a young man killed in the North after driving through a checkpoint. The Senator called for advertising for religious purposes to be allowed. He also stated <Col N="692"/>that offshore energy companies should use or lose the exploration blocks they have been awarded.</P>
      <P>I thank Senator Terry for raising the 20th anniversary of the Chernobyl accident. I have noticed an increasing number of newspaper pieces asking why Ireland should not have nuclear energy. We should stamp on such arguments when we see them because we cannot have nuclear power.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator also commended the generosity shown by Irish families to families from Belarus.</P>
      <P>I have heard and read about the firm anti-racism policy operated by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. I agree, however, that there is a deep well of racism here which is very strong in some areas, although only a small number of people contribute to it.</P>
      <P>Senator White referred to several people, all members of the British royal family, about whom Senators may not talk. In a general sense, however, we should welcome them if they visit.</P>
      <P>Senator Quinn requested that the Taoiseach come before the House to discuss the task force on active citizenship. I believe the Senator has already made such a request which was communicated to the Taoiseach. While the Taoiseach indicated he would like to come to the House, I presume the problem is one of time pressure.</P>
      <P>Senator Morrissey asked that the Minister for Education and Science meet representatives of St. Michael&rsquo;s CBS, Inchicore, and ensure it remains open.</P>
      <P>To mark Senator Browne&rsquo;s cards, with the permission of the Cathaoirleach, the House will debate accident and emergency services next week. The Senator wants VAT on fuel to be capped and seeks a debate on Dublin Airport with the Minister for Transport. Senator Feeney stated that her experience of Dublin Airport was most happy. She also took pride in congratulating the Taoiseach and all those involved in the commemorative event to mark the 1916 Rising. The Taoiseach took a risk in that regard. Prior to the commemoration the newspapers featured many letters and articles arguing that it should not take place. While many doubted whether the commemoration should proceed, they quickly limped off after we had our day of celebration. To use an inappropriate phrase, the Taoiseach stuck to his guns and persisted. We all agree the event was a great success.</P>
      <P>Senator Feighan referred to the IMC report and the DUP and wondered why the Taoiseach did not refer to John A. Costello and W.T. Cosgrave in a particular speech. I had a brief word with Mr. Liam Cosgrave on the reviewing stand at the recent commemoration and he was very pleased with the way in which the event passed off.</P>
      <P>Senator Mooney referred to Gallipoli and noted that the Royal Dublin Fusiliers celebrated <Col N="693"/>ANZAC Day. He also asked about the British-Irish Council which I hesitate to describe as a mysterious body, although it certainly does not advertise itself much. The Senator referred to the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body and an all-Ireland parliamentary tier, which is provided for in the Good Friday Agreement, and asked for a general debate on relations between the House and such bodies. That is a good idea.</P>
      <P>Senator Cummins raised the matter of casinos. I understand it was intended the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill would address the issue. I will ask the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform about it.</P>
      <P>Senator Glynn wants a debate on knife crime which is a serious issue. He also asked about a debate on development lands and the setting aside by developers of lands for schools, health centres or whatever is required in the area. This is a good idea and should be developed further.</P>

    <Title>Middle East Peace Process: Statements.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome this opportunity to make a statement to the House on developments in the Middle East peace process. The process has reached a critical point and I know there is concern, and some unease, at recent events and their implications.</P>
      <P>The search for a lasting and peaceful settlement of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has for many years been a central concern of Irish foreign policy under successive Governments. We are consistently active on the issue in the European Union and at the United Nations. This will not change in the difficult weeks and months ahead. Despite the often dramatic developments since the start of the year, the basis of our policy approach remains clear and unchanged.</P>
      <P>The Government and its partners in the EU are convinced that the only route to a just and lasting settlement is through the negotiation of a mutually acceptable two-state solution. This must lead to the coexistence of two viable, sovereign and independent states with agreed international borders. The EU should stay actively engaged, with a clear and balanced approach. We will work to promote an environment for negotiation, despite the obstacles which are so obvious at this point. We will urge that the short-term temptation to pursue the interests of either or both <Col N="694"/>parties through unilateral actions must be avoided. Peace and security for the Israeli and the Palestinian people will only be assured through negotiation and compromise, based on adherence to fundamental democratic principles.</P>
      <P>In the current difficult circumstances, the continuing relevance of the Quartet roadmap of 2002 has increasingly been called into question. None of its detailed timelines has been fulfilled. It will need to be revisited and recast if the peace process is to achieve momentum again. However, it continues to represent the essential set of principles and sequential parallel steps required of Israel and of the Palestinian Authority if there is to be a settlement. The European Union must support Israeli and Palestinian political leaders who recognise the desire of their people for a just solution, and the inevitable need, sooner or later, to meet the obligations identified in the roadmap.</P>
      <P>The prospects for a lasting settlement have been seriously complicated by the decisive victory of Hamas candidates in the Palestinian elections in January. Hamas achieved a clear majority of seats in democratic elections, which were freely and fairly conducted in difficult circumstances. The conduct of the elections and the subsequent peaceful transfer of power is a tribute to the Palestinian people, especially to the leadership of President Mahmoud Abbas.</P>
      <P>Hamas is a tough and a disciplined organisation. It has engaged in the past in a vicious campaign of violence, including suicide bombings aimed at Israeli civilians. It has been included on the European Union&rsquo;s list of terrorist organisations. However, it has maintained a ceasefire for over a year. It has also displayed a degree of political pragmatism in participating in democratic elections under the Oslo process which it claims to reject. Ireland has been to the fore in arguing that the EU and the international community should give the Palestinians time and space to come to terms with the consequences of the election outcome and the political transition which Hamas urgently needs to undertake.</P>
      <P>Hamas is now in government and that brings with it great responsibilities. Regrettably, to date, the new government does not appear to have taken account of the clear messages set out by the EU, the Quartet and its neighbours on the basis for engagement with the international community. Nor has it heeded the consistently courageous messages from President Abbas on its obligations to the Palestinian people.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The EU has consistently been the strongest supporter of the Palestinian people internationally. Since the signing of the Oslo accord in 1993, the Union has worked politically and provided significant assistance to build the democratic institutions of the future state. The Palestinian Authority was established as part of this process. Ireland strongly supports the requirement that the new Government of that authority fulfils a number of basic principles that any democratic government anywhere would be <Col N="695"/>expected to honour. The EU and the Quartet have made it clear since 30 January that the new Government should renounce violence, recognise Israel&rsquo;s right to exist and accept the existing agreements reached between the PLO and the Palestinian Authority with Israel.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Unfortunately, Hamas has not yet responded. It would have been encouraging, for instance, if it had recognised its responsibilities and condemned last week&rsquo;s horrific suicide bomb attack in Tel Aviv which took the lives of nine Israeli civilians. Instead, it sought to justify the unjustifiable. I emphasise, however, that the EU will judge the Government on its actions. In the period ahead, if there is any evidence of a willingness to make progress to meet the principles set out by the Quartet, and with an absolute requirement that Hamas continues to refrain from violence, Ireland will argue strongly for an appropriate response from the European Union.</P>
      <P>I am aware that considerable concern has been expressed in recent weeks at reports that the EU has decided to freeze its assistance to the Palestinian Authority. The funding situation is more complex than this. In recent years, the EU and its member states have provided some &euro;500 million annually to support Palestinian institutions, NGOs and civil society, and for humanitarian assistance. Approximately half of the annual funding of about &euro;250 million per year administered by the Commission has gone to the UN and NGOs and on food aid, and the other half on assistance to the Palestinian Authority. On 27 February, Ministers agreed on the early delivery of some &euro;121 million in aid by the Commission.</P>
      <P Just="Left">At the meeting of the Council I attended on 10 April, it was agreed that the EU would review its assistance to the Palestinians against the new Government&rsquo;s commitment to the principles set out by the Council and by the international Quartet since 30 January. There was also agreement that the absence of commitment to these principles will inevitably affect direct assistance to the government. Since early April, the Commission has temporarily suspended its direct payments to it, but the Council stressed that the EU will continue to provide necessary assistance to meet the basic needs of the Palestinian population.</P>
      <P>I have argued for &mdash; and in the review process Ireland will press for &mdash; a flexible and wide-ranging definition of what constitutes necessary assistance. We want to look in particular at provisions for support in the areas of health and education. We are under no illusions about the difficulties facing the Palestinian people already in their daily lives or about the dangers of a sudden and rigid freeze of essential assistance. We will work to ensure that the EU meets its responsibilities. Positive movement from the Hamas Government would greatly facilitate the process and directly serve the interests of the Palestinian people. It is not reasonable to expect that those elements of <Col N="696"/>funding aimed directly at building up the Palestinian capacity for self-government should continue unchanged if Hamas does not respect the peace process.</P>
      <P>Nationally, Ireland will continue to do all that is within its capacity to alleviate the suffering of the Palestinian people. The Government is firmly committed to maintaining its bilateral assistance, which amounted to over &euro;4 million in 2005. In response to an appeal from the UN, the Government has already provided &euro;1.5 million in humanitarian assistance this year. Depending on developments, it may prove necessary to redirect funding of some &euro;1 million earmarked for the Ministry of Education. However, we are determined to maintain the overall level of our assistance during 2006.</P>
      <P>It is essential that the EU does not address only one side of the equation. Indeed, it is arguable that one of the reasons for the success of Hamas in the January elections was the perception among many Palestinian voters that the obligations of the peace process were being imposed in an unbalanced manner and that the conditions of their daily lives and the prospects for their children were deteriorating as a direct result. In this context, the April meeting of the Council stressed the responsibilities on Israel to improve the humanitarian and economic situation of the Palestinians.</P>
      <P>In the short term, the EU needs to work with its international partners to persuade the Israeli Government to find an acceptable way to reverse the decision to withhold &euro;50 million in taxes and customs duties that it collects every month on behalf of the Palestinian Authority. Progress in the implementation of the important agreement on movement and access brokered by the US and the EU last November is also essential. The only element of the agreement which is being implemented at present, with the assistance of an EU mission, is the border crossing between Gaza and Egypt at Rafah.</P>
      <P>We welcomed the peaceful and smooth withdrawal of Israeli settlers and troops from Gaza last summer. Gaza must be allowed to develop as a society, with effective links, including trading links, to the outside world and an end to its isolation from the West Bank.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Ireland has rightly been regarded as sympathetic to the plight of the Palestinian people. We are also good friends of Israel. The Government has developed a good working relationship with recent Israeli Governments, which has enabled us to speak directly and constructively on important issues including Israel&rsquo;s obligations under the roadmap and international law. Following the Israeli elections in March, it seems certain that Prime Minister Olmert will form a coalition government, once the current interparty negotiations have concluded. I am encouraged by his statement in his victory address on 29 March that his new Government will work for the establishment of the final borders of Israel through nego<Col N="697"/>tiations and an agreement with its Palestinian neighbours. He correctly stated that &ldquo;there is no good alternative to a peace agreement&rdquo;. We and our partners in the EU look forward to working closely with his new government on this basis.</P>
      <P>The credibility of the EU&rsquo;s role in the peace process, and of its relationship with the Israelis and the Palestinians, requires us to be honest in our dealings with both parties. We have been particularly clear in recent times in setting out the conditions to be met by the new Palestinian Government. It remains essential that we also impress on the Israeli Government its responsibilities in the search for a peaceful settlement. The EU has stated consistently that all parties should refrain from any unilateral action that will further jeopardise the prospects for a two state solution. It is an essential element of the EU position that the EU will not recognise any changes to the pre-1967 boundaries other than those agreed through negotiation. Crucially, the status of Jerusalem can only be decided through agreement in final status negotiations.</P>
      <P Just="Left">We remain very seriously concerned at Israeli practices in the occupied territories which are against international law, bring further hardship to the Palestinian population and create a pernicious and dangerous atmosphere of bitterness and alienation. I believe it is important the EU makes it very clear that there is an obligation on the new Government to end settlement expansion, to remove all illegal outposts and to end construction of the illegal security barrier or wall on occupied Palestinian land. We recognise the obligation on any Israeli Government to protect its citizens against terrorist attacks but we will continue to make the point strongly that measures taken to strengthen the security of Israeli citizens must not be at the expense of the basic human rights of Palestinians. In particular, we remain seriously concerned at extra-judicial killings, which are contrary to international law.</P>
      <P>I have stressed the obligations that rest on both Israelis and Palestinians in the difficult circumstances they face but I also wish to emphasise the obligations that history and geography impose on us as Europeans to continue to work with our international partners to promote the achievement of an historic two state solution to the conflict. A stable, peaceful and just region is in the interests not just of its own peoples but of us all. The Arab-Israeli conflict has threatened international peace and security for many decades. This dictates that the search for such a solution cannot be abandoned. The Government, acting with its partners in the EU, is determined to maintain its engagement in this vital political process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House. The political dispensation in the Middle East has changed with the electoral success of Hamas and the new Administration elected in Israel. However, the central problems remain and <Col N="698"/>I concur with the Minister&rsquo;s closing remarks to the effect that we must remain focussed on the two state solution, which is central to hopes of a long-term solution to the political crisis in the Middle East.</P>
      <P>This issue draws a certain resonance from our political situation, where strife has existed on our island for the past 30 years on the physical level and for the past 70 years on a political level. At a time when we are making progress on a peaceful resolution to that long-running dispute we hope that the same political attention and courage will be shown in the Middle East. The problems facing the Middle East are a mirror image of those we faced in Ireland, where one community recognises the right of another to exist and both communities agree on how they can be governed in a peaceful fashion. While the scale and complexity of the Middle East problem are much greater than our own, we can learn from each other.</P>
      <P>I concur with most of what the Minister outlines but I have difficulty with the approach of the EU to withdrawal of aid to the Palestinian Authority. The original decision to suspend aid was a mistake. A growing humanitarian crisis is being faced by the Palestinian people and the EU had been a beacon of hope to them in trying to grant some degree of certainty in everyday life and providing a reasonable livelihood. The withdrawal of aid is a major blow to those people. I can appreciate the step was taken as a direct result of the decision to put the trust of the Palestinian people in Hamas. The election was free and fair and, although we may not like the decision, we must accept the will of the Palestinian people. It is not good to send the signal that if the European Union does not like election results or the election of certain people, it will try to penalise those people in some way. All this is happening in the context of the ongoing political crisis in the Middle East. Trying to build the peace is exceptionally difficult and the European Union must try to maintain its role as the honest broker. If it is seen almost to punish people for an electoral result, it will not help the neutral stance which it is generally able to adopt during the negotiations.</P>
      <P Just="Left">In addition to the crisis caused by the withdrawal of European Union aid, there is also the problem of custom duties being withheld by the Israeli authorities. As a result, the Palestinian Authority is now unable to pay for vital services. Payments for 140,000 Palestinian Authority employees are delayed. Many of my colleagues in the Oireachtas, particularly the members of the European and foreign affairs committees, have visited the region in the past two or three years and have seen at first hand the difficulties being faced by the people there. We are aware of how valuable the aid programmes are and the difference they make.</P>
      <P>I hope the European Union will revisit its thinking in this regard and restore aid at the earliest possible date. If people have some degree of <Col N="699"/>normality in their lives, particularly with regard to their income and livelihoods, it creates a better backdrop for trying to secure some degree of political progress. I hope the European Union will not remain so shortsighted in its thinking, as I believe the withdrawal of aid is a shortsighted and, in the long run, negative decision.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The Minister referred to the roadmap proposal agreed in 2002. This has been debated in the House on a number of occasions and all Members concur with the Minister&rsquo;s analysis that it is still the best way forward. We cannot move away from the absolute necessity for full international recognition for the state of Israel and full agreement on a permanent Palestinian state. In that regard, although the Minister did not mention it, I am sure he is as appalled as all normal people must be at the recent comments of the new Iranian President that Israel should be wiped off the map. When he made the same comments a number of months ago, everybody condemned it although we believed that the remarks were so off the stage that they could be ignored. That is why it was not just disappointing but deeply disturbing that within the past two weeks he again reiterated his view as to what should happen the state of Israel.</P>
      <P Just="Left">These shocking, inflammatory comments must be condemned by all right-thinking people. I am sure the European Union is making its displeasure with and objection to those comments known. It is not politically acceptable that a Head of State can call for another state to be wiped off the map. The state of Israel has a right to exist in a peaceful fashion, just as the Palestinian people can, rightly, expect and demand that a Palestinian state can exist and be secured in a peaceful fashion.</P>
      <P>On the other side of the political equation, the Minister referred to the security wall. I repeat what I said on previous occasions, that it is a negative political decision by the Israeli authorities to continue the construction of the so-called security wall. While it might provide some degree of physical security, that security is short term in its extent and purpose. The imposition of that security wall creates further division and bitterness among the Palestinian people. It is surprising that the efforts of the international community to get the Israeli Government to desist have been so unsuccessful at both European Union level and within the United States Administration, a long-term ally of the Israeli Government. It is entitled to be an ally of the Israeli Government but it should put far more pressure on the Israelis with regard to this security wall, which will cause nothing but long-term distress, difficulty and further political conflict.</P>
      <P Just="Left">However, I concur with the Minister&rsquo;s sentiments that the roadmap is central to bringing peace to the Middle East. The Irish have a strong affinity with the Palestinian people but at the time of the creation of the state of Israel there <Col N="700"/>was a close affinity between the people who built the Israeli state and Irish politicians. Many of the people who built the Israeli state would have looked to Irish politicians of a previous era to learn how statehood could be gained and a nation built. We have a natural affinity and connection with both the Palestinian and the Israeli peoples and we must try to use it constructively to ensure they begin to respect each other in a more formal fashion and that there is a respect for each other&rsquo;s right to exist. There must be agreement to maintain the partial ceasefire that is in place, to build upon it, to secure the borders, to give certainty and long-term security to the state of Israel and to give long-term certainty by way of statehood to the Palestinian people.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I wish the Minister well in his endeavours. He has the support of every Member of the House in taking whatever steps Ireland, as a small nation, can at EU and UN level to bring a solution to this long-term problem. With regard to our problems on this island, we hope that in the reasonably near future we can put the past behind us. It must be the strong international desire that the same can be done in the Middle East. One associates a number of negative words with the Middle East, such as &ldquo;powder keg&rdquo; and &ldquo;suicide bomber&rdquo;. The conflict has lasted for 50 years so we must redouble our efforts to bring this dreadful period of conflict and strife to a conclusion. It is a little like the Northern Ireland issue in that what is needed on all sides is respect, sensitivity, dialogue and courage. A little of that is being shown at present but those essential qualities must be maximised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>I echo the remarks of Senator Bradford in welcoming the Minister. It is a sign of great respect for the House that the Minister has come here to outline the Government&rsquo;s position on recent developments in the Middle East. I also take this opportunity to record the appreciation of all sides of the House represented at the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body of the historic initiative, in which the Minister was personally and intimately involved, to ensure the presence of representatives of the majority Unionist population in Northern Ireland to outline their position. I make that comment in the wider context of the parallels we constantly draw between the conflict on this island and that in the Middle East between the Israelis and the Palestinians.</P>
      <P>Like the Minister, I unequivocally and unambiguously condemn the loss of life caused by the insidious suicide bombers and the impact it has had not only on the people who have died and their relatives but also on the wider political process, which one hoped was beginning to regenerate with a new dynamic following the recent elections in both the Palestinian Authority and in Israel. I offer sincere condolences to the families of those who lost their lives in such tragic and unacceptable circumstances.</P><Col N="701"/>
      <P Just="Left">I also welcome the Minister&rsquo;s reference to the continuance of Irish aid and the growing relationship between Israel and Ireland. As those of us who have been following the Middle East conflict over quite a number of years know, it has not always been a smooth passage. I recall visiting the Middle East on two occasions as part of a parliamentary delegation. We were subjected to lectures by certain elements within the Israeli political and military establishments about Ireland&rsquo;s perceived lack of even-handedness, especially when we were involved in southern Lebanon, and in our approach to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. As the Minister said, we have rightly been regarded as sympathetic to the plight of the Palestinians and we are also a good friend of Israel. The Government has developed a good working relationship with recent Israeli Governments, which is vital. Of all the countries in the European Union, Ireland is the one that comes to that conflict with the least amount of baggage. The Minister has reflected this fact in his own dealings at the highest level within the EU and also in bilateral meetings with the Israeli Government. The Irish Government has always ensured that an Irish perspective or dimension to that ongoing conflict has been valuable. I am particularly pleased that the Minister emphasised this aspect in his address.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P Just="Left">Kadima&rsquo;s victory in the election reflected a moderation in Israeli politics and a desire for peace among the broad mass of the Israeli people. The restraint shown by the Israeli Prime Minister, Mr. Olmert, and his cabinet colleagues in the immediate aftermath of the savagery in Jerusalem is a positive indication that the new Administration in Israel will not adopt knee-jerk reactions every time an outrage occurs, as happened in the past, but will pursue a more measured and constrained approach. In light of the fact that Israel now faces a Government in the Palestinian territories which is predominantly comprised of terrorists, the Israeli Government&rsquo;s restraint is commendable. The Minister has already made that point.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Concern has been expressed across Europe following the victory of Hamas. As a member of the Irish delegation to the Council of Europe, I was privileged to lead the debate for the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, of which my party is a member. It is fundamental to the concept of democracy that respect for the rule of law is paramount. That message is being sent strongly to the Hamas-led Administration. Of course we respect the right of the Palestinian people to elect the government of their choice in a free and fair election but therein lies the dilemma for the international community. Should it withdraw financial support from a democratically-elected government and plunge an already desperate people into more deprivation and misery, while at the same time sending the strongest possible message to Hamas? What the EU has done, along with <Col N="702"/>Ireland&rsquo;s involvement, is a measured response. Following the meeting on 10 April there was no withdrawal of moneys to those who need it most but there was, rightly, a suspension of direct aid to the Palestinian Administration. Crucially, also, Commission personnel were withdrawn from key areas where they had been providing expertise to the Palestinian Authority.</P>
      <P Just="Left">In analysing the decision of the Palestinian people to choose a majority Hamas Administration, it must be borne in mind that the vote was against corruption in the Fatah-led Administration that had been going on for years under the previous president, Yasser Arafat. In addition, the vote was for Hamas&rsquo;s social policies at local level where its political wing has been providing social, educational and nutrition programmes to address the needs of desperate Palestinians living in the occupied territories. Therefore, the election result should not be interpreted as a vote for terrorism or the continuation of the horrendous and savage manifestation of such terrorism to which I referred earlier.</P>
      <P>I am glad that, although it may not say so publicly, the new Israeli Government, by its actions so far, seems to have adopted the same analysis of the Palestinians&rsquo; voting wishes, as has the European Union. The Minister has reiterated that there is no desire on the part of the EU &mdash; which is one of the largest donors to the Palestinian Authority &mdash; to withdraw funding that would plunge the people of that unfortunate land into even more misery. The Minister&rsquo;s speech indicated the specifics under which that money will continue to flow to those who are most in need.</P>
      <P>Inevitably the parallels between Ireland&rsquo;s troubled history and its relations with its nearest neighbour, Great Britain, over centuries of conflict, are almost mirrored in the history of relationships between the state of Israel and the Palestinians. It is salutary to remember that in 1969 violence erupted in the streets of Belfast and for the next 30 years the Irish Republican Army carried on a war of attrition against the British Government in Northern Ireland. The people of Northern Ireland, along with many in Britain and in the Republic suffered grievously from a series of indiscriminate bombings and shootings as the IRA, supported by its political wing Sinn F&eacute;in, engaged in a war to remove the British presence from Northern Ireland and establish a united Ireland at the point of a gun. It seems far distant now but that was the only language that was spoken for 30 years. As a child growing up, and throughout the troubles of the past 35 years, I recall the term being regularly used and abused &mdash; that the only language the British understood was at the point of a gun. Thank God we have moved on from that.</P>
      <P Just="Left">As regards the parallels involved, during the end stages of the war, attempts by Sinn F&eacute;in to engage in dialogue with the British and Irish Governments on a political agenda were rebuffed <Col N="703"/>while it refused to denounce violence as a means of achieving its political objectives. We also need to be reminded that the strategy at that time was to advance its cause with &ldquo;the armalite in one hand and the ballot box in the other&rdquo;. It seems to me that Hamas believes it, too, can adopt a similar strategy. During that period, when Sinn F&eacute;in campaigned as a legitimate political party, it is salutary to remember that Hamas was doing the same. It engaged in social projects and gained electoral support, especially in economically deprived areas. Despite Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s political mandate, however, both Governments refused to engage in a dialogue at official level unless and until it renounced its military campaign. Once that happened, it was the &ldquo;open sesame&rdquo; to what we now call the evolving peace process.</P>
      <P>In drawing those contemporary parallels concerning what is going on between Israel and Hamas, and what occurred here between the Irish and British Governments and Sinn F&eacute;in, I wish to place on record that the Good Friday Agreement is to the credit of the current Sinn F&eacute;in leadership, led by Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness, and the vision of Nobel peace prize winners John Hume of the SDLP and the former Ulster Unionist Party leader, David Trimble. That agreement is the benchmark for the future evolution of the peace process in Ireland.</P>
      <P>Are there men and women of vision and courage in Hamas and the Israeli leadership who can see beyond the parapets of their entrenched positions and guide their people to a better future in which they will be free from violence, including suicide attacks, and free to prosper while allowing each other to live in peace with respect for each other&rsquo;s opinions? That is the challenge facing both sets of leaders. To paraphrase a question that arose from this society&rsquo;s peace process, who will jump first?</P>
      <P>I have been encouraged by the approach of the new Olmert Government in Israel where there is most definitely a window of opportunity. While I do not wish to overemphasise the fact, I am more than pleased that the Israeli Government did not react in the traditional manner to suicide bombings on its territory. We respect the democratic credentials of the Hamas-led Government but Hamas must in turn respect the democratically-elected Government of Israel. It must abandon its stated aim of eliminating Israel. It has to renounce violence and accept the roadmap for peace.</P>
      <P>Israel too has an obligation. It must avoid taking unilateral action to secure its borders, such as extending the security wall beyond the pre-1967 borders and extending its settlements on Palestinian lands. If Israel contained its wall within the pre-1967 borders the wall would extend approximately 300 miles as distinct from the proposal to double that. I appeal to Israel to stop its land grab and learn the lessons of Irish history whereby a legacy of re-settlement dating <Col N="704"/>back 400 years, when Ireland was colonised by non-native settlers, continues to resonate today.</P>
      <P>I appeal to the Israeli Government to respond humanely to the situation and not to block access to finance and <i>mat&eacute;riel</i> for humanitarian purposes, especially health and education, as the Minister said. The world knows only too well the effect of humanitarian disasters in Africa. Let us not be responsible for visiting such disasters unnecessarily on the innocent Palestinian people, the women and children. No one wants a<?oasys _jy ?>Mogadishu on the Jordan.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>My party and its spokesperson on foreign affairs believe that the decision taken by the Foreign Ministers of the European Union at the recent Council meeting ranks among the most negative decisions in the history of the EU&rsquo;s relationship with the Middle East. I was depressed, annoyed and angry, and remain so, at this capacity to lecture victims of oppression about the need to reject violence, even as their oppressors buy arms and a blind eye is turned to their appalling activities.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The injustices in the Palestinian area would not have justified the killing of a single person. While I do not wish to get involved in a silly what-if debate, it is worth noting that for every Israeli who has died in the intifada, two Palestinians have died. It is difficult for western Europe to have any credibility when it tells the Palestinian Government that uniquely among governments of the world it must reject violence under all circumstances. The international community has not made rejecting violence in all circumstances a condition of dealing with any other government. I defy the Minister to tell me of another situation in which such an instruction has been issued to any government.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The Palestinian Government must operate within the bounds of international law and morality and avoid genocide, etc., but that is not what we told Hamas. We told a government, elected according to what everyone accepts was a fair and free democratic process, that it must &ldquo;reject violence&rdquo;. I wish every government in the world would reject violence. Israel is the only nuclear power in the Middle East and has the capacity to obliterate the cities of every country that threatens it, yet we have told its neighbour&rsquo;s newly-elected Government that it must unequivocally reject violence within fewer than four months.</P>
      <P>This contrasts with the timescale of our peace process. In 1994 our Government had only one condition, namely, a permanent ceasefire. I often discussed this with the then Taoiseach, who had wonderful practical insights. The Provisional IRA attempted to fudge this by making it a three, six or nine month ceasefire but the Taoiseach continued to say &ldquo;No&rdquo;. He did not then demand from it what was accomplished last July, namely, an unequivocal rejection of the use of violence. We have told the democratically-elected Government <Col N="705"/>of Palestine that it must do in four months what we gave the Provisional IRA 11 years to do.</P>
      <P Just="Left">We never asked Sinn F&eacute;in or the IRA to recognise formally the legitimacy of this, or the Northern, state, which they have denied for 80 years. We sought a ceasefire to create the space into which we knew political compromise would draw them, and out of which would come the recognition of the realities on the ground &mdash; it is rare that I quote President George W. Bush.</P>
      <P>We did not tell them they must recognise existing treaties, agreements, states, judiciaries and police forces. We continue to allow them progress into the political process in Northern Ireland and ask them to recognise the police force there. We have told the Palestinian people they have made the wrong choice and tough as it is they must recognise a state they do not recognise before we will talk to them, and that they must reject all violence, no matter what Israel does to them, even when it launches a rocket allegedly to kill a terrorist activist, which killed a 15 year old girl who happened to be in the car. Israel did this immediately after the Palestinian election.</P>
      <P>I have no time for what-if debates. Killing one person never justifies killing another but we are dealing with a world where people believe that. If we want to achieve political progress we must see it through the eyes of those involved. How can I say to a Palestinian that he or she must reject violence under every circumstance and observe all these agreements but Israel is free to break them? It has broken the Oslo Accord, ignored many parts of the roadmap and international law, and has breached basic human rights conventions. That does not justify any act of violence by anybody else but it creates the context in which matters should be judged.</P>
      <P>That is why it was such a dreadful decision on the part of the European Union to mimic what the United States, an ally of Israel, has done. The European Union could have been an independent player and told Hamas it wanted an unequivocal ceasefire and asked it to commit itself to not resorting to violence against Israel on Israeli territory. While I would not justify it morally, international law would probably justify the use of violence by Palestinians against Israeli occupying forces in the West Bank. It would be morally wrong and politically inept but not illegal.</P>
      <P>We will not say that. We will tell the Palestinians we expect them to behave to a higher standard than we expect from their oppressors. No sane country can expect any other outcome from that. Had we done this in 1994, or had the British Government announced that, although the IRA was on ceasefire, it was sending the British army into every strong republican area in Northern Ireland to search out weapons and deal with alleged terrorists, while lecturing the IRA about remaining on ceasefire, we would all, across the political spectrum, have said that is not the way to go.</P><Col N="706"/>
      <P Just="Left">I am astonished that a Government that, by and large, has been sure-footed about the issue of the Middle East and has established a proud position for Ireland, appears to have ultimately capitulated to a particularly short-sighted international response to something that did not happen. It is easy to say they only voted for Hamas because the others were corrupt. That was a serious issue in an appallingly impoverished territory. People who suffered from permanent mass unemployment saw people who happened to be senior members of the Palestinian Authority living in a level of luxury and practising a scale of corruption that was an insult to their own people. That happened and prominent Palestinians from the PLO and Fatah noticed it, spoke about it and denounced it but could not prevent it. That is not a minor issue. That is the sort of issue that annoys people, and somebody delivered for them.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I frequently ask people, including those from a number of other European countries whom I have met since, what they expect to happen now. I ask them if they believe Hamas will lean over backwards and recognise the right of Israel to exist and acknowledge all the treaties because the Palestinians are impoverished. They will say the exact opposite and if another election is forced on them, Hamas will get an even bigger majority. That is the inevitable consequence of every attempt to repress people and use this sort of excessive and brutal force. We should have demanded from Hamas an unequivocal, absolute ceasefire in terms of any attacks on Israel. If we had asked for that we would have some moral authority to criticise it for its inept attempt to justify an horrific car bombing.</P>
      <P>If we are to have any credibility we must consider what we intend to do to put some pressure on the other half of the conflict to end illegal settlements. We are fudging the question. There are no legal settlements on the West Bank. Every Israeli settlement on the West Bank is illegal and anybody wanting to negotiate a solution is entitled to expect that all those settlements will end. As my party spokesman said previously, the decision earlier this month was perhaps the most politically inept and potentially disastrous decision the European Union has made in many years in dealing with a sensitive foreign policy issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMinihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Minihan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is depressing that this House once again returns to the issue of peace in the Middle East within days of a murderous suicide attack in Egypt and just over a week after a bomb attack in Tel Aviv killed nine people. Nevertheless, I welcome the debate and I welcome the Minister of State to the House. I welcome also the comments of the Minister, Deputy Ahern, and the Government&rsquo;s continuing commitment to peace and justice in the Middle East, for there can be no peace without justice. Justice is a much abused term. At its most simplistic, justice is viewed as retributive. The phrases &ldquo;An eye for an <Col N="707"/>eye&rdquo; and &ldquo;A tooth for a tooth&rdquo; are familiar to us all but they are only too familiar to the people of Israel and Palestine.</P>
      <P>I would like to explore another concept of justice, namely, that of a just society. I have no doubt that is what the international community intended in 1947 when the United Nations called for the partition of Palestine into Jewish and Arab states, with Jerusalem as an international zone under UN jurisdiction. Perhaps that was a Utopian dream but had men and women of goodwill from both sides of the religious divide stepped forward at that stage, we may have avoided some 60 years of conflict.</P>
      <P>I have no wish to take Members down the path of history; that path has been well travelled by others far better versed in the issues than me. Broken promises, British misrule, mutual distrust and three wars have brought us to where we are today. Nevertheless, history is important. There will be no solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict unless past injustices are acknowledged and forgiven and restitution granted to those who have lost family members and land over the past 60 years.</P>
      <P Just="Left">During my time in the United Nations in that particular region, I saw injustices on both sides and for every one I could name on one side, I could name another on the other side. I could express outrage at events I witnessed, the behaviour of the Israelis or the disregard for human life shown by the Palestinians. All of that would be to no avail as there is wrong on both sides. Democratic states must uphold certain principles. They must acknowledge the rule of law. Both the Israeli and the Palestinian people have recently elected new Governments and it is time those governments committed themselves to the rule of law. The Hamas-led Government of Palestine must recognise Israel&rsquo;s right to exist and prevent any further attacks on Israel by its citizens such as the one in Tel Aviv last week.</P>
      <P>Likewise, the new Israeli Government has obligations. Attacks such as those last week cannot be punished by indiscriminate acts of retaliation against targets on the West Bank or in the Gaza Strip. Suicide attacks, as with any terrorist attacks, are abhorrent and a crime against humanity but by their very nature the perpetrators cannot be brought to justice. Seeking revenge against their families only breeds more hatred and gathers more recruits for martyrdom. To open a dialogue with those who can prevent such attacks is a true sign of strength.</P>
      <P>There is much to discuss and many obstacles on the roadmap to peace. The question of the Israeli settlements on the West Bank and the so-called security fence remain the biggest obstacles to progress along the road to peace from a Palestinian perspective. I have stated before and I state again that the security fence is nothing but a device for stealing more Palestinian land. Once built, it will copper-fasten Israeli occupation of <Col N="708"/>sections of the West Bank. Even if Israel were to relinquish its hold on the West Bank and abandon its settlements, a topic I will return to, those areas on the wrong side of the wall will never be returned to the Palestinians. In any case, the argument that the wall will provide total security for Israel and its citizens is a fantasy. The only true security will be found in a full and fair settlement of the Palestinian question.</P>
      <P>The question of the settlement is interesting. Should Israel relinquish control of the West Bank, would it also remove its settlers as it did in the Gaza Strip? Currently, there are in excess of 200,000 Israeli settlers living on the West Bank with a further 200,000 in or around Jerusalem, which was annexed in 1967. Could the Palestinian Authority guarantee the safety of those settlers should they decide to live out their lives in a free Palestine? Even if Jerusalem were declared an international city, as the UN originally envisaged, would the Palestinian Authority have the ability or even the will to safeguard those who remain on the West Bank? These are serious questions that cannot be answered by the Israelis and the Palestinians alone. Without doubt, should Israel decide to withdraw its settlers, the international community will have to fund their resettlement. Should they remain so disposed, Palestinians will need recompense for the lost lands and help to restart their lives. In any event, the international community will have to foot the bill and I hope this country will be to the fore in providing such funding.</P>
      <P>West Bank Palestinians are not the only people to have lost lands since the foundation of the state of Israel. What of those who were dispossessed following the 1948 war, many of whom are still living in refugee camps throughout the region? Should these people also be given the right to return to their former homes? Palestinian citizens who remained in the country when the state of Israel was created currently amount to approximately 20% of the Israeli population, a percentage which is steadily growing. If these people were joined by returning Palestinian refugees, how would this affect the political balance of power in Israel? We should ponder the effect of the votes of approximately 1 million Unionists on the balance of power in this State. This should give us some idea of the possible changes facing Israel.</P>
      <P>These are significant questions for Israel and the international community. What of the questions facing the Palestinian Authority? Will it finally recognise Israel&rsquo;s right to exist and safeguard its borders from incursions by militants? Will it, in the event of an Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank, guarantee Israel&rsquo;s access to vital water supplies? As a democrat, I support the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination and to choose their own government but I believe that on this occasion, democracy has not served the Palestinian people well. The Hamas-led Government shows no sign of living up to its <Col N="709"/>responsibilities and no sign that it will answer any of the questions I have posed. This is why I support the decision of the EU to suspend aid to the Palestinian Authority.</P>
      <P>Others take a different view. Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait have all promised the Palestinian Authority funding as not to do so would render those most vulnerable in Palestinian society even more vulnerable. While I may differ with them, I understand their reasons for granting this humanitarian aid. However, I cannot countenance the blatantly political nature of Iran&rsquo;s offer of funding, coming at a time of rising tension due to that country&rsquo;s development of nuclear power and its continuing verbal attacks on the state of Israel. The intervention of Tehran in the tinderbox of Israeli-Palestinian relations is unwelcome and one can only hope that wiser heads prevail in the Palestinian Authority and that Tehran&rsquo;s fanatical rhetoric is not echoed elsewhere.</P>
      <P>I urge the international community to continue its struggle to make progress along the road to peace. A fair and just peace would benefit the people of Israel and Palestine and the family of nations throughout the Middle East. I support the Government&rsquo;s continuing efforts to bring peace to the region. I am sure the Members of this House will do all they can to bring closure to a conflict which has been a running sore in international politics for far too long.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister of State to the House and the opportunity to speak on this matter. I have been a supporter of Palestinian self-determination and the establishment of a Palestinian state for many years. I supported the PLO during this period. I also believe in a two-state solution and have long supported the recognition of the state of Israel. I put this argument directly to the former President of the Palestinian Authority, Yasser Arafat, and others.</P>
      <P>A two-state arrangement is the only solution. We must live through these issues. Many speakers today argued that we must examine parallels on this island. I disagree with Senator Minihan&rsquo;s argument about the perils of democracy. We accept democracy, which led to the election of Hamas. I regret that it did not condemn the suicide bombing last week in Israel. Over the last four to six years, many Members of this House urged the PLO to condemn the suicide bombers who were killing innocent Israeli people and luring young people with false promises of a future. I remember when Yasser Arafat eventually took the difficult decision to condemn suicide bombing.</P>
      <P>I do not doubt that Hamas will eventually be forced to do likewise and the sooner it does so, the better. Events occurring at the moment are typical of what we have witnessed on this island and the Middle East. The relationship between Hamas and the Israeli Government is a rerun of that which existed between it and the PLO 20 <Col N="710"/>years ago. Developments which took place during that period, including the two intifadas, boil down to a basic issue of human and civil rights and the issue of self-determination.</P>
      <P Just="Left">It is incumbent on the West to recognise the flaws in Hamas and the illegality of the construction of the wall and settlements in the occupied territories by the Israeli Government. Having recognised these wrongs, we must park them and examine how we can build on a coincidence of objectives and reach a point where the two states can live side by side in mutual recognition. This must be the objective. It is surely no more difficult than that which took place on this island. The participation by members of the Democratic Unionist Party in a meeting of the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body this week was as unexpected as the difficulties we now witness between Palestine and Israel.</P>
      <P>We must condemn actions which are wrong. The Government and Members of this House have established our credibility on these issues. The Minister&rsquo;s speech contains tough language directed at both sides. The speech touches on the fact that Hamas has not responded to messages from the international community and the former president of the Palestinian Authority, Mahmoud Abbas, and goes on to discuss Israeli practices in the occupied territories. This balance and the fact that it is not expressed in very diplomatic language is welcome because now is not a time for walking on eggshells. It is time to put matters on the record. When we do so in an even-handed way, it gives us some credibility in terms of urging the parties involved to move forward together.</P>
      <P>I have supported the Palestinian cause for many years but in supporting it, I have argued with Palestinian representatives every step of the way. If I believed what they were doing was wrong, I pointed it out to them. I also argued with my colleagues in the Israeli trade union movement about such matters as the closing of Palestinian universities and the prospect of a Palestinian state composed of scattered pieces of territory with very little prospect of economic viability built into its structure. During Yasser Arafat&rsquo;s last visit to Ireland, I, along with a number of other Senators, met him for dinner and asked him how an independent Palestine would become viable. I informed him that I was not satisfied with the answers I was given and that there was a need to develop Palestine&rsquo;s economic structure.</P>
      <P>I remember a conversation with an Israeli trade union colleague in the mid-1970s, not long after the Yom Kippur War, during which he told me that he believed that no matter how bad matters were, the future lay in economic development. He was correct in believing this. He believed that a prosperous Israel and a prosperous Palestine would learn to live together more effectively and quickly than if people were struggling in a subsistence existence. This leads on to the need for economic investment in this area. I agree with <Col N="711"/>Senator Minihan that we must be ready to invest in improving the lot of people in the region and ensuring that there is economic development and that both groups can live together, support each other and move forward together. In the meantime, both groups must recognise that international law, including UN directives, apply to them. We must recognise that, due to the cavalier way in which the United States Government dealt with Iraq in recent years, it is difficult for the West to look po-faced at Israel and insist that it recognise international law and comply with various UN directives.</P>
      <P>We must be brave, take the necessary steps and be prepared to say what we believe is wrong. There is no point in calling for Hamas to condemn these issues as we condemn them out of hand. Suicide bombing is unambiguously wrong, can never be right and must always be seen as unacceptable in any set of circumstances. We must also explain our views on Israel&rsquo;s involvement in the occupied territories and how it is equally wrong and unacceptable under international law.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Having said this, what can we do to move matters forward? How can we get closer to the measures envisaged in the Oslo Accords? Can we make them work? How can we convince Hamas? We cannot do so through megaphone diplomacy. The only way to convince Hamas is to engage with it, argue in quiet and silent rooms and say what we are saying today, namely, that in the same way we must accept that democracy produced a Hamas Government, Hamas must recognise the existence of Israel and that the Israeli Government has been democratically elected, irrespective of the state&rsquo;s boundaries. While there may be an argument in this regard, there cannot be an argument about Israel being a sovereign state with a democratically-elected government. We should hold these positions and argue them with Hamas.</P>
      <P>I ask that the West have a greater engagement with Hamas at a private level to argue the toss with various people and make individuals in rooms without cameras or from which no reportage comes justify their positions. We should ask people what is the way forward and what is their preferred or second favourite solution. We must establish coincidences of objectives between Israel and Palestine, of which there are some. There is no doubt that people in both jurisdictions have the common objectives to seek to live their lives in peace and do better for the next generation.</P>
      <P>I do not know how many times we have discussed this matter over the past 20 years but it is depressing. Will it ever end or be resolved? Now that there are established people with set or polarised positions in both jurisdictions, perhaps it is time they realise they must move. They must commit to either a continuous war or a peaceful process, in which our Government would have a <Col N="712"/>role to play. I have always been proud of this State&rsquo;s position on the Middle East conflict over the past 20 years and through various Governments. On the one hand, Palestine should recognise that Ireland has been prepared to take a stand in its favour before many others were prepared to do so and, on the other, it must listen to us and recognise Israel. There must be a two-state solution that is honest, acceptable under international law and gives people on all sides a chance.</P>

	<P>The EU has been a consistent supporter of the Palestinian people internationally. Ireland has played its part in ensuring that this is the policy. As such, it saddens me to see the removal of funding to the Palestinian Government and I cannot understand why this has been done. As previously stated, this will not help, as people will not have the money they need to govern their country.</P>
      <P>The only route to a just and lasting settlement is through the negotiation of a mutually acceptable two-state solution. We are all aware of the obstacle recent developments have placed in the path of negotiations, which makes it more important for us to work to promote an environment for negotiation. Peace and security for the Israeli and Palestinian people will only be assured through negotiation and compromise based on adherence to fundamental democratic principles. It is in no one&rsquo;s interest to set aside the agreements already undertaken or seek to impose outcomes on the other side through unilateral actions or refusals to negotiate.</P>
      <P>We support Israeli and Palestinian political leaders who recognise the desire of their people for a just solution and the inescapable need to meet the obligations identified in the roadmap. Now that Hamas is in government, it must confront and live up to great responsibilities. Above all, it must take account of the clear messages sent by the EU, the Quartet, the other countries of the region and the democratically-elected President of the Palestinian Authority, Mahmoud Abbas. All voices have given the same clear messages that the Government of the Palestinian Authority must renounce violence, recognise the right of its neighbour to exist in peace and security and commit itself to implementing the agreements entered into since the signing of the Oslo Accords.</P>
      <P>Ireland has been to the fore in arguing that the EU and international community should give the Palestinians time and space to come to terms with these responsibilities. It is troubling that, so far, this time and space has not been used as it should have been. No one responsible for any government should seek to justify the type of atrocity we <Col N="713"/>saw in Tel Aviv last week. This was disappointing evidence that Hamas has not faced up to the new responsibilities that come with active participation in democracy. That said, we must judge the new Palestinian Government on its actions. In the period ahead, if there is any evidence of a willingness to make progress to meet the principles set out by the Quartet and with an absolute requirement that Hamas should continue to refrain from violence, an appropriate response from the international community should be made.</P>
      <P Just="Left">There is an equal need to press Israel to meet its obligations under international law and the agreements it has undertaken. Together with our partners in the EU, we should use every opportunity to further constructive engagement. All parties should refrain from any unilateral action that would further jeopardise the prospects of a two-state solution. There are serious grounds for concern in respect of Israeli practices in the occupied territories. If anyone visited them, as I have, he or she would be appalled by what the Israelis have done. It goes against international law and brings further hardship to the Palestinian population, who have been living in camps for almost half a century. There is an obligation on the Israeli Government to end settlement expansion, remove all illegal outposts and end construction of the illegal security barrier or wall on occupied Palestinian land. The Israeli Government is obliged to protect its citizens against terrorist attacks but measures taken to strengthen the security of Israel for Israeli citizens must not be at the expense of the basic human rights of Palestinians.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Senator Mooney spoke about bombing the British to the table in Ireland. It is a good sign that we have moved on from this but it is unfortunate that people can be bombed to the table. Now that Hamas has done its bombing and reached the table, it is time to cease the bombings. The only way for peace to come to that area of the world is to have a two-state solution, <i>insha Allah</i>.</P>

	<P>I thank Senator Lydon for sharing his time with Senator Mansergh and I. As time is limited, I will not go into historical issues, which have been well covered today. However, I wish to place on record my admiration for the stance of the Government on the Middle East through the years. In many ways, it has set the tone for a solution that must embrace peace and justice.</P>
      <P>It is striking that we asked Hamas to embrace democracy, but when it did so and won the election, I was amazed that some world leaders indicated within 24 hours they would not accept the result. It is interesting that often in history, an opportunity appears but is lost in a short period. An opportunity was lost in the period after Hamas was elected. We must return to that position. The international community obviously has <Col N="714"/>a significant obligation but has also been afforded a considerable opportunity to help in such a situation. Unfortunately, some world powers are having the opposite effect, the reasons for which are distant from the trouble zone. At times, the American Government, for example, tends to take a position that is not always understood and seems to be more about vested interests than the outcome of this situation.</P>
      <P>It is interesting to see the words &ldquo;peace process&rdquo; on the agenda because we tend to associate them with Northern Ireland&rsquo;s problems. We have learned much from that situation and many similarities have been mentioned in this debate. However, as all Members accept, it is important to recognise that there is no justification for either suicide bombings or Israel&rsquo;s pre-emptive strikes, which aggravate matters.</P>
      <P>The European Union&rsquo;s position in this regard has been unhelpful and it should have taken a much more independent stand internationally. There should be no question of withholding finance or of sanctions, which is not the road to take at present. I hope that once again, we will pull back from the brink.</P>
      <P>Hamas has a double problem, as did the republican movement in the North of Ireland. While it must prove that it is capable of working within the democratic system, it must also prove that it can bring its followers with it. The worst possible outcome in the Middle East would be if Hamas was to lose its basic support and if a second group was to come into existence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State. Along with Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute;, I am comfortable with Government policy, both in recent times and for the past 26 years, going back to the Bahrain declaration made by the Minister of State&rsquo;s father, the late Mr. Brian Lenihan. Our policy has been informed by our experience of peacekeeping and the peace process, as well as by the entire history of dispossession and self-determination. I am glad the Government will not cut back on finance because that would be the wrong thing to do.</P>
      <P>While the Gaza withdrawal earlier this year was a positive step, I am as uncomfortable as other Members with the tendency to create facts on the ground, using some of the tactics with which we would be familiar from the days of the old Stormont regime. If one is realistic, Hamas is unlikely to make unilateral ideological concessions and people who press it to so do should realise that this lacks realism.</P>
      <P>In common with other Members, I condemn both suicide bombs and pre-emptive attacks. I saw a film recently apropos of the Munich massacre, which was simply entitled, &ldquo;Munich&rdquo;. It showed the futility, from an Israeli perspective, of pursuing and murdering the various people who had been held responsible. While I empathise with the Palestinian people, some of the tactics <Col N="715"/>used do not make their situation any better, and in some respects they may be going backwards.</P>
      <P Just="Left">There is a strong international responsibility in that many recent international conflicts, including Iraq, Afghanistan, the 11 September attack and so on, are directly or indirectly connected with the unresolved problems in the Middle East. Hence, this issue is of major importance to all in this country and everywhere else. While one might accept that the United States and Europe have somewhat different roles and may have different influence with different people, both must be active and more forceful in a constructive, rather than a punitive sense. We have lived with this situation for a long time without making much progress on the underlying factors.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. C. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Acting Chairman for his attention and thank those Senators who contributed to the debate before my arrival to conclude it on behalf of my senior colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern. Unfortunately, he could not be present to hear the debate&rsquo;s conclusion. However, many Members will have read and listened to his excellent contribution.</P>
      <P>In particular, I wish to pay tribute to a number of Senators who made contributions while I have been present, namely, Senators Mooney, Ryan, Minihan, O&rsquo;Toole, Lydon, Mansergh and &Oacute;<?oasys _jy ?>Murch&uacute;. I particularly thank Senator Mansergh for his kind reference to my late father. As Senator Mansergh and other Members are aware, he was proud that he moved our foreign policy in a direction that was positively disposed towards the Palestinian people in what, depressingly, has become their almost eternal search for nationhood and statehood and for their nation to be incorporated in a state of its own.</P>
      <P>It is a great disappointment that we still negotiate and debate on this particular issue, given all the efforts made by everyone in this House, in other houses and in other political systems across the globe. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, made this clear. I was taken by Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s frank statement that the Government has been even-handed in its response to this matter, notwithstanding the existing foreign policy choice to be pro-Palestinian and in favour of the Palestinian people&rsquo;s rights.</P>
      <P>The election poses its own problems. The current phase of the process in the Middle East is built on four essential pillars. These include respect for the Oslo agreement and respect for the views and recommendations of the Quartet which was established at international level. Many people invested a great deal of hope in it, much of which has, unfortunately, now been dashed. The third pillar is the basic assumption flowing from the Oslo Accords and the Quartet that there would be recognition of the state of Israel and a full-scale renunciation of violence.</P><Col N="716"/>
      <P>I notice that Senator Ryan has re-entered the Chamber. It is unfortunate and wrong to state that we have changed our position in this matter. We are as even-handed now as we were when we began the journey in foreign policy terms with regard to Palestine. We will not cut assistance or aid and I wish to underline that phrase deliberately. We have never cut and run in situations of abject poverty, distress or difficulty, be it in extremely poor countries or countries going through enormously difficult political and violent transition of one kind or another. We have never&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>We have never been anything other than even-handed and proper in our position with regard to Palestine and to suggest that we are being improper now or at any stage is grossly incorrect. It is unfair to all parties of all political colours. I must be clear in this regard. If the Senator takes the time, when he gets the opportunity, to take the opinion of the Palestinian representative who is present in the House, he might reflect that Ireland is still a strong supporter of the Palestinian cause.</P>

	<P>Most fair-minded people would accept that there is broad cross-party sup<Col N="717"/>port within this House and the D&aacute;il for the policy established over the past 20 or 30 years. As it is not an item of dispute, perhaps rhetorical exuberance got the better of the Senator when he made that particular statement. However, it is simply not true and does not stand up to analysis.</P>
      <P>We do not in any way share the view that we should punish the people of Palestine because they have had an election. We have asked for two basic steps which were at the origin of the peace process in the Oslo Accord, namely, acceptance of Israel and its right to exist as a state, and the renunciation of violence as a way of furthering that particular peace process. These are not outlandish or difficult demands and I found the comparison with our own peace process to be somewhat strange, as essentially they were the qualifications which were required to become involved in the peace process in Ireland.</P>

	<P>That is not true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. C. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Government did not talk to either Sinn F&eacute;in or the IRA until the violence had ended and a ceasefire had been declared. That was the major breakthrough about which people in Ireland forget, namely, that the IRA entered into a full ceasefire in August 1994 and that ceasefire was, broadly speaking&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>The Minister of State knows that Hamas has a ceasefire.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. C. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Moreover, it was crystal clear, from the Downing Street Declaration and the various declarations made by the IRA <i>circa</i> 1993 and 1994, that it was entertaining a route that involved a full scale involvement in politics and peaceful means, not allowing a quick or occasional resort to violence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Such as the attack on Canary Wharf.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. C. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>It has taken a long time for us in Ireland to verify that fully, but it has been verified. The sincerity of the people who began the process is not in question now. It was in question over a period of 12 years in this country.</P>
      <P>While it is clear from what the Minister, Deputy Ahern, said earlier, I want to provide some clarification on the following matter. I am the Minister of State with responsibility for overseas aid and we support the Palestinian Authority. In 2005, we provided assistance to the tune of &euro;4 million for the situation in Palestine, and that assistance will continue. If the situation deteriorates, like in any other country in Africa, Latin America or Asia, we will have to consider redirecting aid if we are not happy with the quality of government and the issues confronting us. However, it is not an issue at the moment. The <Col N="718"/>situation is not as acute as it is in Ethiopia and Uganda where there are serious issues about redirecting aid. We will redirect aid if we are not happy with the quality of the elected government and what is being done in the name of the Palestinian people. We are not obliged to do so. We have our own independence in regard to how we deploy our money.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I want to make it clear that if we redirect aid, we will do so to the advantage of those who are suffering in Palestine and not to their disadvantage. As I have indicated in regard to other issues, we will not be cutting and running. As Minister of State I will produce a White Paper in July and I have indicated informally that I would consider including Palestine as a programme country and elevate and deepen our involvement in the region. I am disappointed this may not now be possible because of the difficulties involved. However, I will try to make allowances for it. If the politician situation in the region improves, I will be ready to increase, enhance and deepen our involvement with Palestine and assist it to make the transition we all want and expect of it. This will be subject to the political situation improving on a consensual basis.</P>

      <P FLI="0" el="5">
        <?oasys _is1p8- ?>&mdash;<?oasys _is0p2- ?><?oasys _ix ?>noting the commitment of the Government on 10 July 2003 that following the break up of Aer Rianta, &ldquo;Shannon and Cork are being given a new debt free start&rdquo; and that &ldquo;the existing debts associated with both airports, including the debt associated with the major new investment programme at Cork, will not be assigned to the new companies&rdquo;;</P>

        <?oasys _is1p8- ?>&mdash;<?oasys _is0p2- ?><?oasys _ix ?>calls on the Government unequivocally to renew the commitment entered into on 10 July 2003 and allow Cork and Shannon airports to &ldquo;commence business free of debt&rdquo;.</P><Col N="719"/>
      <P FLI="0" el="5" Just="Left">During my time in this House, I have rarely moved motions that have a local resonance for the area in which I live. It has not been my style. However, sometimes one is confronted with such a blatant act of misgovernment which applies locally that one has no option. I rarely bother wasting my time reading out a motion. This motion is essentially concerned with a commitment given by the Government. I could take up the whole of my 12 minutes citing the succession of occasions on which the Government committed itself to a specific course of action regarding Cork and Shannon airports, but I have more to do.</P>
      <P Just="Left">When it first announced its decision to break up Aer Rianta, the Government stated that the existing debts associated with both airports, including the debt associated with the major new investment programme in Cork, would not be assigned to the new company. It also stated that Cork and Shannon airports would be allowed to commence business free of debt and so on. I do not think anyone believed the Government at the time, except the ideologues in the business press who always believe that doing something with a State company is an improvement because they believe State companies are no good, therefore, if one does anything, it must improve them. Following the Eircom debacle, and the skilful capacity of that company, recognised by the international financial press, to outmanoeuvre our regulator, one would have hoped that we might have learned that sometimes State companies, however slow-moving, can at least be told to do things.</P>
      <P>I could recite more quotations but I do not wish to do so. The Leader of the House said that the legislation which brought about the break-up of Aer Rianta was rushed, premature and not so good. As leader for the Government, she had to be restrained, but what she said was a good brief summary.</P>
      <P>However, one statement deserves to be put on the record:</P>
      <P LI="1">This is unnecessary legislation which is badly conceived and badly thought out. I very much regret that it will inevitably pass in this House this week and eventually become law despite the many reservations about it on all sides of the House. If we pass this Bill, it will be a bad day for Ireland, and a very sad note on which to end this session. I believe the Minister has some reason that he has not told us about. I hope he will break it to us before the end of this session.</P>
      <P FLI="0" Just="Left">This is a politically charged statement, which is pointed and blunt. It sounds like something I would say. The Minister, Deputy Cullen, is used to me saying such things, and worse. However, that statement was made by my colleague, Senator Quinn, who is a very successful figure in the Irish business world. He is a champion of <Col N="720"/>private enterprise and a great believer in the value of competition. Nevertheless, he is profoundly wary of this policy. I do not think the Government should be guided always by Senator Quinn but it would have been worthwhile to have a specific response which would satisfy the business judgment of a person of such proven record and ability. No such response has been given.</P>
      <P>What most characterises the Government&rsquo;s position since the putative break-up of Aer Rianta is that there was no response other than an assurance that it should be trusted because it knows what it is doing, and somewhere along the way it will get better. We still do not know what motivated the Government. The policy was inherently contradictory from the moment it was announced. I would not have agreed with it but I would have understood a decision to privatise our airports. I would have seen the logic of it. I would have thought it was daft and ideologically driven, but I would have seen the sense of it.</P>
      <P>However, the Government imposed a series of constraints on our three international airports and fiddled around with a significant amount of debt to attempt to create an impression that two out of the three airports, which are relatively small, are commercially viable and that the third is so commercially powerful that it could sustain the debt of all three. It ignored advice already available that company law would make what was promised impossible. It talked good and decent people in the Cork region into becoming directors of a company which they now fear is not viable. However I might disagree with it, it would be nice to believe that the decision was based on some kind of forward-looking sense of the role of the private sector, private investment and a thrusting competitive market economy. I could deal with this because I would know if it was successful or unsuccessful. However, this was an attempt to create an impression of thrusting competitive individualised airports, while at the same time dealing with the fact that in terms of crude commercial reality, the scale of the debt and the scale of the turnover meant that the policy was internally contradictory.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Cork Airport has approximately 2.5 million passengers a year. A figure of 2.7 million passengers is predicted for the coming year, but let us look back to when the Minister made his announcement. Cork Airport could be saddled with a debt of &euro;140 million. The Minister may not mention debt at all in his script &mdash; it is not mentioned in the amendment. Seanad &Eacute;ireann needs to amend its Standing Orders so that amendments should at least have something to do with the motion. That is the least service the Government could do to Seanad &Eacute;ireann, regardless of who is moving the motion. If the Government wants to amend a motion, the amendment should deal with the topic under discussion, because none of us doubts there is significant growth in air traffic. Who argues against that? We did not say there is not such growth. None of us <Col N="721"/>wants to do anything other than commend the board. Its members are doing their best and are public servants in the best sense of the word, for limited reward, because they want to make something successful. We all know there is a need for continued investment and that Cork would benefit from new investment. We also know what the Government said in 2004. However, that is not the issue. The issue is what the Government is doing now. It is an extraordinary fact that the Government ran away from the opportunity to clarify the question most preoccupying business, trade unions and anyone interested in the future of Cork and Shannon airports, namely, what the Government is going to do about the debt.</P>
      <P>The Government considered this motion and agreed an amendment which ran away from it. That is what we have had to deal with since this topic first came on the agenda, the running away from the contradiction there from the start. It is not true that the Opposition did not notice it, despite what some journalists might say. We could see there were contradictions. We dealt with the legislation, voted against it, tried to amend it, sought clarity and were refused.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Consider the landing of a debt of &euro;140 million or &euro;150 million on Cork Airport. In the business and commercial world with which I am familiar &mdash; the chemical-pharmaceutical processing industry &mdash; one would expect to have an investment repaid in two to three years. That is if one is talking of commercial realities as distinct from infrastructural investment, which is the role of the State. In my capacity as a chemical engineer, I would not approve of any investment which would not be repaid within two or three years. If I were to suggest Cork Airport should pay back &euro;140 million in three years, that would be impossible. One would be talking of charging passengers an extra &euro;15 or &euro;20 per passenger per journey, and the airport would close down. So what are we to do? One can reduce the debt but is still tied into company law. One can either reduce the debt or spread it out over a period of time, which will in effect amount to some kind of subsidy to Cork Airport by the Dublin Airport Authority. Either choice will contradict the fundamental plank of public policy, which was to give Cork Airport the autonomy and the commercial space to operate independently. The debt will make it impossible for it to operate commercially. The tie-in to Dublin will prevent it from operating independently, which has happened over the years. Cork Airport was not allowed to open up routes unless Aer Rianta, essentially Dublin Airport, approved. That is what is now handed to Cork Airport, with the prospect for its directors of a major overhang of debt. That debt may well be converted into some sort of lease-back arrangement but will amount to the same thing. The airport will be commercial because it will have to be &mdash; if it is not commercial, all the issues to do with corporate governance will arise. If it is commercial it will have to meet commercial criteria, <Col N="722"/>which will represent a premium on the borrowings, because otherwise it is a subsidy rather than a commercial loan.</P>
      <P Just="Left">That is the mess the Government has gotten us into, and it threatens the futures of Cork and Shannon airports. That mess should not be resolved by threatening the future of Dublin Airport. It is no solution to treat that airport, because of its effective monopoly in an area of booming economy with potentially 30 million passengers within a short period of time, as some sort of cash cow to be instructed to fund the other airports.</P>
      <P>I hoped the Minister for Transport would attend and I deliberately left out the word &ldquo;condemn&rdquo; because I thought the issue was too important to get involved in silly politics. I wanted to hear what the Government intended to do to get us out of a mess into which it got us. Instead we have been given an inept amendment. I could vote for it, but will not. There is nothing in the amendment with which I would disagree. Who could disagree with any word of it? It is quite inept and offers no defence of Government policy, no response to the Opposition. It shows a running away from responsibility.</P>
      <P>As I said before in this House, I am tiring of the fact that the occasional motion from the Government side thanks the Government for making a decision, because such decisions are apparently now so rare that it is worthwhile standing up and cheering when they are made. Will somebody make a decision and tell the directors of Cork, Shannon and Dublin airports what the commercial future is, what commercial constraints they must operate within and what restriction will be imposed on them either by the Government, Dublin Airport, or whoever?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Mr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the motion. If we were to talk of political promises made and not fulfilled, and various commitments made by the Government, particularly with regard to the 2002 manifesto, we would be here for the night. It is important to focus on the matter before us. Particularly with regard to the greater Cork region, where Fianna F&aacute;il had its biggest success in the last general election, winning ten seats out of 20 in Cork city and county, this particular decision stands out well above every other unfulfilled commitment because it has a capacity to seriously undermine the economy in Cork and the competitiveness of Cork Airport.</P>
      <P>It is almost three years since the then Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, famously made the statement in which he pledged to dismantle Aer Rianta and set up three fully independent autonomous airports, the Dublin, Cork and Shannon airport authorities. I am repeating what he said in his press statement at the time. The promise was of fully independent and autonomous airports under State ownership within a year, yet three years later we are not quite sure what the future holds for those airports. Cork <Col N="723"/>Airport is not guaranteed independence and autonomy, but it now looks almost certain that the decision made by Aer Rianta, within a month of the decision made by Deputy Brennan when Minister for Transport, will mean that the cost of a &euro;140 million terminal in Cork Airport will be borne in part if not in full by Cork Airport Authority.</P>
      <P>Senator Ryan made the good point that to get out of this mess, to discover all of a sudden that company law now prohibits the Government from fulfilling its obligation, clearly outlined in a number of statements by Deputy Brennan when Minister for Transport, means the Government is hiding behind company law.</P>
      <P>I want the Minister for Transport to address a number of issues. Who in the Department of Transport was advising the then Minister, Deputy Brennan, in July 2000, and what was that advice? From a Cork perspective in particular I find it difficult to swallow the notion that the issue of company law was only discovered subsequent to a decision. This was one of the biggest decisions taken in recent years by any Minister for Transport. It was a major decision, and to be fair to the then Minister, Deputy Brennan, one would have to return again to the manifesto of 2002 and look at the party which pushed for separation of the airports, namely, the Progressive Democrats. That is how far back this issue goes. That was well established and well known by commentators, apart from Opposition politicians.</P>
      <P Just="Left">It is very difficult to accept the reality of the situation when for example Ryanair, as a result of this debacle, has decided to shelve its Cork to Liverpool service. It now flies from Kerry, where costs are significantly lower. Much of the time, I would not agree with anything said by one particular individual in that airline, but I can accept that decision in the context of the statement by Michael Cawley, Ryanair&rsquo;s deputy chief executive, that the increases were having a detrimental effect. It was Michael Cawley rather than Michael O&rsquo;Leary who said that. That has resulted in the loss of up to 20,000 tourists. The Minister knows full well the location of the airport and its critical importance to the economy of Cork and particularly the tourism economy of Kinsale, including the Beara Peninsula and Mizen Head. There is also a loss of &euro;13 million to the Cork economy.</P>
      <P>A certain spin is being pursued by Fianna F&aacute;il in Cork. The spin is precisely this, when the then Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, gave his commitment in regard to debt-free status, it related to the debt on the books of Cork Airport Authority in 2003. That is absolute rubbish. To hit that myth on the head I shall read from the Minister&rsquo;s press release when he announced the break up. To say that the debt-free status only applies to the 2003 accounts is incorrect. The then Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, said:</P><Col N="724"/>
      <P LI="1">When I establish the independent Shannon and Cork authorities on a statutory basis they will both commence business free of debt. The existing debts associated with both airports, including the debt associated with the major new investment programme at Cork, will not be assigned to the new companies but will remain with Dublin Airport.</P>
      <P FLI="0">Clearly that was the thinking of the then Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, at that time. It puts to bed the myth that is being spun in the Cork region by Fianna F&aacute;il. Of all the decisions made in regard to Cork and all the commitments made by Fianna F&aacute;il and the Progressive Democrats to the Cork region in recent years, this is one from which Cork will suffer most. Cork Airport will not be autonomous and will not be independent. It is unfair to expect Dublin Airport to consume the debt arising from the new terminal at Cork Airport. We are left with a political mess entirely of the Government&rsquo;s making.</P>
      <P>Who advised the then Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, in 2003? I presume the same people are advising the Minister in 2006. When was the issue of company law first discovered? Is it inevitable that Cork Airport Authority will have to shoulder all that debt, which is probably upwards of &euro;160 million? I look forward to the Minister&rsquo;s reply.</P>

      <P FLI="0" el="5">I welcome the Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen, to the House and also the opportunity to speak on the motion. This matter has been in the public domain for some time. It is good the Minister is present to discuss the issue from a Cork and Shannon perspective. The motion is set against a backdrop of significant growth at Cork and Shannon since the passage of the legislation, most of which was of critical importance. The idea of creating more autonomy at Shannon and Cork was welcome at the time. It was welcome because the management structure in place in Aer Rianta prevented basic decision-making at Shannon and Cork which resulted in a lack of movement in the sector to allow for greater use of these airports. There were no decision-making opportunities and no power afforded to the management other than the basic operation of the infrastructure.</P>
      <P Just="Left">It is widely accepted that the establishment of the independent boards has had a significant positive effect not only on Shannon and Cork but on the entire region. Like Senator Ryan, I do not wish to harp on the local element but I am familiar with what is happening at Shannon Airport and I am aware that the number of passengers has increased during the past 12 months to in excess of 1 million. The number is somewhat more when the military traffic is included. Shannon Airport has been very successful. The decision to allow the boards to set their own prices and approach airlines in their own way has been very successful and must be continued. It has also created better conditions for the management to go after new business. In this context I refer to the military business. There has been a significant increase in military traffic through Shannon Airport. My investigations suggest there has not been any more activity across the Atlantic during the past 12 months in the number of troops ferried to and fro.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>When we wanted to investigate Shannon the Government would not let us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>Rendition is a separate issue. We have talked about that and it is totally separate from the movement of troops. The volume of business is the same but Shannon is winning a greater amount of that business from our friends from Germany, England and other airports because it is able to offer a better service. Management has more control and has greater capacity to react to the needs of the airlines ferrying the troops. That is a positive development. The quality of the service being offered is better. The management team is more adaptable and easier to work with and is able to offer a more affordable service. The Minister has been at Shannon on a number of occasions and will be aware that <Col N="726"/>enormous progress has been made there in terms of growth.</P>
      <P>It is widely accepted by management, unions and staff that there is still a requirement to restructure at Shannon. However, we have gone a long way in proving the viability of the airport in terms of identifying ways of increasing the business. There was little point in talking about restructuring until such time as it was made clear to the workers that there was a viable business. In my view that has been achieved. Notwithstanding that, the board and the management must recognise that the workers are protected in legislation. There can be no mandatory redundancies. The best way to deal with that issue is to ensure the business grows sufficiently to accommodate the workers and ensure they have a viable future. That can be done. That there are no compulsory redundancies is not sufficient to stand on that premise. It is critical that the business is grown.</P>
      <P>The board and management at the airports, particularly at Shannon, need to engage more with staff on the issue of outsourcing. The catering section has been under fire for some time. The management has been suggesting, through the board, that the only solution is to outsource that component. I disagree. I am not a business expert but having discussed the matter with a number of people who have an interest in this area it is clear there is a viable business in the catering section and the management and the board must be more open to ideas on how that business might be part of a restructured operation. Given that there can be no mandatory redundancies the board will have to work with the hand of cards it is dealt. I hope that happens without delay. There is a need to look at all the alternatives in this area.</P>
      <P>The debt-free issue which has been raised by Senator Ryan and others is of critical importance to the development of the business plan. In Shannon it is probably not as big an issue because the board does not believe it will end up with anything other than a debt-free facility. I understand the debt at Shannon is approximately &euro;70 million, which is an historical debt, unlike that at Cork where the debt is more recent. However, that is not to minimise its impact on Cork. My concern in regard to Shannon is that there has been relatively low capital expenditure during the past two or three years. Those who understand the aviation sector will be aware there must be planned upgrade and maintenance of lighting facilities, runways and all the ancillary services to ensure the asset is maintained in order that one does not have to spend a huge amount of money some years hence. Capital expenditure of approximately &euro;8 million is needed annually to maintain the facilities.</P>
      <P>Senator Ryan has identified the reserves issue. There is no doubt that is creating the bulk of the problem. The inability of Dublin Airport Authority to spin off into the two separate companies, without the necessary reserves under company <Col N="727"/>law, has created a problem. There is no point dwelling on the reason this was allowed to occur or whether better or different advice should have been obtained. The intent at the time was to ensure the airports had sufficient capacity to manage their business, expand their market, generate increased numbers of passengers and provide better facilities for customers.</P>
      <P>A review of the progress achieved in realising the aims set down in the legislation is required. Policy could then be examined in light of the outcome. It is possible, for example, that the spin-off of assets to three individual companies will prove unnecessary. I propose such a review on the basis of the position at which we have arrived as opposed to the original aim. Given the substantial progress achieved to date, perhaps the establishment of three independent, statutorily constituted companies operating under the provisions of company law is no longer required. It is this proposal that is causing the problem. The airports are working well in the current hiatus. While I am not an expert in this area, I suggest that the Dublin Airport Authority be restructured to act as an umbrella encompassing all the State airports.</P>
      <P>When the legislation was first debated in the House I indicated that three independent companies would not be necessary and proposed the establishment of an umbrella organisation consisting of three boards, each with some degree of autonomy. While questions on the division of responsibility and control would arise, these could be resolved. The manner in which the airport boards have worked together in recent months has demonstrated they are capable of achieving the growth levels originally sought. We should review plans for the three major airports because any such examination might conclude that the transfer of debt or assets is not necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I would have been pleased to cede part of my time slot to Senator Dooley as he may have eventually informed the House whether he is in favour of his Government fulfilling the promise it made in 2003. That is the crux of this debate and the reason I support the motion tabled by Senator Ryan and his Labour Party colleagues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>The priority is to increase the number of passengers using our airports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I have never read such a meaningless amendment. Every Senator is in full agreement that the House should record its appreciation of the growth in airport traffic, note how important airports are to the regions and welcome new investment. In 2003, the then Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, promised that Shannon and Cork airports would start out as independent airports without debt. We want to ascertain from the Government side, particularly <Col N="728"/>the Fianna F&aacute;il Party Senators and Minister for Transport, the Government&rsquo;s position on the debt-free start for Cork Airport.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The House has two hours to debate the motion and amendment. The question the Minister must answer is whether he intends to fulfil the commitment given by his predecessor. This was central to the legislation and future plans for developing Cork and Shannon airports. Airports play a crucial role in the regions, not only in terms of tourism and passenger traffic but also in generating inward investment. It is vital, therefore, that Cork and Shannon airports continue to grow.</P>
      <P Just="Left">It is universally recognised that Cork and Shannon airports have significantly enhanced their status in recent years. The Fine Gael Party welcomes plans for further expansion and, in particular, the new terminal at Cork Airport, and looks forward to further developments. Politicians, workers and the business and commercial interests of Cork want answers and it is incumbent on the Minister to provide clarification and certainty with regard to the next steps. The previous Minister for Transport gave a solemn promise. While this commitment has not been explicitly withdrawn or contradicted, grave doubts have emerged about whether it will be kept. I hope the Minister will provide clarity and finality on the issue.</P>
      <P Just="Left">If the estimated debt of &euro;160 million is assigned to the new Cork Airport structure, the company will find it impossible to carry the burden, with the result that the airport and region will move into reverse gear. This would be disadvantageous from everyone&rsquo;s perspective. The Minister will be aware, for example, of the importance of Cork and Shannon airports to his Waterford constituency. Certainty is required if these airports are to expand and develop. The commitment given by the previous Minister to ensure the airports would commence independent operation with debt-free status provided such certainty. It is crucial and urgent, therefore, that the Minister not only clarify the position but ensure the Government meets its obligations at an early date.</P>
      <P>I noted comments made recently by Mr. McGann, chairman of the Dublin Airport Authority, following the welcome announcement that the authority&rsquo;s profits jumped 57% last year. Referring to the establishment of three independent airports, Mr. McGann stated this would not take place for at least a year, adding that the question of the debt-free status of Cork Airport could make the break-up of the authority even harder to achieve. Someone must take control of this matter. I trust the Government, rather than Mr. McGann and the Dublin Airport Authority, determines policy on airports, airlines and transport in general.</P>
      <P Just="Left">It is in the interests of all concerned that we bring this saga to a conclusion. I appeal to the Minister to ensure the future of Cork and Shannon airports reflects the fashion and formula <Col N="729"/>proposed by the Government in 2003, that is, that the new independent airports will start afresh with debt-free status. That is the crux of the motion and the Minister must provide clarity as to whether Government policy, as enunciated in 2003, has been changed. If it has changed, he must explain how and for what reason. I hope its policy remains intact and the Minister will respond favourably to the motion.</P>
      <P>As Senator Ryan and I both indicated, the Government amendment is meaningless. If the Government proposes to fulfil the commitment it gave, the Labour Party motion should be passed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomMorrissey"><NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
	<P>Like many other Senators, I was present for the debate on the relevant legislation. Members entered choppy waters in the early days of July 2003 when we tried to get the Bill through the Seanad and the Other House. I am familiar with the commitments entered into in the legislation.</P>
      <P>Senators have lauded the increase in traffic at our airports. When the Bill was introduced the Government was ambitious as regards the future of Cork and Shannon Airports and confident they would survive and grow. We have been proved correct. We would like the commitments entered into for Cork and Shannon Airports to be adhered to. Cork Airport cannot pay the debts due to its current payload for infrastructure and the same is true for Shannon Airport. Commitments were given with regard to the debts. Not alone should Cork or Shannon not have to pay them, but neither should passengers flying through Dublin.</P>
      <P>The Dublin Airport Authority has interests other than airports that are not strategic interests vital to the running of airports. The authority is involved in a hotel chain that cannot make a profit in an industry that has increased a hundredfold in the past nine years. It is sitting on an asset.</P>
    </Speaker>
<Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transpor</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>The chain is up for sale.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomMorrissey"><NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, and we want to see it sold as quickly as possible. The authority also has interests in airports outside of the country. Do they need to be involved in those interests? If they were realised, would there be enough money available to pay the debts? How much would be available to provide a way forward? Dublin Airport Authority is a company with certain assets and these must be examined.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I know from discussions I have had with directors involved in Cork and Shannon airports that when they took on their onerous task, they did so in the belief that the commitments entered into at the time would be adhered to. Notwithstanding the recent problems that have surfaced, we must do everything in our power to ensure they will. We have seen growth take place on the presumption that these airports would be debt free and on that basis decisions have been taken to introduce <Col N="730"/>extra flights. How can we ensure these airports still get a blank canvas and that the commitment is kept? We have seen the growth that has taken place since they became independent. It would not have taken place under the old regime. The T&aacute;naiste said at the weekend that there is no turning back. We must find a way forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister for Transport to the House. I recognise that his is a difficult portfolio as the issue of airports is so political and local that it raises the hackles of many. However, it is fair to say that we were sold a pup in this regard. When the legislation was going through the Houses I asked for clarification on two areas. I asked for clarification that the then CEO of the airport authority would be unaffected by the change, but this turned out to not be the case and we saw the back of her shortly afterwards. Senator Dooley sought the same assurance in that regard. I also raised the matter of the commitment to debt free status. I did not have a difficulty with the break up provided it was done along the lines suggested at the time, but I asked for the debt issue to be clarified and I left the debate with the clear impression that both Shannon and Cork airports would start off debt free under the new regime. The debt is a desperate manacle to place on them. It is unfortunate and bad for politics.</P>
      <P>When the break up was discussed here there was an element of political manoeuvring and politicking on the issues. There was genuine interest in discovering what would work and be best for each locality, particularly from those of us from the areas involved, including the Minister who has shown special interest in Waterford Regional Airport over the years. The issue for Munster is that the airports at Shannon, Cork, and to a lesser extent Kerry and Waterford, have something to offer. I did not object to the various interests or take on those arguments.</P>
      <P>When, for example, people from the Shannon area came here to lobby four or five years ago many said they would get nowhere because the issue then was all about the Shannon stopover. I met them and advised them to forget what had been said so far and go to the Minister and tell him they were prepared to sign off on becoming independent and ending the stopover etc., on the day he opened the rail head into Shannon. I felt that once they got the rail head into Shannon, it would have opened up the freight area. Shannon would have been the only airport in the country with a rail link and this would have provided significant possibilities. The Ennis-Limerick line was only three miles away and people were open to that kind of thinking at the time. Now Shannon has been left out on a limb, although it is in a better position than Cork, which appears to be left with a huge burden of debt.</P>
      <P>Cork Airport should not be left in this position and no fair-minded person would agree it is a fair start. Cork Airport did not hit the ground running <Col N="731"/>like Shannon, which got extra flights from Ryanair. At the same time, however, Cork Airport is building up business and next week is announcing new weekly flights to Hungary, Vienna and similar places. The airport is beginning to build links and the new facilities there will open soon. Nobody would disagree that we should give Cork Airport the fair start it expected. If the Department of Finance is not prepared to cough up in this regard, it should be exposed. Nobody will object to Cork getting a free run on this.</P>
      <P>The debate on privatisation versus nationalisation and keeping facilities in safe hands is another issue. The country has gone beyond this. People want a good service that gives taxpayers good value. There is no problem in introducing competitive elements, but neither is there anything wrong with a company being owned by the State if it works well, and this is my view on Aer Lingus. There is nothing wrong either in considering privatisation if it is in everybody&rsquo;s best interest. I had doubts about the break up of the airports and I expressed them at the time. Now that it has happened let us make it work and give the individual airports a good chance.</P>
      <P>Let us show people that we can have trust and confidence in recommendations such as these. In other words, if the Minister wants to sell the idea of the privatisation of Aer Lingus later in the year &mdash; on which I will argue against him &mdash; he will want people to have trust and confidence in what he will have to say. As matters stand, if he stands up on the issue, we will think that the last time we had a discussion on the airports we were sold a pup. We walked out of the debate with a different understanding of what was going to happen. It is important that we have trust and confidence in what we are told before we argue over crossing the t&rsquo;s and dotting the i&rsquo;s.</P>
      <P Just="Left">What needs to be done? We need investment in these airports. Currently they are not being marketed. The authorities are working hard at getting additional routes, which is crucial, but they are not marketing them. I use Cork and Shannon airports. I used Shannon Airport three times within the past six months and find it a great airport as it is so easy to get through. This is attractive to passengers. People from as far north as Mayo, who would be almost equidistant from Dublin and Shannon, now prefer to get to where they want to go from Shannon. Some people in the south west only consider holiday destinations they can reach through Cork or Shannon.</P>
      <P>There is a surge of support for these airports and there are significant possibilities that can be made work. Tourism bodies should be more closely linked with airport authorities but this is not happening. It happens in places such as Knock, which enjoys a significant number of flights. The importance of these regional airports is not marketed. In fact, the description of these international airports as &ldquo;regional&rdquo; should be <Col N="732"/>dropped. They provide a service to many destinations.</P>
      <P>Although I am a critic of Mr. Michael O&rsquo;Leary, at least he pays his taxes in this country and he has a sense of humour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>We can forget about Mr. Michael O&rsquo;Leary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>He has given life to Shannon, albeit only because he is playing one airport off against another. He played Shannon Airport off against Kerry Airport and the latter against Cork Airport, moving routes around like pieces on a board. That is the game he plays and we should take him on. He lost the war at Dublin Airport but he is still expanding the routes from it. After telling us he will not put another flight through it, he announces a new route the next week.</P>
      <P>The value offered to those flying through Cork and Shannon is of major importance. Both are traveller-friendly airports that I wish to see promoted. I agree with Senator Ryan&rsquo;s points at the outset of this debate and I wish both airports to be debt free so they can hit the ground running. This will allow them to market themselves, expand and provide a service to the communities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly"><NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>It is early days to have a broad, critical discussion on the future of the three airports. They were set up a couple of years ago and have not yet got down to business. We are debating this matter on a day when Shannon Airport was awarded a prize for being one of the best airports in Ireland. Dramatic figures indicate Dublin Airport will have to erect tents on top of car parks to accommodate people over the summer season. We should not be so negative and critical of something that has not yet established itself.</P>
      <P>There was always the view in Shannon that the airport was dominated by Dublin and that Aer Rianta looked after Dublin first and then Shannon and Cork. Shannon Airport&rsquo;s facilities were not utilised to the full extent because Dublin Airport dominated, denying Shannon the opportunity to expand and develop as it would have done if it had an autonomous board. I had reservations about breaking up the central authority with a common till, which is a better way of managing the airports. The competition arising from breaking up the airport authority will not help matters and may, in fact, create more difficulties.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, some felt that Shannon Airport needed an autonomous board to undertake the work necessary to provide more facilities and attract more airlines. There was underlying anxiety about what would result from the open skies policy and what would happen to Aer Lingus and workers at Shannon. The chambers of commerce, local commentators and politicians in the region believed the airport would be better served by an autonomous management board with State airport status. The Minister&rsquo;s prede<Col N="733"/>cessor made it clear that these three airports would remain State airports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <?oasys _cl11.5- ?>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>They will.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly"><NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>I will not express it in terms I would use outside the House but if things got difficult the State should support any airport that got into difficulty. Although the cost base problem at Shannon must be addressed, I cannot see these airports getting into difficulty. Much work has been done to reduce the cost base and the Minister&rsquo;s predecessor gave an undertaking that people would not be forced from their jobs. It was hoped that if there was overcapacity of personnel in the airport, some arrangement could be made to facilitate workers having a say in how this is addressed. I am satisfied that the difficulties highlighted this evening can be resolved because these are State airports.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Shannon, Dublin and Cork airports are expanding to the point of having capacity problems. This was not the case for a long time in Shannon. Runways and terminals were empty and, as the Cathaoirleach is aware, we were pleased to welcome Aeroflot long before the Iron Curtain collapsed. At the time the airport was in danger of closing. A transformation has taken place and the large numbers that passed through last year are an indication that the current policies are working. I wish to see the Shannon authorities allowed to undertake work at the airport. The board is comprised of very competent people and expert professionals are available. Some have managed airports for years and know what must be done to attract more business and address shortcomings. Major investment has made Shannon the ideal airport, as other Senators have mentioned.</P>
      <P>If the day of reckoning comes, management at Shannon Airport can approach the Minister to remind him of his responsibility to a State airport, owned by the people of Ireland. The new formula can transform Shannon Airport, thereby making a major impact on industry, tourism and business in the region.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>Despite the concern that transatlantic flights may be lost as a consequence of an open skies policy, sufficient business can be generated to copper-fasten and expand on current business. Yesterday I spoke to my neighbour who could not get an Aer Lingus flight to Shannon because of capacity problems. I appeal to those who take a negative view of the situation to give these airports a chance to become established.</P>
      <?oasys _cl11.5- ?>
      <P>I referred to rates on Committee Stage of the Bill that created the airport authorities. State airports should not pay substantial rates. Instead, the State should pay these bills and remove this burden from companies. Many such issues could be addressed, allowing the authorities to provide <Col N="734"/>a service to airlines, customers and people in the Shannon region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMinihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Minihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The view of the Progressive Democrats is that competition, in the same way as it has transformed the airline business, can transform the aviation sector generally for the benefit of consumers. Competition between airlines has worked and it will work between terminals, between service providers within terminals and it should work between airports.</P>
      <P>The Minister&rsquo;s predecessor correctly stated when Aer Rianta was being broken up that Dublin, not Cork, would bear the cost of the new terminal, which is &euro;140 million to &euro;160 million. The objective was to have Cork Airport independent and debt free so it could compete, to the benefit of consumers. As an independent authority, the Cork Airport Authority is based on a commercial mandate and its board has a fiscal duty only to absorb costs that, in its opinion, are reasonable and sensible. I trust the Minister agrees with this view.</P>
      <P>Placing a burden of cost on the Cork Airport Authority defeats the purpose of the break-up. Does the Minister accept that the charges in Cork are already the highest of the three airports? Increasing charges to repay debt on the terminal will merely result in Cork becoming more uncompetitive in comparison to Shannon, not more competitive. The people of Cork took great comfort from the words of the then Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, on 13 July 2004. I listened carefully to the debate and to the words of the Minister when he gave the explicit commitment Cork was awaiting. He stated:</P>
      <P LI="1">I am just leaving the existing debt where it is. It belongs with Dublin and nowhere else and I am not moving it. The debts belong in Dublin and will stay there. Does [anyone] believe I should leave Cork Airport to pay it off while still developing the airport? The burden of those debts must be lifted from their shoulders to allow them properly develop for the future.</P>
      <P FLI="0">In light of recent debate, the people of Cork are now left wondering what has changed. Cork Airport&rsquo;s passenger figures are up 20% at 2.7 million and heading to 3 million in 2006. The airport already has the highest charges and, if saddled with a significant portion of debt, will have to increase charges to service debt. Airlines will not open new routes and existing routes will be threatened. Where do we go from here?</P>
      <P>If it is now accepted that Cork Airport will not be debt free, our attention must move to the debt &mdash; how much will it be, how the repayments will be structured and so forth. A capital structure must be put in place so as not to create a position of insolvency in Cork Airport at any time. Such a position must be subordinate to the rights of employees. The workforce must be protected <Col N="735"/>regarding future pay deals, pension rights and so forth. Repayment must be structured in such a way that it is based on ability to pay and it must not compromise future development. It must be linked in some way to, for example, increased passenger turnover.</P>
      <P>The Dublin Airport Authority cannot place the Cork board in a position where it is at a competitive disadvantage. Shannon cannot be given preferential treatment, as in the past. This is meant to be an open, competitive race, not a handicapped hurdle.</P>
      <P>The Dublin Airport Authority, consultants and, regrettably, the Department of Transport are obsessed with Dublin Airport and its future at the expense of Cork and Shannon. It is unthinkable that while the Dublin Airport Authority retains its assets in Birmingham and Dusseldorf airports and the Great Southern Hotels &mdash; and it is considering the sale of the latter &mdash; it plans to place a crippling debt on Irish airports and place Dublin at a competitive advantage over Cork and Shannon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>That is utterly untrue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMinihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Minihan</NameTxt>
	<P>If it is untrue, I am delighted the Minister will clarify that this evening.</P>
    </Speaker>

	<P>The Senator should be careful what he wishes for with regard to competition. He just might get some.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMinihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Minihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Despite the various talks that are taking place, there is a tense stand off between customers, staff and the airlines simply because they do not know what is happening. I was shocked at the comments of the chairman of the Dublin Airport Authority after the recent AGM. He gave the definitive reply, prior to the completion of talks or consultants&rsquo; reports, that Cork would carry the debt. Is it right that a party with a clear vested interest controls the decision-making process, appoints the consultants and interprets their reports? It is disturbing that a chairman whose remit is to carry out Government policy would make such a comment. This appears to have been a unilateral decision.</P>
      <P>We now live in an era of 30-year mortgages and interest-only mortgages. If we need fantasy accounting to get over a technicality in company law, let us do it. The Minister knows the issue can be addressed. The new board in Cork has no power and is extremely frustrated. Frankly, it is working with its hands tied behind its back. All this suits Dublin and its own agenda.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMinihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Minihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Dublin is putting the screw on Cork and increasing charges to ensure a competitive advantage when it ultimately operates inde<Col N="736"/>pendently. It has no interest in the consequences for Cork.</P>
      <P>Cork Airport is well known as a productive operation. Its customers have shown great tolerance. The airport was voted airport of the year in 2002, 2003 and 2004 by the Chambers of Commerce of Ireland, despite the congestion. Passenger numbers are 2.7 million. However, we are not sure the proposed opening date for the new terminal, 10 May, will be met. Public relations people are defending the chairman of a State-owned company who is defying Government policy. What is the agenda? From whom is he taking direction?</P>
      <P>What action does the Minister propose to take if the boards of Cork Airport Authority and Dublin Airport Authority cannot agree on a repayment scenario? If I have said something incorrect, I will be glad to hear the Minister clarify the matter. We need answers and assurances. In particular, specific commitments must be honoured.</P>

	<P>There is much indecision on the part of the Government parties about air transport and the Dublin Airport Authority. If Cork Airport, Shannon Airport and the regions are to grow, they must be given the freedom to do it. When the then Minister, Deputy Brennan, said that Cork and Shannon Airports were to be debt free, he must have had a reason for saying it and must have meant it. However, it appears this Minister has changed his mind and the position of the previous Minister on it.</P>

	<P>On 17 January 2006 a spokesperson for the Minister said that any resolution would have to be considered in the context of the other airports and aviation policy. That means the Minister will take Dublin Airport&rsquo;s situation into account when he makes his decision&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. P. Burke</NameTxt>

	<P>Senator Paddy Burke without interruption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. P. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I hope the Minister will clarify the position this evening. Senator Minihan pointed out that Cork Airport was voted the best airport in 2002, 2003 and 2004 and now has 2.7 million passengers per year. It is a very important part of the infrastructure of Munster. Likewise, Shannon Airport is a very important part of the infrastructure of the west and mid-west. People from my constituency prefer to travel from Shannon rather than travel all the way to Dublin to leave the country.</P>
      <P>It is important to have the two airports at Cork and Shannon to cater for transatlantic flights. If the two airports are to be allowed to grow, the approach of the previous Minister, Deputy Brennan, is the one we should follow. My party&rsquo;s view is that neither airport should be carrying any debt. As Senator Minihan said, the boards of both airports are currently frustrated because they do not know whether they are coming or going. If any airport is able to carry the debt of the airport authorities, it is surely Dublin Airport which caters for nearly 20 million passengers per year. That number is predicted to grow to 30 million over the next ten years. Most people consider that, by and large, the Dublin Airport Authority has created the debt. I know that a large development is taking place at Cork Airport but the DAA is best placed to carry that debt.</P>
      <P>If the Munster and western regions are to be allowed to grow we will need proper infrastructure, including airports, roads, sewerage and water facilities. Some 15 or 16 different carriers are flying into Cork Airport, which is unbelievable. It is great to see that such companies can provide a service from the south to various parts of Europe and the UK. Hopefully, in the not too distant future transatlantic flights will also operate to and from Cork. It is important, however, that Cork is not straddled from the start with a massive debt in the region of &euro;160 million. If such airports are to compete they must be allowed to grow without any initial debt, otherwise they will lose some carriers which operate on the basis of low landing charges. If an airport is straddled with debt from the beginning, it will be at a complete disadvantage and will not be able to compete. We will then be left with one airport in Dublin and will be back to square one.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister will clarify the position because it seems there has been a shift in the <Col N="738"/>Government&rsquo;s position on the debt attached to some of those airports. I was disappointed with what Mr. McGann said and I hope he is not advocating the Government&rsquo;s position, which was the view expressed by the previous Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, two years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I hope I will be able to put all my points on the record within 15 minutes. I am glad to attend the Seanad for what has been an interesting debate. It saddens me that, unfortunately, substance and fact have had little to do with any such recent debates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>After tabling an amendment like that, that takes some nerve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>It is the ether that we all tend to focus on, rather than substance and fact, which is highly regrettable. We burn up huge amounts of energy and effort on points that in fact&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. P. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government has shifted its position, not the Opposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to allow Cork Airport &mdash; as with Shannon and Dublin &mdash; to be strong, commercially viable and successful. I am not sure what speech of my predecessor&rsquo;s the Opposition Members have quoted from but I wish to quote from his exact speech of 24 June 2004. Senators will see that the position has not changed one bit. The former Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, stated:</P>
      <P LI="1">The State Airports Bill has been carefully designed to deploy the necessary mechanisms under company law to provide maximum flexibility to effect the restructuring in conformity with the capital maintenance provisions of the Companies Acts. It provides a framework to allow for an orderly approach to the distribution of assets and facilitates the phasing which will be necessary in respect of the distribution of Cork and Shannon because of the insufficiency in Aer Rianta&rsquo;s reserves. The Bill proposes an enabling framework for the restructuring which is in line with existing provisions of company law. Aer Rianta will effectively transfer the assets relating to the airport businesses at Cork and Shannon to the new airport authorities established under the Bill in return for the issue of shares by the new companies to the Minister for Finance. For company law and accounting purposes the transfers will be regarded as distributions made by Aer Rianta to its shareholder, the Minister for Finance. Consequently, Aer Rianta will be able to make the transfers only when it has available distributable reserves equal to the net value of the assets transferred. As the distributable reserves available to Aer Rianta are insufficient for this purpose, a phased approach is <Col N="739"/>provided for in the Bill which will allow for one of the new airport authorities to be vested relatively soon after enactment, namely Shannon Airport, while the second will be vested once sufficient further distributable reserves have been built up within Aer Rianta, namely Cork Airport. A portion of the Cork Airport assets will remain in Aer Rianta and will be subject to a finance lease between Aer Rianta and the Cork Airport Authority.</P>
      <P FLI="0">That statement was made on 24 June 2004. It is utterly untrue to suggest that there is suddenly a problem with company law, that I have decided to do something utterly different from my predecessor, or that Government policy in this area has changed. All this was set out in great clarity and detail and no ambiguous language was used in the 2004 statement. My position today is precisely what the Government decided at that time.</P>
      <P>Neither I nor the Government has any interest in somehow establishing Cork, Shannon or Dublin Airports in a financially unviable position. It would be nonsense to do so. As a Minister representing a county next to Cork, I am happy to say I have used Cork Airport recently, in addition to using Shannon. I find both of them to be excellent airports. I have never referred to either Cork or Shannon as regional airports because they are major international airports&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">&mdash;&mdash;along with Dublin and should be seen as such. We need to avoid the ether and deal with the facts of what we are trying to achieve. I hope I can demonstrate clearly to the House that there is no equivocation on my part. There are issues that must be dealt with fairly to the advantage of Cork, Shannon and Dublin airports. That is where we currently stand.</P>
      <P>Senators have referred to the fact that the three airports have made significant advances in this Government&rsquo;s period in office. All three airports showed record traffic growth last year with passenger numbers of over 18.5 million for Dublin, 3.3 million in Shannon and 2.7 million in Cork. That represents a growth of approximately 8% for Dublin, 38% for Shannon and 21% for Cork. It is clear that the new boards at Shannon and Cork, in conjunction with the DAA, are bringing a new impetus to the development and growth of their airports.</P>
      <P>The State Airports Act 2004 provided a new opportunity to the State airports to grow and develop with an invigorated commercial mandate. It paved the way for the establishment of three State airports. I believe in State airports, by the way. I have a clear view on fixed assets in this country remaining in State hands. I have stated that repeatedly and it is a view I hold dear. Others may have different views but my view <Col N="740"/>should not be confused in this regard because it has been unequivocal. My track record on the development of Dublin Airport clearly demonstrates my view in that respect.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The Act provides a framework to allow for an orderly approach to the distribution of the assets of Shannon and Cork airports in conformity with capital maintenance and other provisions of the Companies Acts. I am surprised that some Senators may say we will ignore the Companies Acts when we talk about our business but we will make them apply very strongly to the private sector. That is a nonsense and would be unacceptable by international standards. We do not want another WorldCom or whatever coming into this country. I will not, and would not, preside over some way of bypassing or getting around the Companies Acts. National and international law is clear. I will ensure that State and private sector companies adhere to the highest standards of international practice of company law. There is no separate company law for State companies and private sector companies. As long as this Government is in power company law will apply across the board and the standards will be the highest possible.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The boards of Cork and Shannon airports are charged with preparing to assume responsibility for the ownership and development of the airports. They are also empowered to undertake certain management and operational functions which they have done successfully. Under the Act, before any assets can transfer to Shannon or Cork, the Minister for Finance and I must be satisfied as to the financial and operational readiness of the airport authorities.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I have no interest in going forward with a proposal that would in any way undermine Cork Airport. The opposite is the case. My job is to ensure that Cork and Shannon airports are set off with the strongest possible, viable commercial mandate for their future development. That is the only agenda that the Government and I wish to pursue. Therefore, each authority is required to prepare a comprehensive business plan and obtain our approval for these plans before any assets can be transferred.</P>
      <P>The three State airport authorities continue to work on the preparation of their business plans with the Dublin Airport Authority. I accept that this entails difficulties. Everybody has a view and seeks the best outcome from his or her perspective, which is reasonable and understandable. We must reach a point at which we focus on the reality of what we are trying to achieve and make sure we have good outcomes for all the airports.</P>
      <P>A range of issues need to be considered, including the unsustainable cost base at Shannon which has been acknowledged by all involved there; the recent airport charges determination for Dublin Airport by the Commission for Aviation Regulation; and the optimum mechan<Col N="741"/>isms for the financing of the new terminal in Cork. The Commissioner for Aviation Regulation made clear that he will not allow a charging regime at Dublin Airport to cover the costs of Cork or any other airport. That is the law within which we must operate. Some might argue that of course he would say that because it would be unfair for passengers in Dublin Airport to pay for passengers in other airports. We must, however, strike a balance of fairness, based on good commercial outcomes for all the airports.</P>
      <P>The airport authorities must consider these complex issues. I have not set any artificial deadlines for the completion of the process. My Department will continue to liaise with the boards on the business planning timetables, taking account of the key issues I have mentioned. I look forward to the finalisation of the business planning process because of its importance to facilitating the development of dynamic, independent and financially sustainable State airports.</P>
      <P>A core principle of the Government objective in airport restructuring is that this must be achieved in a manner which underpins the financial sustainability of all three State airports. Cork Airport is being transformed by the development project nearing completion which will effectively deliver a new landside airport for Cork. This is the first major upgrading of all its facilities since the airport was built in the late 1950s.</P>
      <P>The figure of &euro;140 million has been bandied about here tonight. This is a new figure to me. I have never articulated it but it has suddenly emerged. The debt for Cork Airport will be approximately &euro;200 million, inclusive of the new terminal, which is a great deal more than &euro;140 million. I have never said and nobody in my Department or the Government has said &euro;140 million or that Cork Airport was being saddled with the full cost of the terminal. That is not the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Minister should outline the position. He should not be lecturing us here. He should tell us the figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not lecturing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister always tells us we are wrong. He should tell us what the figure is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>I am only putting the facts forward. One of the first meetings I had after being appointed Minister for Transport was with the board of Cork Airport. I made the facts and the demands clear at that meeting and have not changed my position. That board has been in no doubt of its position and responsibilities since the first day I met it on taking office. I have quoted what that position was as set out when the State Airports Bill was brought to this House and to the D&aacute;il. It is clear what the Minister said and what the procedures were. There is no point play<Col N="742"/>ing games around these issues. The facts must be dealt with and the outcomes achieved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister should tell us what they are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Another point made here tonight reflects a perception that Dublin Airport Authority holds sizeable assets worth large sums of money. That is not true. All of those assets must be cashed in but they will not go near providing for the separation of Cork and Shannon, the pension issues and the development of Dublin Airport. There are few of them. The Great Southern Hotels group is being sold but there is a heavy debt attached to that. The only other major asset is the stand at Birmingham; the one at Frankfurt is not equivalent to that. They are good assets to cash in but they are also a serious part of the income which will be lost in order to develop the airports.</P>
      <P>The project in Cork comprises not only the new terminal building but the multi-storey car park, surface level car parks, new fire stations, new internal road systems and the upgrading or replacement of all utility services such as water, gas and electricity. When completed the new Cork Airport will have a passenger capacity of over 3 million with a facility to expand to 5 million. It is important that the debate about Cork&rsquo;s future does not obscure this major development for the airport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister left out the reference to debt in his script.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
	<P>This development will impact not just on the airport and the general Cork area but also on the regional economy in which it will be a major driver of growth. The new terminal should be seen as a key component in delivering on Cork&rsquo;s status as a gateway city under the national spatial strategy.</P>
      <P>This airport investment complements the other major transport infrastructural projects that the Government has earmarked for Cork under Transport 21. This includes the railway in Midleton, the strategic area plan, the investment in public transport, road transport etc., all of which will greatly benefit the interconnections with Cork, as at Shannon and all the developments taking place there too.</P>
      <P>I acknowledge the efforts going on at Shannon. I welcome the fact that the Labour Relations Commission is meeting with people there, which I hope reaches a positive conclusion for all the stakeholders in order that we can move on. That will be an important contribution to the success of Shannon Airport. Some of the Senators are right, the opportunities for both airports are significant on the European, transatlantic and other long-haul routes.</P><Col N="743"/>
      <P>The previous Minister said that it would take a sequential effort to distribute and give these airports their independence. The confusion arises because Cork Airport wants to speed up the process. It is right to want its independence now because it wants to start its own planning but that requires working within the circumstances available. We can wait seven to ten years if we want, until all the distributed reserves are available and then move out but that would be the wrong decision. We must place this debate about Cork in the context of what exactly was said rather than bits extrapolated from what was said.</P>
      <P>I believe there is a very good formula on the table. I have articulated that to the sub-committee, as Members from Cork will be aware. I met them again recently. We are having some final figures examined. I am aware there are concerns in Cork about the charging regime and legitimate questions are being asked, as is the case on some of the other issues. Senators Dooley, Daly and others have raised issues on the Shannon aspects and how they are to be resolved but they are all resolvable. We are all mature people and we are all business people. The people on the board understand what they want to do.</P>
      <P>As a regional Minister I want a strong Cork Airport and a strong Shannon Airport. Equally, I am mindful that we need a strong Dublin Airport. It is the major gateway into the country and we must move ahead in that respect. Between &euro;1.2 billion to &euro;1.5 billion must be found for developments at the airport. We have an unsustainable position in an airport now trying to carry in excess of 21 million passengers, and that figure will increase to 30 million. Achieving a balance in all of these issues can deliver a very good outcome.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Senators should accept that small regional airports have debt but they can manage it. The small corner shop at the end of the road has some kind of debt but it manages it. We must be realistic as to what we are saying. There is no question that we can send Cork Airport off to independence without any real debt. We can put an arrangement in place between the two boards. That will be very strong from Cork Airport&rsquo;s point of view in terms of its ability to develop its commercial mandate, as we can with Shannon, but equally it will allow Dublin, working within the rules and regulations and the law of the land, to develop as well. When we take all those issues into consideration, there is the prospect of a very good outcome for Cork, Shannon and Dublin airports. We should all focus on that and get on with it.</P>
      <P>I agree with the assessment of people on the Cork board to whom I have spoken that rather than wait, as originally anticipated, for a number of years to take its independence, the opportunity in aviation development presents itself now and let us find a mechanism to do it more quickly. I <Col N="744"/>agree with that and I have told them they are right. That is a good judgment call but to do that we must consider how to manage these issues in a much shorter timeframe than might have been the case previously when the Bill was introduced.</P>
      <P Just="Left">It is in everybody&rsquo;s interest to get a good outcome. I am in a position to deliver a very good outcome for Cork, Shannon and Dublin airports which will leave them free to focus on the real challenge &mdash; developing services for their passengers with the airlines into those airports to strengthen them for the future. That is where we all want to go.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister. I have absolute confidence that he is committed to all the State airports to ensure they are able to develop.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I had the pleasure in the past fortnight of travelling three times to and from Shannon and a fourth time from Dublin. If people realised what a pleasurable experience it is going through Cork and Shannon airports &mdash; obviously if it is a transatlantic flight one is talking about Shannon &mdash; in comparison with struggling with long security queues, long distance car parks and the like in Dublin, the traffic would grow even faster.</P>
      <P>I assume a little of the growth of traffic in Shannon has to do with the throughput of GIs. I spoke to some of them who were stopping over for an hour and a half on their way to Kuwait and Baghdad. I have never had any problem with that traffic and I am glad we are able to assist in conformity with the United Nations resolution of June 2004 to facilitate the multinational force in the establishment of democracy in Iraq.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The reason we are having this debate is that the impression was given that Dublin Airport, being infinitely the strongest of the three airports, would take care of the debt for the other airports. I did not appreciate the way the chief executive in Dublin spoke out almost in defiance of previous Government policy. I am in favour of chief executives making measured contributions to public debate. If they have difficulties with decisions that have been taken they have many channels of communication with the Government but it is not a satisfactory spectacle, whether one is talking about debts of Shannon and Cork airports or the Great Southern Hotels, to fairly trenchantly lay down a position in public without much caring whether it is consistent with Government policy. The Minister who has just left will remember that recently at a south-east region chamber of commerce meeting, the chief executive of another State body was quizzed about the question of a university for the south east. Very properly, he played somewhat to touch on that given the state of formulation of Government policy on that area. I do not believe that was a satisfactory approach by the other chief executive.</P><Col N="745"/>
      <P Just="Left">The Government is fortunately in a very strong financial position. My estimate, on the basis of the Exchequer returns, is that there will be a comfortable surplus this year instead of a significant deficit. When all is said and done, assets realised and so on, if it is necessary for the Government to assist in putting Cork and Shannon airports on the right footing, it should not hesitate to do that. I was one of those who on balance was in favour of splitting the three airports because traffic growth had been occurring in a lopsided manner and there had been a shift in the balance, particularly away from Shannon towards Dublin. There had to be a way of levelling the playing field and I had the impression, for a time anyway, that Dublin was the big player and that was what Aer Rianta was mostly interested in developing.</P>
      <P Just="Left">There are great possibilities for Shannon and Cork airports because they offer a much more pleasant experience. I was very pleased to see in Shannon Airport the morning I travelled out that there were about six or seven flights crossing the Atlantic to various destinations in North America. That is the way it should be.</P>
      <P>Picking up on what Senator O&rsquo;Toole said, there is a nice new dual carriageway into Shannon Airport, which was still being built this time last year. That is a very welcome development but the rail link into Shannon is also necessary. On one of my journeys I did not have the car and I got the bus into Limerick and then waited for a train to Limerick Junction. As Members know, I am quite a user of public transport; I like to see how it is operated and experience using it.</P>
      <P>I look forward to the day when Shannon is served by a direct link, as Ennis is currently served. This should be part of the equation of Government decisions on this subject.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DiarmuidWilson"><NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank the Minister for his very comprehensive speech in which he clarified a number of what he termed &ldquo;misunderstandings&rdquo; by the Opposition in respect of Cork and Shannon airports. I welcome the Minister of State to the House. As Senator Mansergh noted, the experience of travelling from Shannon, Cork or even Donegal is more pleasurable than travelling through Dublin Airport. Donegal does not have a dual carriageway going to the airport but I am sure it will by the time the Minister of State completes his tenure in the Department of Transport.</P>
      <P>In the State Airports Bill 2004, the Government set out its wish that the three airports be structured in a way that best equips them to deal with the new challenges and opportunities of the 21st century facing the entire aviation sector. The Government believed that commercially successful airports in Shannon and Cork would better assist in the economic and tourism-related development of their catchment areas. The Government took the view that autonomous <Col N="746"/>regional boards in Cork and Shannon with the necessary commercial expertise and background would give strong and visionary regional leadership to the new airport companies so that both airports could adapt more quickly in a rapidly changing aviation environment.</P>
      <P Just="Left">In so far as market dynamics permit, the establishment of Shannon and Cork airports as separate commercially focused entities placed them in a position to promote and expand their range of services, thereby leading to greater competition with Dublin Airport.</P>
      <P>As the country&rsquo;s major airport, Dublin Airport continues to expand to meet Ireland&rsquo;s requirements for tourism and industrial growth. The three State airports, operating as separate successful commercial State companies, have the potential to expand their business and enhance shareholder value.</P>
      <P>The Minister&rsquo;s speech makes it clear that this policy has worked. He pointed out that all three airports showed record traffic growth last year, with passenger numbers of 18.46 million at Dublin Airport; 3.3 million at Shannon Airport; and 2.73 million at Cork Airport. I understand that last year, passenger numbers increased by 1 million at Shannon Airport and that passenger numbers also increased at Cork Airport.</P>
      <P>In a speech to this House, the former Minister for Transport, Deputy Seamus Brennan, stated that the three State airport authorities would consult with unions in respect of the preparation of their business plans. I would like further clarification because the Minister did not indicate whether this has happened. It is important that this consultation takes place in order to ensure continuing harmony at these three airports.</P>
      <P>Senator Ryan, for whom I have great respect, and Senator McCarthy should be more concerned with&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I hope Senator Wilson also respects Senator McCarthy. He would be very disappointed if he did not respect him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DiarmuidWilson"><NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
	<P>Senators Ryan and McCarthy should be more concerned with the content of the Minister&rsquo;s speech today. According to the Minister, the new Cork Airport will have a passenger capacity of 3 million when completed. The airport has almost reached this capacity. If I were Senator Ryan or Senator McCarthy, I would be more interested in increasing this capacity to 5 million immediately.</P>
      <P>The plan set out in the State Airports Bill 2004 introduced by the former Minister for Transport has worked and the Opposition knows this. While we all appreciate that an election is looming and that the Opposition would like to take one or two of the ten Fianna F&aacute;il seats in Cork, it will not do so by spinning untruths in this House or in Cork.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="747"/>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Among the qualities given to me by the good Lord is my sense of humour, which has survived in spite of the vicissitudes of politics. I am also an engineer and, therefore, comfortable dealing with numbers. Fortunately, having spent long and tedious hours here dealing with legislation, I am also comfortable dealing with legal matters.</P>
      <P Just="Left">When I hear a Minister give a speech comprised of hot air alleging that the Opposition&rsquo;s argument is nothing but hot air, I tend to heckle but also listen very carefully. The Minister said essentially that there was no difference between his position and that of his predecessor. According to a statement dated 10 July 2003 on the Department of Transport&rsquo;s website, the former Minister stated that 12 months from 10 July 2003, Shannon, Cork and Dublin airports would be established as fully independent authorities. He also stated that he would establish independent airport authorities in Cork and Shannon Airport on a statutory basis which would commence business free of debt. According to the former Minister&rsquo;s statement, the existing debts associated with both airports, including the debt associated with the major new investment programme at Cork, would not be assigned to the new companies but would remain with Dublin Airport and absorbing the debts for Shannon and Cork would not place an unreasonable additional burden on Dublin Airport.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The current Minister for Transport attempted to deal with this issue in his speech here today. In a copy of his speech received by Members, the Minister acknowledged that during the early stages in the airport restructuring process, it was intended that both the independent Cork and Shannon airports would commence operations on a debt-free basis. However, he omitted to deliver this part of his speech to the House. Perhaps, we persuaded, converted or confused him but he did not deliver this part of his speech.</P>
      <P>The Minister then went on to state that this would always be subject to determining the optimum mechanisms for allocating airport assets among the three airports in compliance with the capital maintenance rules and other provisions of the Companies Acts. This provision came later and was not part of the former Minister&rsquo;s original announcement. Later in his speech, the Minister stated that an adjustment to the approach was required as the matter was examined further, in consultation with the Department&rsquo;s advisers, before the State Airports Bill 2004 was debated in the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>On Second Stage of the State Airports Bill in the D&aacute;il in June 2004, the former Minister stated that under the terms of the restructuring, both airports would commence operations debt free. This meant that a debt of &euro;70 million would be removed from Shannon Airport and approximately &euro;120 million from Cork Airport. This is <Col N="748"/>where I obtained my mythological figure of &euro;120 million, which the Minister informed me was wrong although he neglected to tell me the correct figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. P. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>He said the figure was &euro;200 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">We do not know what the correct figure is anymore. The Minister told Cork Airport but he will not tell anybody else. He will obviously wait until after the next general election. He informs this House that it was a readjustment that was necessary before the legislation was introduced in the Houses of the Oireachtas. This is in spite of the fact that part of his speech referred to the intention in the early stages in the airport restructuring process that both the independent Cork and Shannon airports would commence operations on a debt-free basis. Presumably, he did not deliver this part of his speech because even his neck would not extend that far. It now transpires that the readjustment process began once the Government was out of the gate and there was no plan for a readjustment beforehand. The Government either did not examine company law properly beforehand or ignored it.</P>
      <P Just="Left">It is clear that the former Minister, with the full knowledge of the Government, gave a speech which was inherently contradictory. Parts of the speech complied with company law, while others were full of sweeteners to keep Cork and Shannon happy. The former Minister and the Government knew at the time that they could not achieve both aims but they knew they would not get away with the restructuring process if they did not state that Cork and Shannon airports would commence operations on a debt-free basis. The Minister&rsquo;s statement was among the most brass-necked attempts to pretend that nothing has changed. After reading his script, he said an adjustment was required. He began his speech by telling the House that there was no difference between the former Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, and himself. &ldquo;Adjustment&rdquo; is a carefully chosen word.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>We now know that the Government knew it could not do what it said it would, it made promises in respect of this that it could not keep and it could only have kept its promise on debt by breaking company law. The Minister should not play games about bank debt with me. A lease to Dublin Airport with a commercial obligation to make a repayment is the equivalent of a bank debt. There is no difference. It is an extraordinary exercise in verbal mincing to pretend that the former Minister was talking about bank debt. The basic idea was that the balance sheet of Cork Airport would be free of debt. A mortgage is a debt, borrowing is a debt and an obligation to repay for something is a debt by everybody&rsquo;s understanding except <Col N="749"/>that of one person, the Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen.</P>

    <Title>Neural Tube Defects.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House because he will have a good understanding of this issue. He replied previously to a debate on the folic acid fortification of flour which I bring up every three or four years. However, I have proceeded no further.</P>
      <P Just="Left">It is known that folic acid fortification prevents neural tube defects such as anencephely and spina bifida. This issue has been discussed in this <Col N="750"/>country since 1992. We have one of the highest incidence in the world of these serious congenital abnormalities. All babies with anencephely die, some with spina bifida die and those who survive face problems with incontinence, walking difficulties, which get progressively worse in some cases as they get older, surgical operations and other medical interventions to deal with their serious problems.</P>
      <P>Since it became known that a diet high in folic acid helped to reduce the incidence of these conditions, there has been a public health campaign to encourage women hoping to conceive to supplement their diets with folic acid. Research carried out by O&rsquo;Leary, McDonnell and Johnson of the then Eastern Regional Health Authority in 2000 on the uptake of folic acid, which was published in the <i>Irish Medical Journal</i> in June 2001, found that just 18% of women heeded the advice. While these were usually in the higher socio-economic classes, there was a high number of people in poorer areas, where diet might not be as good in respect of the general amount of folic acid one takes in and where 50% of pregnancies were unplanned.</P><Col N="751"/>
      <P Just="Left">I raised the matter shortly after the Department of Health recommended that something be done about it in the early 1990s. I raised it in 1998, 2000 and subsequently. On each occasion, I am more or less told &ldquo;Live horse and you&rsquo;ll get grass.&rdquo; I pointed out in the debate in this House on 27 January 2000 that the Food and Drug Administration in the United States, which is a conservative body, recommended folic acid fortification of flour decades ago. The United States has achieved a 70% reduction in these very serious neural tube defects and the resultant disabilities.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The Food Safety Authority of Ireland backed such a move in 1998. I received a reply from the then Minister of State at the Department of Health, Dr. Tom Moffatt, which reads as follows:</P>
      <P LI="1">I can assure the House that the Department of Health and I are committed to ensuring that no effort is spared to ensure that the number of babies born with neural tube defects can be reduced or eliminated altogether.</P>
      <P FLI="0" Just="Left">At the time, approximately 70 to 80 children were born in the country each year with one of these problems. The year 2002 is the most recent for which I can get figures. The perinatal mortality and morbidity figures take a little while to obtain. When these were published in December 2005, there was little or no change in the incidence of anencephely or spina bifida. Any change by way of a decrease might be ascribed to the fact that when women have an ultrasound scan early in the pregnancy, they know the baby has a neural tube defect, and it is more than probable that many of them who would otherwise have gone on to full term have abortions abroad. In practical terms, what this means is that in the five and a half years since I spoke on the matter in this House in 2000, several hundred children have been born in this country with neural tube defects when the figure could have been a few dozen if their mothers had been taking folic acid in fortified flour.</P>
      <P>We have been waiting for a report on these recommendations for four years. The national committee on folic acid food fortification has met four, five or six times and we are constantly told it will recommend the fortification of flour, but we are waiting for the report, which has repeatedly been delayed. Meanwhile, as I speak, children in the womb are not protected. Why the delay?</P>
      <P Just="Left">The value of additional folic acid in dealing with cardiac disease is also well known. A high level of homosisteine in the blood due to a low level of the enzyme which reduces it is one of the genetic crosses of the Irish. That we bear this cross contributes to the high levels of heart disease in this country. Cardiologists appear to be<i> ad idem</i> that the fortification of food with folic <Col N="752"/>acid would greatly help in preventing heart disease. Evidence that it may help in other conditions such as reducing the incidence of bowel cancer &mdash; another serious problem in Ireland &mdash; is less conclusive, but we know that neural tube defects could be almost eliminated and that cardiac disease would greatly reduce if we had the folic acid fortification which would help in both these conditions. I again ask the Minister of State why there is such a delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimOMalleyPD"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. T. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>I am taking the Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney. I thank Senator Henry for raising this matter again as it provides me with an opportunity to outline to this House the position in this matter.</P>
      <P>The national committee on folic acid food fortification, which held its first meeting in February 2005, is tasked with reviewing options for the fortification of foods with folic acid in view of the relatively high level of neural tube defects in Ireland. In carrying out this work, the committee is to address the broader aspects of implementing a fortification policy, including the technical issues regarding fortification, addressing risk and examining other reported health benefits that are linked to fortification. The Food Safety Authority of Ireland is acting as the secretariat to the committee.</P>
      <P>The national committee is comprised of experts in this area as well as public health specialists and administrators. The committee is looking at three policy options, the first being structured voluntary fortification programme whereby flour millers or bakers would add a specific level of folic acid to bread. These breads would carry a special logo and label to enable consumers to choose bread with or without added folic acid. The second option is a mandatory fortification programme of some bread making flour or of all flour and the third option is the continuation of the current practice whereby a limited range of foods are voluntarily fortified with folic acid. This is combined with health promotion campaigns advising women who may become pregnant to take folic acid supplements.</P>
      <P>As part of its work, the committee consulted widely and, following an analysis of all submissions received and having reviewed the scientific evidence available, the committee will make a policy recommendation to the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children. The work of the committee is well advanced and I am informed that its formal report will be submitted shortly. The work of the committee is fully documented on the website of the Food Safety Authority of Ireland and given that it commenced its work just over one year ago it has performed a <Col N="753"/>complex task in a tight timeframe. When the report is received it will be considered with a view to implementing the eventual recommendations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>I know the response is prepared for the Minister of State but there is not one word in it which I could not have written down and brought here myself. One of the excuses I was constantly given is that the fortification would affect the confectionery trade with the United Kingdom. The United Kingdom has now introduced fortification of flour so that excuse is gone. I implore the Minister of State to have some sense of urgency brought to the situation because if one visited the National Rehabilitation Centre and saw young children and older people there with spina bifida, one would be ashamed to think that children with such conditions are still being born in this country. I am very disappointed with the reply and I hope the Minister of State will inform the Department of Health and Children.</P>

    <Title>Aviation Emergencies.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House. As he is aware, during the Easter recess a Ryanair flight from Paris was diverted to Prestwick in Scotland because of a bomb scare. The diversion of the aeroplane made sense as it was escorted to the airport by RAF fighter jets, and the British Prime Minister was notified of the event. The aeroplane landed safely, but what happened afterwards was mind-boggling, as passengers and cabin crew were left on the aircraft for two hours. If the Minister of State were on an aircraft and received word &mdash; God forbid &mdash; that a suspected bomb was on the aircraft and an emergency landing was being made, he would naturally be terrified.</P>
      <P Just="Left">On the aircraft in question there were students from St. Leo&rsquo;s College, a secondary school in Carlow. No doubt the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Parlon, who is present, may also have had some constituents on the aircraft, as many students from Laoighis-Offaly go to that school.</P>
      <P>The aeroplane landed safely. The obvious action to take would then be to evacuate the plane, including the cabin crew and staff. My brother-in-law happens to be an Aer Lingus captain, so it is worth noting that the cabin crew was also put at risk in this instance. The passengers and crew could have been escorted to a secure building and perhaps questioned. Instead they were left on the aircraft for two and a half hours, which makes no sense to anyone considering the situation. I know the pilots involved are very concerned and I believe an investigation is under way. I spoke to parents who were frantic with worry. They were all set to collect their children <Col N="754"/>from the school trip. Then they heard the aircraft was being diverted and that there was a suspected bomb on board. The children aboard were not allowed to text their relations, although some managed to send a few texts.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The basic point is that people were left on the aircraft for two and a half hours after it landed. I am aware of a similar incident involving an Aer Arann flight in the same week or the following week but the incident I refer to must be raised by the Minister of State with his British counterpart. He or she needs to be asked why people were left on the aircraft for two and a half hours after they landed safely.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Let us imagine if there had been a bomb on the aeroplane and if it had exploded an hour after the safe landing. We would all be asking why the aircraft had not been evacuated. Have we learned anything from the 9/11 attack where, unfortunately, thousands of people paid with their lives when the second tower was not evacuated as should have happened after the first attack? I understand a message went to those in the second tower to stay there, although it was intended to evacuate the building. If people had been evacuated from the second tower, their lives and those of many others would have been saved.</P>
      <P>This is a serious issue which I intend to pursue further. I implore the Minister of State or the Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen, to raise the matter directly with their British counterparts and find out why people were not evacuated from the aeroplane and brought to a secure unit where they could be questioned and allowed to telephone their relations and friends at home. Their experience was quite terrifying.</P>
      <P>I commend the teachers involved who had to cope with their own fears while looking after the 70 students involved. It is mind-boggling to leave someone on an aeroplane in that situation after a safe landing. I look forward to the reply of the Minister of State. Questions should also be asked of his British counterparts about the questioning procedure employed. As far as I know, the students were questioned, although many were under the age of 16. I am not a legal expert but I think the law requires that either a guardian or a legal representative must be present before a minor can be questioned. That does not appear to have happened, which is a separate issue.</P>
      <P>My question is simple. Why, when the aeroplane landed safely, were passengers and crew left on the craft with a suspected bomb on board for over two hours?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Browne for raising this issue. The Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen, and I are aware of the general circumstances surrounding the recent hoax bomb scare on a Ryanair aircraft flying from Paris <Col N="755"/>Beauvais to Dublin Airport on 12 April 2006. Ryanair has furnished an initial report to the Department and the airline has also been in touch with the UK Department of Transport in the matter.</P>
      <P>I have been advised that the Ryanair investigation into the handling of the incident at Prestwick Airport and the dissemination of information to passengers on board the aircraft is ongoing. As the Senator has stated there were 80 teenagers from St. Leo&rsquo;s secondary school, Carlow, on board the aircraft and the investigation is also examining the question of communications with the parents and guardians of these passengers. As the Senator has done, I too compliment the teachers who accompanied the 80 teenagers on their visit to mainland Europe.</P>
      <P>A bomb threat warning on an aircraft is obviously a traumatic occurrence for the passengers and crew. It is totally irresponsible for any person to threaten the safety of any aircraft or airport installation. I encourage the police authorities to vigorously pursue any such threats made by any person against the safety or security of an aircraft in flight or any airport installation.</P>
      <P>I hope this event will not deter the teenagers from St. Leo&rsquo;s secondary school from flying on aircraft in the future. I have been informed that during the incident Ryanair provided refreshments for the passengers on the flight after they had been interviewed by police at Prestwick Airport. I understand that Ryanair also provided telephone facilities for passengers, arranged for hotel accommodation for some passengers as well as making alternative surface transport arrangements for passengers who missed connections at Dublin Airport because of the emergency.</P>
      <P>Given that the bomb threat warning was detected by the crew while the aircraft was flying within UK airspace, it was a matter for the UK authorities to implement their contingency planning arrangements to address the emergency on the Ryanair aircraft. It is vital that all responding agencies discharge their responsibilities and that the threat, real or otherwise, is addressed effectively and efficiently in accordance with approved procedures. I understand the UK authorities are reviewing the handling arrangements for this emergency.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen, has written to Mr. Alistair Darling, MP, UK Secretary of State for Transport, concerning the handling of the incident, the fact that the Ryanair aircraft was required to fly to Prestwick Airport when there were other airports in close proximity and that passengers and crew were not allowed to disembark from the aircraft for over two hours upon arriving at Prestwick Airport. We await the response.</P><Col N="756"/>
      <P>Senator Browne asked what we have learned. The Minister has asked the national civil aviation security committee to establish if there are any lessons to be learned in so far as emergency planning procedures for aviation in the State are concerned. The committee will meet shortly. The committee which is chaired by a senior official from the Department of Transport comprises representatives of Departments, Dublin Airport Authority, airlines, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Defence Forces, An Post, Customs and Excise, the Irish Aviation Authority and the Irish Airline Pilots Association. Needless to say we are anxious to hear from the UK authorities, Ryanair and the Irish Aviation Authority who will establish what lessons are to be learned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank the Minister of State for his comprehensive reply. Who is in charge of an aircraft? Is the pilot flying the aircraft ultimately responsible? Can he or she be overruled by a security force in a different state? I understand that the training a pilot receives indicates that he or she has the authority to evacuate the aircraft. That did not happen in this case. While I do not expect an answer today, perhaps the Minister of State could bring the matter to the attention of his counterparts. I thank Ms Blake for her help in wording this Adjournment matter because it was quite complicated. I ask the Minister of State to keep me and the local TD, Deputy Nolan, briefed on the outcome of any meetings on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>The reason for the investigation is clear in that the aircraft was flying in UK airspace. While I am not an expert I always understood the pilot had authority but immediately the aircraft landed it appears the UK authorities took responsibility. There are lessons to be learned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Mr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Parlon, for taking time out of his busy schedule to take this Adjournment debate.</P>
      <P>This issue has been ongoing for some time in west Cork. At the beginning of 2002, members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, with the support of the Garda Representative Association, threatened to walk out of the Garda station in Dunmanway which has been in a state of disrepair for many years. The garda&iacute; were at crisis point. At this juncture the Office of Public Works acquired a <Col N="757"/>house opposite the Garda station into which the garda&iacute; moved. Since then the Garda station in Dunmanway has been operating out of that house. That house is primarily a family residence and is not conducive to proper working conditions for members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. It is not wheelchair accessible and does not have interrogation rooms or a cell. It is wholly inappropriate in terms of policing. In an era when the country is awash with money it is not good enough that a Garda station should operate from a private house.</P>
      <P>Discussions have been ongoing for some time with a local couple who own a tract of land to the rear of the Garda station. I met the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, last year with members of the community on that issue. The people concerned have made every effort to find a resolution. It has cost them an amount of money in the process of trying to satisfy legal requirements to enable the Office of Public Works to take over that plot of ground. It has been some months since there has been any tangible contact from the Department on this matter. There is no end in sight for that retired couple who have expended quite an amount of money and have gone to great trouble to make it easy for the State to take over the plot but nothing has happened.</P>
      <P>The sub-district of Dunmanway has a population of more than 7,500 people. It is urgent that this refurbishment takes place. It has been announced on previous occasions by a candidate in the general election of 2002 who is now a Deputy and who announced it again last year. However, no work is being done. There is no physical proof to the people of Dunmanway that this long awaited and much promised refurbishment work will take place.</P>
      <P>In September 2005, at a protest meeting which I and a number of people in the community organised, members of the Garda Representative Association met in Dunmanway <i>en masse</i> and protested at the lack of a proper Garda station in the area. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, travelled to Bantry on the same day to open a state-of-the-art Garda station which the people there deserve. However, on that occasion when questioned by those present, the Minister said that somebody fell asleep at the wheel and that he would ensure there was a swift response. Eight months have elapsed since we discovered that somebody was asleep at the wheel and still nothing has happened. We are approaching the next general election and there is no proof that anything will happen. There are local rumours to the effect that the Office of Public Works will not pursue the proposal to refurbish Dunmanway Garda station and that it may seek a greenfield site. This was denied when I contacted the Department in recent months but the rumour persists. I plead <Col N="758"/>with the Minister of State to offer the House concrete evidence that this long awaited project will finally be given the green light. Dunmanway needs results because it is not good enough that the town does not have a decent Garda station in 2006, given that public disorder and anti-social behaviour are dominating newspaper headlines. The closure in recent years of Garda stations in other villages such as Drinagh and Ballygurteen places even greater responsibility on members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in Dunmanway who must already operate under highly unsatisfactory conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senator for raising this issue and affording me an opportunity to answer and explain the position regarding Dunmanway Garda station, County Cork. As the Senator may be aware, the objective is to extend and refurbish the existing Garda station. An important aspect of the refurbishment work will involve improved access to the rear of the station. For this to take place, a privately-owned plot of land adjoining the Garda station needs to be acquired. The Commissioners of Public Works have endeavoured to purchase this plot of land for some time. Negotiations to acquire the land have been complicated and delayed by a number of factors, including the legal issue of the vendor&rsquo;s title, which he had to perfect.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I am pleased to note that all the delaying factors have been resolved and negotiations to acquire the freehold interest in the plot of land have resumed. These negotiations have entailed officials from the Office of Public Works engaging in regular contact with the vendor in recent months, through direct telephone communication and site visits. The OPW&rsquo;s valuer is in advanced discussions with the vendor with a view to agreeing a market price for the area required.</P>
      <P>The House will appreciate that I am not in a position to give a precise date as to when the refurbishment works will commence. However, the Commissioners of Public Works are treating this case as a priority matter and are ready to proceed immediately on the refurbishment works to Dunmanway Garda station as soon as agreement to an acceptable price for the plot of land is secured. I assure the Senator that I will continue to endeavour to bring this matter to a satisfactory and successful outcome as soon as is possible.</P>

	<P>While I appreciate the Minister of State&rsquo;s reply, it is not different from other replies we have received in the House and does not provide a timeframe. With a general election due in less than 12 months, this issue will be used as a political pawn. It is above such games; I plead with the Minister of State to ensure the refur<Col N="759"/>bishment commences and give the House a date as soon as possible to ensure a successful resolution of the matter.</P>

	<P>The only outstanding issue is the need to agree a final price and have the lands signed over. The Office of Public Works is ready <Col N="760"/>to proceed with the building works as a priority with a timeframe for completion of four to six months. I will take a personal interest in the matter, which I appreciate was raised with me some time ago, and revert to the Senator.</P>
