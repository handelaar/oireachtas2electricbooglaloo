      <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>As this is the last sitting day of this session, I take the opportunity to wish Members a happy Christmas.  I thank them all for their co-operation, especially the Leas-Chathaoirleach, Acting Chairmen, Leader and party leaders.  I also thank Deirdre Lane and Jody Blake and other members of staff for their assistance.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid=""><NameTxt>Senators</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I also thank the parliamentary reporters and press members for their work, and the ushers for the help they provide.  I hope I have included everyone; any omission is unintentional.  I wish everyone a happy and holy Christmas.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>And bright prospects for the new year.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>I too wish to extend my good wishes to Members, particularly the Cathaoirleach, who is our guide and mentor.  I also thank the Leas-Chathaoirleach and Acting Chairmen, although they do not take the seat with the same aplomb as the Cathaoirleach.  I thank Deirdre, Jody and the other staff, who do sterling work.  I give my best wishes also to the party leaders, Senators Brian Hayes, Ryan and O&rsquo;Toole.  I also thank the Acting Leader, Senator Dardis, and the Whips, Senators Moylan and Glynn and those of the other parties for their co-operation.</P>
        <P>I thank the Ministers and their private secretaries, with whom we communicate on a daily basis.  We are fortunate that a good relationship exists between my office and those of the various Ministers.  I also thank the spokespersons who speak on Bills from the different Departments.  They always respond well in making their contribution on the relevant legislation.</P>
        <P>Where would we be without Jimmy Walsh of <i>The Irish Times</i>?  He is faithful and true.  I thank RTE when it reports on our proceedings at what<Col N="1522"/>ever time.  It gives us a lick from time to time.  I thank the Captain of the Guard and the ushers who observe great decorum and keep order in the House.  I wish everyone a happy and peaceful Christmas but most of all time with their families.  I am looking forward to the Christmas.  It is a time to recollect, be free from duties and be in the bosom of one&rsquo;s family.  We will see how the next year will go.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>On behalf of my colleagues on this side of the House, I wish the Cathaoirleach and his staff a very happy and holy Christmas.  A select group had the privilege of being at the Cathaoirleach&rsquo;s last dinner this week.  At the dinner I was thinking what was the best scene in the liturgical calendar which suited the feast.  Would it be the Last Supper, considering that the Cathaoirleach is not standing for office again?  In the end I thought the Nativity is the best biblical scene, as we were all coming to give him homage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Was gold, frankincense and myrrh brought?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>No, Senator Moylan brought a pear for everyone.</P>
        <P>I thank the Clerk of the Seanad, the Assistant Clerk and the Seanad Office for ensuring the House is run efficiently and smoothly.  I wish a happy and holy Christmas to all Members, particularly to the Leader, other leaders and spokespersons.  I thank the parliamentary reporters who do a fantastic job in ensuring our mutterings are on the Internet as soon as possible.  I thank the ushers.  I particularly thank <i>The Irish Times</i> correspondent, Mr. Jimmy Walsh.  I thank Mr. Eamonn McCormack from the Leader&rsquo;s office who does a terrific job in ensuring the smooth and efficient workings of the House.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>What will happen next year, none of us know.  One certain matter, however, is that this is the Cathaoirleach&rsquo;s last Christmas.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not know about that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>He might be called back.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I meant in the Chair.  My apologies for putting the Cathaoirleach into an early grave.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>It might be my last Christmas in the Chair but I hope to have many more of them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>Famous last words.  I wish every Member a happy Christmas and thank them for their co-operation this session.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>My colleague, Senator O&rsquo;Toole, who is not our leader but is <i>primus inter pares</i> <Col N="1523"/>asked me to fulfil this function on behalf of the Independent Group as he is detained at a funeral in the west.  I am very happy to do so.  I am sad to realise that the Cathaoirleach will not be in the Chair again.  He has graced it in a very unique fashion.  Several days ago I met a former holder of that office, Tras Honan, who was known for her style, upon which she remarked herself sometimes.  The Cathaoirleach has his own unique style which every Member accepts.</P>
        <P>I pass on the compliments of our group to Deirdre, Jody and the rest of the officials in the Seanad Office.  I pass on our compliments to the Leader, who unquestionably has her own unique style.  I hope it continues to grace political life for many years to come.  I thank Eamonn McCormack.  I thank the parliamentary reporters who do an extraordinarily good job.  I sometimes read not just &ldquo;the blacks&rdquo;, as they are termed, but the printed record and they do a very good job in tidying up Members&rsquo; grammar, including my own, which saves us from some embarrassment.</P>
        <P>With the Captain of the Guard and the ushers, we are exceptionally lucky.  Every visitor or delegation with which I am involved comments upon their courtesy and graciousness.  Over the year, I have had numerous occasions to experience that.  I am grateful for it.  If I have left anyone out, it is simply down to age and indeterminacy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>One could call it a senior moment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I have many senior moments.  I feel we are a happy but sometimes discordant family.  I take great pleasure in wishing my fellow members of this community a very happy Christmas and prosperous new year.  I hope we will all be back here healthy, vigorous, active and combative in the new year.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>I join with others in wishing<?oasys _jy ?>the Cathaoirleach, the Leas-Chathaoirleach, Members and those associated with the House a happy and peaceful Christmas and a good new year.  I thank the Cathaoirleach for his patience and humour in conducting proceedings.  I wish him well in everything he decides to do in the future.  I thank the Leas-Chathaoirleach and the Acting Chairmen for the manner in which they have chaired.  I acknowledge the work and co-operation of the Senators Brian Hayes, O&rsquo;Toole and Ryan.  I pay tribute to the Leader for her work.  In my experience she is one of the hardest working Leaders the House has had.  One must also acknowledge that Eamonn McCormack keeps the whole show on the road.  It is not appropriate to name officials but in this particular case the Cathaoirleach will allow an exception.  He does a remarkable job and is always patient and good-humoured.</P>
        <P>I thank the Superintendent, the Captain of the Guard and their staff for the courtesy they show <Col N="1524"/>us at all times.  I acknowledge the work Jimmy Walsh does in reporting the proceedings of the House in <i>The Irish Times</i>.  Whatever we might say about things that we think should be in or left out, one thing we cannot say is that he is inaccurate.  That is a tribute to a journalist.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid=""><NameTxt>Senators</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>He is always accurate in what he reports.</P>
        <P>It is when one is in Opposition that one finds out how hard the Clerk, the Assistant Clerk and the Seanad Office have to work in the preparation of proceedings, for example, amendments to Bills.  Some of us, including myself, are not always the best in bringing the amendments to them early in the evening.  It is extraordinary that they can get the amendments out and mistakes are not made.  Given the extra onus on them, with the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission, the whole question of resources and staffing needs to be examined.</P>
        <P>Finally, I will mention the Editor of Debates and those who report what we say so accurately.  As Senator Norris said, they improve the grammar and the syntax.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>And the Irish.</P>
      </Speaker>
     <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">We will recall when we had to wait for several weeks for the report to come from the Editor of Debates. Now we have them almost instantly. That is a great step forward. I wish everyone a merry Christmas.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I have received notice from Senator Henry that she proposes to raise the following matter on the Adjournment:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Foreign Affairs to restore Irish Aid funding to the maternity services in Bethlehem immediately.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Bradford of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Health and Children to give her views on the decision by BUPA to withdraw from the Irish health insurance market.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

    <Title>Order of Business. </Title>
      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>The Order of Business is Nos. 1 to 5, inclusive.  No. 1, Social Welfare Bill 2006 &mdash; Committee and Remaining Stages, to be taken on the conclusion of the Order of Business and to conclude no later than 12.15 p.m.  No. 2, motion for earlier signature of the Social Welfare Bill 2006, will be taken immediately without debate on the conclusion of No. 1.

No. 4, motion for earlier signature of the Appropriation Bill 2006, will be taken immediately without debate on the conclusion of No. 3 and No. 5, Investment Funds, Companies and Miscellaneous Provisions Bill 2006, Report and Final Stages, will be taken at 12.30 p.m. and conclude no later than 1 p.m.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>Yesterday&rsquo;s decision by BUPA effectively to pull out of Ireland represents a black day, not least for the staff in Fermoy, County Cork, but also for the approximately 470,000 people who invested in BUPA and who depended on the company for their health insurance.  I do not underestimate the difficulties for the Government, the Minister for Health and Children and for the country at large in terms of resolving the issue of risk equalisation.  However, I hope we can resolve it ourselves before it is resolved by the European Commission.  If we are serious about competitiveness and introducing the best possible range of products in the health insurance market for all consumers, we must ultimately deal with the issue of risk equalisation.  It remains to be seen whether that means a break up of the VHI.  On the day BUPA made its decision, we heard that the Competition Authority will soon submit a report on this matter to the Minister for Health and Children, but it is a bit late in the day.  We have known for some time that this issue was going to come to a head.  It was established in the High Court that this would happen.  BUPA is on record as stating this matter would have to be addressed because it could not cover the liability.  I ask the Leader to arrange for statements for an hour at the end of our proceedings today, although I know my colleague Senator Bradford has tabled an Adjournment motion on the issue.  The House needs to debate this matter, which is of great concern.  </P>
        <P>For the past ten years, I have known Dr.<?oasys _jy ?>Zappone and Ann Louise Gilligan in my community.  They are exceptional people.  In the past year they have taken an exceptional case before the High Court and I note the result.  The judge said that legislation has never been introduced to bring about equality for cohabiting couples, but that is not the case.  Legislation has been introduced but did not go through this House because the Government has not brought forward its own proposals on rights for cohabiting couples.  For the past two years, this issue has been raised by Senators Terry, Norris and others.  We should agree to resolve this issue once and for all in the next session.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Ms White</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>We should ensure that cohabiting couples of whatever sexuality have rights in Irish law.  Dr. Zappone and Dr. Gilligan deserve congratulations for having had the cour<Col N="1526"/>age to take this case.  I hope the case will ensure the State introduces some equality in the law for cohabiting couples.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree strongly with everything Senator Brian Hayes has said.  The situation concerning BUPA is serious, but I am not surprised the Competition Authority came in late in the day.  Did it not miss one of its own deadlines?  I sincerely hope the Government will scrutinise the recommendations carefully.  They were reluctant to come on the radio today to defend the situation that is mooted, whereby the VHI could be split up into four segments.  My colleague, Professor Se&aacute;n Barrett of Trinity College, who is a former candidate for the Dublin University Seanad panel, was extremely good on RTE today, although it galls me to say so.  He said the splitting up of the VHI would be like creating four Aer Lingus companies.  It is absolutely daft.  Professor Barrett suggested that the problem might have been solved if BUPA had a dedicated telephone line which referred 25% of older patients to the VHI.  It is a simple and practical measure.  This matter should not be ideologically driven, however.  At the end of the day, patients&rsquo; care should be at the heart of the matter.  </P>
        <P Just="Left">I know and respect Katherine Zappone and Ann Louise Gilligan.  The community is extremely lucky to have two such dignified, gracious and well advised women to take this case.  It comes as something of a relief that I was contacted only once by a radio station yesterday, and its representative did not bother to ring back for my views.  I was not quoted in any of the newspapers, which to my mind shows the growing maturity of this society.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, it does.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not the only one who is interested in this matter and neither am I a single issue person.  This is a human rights matter which has been taken on by both Government and Opposition Senators.  It is important to note that yet again a rebuke was delivered to the Oireachtas by a judge, who in this case indicated that we should have dealt with this a long time ago.  We should do so.  I have proposed a Bill, which has been revised, and I will propose it in the next session.</P>
        <P>When I see that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Michael McDowell, is considering examining the issues, my feelings are like those of the Old Testament prophet who said, &ldquo;How long, O Lord, how long?&rdquo;  He is a slow learner.  For how long must these matters be examined?  The Minister should get up and do something.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask Senators not to chat amongst themselves while a Member is making a contribution because others wish to hear what is being said.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1527"/>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank you, a Chathaoirligh.  You are very kind.  I have quite a carrying voice and I know what I am going to say.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Ms White</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator should cut to the point.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>If others are not interested that is just too bad.  Like the Government, they are probably suffering from what I can only describe as political attention deficit disorder.  I hope the Government will concentrate on this issue because action on it is overdue.  We now have an opportunity to deal with it.  Both women in the case were gracious in their comments on the judge, even though they must have been stung.  I have been there, too, and know what it is like to face this kind of reversal, but they were gracious in what they said about the judge and the court proceedings.  I have proposed such a Bill and we should press ahead with it. </P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Christmas has been adverted to and while Members of this House are in a lucky and privileged position, there are others in this city who are not.  They include the homeless who are lucky to have Sr. Stanislaus Kennedy.  One point struck me from listening to the radio news programmes, which concerned a ship that has been impounded in Dublin port.  This is the second ship belonging to Norfolk Lines that has been found to pay less than &euro;1 per hour to its employees, while others have not been paid at all.  More than $200,000 is owed to the crew.  This is a form of indentured slavery and must end.  It is not appropriate to treat seamen in this way.  We have seen the Irish Ferries situation and there have been difficulties with other shipping lines also.  This matter should be resolved quickly because it is wrong to have people stranded aboard a ship in Dublin port with no income.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>Like other speakers, I regret BUPA&rsquo;s decision to pull out of the Irish market, which was based on a court judgment.  It is difficult to see how one can reconcile unfettered competition with community rating and risk equalisation.  I do not know how those two matters fit in with one another.  One has enormous sympathy for the 475,000 clients of BUPA and particularly for the staff who will lose their jobs in Fermoy.  Hopefully, this matter can be dealt with effectively by the proposals to be brought forward in the new year and that everybody can be looked after, as they should be by a national insurance scheme.  The VHI has served us well in the past.  It is a curious conjunction that we had the report of the Competition Authority at the same time, or shortly after, this decision.  Hopefully, we will be able to make progress on these matters. </P>
      
        <P>I note the 50th anniversary of the signing of the Treaty of Rome falls on 25 March 2007.  It is an important event and one the House should mark.  The Cathaoirleach might bring this matter to the attention of the Committee on Procedure and <Col N="1528"/>Privileges.  As the Cathaoirleach is aware, the House has a good record on debating European matters and in bringing Commissioners here.  The EU Ambassador to the United States, Mr. John Bruton, recently appeared here and we all benefitted from that experience.  Something special needs to be done.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid=""><NameTxt>Senators</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>We will discuss it at the next meeting of the committee.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Cathaoirleach, but I wanted to make the point that something special needs to be done.</P>
        <P>The recent court case was about recognising a Canadian marriage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>This State recognises Canadian marriages.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>The kernel issue was tax.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Ms White</NameTxt>
	<P>It was a tax issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnDardis"><NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
	<P>That is at the heart of such matters, and can be dealt with as effectively by the proposal on civil partnership, along the lines of the one Senator Norris made, as full marriage.  I agree that the Houses and the Minister must respond, and those matters will be brought to his attention.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>I, too, want to raise yesterday&rsquo;s court verdict.  It is more important than ever that we speedily deal with the legislation.  We are fortunate that Senator Norris&rsquo;s Bill is before the House as well as Fine Gael&rsquo;s publication on civil partnerships.  We have had debates in this House on it.  We must proceed speedily.  As Senator Brian Hayes said, these two women were brave to take this case.  We must respect them and the many couples in this country who wish to have their partnerships recognised, whether gay, lesbian or cohabiting heterosexual couples.  I urge the leader to speak to the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, who wants to bring this legislation forward.  Let us do it before the general election.  We cannot afford to delay any further.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>BUPA&rsquo;s decision to leave the Irish market is a serious matter.  As Senator Dardis pointed out, it concerns 475,000 people who will be without health insurance and 300 workers who face a bleak Christmas.  All the indications were there following the judicial decision.  I am not an apologist for BUPA, but it has regularly and constantly said in the media and in paid advertisements that if this judgement went against it, it would pull out.  Yet I regularly read the opposite opinion by so-called experts that it would not leave because there was still such a potential business, and that it would not walk away from millions of euro.  I hope the Govern<Col N="1529"/>ment and the Leader will respond to this and convey the concern that has been expressed in this House.  I want to add my voice to that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I note the concern about BUPA.  It will be raised on the Adjournment and I would not like any Senator to steal that Senator&rsquo;s thunder.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>I was not aware of that.  I thank the Cathaoirleach and I am glad because this matter will exercise the minds of many people over the next couple of weeks.  I hope the Government will speedily address this issue.  I agree with the sentiments expressed about the Competition Authority&rsquo;s inadequacy on this.</P>
        <P>I hope the Leader will encourage Irish people to take up the proposal of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin, that we buy Irish this Christmas.  During the 1990s, when the economy was not as strong as it is now, the main buzz phrase was &ldquo;import substitution&rdquo;.  It has fallen by the wayside.  I am glad the Minister has reaffirmed the view that by buying Irish we protect Irish jobs.  Due to our Treaty of Rome obligations we cannot show preference at official level.  If Mr. Jimmy Walsh or others are listening, I urge them and other Members of this House to take the opportunity in the week leading up to Christmas to pause for a moment if they enter the major supermarkets that are dotting our high streets across the country and decide whether the Irish product is the better product to buy rather than automatically buying something because it happens to be there.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Ms White</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>People should examine the source of a product, and if it is Irish and competitive, buy it, because this protects Irish jobs.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>Yesterday there was news of the highest inflation rate we have had for some time.  It reached 4.4% in November, up from 3.9% in October.  Last month the Independent Senators put down a Private Members&rsquo; motion expressing concern about inflation but got no real response from the Minister.  It was just before the budget, and the budget increased inflation again.</P>
        <P>The decision to increase current expenditure by 11.5% without any proportionate demands for efficiencies in public services surprised me.  It is a major concern that our inflation is very high.  The other figure that emerged this morning is a 21% increase in the cost of three areas, energy, housing and water.  It is in the hands of the Government to address these three areas.  We have not put inflation high enough on the agenda and the Government should direct its attention to it in the next few weeks.</P>
        <P>We have recently heard about the danger of rural post offices being closed.  Yesterday it was decided to close 2,500 rural post offices in the <Col N="1530"/>UK.  The cause is that they are not being used by customers.  It is in our hands to do something about it.  I remember a complaint about a railway closing down in the south.  When a rally went to address the relevant Minister in Cork, the Minister asked how many had come by rail and how many had come by car.  Although they were there to protest the closure of a railway, practically nobody had come by rail.  We are in the same situation with the post office.  How many of us use the post office?  It is up to us.  If the post offices fail it will be because we, as customers, did not use them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Mr. Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Leader to invite the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs with responsibility for European affairs, Deputy Treacy, to the House in the new year to discuss a developing situation.  In the last year, when Russia increased gas prices and cut off the supply to the Ukraine, the rest of Europe suffered.  Poland and Russia are in dispute.  Poland is asking the European Union not to sign the energy agreement with Russia because of a meat labelling issue.  If that happens we could lose a significant meat market.  We consume 10% of the beef we produce and export 90%.  Russia is an important market for us and if this local disagreement between two neighbouring nations escalates we will suffer disproportionately.  We must avoid this.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>I would like to highlight the plight of many people, including farmers, in the midlands due to the serious flooding in the area of the River Shannon.  The ESB must be forced to reduce the water levels on Lough Derg and downriver from Athlone, Lanesborough and Longford because serious flooding is taking place in those areas.  Farmers in Longford, Westmeath and Roscommon are seriously affected by the situation.  Better management of this waterway must be implemented.</P>
        <P>The River Shannon must be regularly dredged because of the serious build-up of silt in the river at this time of year.  The flooding is causing serious problems for farmers.  Many of them have lost their fodder crops and have had to move their cattle from slatted houses, which are two feet under water in some parts of the midlands.  Could the Leader indicate whether the Government has plans to introduce a flood relief fund to help those hard-pressed people in the midlands?  There is a serious situation for the farmers and for local county roads in the midlands due to the flooding.  This is a catastrophe for many people in the midlands.  In the days of former Ministers for Agriculture, Austin Deasy and Mark Clinton, when such catastrophes happened relief was given to people.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>There have been many flood relief funds since then.</P>

	<P>I would not have much confidence.  They might suggest people get out their canoes.  Yesterday the Leader told me to get out my clippers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JamesBannon"><NameTxt>Mr. Bannon</NameTxt>
	<P>Hard-pressed people in the midlands need support.  The Government must take immediate action and provide flood relief.  I raised the issue with the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, during the debate on the Local Government (Business Improvement Districts) Bill.  Public meetings will be held over the Christmas period.  I have alerted the Government to the measures it needs to take and I hope it takes them. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly"><NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>Several years ago, I introduced a Private Members&rsquo; Bill to establish a Shannon river council, the purpose of which would be to bring together the various organisations with responsibility in this complex area.  The Commissioners of Public Works, fisheries, Bord na M&oacute;na and a range of environmental bodies have an interest in this issue.  An overview needs to be taken quickly to enable action to be taken to alleviate flooding, in so far as that is possible, and ensure flooding does not occur elsewhere.  Clonlara in County Clare has been subject to severe flooding and many houses in the villages were flooded.  Residents claim the reason was that the ESB allowed additional water through the gates of Ardnacrusha to relieve a problem in Lough Derg.  The problem of flooding will not be easily resolved.  The legislation I introduced needs to be progressed.</P>
        <P>The late Se&aacute;n Doherty made many efforts to bring together the various interests involved.  He held a series of meetings along the River Shannon catchment area which gave him a good insight into the type of measures required.  The various bodies came together yesterday &mdash; a little late in the day &mdash; to try to respond to flooding.  A council of representatives of the various interests should be established to take urgent action, carry out research and undertake an assessment of what measures are necessary to alleviate the problem of flooding which will regularly recur unless action is taken.</P>
        <P>I concur with Senator Hanafin on the problems encountered in exporting beef, particularly to the Russian market.  This trade is worth &euro;100 million per annum to farmers.  It is critical that a resolution to the problem is found as quickly as possible.</P>

	<P>A letter in today&rsquo;s edition of <i>The Irish Times </i>draws attention to the fact that judgment in a case involving five Bulgarian nurses and a Palestinian doctor accused of having infected children with HIV in Libya is to be given next Tuesday.  I and many other Senators have taken up this case.  I would be grateful if the Leader would ask the Minister for Foreign <Col N="1532"/>Affairs to ensure it is closely monitored.  It is an international case which has caused terrible concern that nurses working abroad appear to have been very badly treated.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome this morning&rsquo;s announcement by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, that the retirement gratuity and expenses available to elected councillors will be improved.  I will continue to pursue proposals to introduce a pension for councillors because they are entitled to one.  I am not prepared to walk away from this issue, even if it is unpopular with members of the public and the press which has attacked it.  I am not afraid of the press because the proposal is right.</P>
        <P>I concur with Senators&rsquo; comments on the despicable decision by BUPA to pull out of Ireland, leaving 475,000 policyholders in the lurch and resulting in the loss of 300 jobs in Fermoy.  The VHI should step in and take over&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>As I indicated, the matter will be raised on the Adjournment. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept that.  The VHI should devise a scheme to enable people to contribute funds for their retirement.  The proposal by the Minister for Health and Children to recoup a percentage of a nursing home resident&rsquo;s moneys following his or her death may be unconstitutional.  Article 43.1.2&deg; of the Constitution states: &ldquo;The State accordingly guarantees to pass no law attempting to abolish the right of private ownership or the general right to transfer, bequeath and inherit property&rdquo;.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>According to the Government, the proposals have been constitutionally proofed.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I recommend that the Government hold a referendum on its proposal on the same day as a referendum is held on children&rsquo;s rights.  The matter should be put to the people to allow them to decide whether it is appropriate to take a percentage of a person&rsquo;s property to pay the cost of his or her stay in a retirement home.  </P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Senator Daly&rsquo;s point on addressing the problem of flooding in the River Shannon basin.  I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on the Shannon river council report early in the new year.  There are major difficulties and many bodies involved in the water levels on the River Shannon.  It is argued that a certain water level is needed for boating purposes.  The level must be changed from October until March. <Col N="1533"/> Water levels downstream must be lowered to enable water to flow into the lakes.  It would not be useful to open Ardnacrusha as it would flood Limerick.</P>
        <P>Many of my neighbours have been flooded out of their homes.  The main street of Shannon Harbour, a lovely village close to my home town of Banagher, is under at least eight inches of water and many houses are close to being flooded.  This is a serious matter and a debate could help ensure that those with responsibility for water levels on the River Shannon who live in areas which are not affected by flooding will take action to address flooding.</P>
        <P>I concur with Senators Daly and Hanafin on the serious problem with beef exports to Russia.  If beef prices fall in the coming months it will have a detrimental effect on farmers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for allowing me to raise on the Adjournment BUPA&rsquo;s decision to pull out of Ireland.  Senator Brian Hayes proposed that statements on the issue be allowed on the conclusion of the Order of Business.  If the Leader acceded to the request, I would be prepared to withdraw the matter I raised on the Adjournment.  BUPA&rsquo;s announcement yesterday that it will withdraw from the Irish market is of profound importance in terms of health insurance, competition and public policy.</P>
        <P>Unfortunately, no one should have been surprised by the decision because it has been flagged for almost five years.  As recently as a fortnight ago, when the High Court adjudicated on this matter, the judge who ruled that the Government had the legal power to introduce risk equalisation, indicated that the introduction of risk equalisation would render BUPA financially non-viable.  This reflects statements made by spokespersons from BUPA during appearances before the Joint Committee on Health and Children and other meetings.  I am disappointed with the company&rsquo;s decision and the failure of the Minister to intervene in recent months.  It would be helpful to have statements today on this major public policy issue affecting almost 500,000 policy holders.  It is of fundamental importance and goes to the core of the issue of competition.  The House must demonstrate its relevance by debating it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>Like previous Senators, I deeply regret the decision of BUPA to pull out of the Irish market and the loss of jobs involved.  I also regret the removal of this element of competition.  At the same time, I must praise the Minister for Health and Children for upholding the principle of community rating in public policy guidelines.  I am not a believer in unbridled competition.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>It is sometimes presented in this House as if it is an unqualified good.  I do not wish <Col N="1534"/>to see the break-up of VHI, which has served the Irish well for a long time, any more than I wish to see the break-up of the ESB.  Somewhat perversely, competition has led to increased electricity prices rather than reductions.</P>
        <P>If one has any doubts on the unlimited virtues of competition, there was news this morning about how goods bought on the streets are manufactured by people working 96-hour weeks at 7 cents an hour.  We should have a more reasoned and humane approach to the competition issue, and we should also realise that public service and policy properly carried out are just as important and valuable as competition.</P>
      </Speaker>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Senator Quinn&rsquo;s sentiments on inflation.  We discussed the matter some weeks ago and were given an indication by the Government that the figures would be reduced in the future.  It was the usual Government spin on the issue.  Senator Quinn and I were disappointed to see the figure increase again in the results announced yesterday.</P>
        <P>I agree with previous speakers who have raised the issue of flooding on the Shannon.  I live quite a distance from the Shannon but it is important to point out that a number of occurrences have affected developments in areas that would traditionally have been flood plains for rivers all over the country, not just on the Shannon.</P>
        <P>There also have been significant changes in agricultural practices, which have led to more water getting to rivers more quickly.  In particular, there has been much deforestation in different parts of the country, where big open drains are putting more water into rivers.  These issues are combining to ensure we have much more regular and severe flooding in towns and villages around the country.  It would be useful to have a discussion on the matter in January in order to consider ways to alleviate flooding in future.</P>
        <P>I was not here for the Order of Business yesterday but we should have a debate at the earliest opportunity in the new year on gun crime.  I raised the matter last Tuesday on the Order of Business.  We should emphasise the way society has changed, in particular the disregard many people seem to have for human life now, whether it is gangland crime or the other types of murder which have seen a large rate increase in recent years.</P>
        <P>I have raised my next issue a number of times already.  I received a pamphlet shaped like a lovely Christmas sock in the post yesterday from a leading financial institution.  It stated that I could have &ldquo;a lot more jingle this Christmas&rdquo; if I signed the document and applied for a &euro;9,000 personal loan in the run-up to Christmas.  The listed requirements were that I be over 18, in full-time employment and have a good credit history.</P>

        <P>I also wish to raise the matter of below-cost selling of spirits and other alcoholic drinks in the run-up to Christmas, which sends out the wrong message.

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;the selling of alcoholic drinks should be treated similarly.  It sends out the wrong message to people, who may go for a deal when they see it.  Much drinking is done within homes, and such selling practices send out the wrong message.  The matter should be considered by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>Two issues were raised which I would like to support.  Senator Hanafin and others raised the fears over the export of beef from this country as a result of the dispute between Poland and Russia.  I would welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Treacy, to the House to discuss what is becoming a serious issue.</P><Col N="1537"/>
        <P>Senator John Phelan raised the crime issue.  This could be bigger than crime, as we should look at society as a whole, particularly the structure of society and the family.  The discussion would have a great impact on how behaviour is exercised within society, and I would like a Minister to come before the House to have a long and broad consideration of this fundamental issue of how crime is affecting society.</P>
        <P>I have other issues to raise but I will not do so in full today.  Some Senators have raised the announcement of expenses but I will leave it to the Minister to make his announcement.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a half page on it in <i>The Irish Times</i> today.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Is that a conflict of interest?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Brian Hayes raised the matter of BUPA and risk equalisation.  It is interesting to note that other countries have health insurance markets which combine community rating with vigorous competition.  For example, the concepts would not be incompatible in Australia, where BUPA itself operates within such a system and receives money as a result of risk equalisation because it has an above average number of older members.  It can happen in other areas.</P>
        <P>Be that as it may, the issue has hit us strongly here and the Senator asked if we could debate the matter when the Order of Business finishes.  The other House is not sitting and I do not know how I can go galloping around the city trying to fetch Ministers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Go on.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>If the other House were sitting we could go over and indicate that we need an urgent debate.  I agree the matter is extremely urgent and I am glad the Cathaoirleach has taken it as an Adjournment issue.  Senator Bradford may have to deal with the potential unemployment in Fermoy.</P>
        <P>Senator Bradford also referred to the case of Dr. Zappone and Dr. Gilligan.  I know Dr. Gilligan well from when I worked in education.  They sought authorisation for their Canadian marriage.  Senator Norris&rsquo;s Bill deals with civil partnerships, which is a different matter.  The underlying matters are whether taxation and welfare rules which appertain to marriage would also apply to civil partnerships.  The two women involved in this case carried themselves well yesterday.</P>
        <P>Senator Norris raised the matters of BUPA and his civil partnership Bill.  I saw a statement on civil partnerships from the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in the <Col N="1538"/>newspaper today and he intends to move on it in the new year.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>He also spoke about the impounded ship and the sailors who have not been paid.</P>
        <P>Senator Dardis greatly regretted the BUPA matter and the situation of its employees in Fermoy.  He asked for a discussion on who we will invite to the House on 25 March to mark the 50th anniversary of the signing of the Treaty of Rome.</P>
        <P>Senator Terry referred to the court decision yesterday and asked to proceed quickly on civil partnership on foot of the Law Reform Commission proposals, Senator Norris&rsquo;s Bill and the general debate on the issue.  Senator Mooney raised the issue of BUPA.  He also wants us to buy Irish goods.</P>
        <P>Senator Quinn is concerned about inflation.  It is at 4.4% and is destined to rise in the new year but then to decrease and level off at 3.5%.</P>
        <P>The Senator also spoke about post offices.  We discussed post offices during the week but the Senator was not here.  Half of the post offices in the UK are closing.  Senator Quinn is correct to state people do not use them.  Yesterday, I stated that an interesting man suggested the Internet is killing post offices.  People do their business on the Internet.  If people used post offices they would have a better chance of remaining open.</P>
        <P>Senator Hanafin wants the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs with responsibility for European affairs to speak about the looming row between Poland and Russia.  Russia told Ireland if it broke with the rest of Europe it would continue to buy Irish beef.  That will not happen.  I heard Mr. Liam Aylward, MEP, dealing with the matter on the radio during the week.  It is extremely serious.</P>
        <P>I fully concur with Senator Bannon, who raised the matter of flooding.  One should be in Athlone tonight.  It is extremely serious.</P>

	<P>The Senator spoke about the need for flood relief funds.  The Government will not be found wanting if it becomes an issue.  It is not only down to ESB management.  A complex range of issues are involved.  The problem may be solved in Athlone and Lanesborough but then Limerick or somewhere else is flooded.  It must be <Col N="1539"/>solved everywhere.  Senator Daly made the point forcefully that it is a major and complex issue.  The management of the River Shannon waterway is enormously difficult.  For the moment we can only hope the rain stops.  The flooding is very extensive.  Athlone&rsquo;s large shopping centre, the Golden Island, is now flooded.</P>

        <P>Senator Henry raised the issue of the five Bulgarian nurses and the Palestinian doctor.  The case will be resolved this week.  I am glad Senator Henry has taken an interest in it.</P>
        <P>Senator Leyden raised the issue of local councillors.  What has been promised for councillors is not a secret as a statement on it takes up half a page in <i>The Irish Times</i> today.  There is nothing wrong with discussing it here because it is public knowledge.</P>

	<P>Senator Leyden also spoke about BUPA and made a point about property rights and the constitutionality of the proposal by the Minister for Health and Children.  To answer the question asked by Senator Coghlan, the property services regulatory authority Bill is on the C list and will be printed in 2007.</P>
        <P>Senator Moylan also raised the issue of flooding.  We share the River Shannon, as do other Senators.  He also raised the issue of beef exports to Russia.  If it fails we will lose a major lucrative market.</P>
        <P>Senator Bradford has left to take part in a radio programme.  I can imagine the low spirits and sadness in Fermoy, the town in which he lives.  If something could still be done to accommodate BUPA I hope it is done.  Senator Mansergh also spoke about BUPA.</P>
        <P>Senator John Paul Phelan raised an interesting matter regarding the offer of a loan made to him on the basis he was over 18 and in steady employment.  He does not like the idea of being offered &euro;9,000 on the basis that all he needs do to receive it is hold out his hand.  The day of payment will arrive.</P>
        <P>Senator White stated Fianna F&aacute;il Senators should campaign for better conditions for councillors.  All Senators do so.  Like Senator Leyden, she raised the pension arrangements she wants and stated she would not lose sight of that goal.  Who would not be a county councillor?  Reading today&rsquo;s newspaper would cause one&rsquo;s eyes to go out on sticks.</P>
        <P>Senator Paddy Burke called for a relief fund from the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government for flooding areas.  He also raised the issue of below-cost selling of alcohol.  I see large one page advertisements from Tesco and Dunnes Stores.  It is all right for people <Col N="1540"/>to have a drink in their homes, but the problem arises with drinking elsewhere and then going on the roads.  I intend to give a bottle of whiskey to people and I hope it will be well-appreciated but drunk within their houses.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;benefits for older people such as contributory and non-contributory pensions, carer&rsquo;s allowance and fuel allowance are extremely well deserved.  Will the Minister tell the House how much is spent on contributory and non-contributory State pensions?  I believe it is approximately &euro;2.4 billion or &euro;2.5 billion. I will focus on the relationship between this and what we forgo in tax in respect of occupational pensions.  I believe this figure is approximately &euro;3 billion.  As I stated previously, if we did away with tax relief on private pensions in the morning, we could double State benefits overnight.  I know this will not happen and I do not advocate it.  This is because, as the Minister previously told me, fewer people would take up private pensions because they would not receive tax relief, a point I accept.</P>
        <P>However, my point is that we forgo a considerable amount of tax, approximately &euro;3 billion, in respect of private pensions.  Does the Minister believe this is good value for money?  I do not believe it is.  The majority of pensioners are still dependent on the State pension.  Thankfully, this is now a reasonable amount.  Why are the majority of people still dependent on the State pension for their income when we spend &euro;3 billion on tax foregone in respect of private pensions?  There is something very wrong with this <Col N="1541"/>system and this should be addressed by carrying out a cost benefit analysis of the tax we forgo.  If this money were not given out in tax relief for private pensions, we could spend much of it on old people and benefit more people to a greater extent.</P>
        <P>We know that tax forgone on occupational pensions goes to the better-off who are well able to look after their pensions and probably have other financial interests, such as properties.  It is a question of value for money.  Could the Minister give the House his opinion on the value for money we receive from expenditure on State pensions <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> tax forgone on private pensions?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>We are dealing with section 3, which concerns pensions.  The contributory State pension cost us &euro;2.4 billion this year.  This is up 57% on the previous year&rsquo;s expenditure, which was &euro;1.5 billion, so the cost of paying the State pension is quite significant.  The cost of the non-contributory State pension next year will be &euro;810 million.  I do not have the figure for tax forgone, but it is in the order of &euro;3 billion.  The Senator&rsquo;s argument still holds nevertheless.</P>
        <P>Senator Terry knows I still hold the view that, although we have made some progress, pension reform is essential.  The concept of mandatory cover is one of the items I have raised and it will be examined in the Green Paper.  The Senator has expressed her concern to me many times about the security of people&rsquo;s funds and the professionalism with which they are invested is a critical factor.  As I told the Senator yesterday, I must rely on the Pensions Board to police this area.  The Green Paper will rehearse many arguments concerning the prudence principle and how to ensure people&rsquo;s money is properly invested and secure.</P>
        <P>In respect of value of money, to put it very simplistically, and I know the Senator is not advocating it, one could simply double the State pension and remove all need for private pensions.  Ideologically, I would have a problem with this in the sense that the State now takes on everything.  I do not think this is necessary.  I do not have the percentage, but the bulk of this tax relief is given at the higher rate or certainly to people on higher incomes so there is a pattern of middle and higher income people providing themselves with pensions.</P>
        <P>The Minister of Finance put a cap on the value of an individual&rsquo;s pension fund which may attract tax relief, which is the amount in the individual&rsquo;s pension fund on 7 December 2005 or &euro;5 million, whichever is the greater.  This will be adjusted annually from 2007.  If the fund is greater than the limit, tax at 42% will be charged on the excess when it is drawn down from the fund.  The maximum tax-free lump for pension drawdowns made on or after 7 December 2005 will be &euro;1.25 million.  The balance of a lump sum greater than this amount will be taxed at the marginal rate as income.  The restriction applies to a single lump <Col N="1542"/>sum or, where more than one lump sum is drawn down, the aggregate value of those lump sums.  The lump sum will also be adjusted from 2007 onwards.</P>
        <P>It is predicted that the labour force will remain static up to 2050 while the population of older people will treble.  It is against this background that we must go down the road of pension reform.  The Green Paper will be published at the end of March.   It will look closely at the contributory and non-contributory State pensions, how they interact with occupational pensions and how we can have a good first pillar and a second pillar, that being occupational pensions.  I do not think one would have as many people covered by pensions today if they had not been given tax relief.</P>
        <P>One suggestion from the Pensions Board was that we introduce an SSIA-type arrangement under which, instead of tax relief, the Government would give matching funds, as happens with SSIA accounts.  It has been argued that this would attract more people, especially those on the lower rate, to pensions because they would better understand the matching and it would be more transparent than tax breaks.  This option, which has considerable merit, will also be examined in the context of the Green Paper.</P>
        <P>I also think the mandatory system has some considerable merit and must be looked at.  When PRSI was introduced, it was mandatory, and still is, for those who work.  We are well used to the concept of ensuring people provide for themselves.  This week, I extended PRSI to people on farm assist, which again is mandatory.  People in this category are required to make this payment, but it gives them a very good pension.</P>
        <P>Value for money is subjective.  I am sure that if we did not have tax relief, whole swathes of the population would not have pensions cover, which would be bad for the country and the people themselves.  The question of whether the money could be better used is a judgment issue.  I would like to ensure tax relief is pushed down the line and taken up by people on lower incomes, but this is possibly where the SSIA-type reform will come in.  We must make all these decisions in the context of the March Green Paper.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister said he wished pensions were taken up by more people on low incomes.  I disagree with this because they get very bad value for money if they take out pensions.  They only receive tax relief at the lower rate as against individuals on the higher rate, so there is inequity in that.  If the Minister were prepared to give them tax relief at the higher rate and afford them equity, it could be considered worthwhile.</P>
        <P>How can somebody on a low income who is outside the tax net or who pays the lower rate of tax afford to pay into a pension scheme when he or she is probably struggling to save for a house, which is what he or she should be doing, or if he or she cannot afford to buy a house, is struggling <Col N="1543"/>to make ends meet?  It is difficult to understand why we are spending large amounts of money trying to encourage people on low incomes, who are either paying tax at the lower rater or are outside the tax net altogether, to pay into pension schemes.  The people to whom I refer &mdash; approximately 700,000 of them are outside the tax net &mdash; cannot afford to make such payments and are getting bad value for money.</P>
        <P>People on the lower rate of tax may pay into pension funds when they are younger.  Such money is, after all, only tax deferred, which causes some confusion because there are those who believe that it is tax relief and that they will never be obliged to pay it back.  They will have to do so when they are drawing it down.  They draw down this money at the top rate.  We must ensure, therefore, that people are aware of what they are doing.  Some individuals do not realise that they might obtain tax relief at the lower rate but that they will pay at the top rate when they are drawing it down.  I have received many complaints to the effect that we should inform people of their rights.  I have also received representations regarding the best way of doing things.</P>
        <P>I understand the Minister is heading down the mandatory route in respect of pension contributions.  I am, for some of the reasons I have already outlined, extremely concerned in this regard.  It would be wrong to take the mandatory route.  Would it be constitutional to impose a mandatory regime?  Many people have already been obliged to pay into pension schemes because it was company policy to do so.  These individuals were either forced to make contributions to such schemes or their employers did so on their behalf.  Either way, this proved a benefit for the employers.  People expected that making such contributions would deliver pensions for them but this did not prove to be the case.  How constitutional is it to oblige people to make mandatory contributions?</P>
        <P>I hope the Minister does not take the mandatory route.  If he does, however, people should retain the right to opt out.  This would at least give people the right to decide whether paying into pension schemes is the right way to spend their money.  In circumstances where employers make pension contributions on behalf of employees, the latter might prefer to opt for increases in salary instead.  An opt-out clause must be included in respect of mandatory contributions, unless guarantees are provided that people will receive pensions in the amount they would expect when they retire.  If there is no opt-out clause and no guarantee of outcome, we should not proceed down the mandatory route.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MargaretCox"><NameTxt>Ms Cox</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister referred earlier to an SSIA-type arrangement in respect of pensions.  We debated pensions approximately two and a half years ago and his suggestion in this regard was discussed at that point.  The Minister is cor<Col N="1544"/>rect that many people do not understand or recognise the benefits of money being invested on a tax-free basis and being drawn down the same way.  If we were to repackage it we would obtain better value for money because people would understand what is on offer to them from a pensions point of view.  The Minister&rsquo;s point in this regard is valid.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Cox for her remarks.  I accept Senator Terry&rsquo;s concerns in respect of this matter.  However, I am obliged to face the reality that there are 900,000 people who do not have occupational pensions.  Of these, 500,000 are women who work.  It behoves all of us to find some way to move these people to a position where they can look forward, when they retire, to income that will be additional to the State pension.</P>
        <P>Leaving aside whatever will be decided following the process relating to the Green Paper, the only option available to the people to whom I refer under the current system is to enrol in pension schemes.  To do this in a structured way and to ensure that people save money, the PRSAs are in place and offer possibilities.  I accept that there are risks involved.  However, it is better to be covered, have a pension, use the tax relief and work to ensure that one has as many protections in place as possible.</P>
        <P>On guarantees, I spoke with Lord Turner about the system that applies in the UK.  The new mandatory savings scheme there comes with a form of guarantee that people will get back a sum equivalent to what they invest plus a certain percentage.</P>
        <P>I cannot accept Senator Terry&rsquo;s general thesis that pensions are bad value.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Minister should say that to pensioners who have deferred or frozen benefits.  He should compare the income of a pensioner who has been retired for ten or 20 years with that of a civil servant.  If he does so, he will get an indication of whether it is good value for money.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>Many of the modern schemes, particularly the PRSAs, are finely tuned.  If people begin making contributions when they are sufficiently young and in light of tax relief and the purchasing of annuities, there is quite an amount of scope involved.  The alternative would be to go completely down the State-funded road and give everyone in the country a State pension.  That is a major philosophical debate in which we would be obliged to engage and I hope we may do so in the context of the Green Paper.</P>
        <P>In the meantime, I must deal with matters as they stand.  In that regard, I take the view that it is better to have pension provision and work towards ensuring that this is as secure as possible and that people obtain the best possible returns.  I accept that many people are making their own arrangements by investing in property, apart<Col N="1545"/>ments, etc., which is quite legitimate.  However, I must give a great deal of consideration to ensuring that the 900,000 working people to whom I refer have in place some pension provision when they reach 65 or 66 years of age.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>How many of those 900,000 people are outside the tax net?  What benefit will they receive in the context of tax relief?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>A number of them are outside the tax net and some are on the minimum wage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>Is it not then very bad value for money?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>If we moved to an SSIA-type of contribution system, it would take account of that argument.  Tax relief would not be needed because a matching amount would be paid.  That is why the Pensions Board made its relevant recommendation, which has a great deal going for it.  The Senator&rsquo;s point is interesting because if a person on &euro;30,000 per year cannot afford a pension, someone on &euro;15,000 will not be able to do so either.</P>

        <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 7 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="MargaretCox"><NameTxt>Ms Cox</NameTxt>
	<P>I was hoping to put forward an amendment in respect of parental and paternity leave.  We discussed this matter on Second Stage.  Now that maternity leave has been extended to 26 weeks &mdash; people can also take unpaid leave &mdash; and there is to be increased maternity benefit, the next step in nurturing families is to consider the issue of paid parental leave.  The Minister will be aware that either parent can take up to 13 weeks unpaid parental leave per child under the age of eight.  We must focus and set a target for whatever Government and Minister will be in place next year.  We must make a commitment to parents and children that there will be a benefit associated with parental leave.  As I suggested to the Minister on Second Stage, we could commence the process by providing four weeks paid leave for either parent.  In other words, one parent could take two weeks paid parental leave and his or her spouse or partner could take the other two.  People have a right to parental leave but my concern now is to ensure they are given an entitlement to benefit.</P>
      
        <P>On Second Stage, the Minister was asked whether he would consider allowing parents to share the maternity leave entitlement.  That would be a retrograde step and I am sure the Minister will not even contemplate it.  A situation cannot be allowed to arise where mothers would <Col N="1546"/>lose any of their entitlements.  I support giving fathers more opportunities to be involved in the parenting of their children, particularly those of a very young age.  That must be done as an add-on to maternity benefit, not by way of dividing that benefit between the mother and father.  To do that would be to regress to the dark ages.  While I understand the sentiments behind the idea as presented, I hope the Minister will never consider such a move.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>I reassure the Senator on the last point.  Employers are not obliged to grant male employees special paternity leave, paid or unpaid, following the birth of a child.  Unpaid parental leave is available.  Paternity leave for three days at 80% of wages subject to a minimum of &euro;207.80 and a maximum of &euro;280 per week would cost &euro;6 million rising to approximately &euro;10 million for five days&rsquo; paid leave.  That is based on the assumption that all fathers would take up the leave and that 95% would be paid at the higher rate.  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform would have to introduce the necessary legislation as it would come under his jurisdiction.  Parental leave entitles both parents to qualify to take up to 14 weeks&rsquo; unpaid leave in respect of children aged up to eight years.  Much of this legislation comes from the European Union and no doubt in future we will have to examine this area probably in the context of European directives.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MargaretCox"><NameTxt>Ms Cox</NameTxt>
	<P>It would be nice to have paid paternity leave.  A cost of &euro;6 million, rising to &euro;10 million if all the men were to take it up, seems small in the context of the overall social welfare budget in which &euro;1 of every &euro;3 spent by the Government goes to social welfare benefit.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The real issue is the parental leave per child.  The case for that is to allow the child be looked after in his or her home for the first year of his or her life.  We should add 13 or 14 weeks with an element of pay to the 26 paid weeks&rsquo; maternity leave.  The first couple of months after the six months of paid benefit are not too expensive, but as time goes on and the child grows, it is difficult to choose to stay at home with no support from the State.  The carer&rsquo;s leave and benefit provide a model for this benefit.</P>
        <P>We have made many changes to parental leave in recent years, driven by Europe, but with an economy such as ours we should lead the field in the area of parental leave and care for children.  This would make a statement about our country.  We should not have to wait for EU directives but say we accept that it is better for a child to stay at home and that we want to facilitate parents and families in doing that by phasing in a benefit for unpaid parental leave.  We cannot do everything at once but we need to set down a marker in this House that we have done so much and must look to future challenges.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1547"/>
      <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the extension of the maternity leave and hope it continues to widen.  I agree with Senator Cox that we must work towards enabling as soon as possible a mother to have one year at home with her child.</P>
        <P>The male member of Fine Gael who said yesterday that the mother and father should share the maternity leave spoke with the best will in the world.  He was saying that men want to take their responsibilities seriously but in hindsight, he would agree that the benefit should not be given at the mother&rsquo;s expense.  We should consider providing paternity leave or paid parental leave which would allow the mother or the father to avail of that time with the child.</P>
        <P>We need to move more quickly to extend the paid period for which a parent is at home with his or her child.  Only certain people can afford to take the unpaid maternity or parental leave.  Many parents who cannot afford to take unpaid maternity leave struggle in low-paid jobs.  We hope that everyone will be put on an even footing such that all can avail of this benefit and receive payment to spend valuable time with their young children.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>Two working groups of the social partners established under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness examined this issue in reviewing the Parental Leave Act 1998, the report of the working group on the review of the improvement of the maternity protection legislation of 2001 and considered a proposal from the ICTU, the Equality Authority and the National Women&rsquo;s Council of Ireland that legislation should provide for a five-day paid paternity leave on the birth of the child, to be paid on the same basis as maternity benefit.  The proposal was discussed and the following issues taken into account: the comparative situation in other EU member states, <i>force majeure</i> on paternity leave, reconciliation of work and family life, the balanced participation of men and women in work and family life, and the cost to employers.  Both working groups stated that they recognised the importance of the role of fathers at the time of and immediately after the birth of the child.  They could not, however, reach a consensus on the proposal and no recommendation was received for it to be progressed.  That happened a couple of years ago and the discussion has probably advanced since then.</P>
        <P>This section increases the length of time by four weeks and brings in a weekly earnings threshold of &euro;350 and a new payment rate of &euro;280 per week for maternity and adoptive benefits.  I have a list of paternity leave benefits in other EU countries.  In many countries some of the maternity leave is transferred to the father.  For example, in Denmark the last ten weeks of the mother&rsquo;s leave may be transferred.</P>

I extend a special word of thanks to my officials in the Department of Social and Family Affairs as the Social Welfare Bill goes for presidential signature.  An enormous effort was required to get from the stage many months ago when we first examined what we might do in the budget.  We had to get through the Estimates process, the budget and then incorporate the budget into the first of two Social Welfare Bills.  My sincere thanks to all my officials, some of whom are here, and to the many others who also worked on this Bill for so long.  Tribute has been paid to them from all sides of the House and in the D&aacute;il on many occasions.  This legislation is historic in that it introduces a number of reforms which will make a real difference to the lives of many people.  Senators can be proud of the part they played in getting us to this stage.</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister for the work he put into the Bill.  He is lucky he is in the job at a time when there is plenty of money to give back to people.  His predecessor made many cuts and the Minister, Deputy Brennan, has been playing catch-up since he came to the Department.  We <Col N="1549"/>have been through the bad times and we are all very lucky there is money around now to give to people to make their lives a little better.  However, many people remain who need further help.  I thank the Minister also for the time he has spent in the House.  I thank the staff involved in the Bill for all their work in preparing it.  I can only guess the enormous effort required to examine every area of the Bill.  I wish the Minister and his staff a very happy Christmas.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MargaretCox"><NameTxt>Ms Cox</NameTxt>
	<P>I pay tribute to the Minister, his Cabinet colleagues and the departmental officials who worked on the preparation of the Bill.  It is indicative of the successful nature of this legislation that we moved through all stages of the Bill with the complete agreement of the House.</P>
        <P>Although the social welfare package is worth in excess of &euro;1.4 billion, in many ways it did not receive the attention it deserved.  Far reaching reforms have been made in tackling child poverty.  The Minister referred to this issue yesterday.  A two-tier system of child benefit has been introduced without giving rise to an outcry about it being unequal.  That is a significant achievement in itself.</P>
        <P>I also welcome the reform in the area of women and pensions, in that women are now recognised in their own right.  Increases in the old age pension will make a great difference to people&rsquo;s lives.  Welcome change has also been made to maternity benefit and maternity leave.  It was like manna from heaven when the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, announced in the 2006 budget that maternity leave would be increased by four weeks paid this year and another four weeks paid next year.  These are the types of reforms and changes that make a difference to people&rsquo;s daily lives.</P>
        <P Just="Left">When the Minister, Deputy Brennan, was appointed Minister for Social and Family Affairs he said he wanted to make changes; he did not want just to throw money at people.  He has succeeded in his objective.  I congratulate him on that.  Social welfare expenditure accounts for &euro;1 in every &euro;3 of Government spending.  While the increased spending is welcome, of most importance is the reform of the system.  I recall the case of a young woman who could not receive a carer&rsquo;s allowance because she was in receipt of a widow&rsquo;s pension.  I welcome the historic change that will address that anomaly.</P>
        <P>I commend the Bill to the House.  I am delighted to have been involved in the debate on it.  On behalf of Members on the Government side of the House I wish the Minister and his officials a very happy Christmas.  I thank the officials for their courtesy and assistance at all times.</P>

        <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="TomParlonPD"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Parlon</NameTxt>
	<P>As today&rsquo;s debate on the 2006 Appropriation Bill will be brief, on the basis that the Seanad intends to have a more substantial debate on the topic of public expenditure early in the new year, I propose to confine my contribution to setting out the purpose of the Bill and its provisions.</P>
        <P>The main purpose of the Appropriation Bill is to give statutory effect to the departmental Estimates for supply services, both current and capital, including all the Supplementary Estimates which have been approved by the D&aacute;il since the last Appropriation Act.  The gross provision for public expenditure in 2006 inclusive of expenditure from the social insurance fund and the training fund is &euro;50.7 billion, comprising &euro;43.9 billion current and &euro;6.8 billion capital.  Some &euro;35 billion or 69% of the total provision for current spending was allocated to the priority areas of health, social welfare and education.</P>
        <P>In addition to providing for the 2006 Estimates, the Bill in section 2 provides for the carryover of unspent voted capital into 2007 amounting to just over &euro;159 million under the multi-annual capital envelopes.  In section 3, in line with what is now established practice, a technical provision is included to allow for deferment of the end-year deadline for the financial resolutions passed on budget night.  Again in line with established practice, the Seanad is also being asked to approve an early signature motion to facilitate a request to the President to sign the Bill earlier than she would normally do.</P>
        <P>Section 1 appropriates for the year 2006 the net sum of almost &euro;40.2 billion to the various services listed in Schedule 1.  The 2006 sum includes Supplementary Estimates of almost &euro;455.7 million on 12 Votes which have been approved by the D&aacute;il.  The figure of &euro;455.7 million includes a Supplementary Estimate of &euro;340 million in respect of reimbursement of certain long-stay charges.  I understand from the Department of Health and Children that expenditure of some &euro;26 million is now expected under this scheme in 2006, due to <Col N="1551"/>delays in getting the scheme up and running.  I understand these difficulties have been resolved and provision of &euro;360 million has been made for this purpose in the Health Service Executive Vote for 2007.</P>
        <P>The latest indications are that overall spending for 2006 will be within budget.  The projected outturn on net current spend for this year is &euro;33 billion which is broadly on target and it is &euro;6.63 billion for capital.  The actual end-year Exchequer outturn will be published in the end-year Exchequer statement on 3 January 2007</P>
        <P>This section of the Bill also seeks approval for the use of departmental receipts of more than &euro;4.02 billion as appropriations-in-aid for the services listed in Schedule 1.</P>
        <P>Under the multi-annual capital envelopes, up to 10% of voted Exchequer capital may be carried over to the following year.  There will be a capital carryover of some &euro;159 million from 2006 to 2007 or 2.4% of net voted capital for 2006.  The corresponding capital carryover from 2005 to 2006 was &euro;289 million or 5% of net voted capital.</P>
        <P>In accordance with the provisions of section 91 of the Finance Act 2004 which is the legal basis for capital carryover, section 2 of this Bill provides for this carryover by Vote.  The relevant Votes are listed in Schedule 2.</P>
        <P>The &euro;159 million of capital carryover cannot be spent in 2007 until the D&aacute;il approves an Order early in the new year specifying the capital subheads in each of the Votes concerned against which the money will be spent as a first charge.  The availability of the carryover facility means this money is not required to be surrendered at the end of the year and that it is available for spending on priority capital programmes within the Votes concerned in 2007.</P>
        <P>Article 17 of the Constitution requires that the financial resolutions of each year must be enacted into law by the end of that year.  However, the end of year deadline can be deferred if an Act to that effect is passed before the end of that year.  Section 3 of the Bill makes provision for this deferment to be invoked. The inclusion of this provision in the Appropriation Bill will maintain the usual statutory deadlines for passing budget measures into law.  Identical provisions have been included since the 1997 Appropriation Act.</P>
        <P>The Seanad is also being asked to approve an early signature motion.  This is sought each year to ensure the necessary legislative authority is in place for the final end of year issues from the Exchequer.</P>
        <P>The Bill before the House is necessary to appropriate the public moneys that have been granted by the D&aacute;il for spending on public services in 2006.  Under the provisions of the Central Fund (Permanent Provisions) Act 1965, the enactment of this Bill also provides for essential continuity by allowing for interim expenditure to be incurred on existing services in 2007 until such <Col N="1552"/>time as the 2007 Estimates are voted on by the D&aacute;il.</P>
        <P>I look forward to returning to the Seanad in the new year to outline the Government&rsquo;s approach to public expenditure policy and to discuss, in more substantive terms, the improvements in public services and what has been achieved for the substantial levels of public expenditure.  I commend the Appropriation Bill 2006 to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State and his officials to the House.  The Appropriation Bill is an annual event on the last Friday before the Christmas recess.  The House will have an opportunity in the new year to have a longer exchange of views on the items referred to by the Minister of State.  The sums of money involved are extraordinary.  I recall the remarks made by Senator O&rsquo;Toole during the debate on the budget when he said that when one refers to &euro;1 billion here and &euro;1 billion there, one is soon talking about serious money.  </P>
        <P>The sum of &euro;44 billion appropriated in current expenditure is serious money.  I heard a reference on the radio to the time when the late Mr. Haughey was Minister for Finance and to an initiative of his at the time.  Current expenditure at that time was in the hundreds of millions and we have come a long way in the intervening years.  I am interested in the Minister of State&rsquo;s remarks about the delay in setting up the long-stay charges reimbursement scheme.  I am pleased provision is included in this year&rsquo;s expenditure for that scheme and that there will be future funding to ensure those who were incorrectly charged are refunded.</P>
        <P>I will hold my fire until the House has a fuller discussion in the new year.  Senator Quinn on the Order of Business referred to inflation.  Both the Minister, Deputy Cowen and the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, have contributed to the discussions on inflation.  The further increase in the monthly rate of inflation announced yesterday is a worrying development.  The Opposition will have an opportunity in the new year to have a fuller and more frank discussion on the issue.  This side of the House will not cause any difficulty to the Minister of State when putting this Bill through the House today.  We will facilitate its early and swift passage through the House.</P>

        <P>The end of the year sees the public finances in excellent order, with economic growth of 7%, employment rising, economic activity buzzing and visible all around the country and the same prospects for next year.</P>
        <P>Reference was made to inflation.  I would point out that the average inflation for the year is likely <Col N="1553"/>to be under 4% as it also will be next year, and a close eye will be required to be kept on it.</P>
        <P>I will make the opposite point to that made on the Order of Business this morning.  By and large we get very good value for our public services.  People who have not worked in the public service simply do not appreciate the amount of work done which is way beyond the minimum by many public servants and civil servants, and in many cases for no extra reward.  The productivity is far higher than organisations like ISME and, dare I say it, sometimes the farming organisations are inclined to credit.  This Bill is a piece of budgetary housekeeping.  I support it and wish it a speedy passage.</P>

In accordance with Standing Order 103, it is deemed to have passed its First, Second and Third Stages in the Seanad and is placed on the Order Paper for Report Stage.  On the question &ldquo;That the Bill be received for final consideration&rdquo;, the Minister may explain the purpose of the amendments made by the D&aacute;il.

For Senators&rsquo; convenience, I have arranged for the printing and circulation of the amendments.  The Minister of State will deal separately with the subject matter of each related group of amendments.  I have also circulated the proposed grouping.  Senators may speak only once on each grouping.  I remind Senators that the only matters that may be discussed are the amendments made by the D&aacute;il.</P>

        <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be received for final consideration.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The first group of amendments involves amendments Nos. 1 and 46.  I am delighted to be returning to this House with the Investment Funds, Companies and Miscellaneous Provisions Bill, as amended in the D&aacute;il.  The amendments made have immeasurably improved the Bill and include, as I will explain when we come to discuss <Col N="1555"/>one of the later groups of amendments, some amendments tabled by me which were first suggested in this House by Senator Coghlan.</P>
        <P>Amendment No 1 amends the Long Title to the Bill and is directly consequential on amendment No. 46, which amends the Netting of Financial Contracts Act 1995.  The Netting of Financial Contracts Act 1995, as amended, provides certain &ldquo;super-protections&rdquo; in insolvency for certain netting and related credit support arrangements that come within its ambit.  At its simplest, it allows for amounts owed to a party &ldquo;A&rdquo; under one or more financial contracts entered into by that party with another party &ldquo;B&rdquo; to be netted off, or offset, against any amounts due by party &ldquo;A&rdquo; to the other party &ldquo;B&rdquo; under separate financial contracts.  The definition of who is a &ldquo;party&rdquo; for the purposes of the Netting of Financial Contracts Act is central in determining to whom the 1995 Act applies.</P>
        <P>Last year, Part 2 of the Investment Funds, Companies and Miscellaneous Provisions Act 2005 made provision for the formation and use of a new form of entity by the financial services industry called a common contractual fund that is not an undertaking for collective investment in transferable securities, for short called a non-UCITS CCF.  This followed provisions in the 2003 UCITS regulations which first introduced the UCITS CCF.  However, the nature of common contractual funds is such that each participant or investor shares in the assets and suffers liabilities up to a maximum of his, her or its investment in the proportion that the nominal value of their holdings of units bears to the aggregate nominal value of all of the units issued by the CCF.  This means that neither investment vehicles constituted as UCITS nor those constituted as non-UCITS CCF can benefit from the Netting of Financial Contracts Act 1995.</P>
        <P>Likewise, there is a legal doubt as to whether partnerships, whether constituted as an ordinary partnership or a limited partnership, including under the Investment Limited Partnership Act 1995, benefit from the Netting of Financial Contracts Act 1995.  The amendment of the Netting of Financial Contracts Act 1995, which is now included in the Bill as a result of amendment No. 46, will address the issue by expressly providing that the definition of &ldquo;party&rdquo; in the Netting of Financial Contracts Act includes, and is deemed always to have included, the particular arrangements that I have described.</P>
        <P>The second group of amendments covers amendments Nos. 2, 3 and 6 to 13, inclusive.  A number of significant amendments were made in the D&aacute;il to Part 2 of the Bill.  These involve not only further refinements to the provisions as passed by this House but also the addition of new sections.  The main changes made to existing provisions relate to the section providing for the increase in the audit exemption thresholds.  The new provisions added deal with a number of <Col N="1556"/>matters, such as statutory declarations made abroad for the purposes of the Companies Acts, private companies and their ability to offer shares and debentures and amendment of the Investment Funds Companies and Miscellaneous Provisions Act 2005 relating to the consent of experts of material provided by them in prospectuses.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 6 relates to statutory declarations.  In a number of provisions in the Companies Acts, documents that need to be filed in the Companies Registration Office, CRO, are required to contain a statutory declaration.  Under general law, statutory declarations made in the State are required to be made under the Statutory Declarations Act 1938.  They can be taken before a person authorised by law to take and receive statutory declarations such as a solicitor, a notary public, a commissioner for oaths or a peace commissioner.  Statutory declarations made outside of the jurisdiction are required to be made under the Diplomatic and Consular Officers (Provision of Services) Act 1993.  Essentially this Act requires that statutory declarations be made before a diplomatic or consular official.</P>
        <P>For many years, the practice operated by the CRO permitted the registration of statutory declarations taken abroad when made before persons authorised to administer oaths in the jurisdiction in question, including in the case of Northern Ireland and the UK, before practising solicitors in those jurisdictions.  However, as a result of a detailed analysis of the situation, it emerged that the existing practice was incorrect.  Consequently, since April of this year, the CRO has changed its practice so that it now only accepts statutory declarations made abroad where they comply with the 1993 Act.  The Law Society has strongly argued that the essence of the previous process and procedures should be restored.  It also recommended that persons entitled under the Solicitors Act to practise as a solicitor in the State should be able to take statutory declarations abroad.  It also recommended that all statutory declarations made and delivered for registration in the CRO under the old regime should be retrospectively validated.  The CRO fully support these recommendations.</P>
        <P>Amendments Nos. 7 and 8 relate to offerings of shares and debentures by private companies.  Prior to the enactment of the Investment Funds, Companies and Miscellaneous Provisions Act 2005, and Part 5 thereof in particular, and the Prospectus Regulations 2005, SI 324 of 2005, practitioners were able to advise their clients that on the basis of existing law, and in particular a combination of sections 33, 51 and 61 of the Companies Act 1963 and section 21 of the Companies (Amendment) Act 1983, it was possible for a private company to make offers of their shares and debentures to potential investors provided the offer was structured in a particular way.  Thus, while offers of the type that were permitted were not expressly spelt out in law, they could be made by private companies so long as they were con<Col N="1557"/>sidered as being, in the terms of section 61(2) of the Companies Act 1963 &ldquo;regarded, in all of the circumstances, as not being calculated to result, directly or indirectly, in the shares or debentures becoming available for subscription or purchase by persons other than those receiving the offer or invitation, or otherwise as being a domestic concern of the persons making and receiving it&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>Along with a number of others, however, this section was repealed with effect from 1 July 2005 as part of the transposition of the EU prospectus directive, and this has resulted in a degree of uncertainty as to what types of offers of their shares or debentures can be made by private companies.  The issue of private companies making offers of their debentures or other debt instruments to raise capital has also been considered by the company law review group, CLRG.  As part of its recommendations for the reform and consolidation Bill, the CLRG suggested that the proposed model private company &mdash; the company limited by shares, CLS &mdash; will not be able to offer shares or debentures in the manner under consideration.</P>
        <P>However, the proposed private company that has an objects clause &mdash; a designated activity company, DAC &mdash; and which specifically provides for the matter in its constitution, will be able to make offers of this type, so long as the manner of doing so does not give rise to the need to publish a prospectus under the national law transposing the EU prospectus directive.  This proposed approach is broadly in line with that adopted in several areas of company law in recent times, such as in transposing the prospectus directive and availing of the maximum audit exemption thresholds, as we propose in section 6 of the present Bill, where the limitations or thresholds set in European law are adopted in determining the appropriate boundaries for the application of national law.</P>
        <P>The approach adopted in amendments Nos. 7 and 8 in respect of the proposed amendments to section 33 of the Companies Act 1963 and section 21 of the Companies (Amendment) Act 1983 is explicitly to permit a private company to make offers of the type that benefit from an exemption under regulation 9 of SI 324/2005, or which otherwise fall outside of the scope of the implementing regulations.  The opportunity is also being taken to increase the permitted number of members a private company may have to 99, in line with the recommendations of the CLRG.  This change would otherwise have to await the implementation of the main CLRG reform and consolidation Bill.</P>
        <P>Amendments Nos. 9 and 10 provide for an increase in the audit exemption thresholds.  Senators warmly welcomed the proposals in section 6 of the Bill to increase the audit exemption thresholds significantly when it was considered and passed by this House earlier this year.  Arising from further examination of the text as passed by this House, and to meet the wishes of <Col N="1558"/>all concerned that the increased thresholds should be capable of being availed of at the earliest opportunity, I introduced several amendments in the D&aacute;il on both Committee and Report Stages to address all aspects that were seen to arise.</P>
        <P>In this regard, it proved necessary to make a larger number of amendments than might have been thought necessary.  This is particularly so as the provisions of Part III of the Companies (Amendment) (No. 2) Act 1999, which first introduced the possibility for a company not to appoint an auditor, contain a number of interrelated and interdependent provisions, such that when one is changed, various consequential amendments must be made.  The essence of the changes made in the D&aacute;il will still enable a member or members holding not less that 10% of the voting shares of a company that would otherwise be eligible to avail of the exemption to notify the directors that the exemption should not be taken.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 9 replaces section 6 with an expanded section.  A new section is inserted after this by amendment No. 10, to deal with transitional arrangements.  The D&aacute;il also accepted amendment No. 11 which amends sections 150 and 160 of the Companies Act 1990.  The purpose of this amendment is to permit the High Court to order that the costs of investigating and prosecuting restriction or disqualification applications, or a proportion specified by the court, can be recovered from the restricted or disqualified company directors, rather than merely the legal costs as is the case at present.</P>
        <P>Amendments Nos. 12 and 13 relate to prospectuses and expert consents.  In recent weeks, a particular difficulty was raised by various legal practitioners who advise clients on the raising of capital through the issue of debentures, which involves the issue of a prospectus.  The problem relates to the way in which the EU prospectus directive was transposed into Irish law through a combination of the Investment Funds, Companies and Miscellaneous Provisions Act 2005 and the separate transposing of regulations under SI 324 of 2005 which were made under section 46 of that Act.</P>
        <P>The specific problem arose from the requirement in the original section 45(1)(<i>a</i>) of the Act that, where a prospectus includes a statement made by an expert, that expert must give his or her consent to the issue of the prospectus and that this consent must not be withdrawn before the issue of the prospectus.  It has now emerged that this requirement, which was modelled on section 46 of the Companies Act 1963, goes beyond the requirements of the prospectus directive, which is a maximum harmonisation directive.</P>
        <P>To address this problem, I moved amendments Nos. 12 and 13 in the D&aacute;il.  The first of these substitutes a new section 45 which specifies that an expert is only required to give his or her consent <Col N="1559"/>to the inclusion of the statement in the prospectus.  As a result of the way Part 5 of the 2005 Act is structured, it proved necessary to make a large number of consequential changes to sections 38, 41, 42, 44 and 48 of the 2005 Act, and these were catered for in the second amendment.</P>
        <P>Amendments Nos. 2 and 3 are designed to provide that certain provisions will come into operation on the passing of the Bill.  These include the provisions relating to the increase in the audit exemption thresholds which will come into effect once the President signs the Bill into law on 1 January.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern"><NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The primary national law relating to takeovers in this jurisdiction is the Irish Takeover Panel Act of 1997.  This provided for the establishment, on a statutory basis, of the Irish takeover panel, which oversees extensive rules governing the many aspects of takeovers.  The panel covers full takeovers as well as case of the acquisition of a substantial interest in a target company.  Earlier this year, the European Communities (Takeover Bids (Directive 2004/25/EEC)) Regulations 2006, SI 255 of 2006, were signed into law by the Minister, Deputy Martin.  These were designed to transpose into Irish law the necessary provisions to give effect to the EU directive in question.  The regulations came into effect on 20 May 2006.</P>
        <P>The directive has a narrower focus both as regards the range of companies covered compared with the current regime applying to takeovers here under the Irish Takeover Panel Act and the rules made by the panel for the exercise of its supervisory functions under the Act.  The directive applies only to companies admitted to trading on a regulated market, which, in an Irish context means those companies on the official list of the Irish Stock Exchange, whereas the 1997 Act applies to a wider cohort of listed companies.  In terms of transactions, the directive only applies to takeover bids whereas the Act also covers other transactions, including substantial acquisitions of shares and offers other than takeovers.</P>
        <P>As a result of the transposition of the directive, certain differences exist as regards the takeovers regime applying here, depending on whether the company is a directive or a non-directive company.  The primary purpose of the takeovers provisions in the Bill and the amendments made in the D&aacute;il is to empower the panel to minimise these differences to ensure it can apply a single set of rules to all companies and transactions under its jurisdiction, if appropriate.</P>
        <P>Perhaps the most significant of these amendments is amendment No. 31, which provides for <Col N="1560"/>the substitution of section 1(3) of the 1997 Act which is designed, as far as possible, to align the definition of &ldquo;acting in concert&rdquo; in that Act with that applicable in the 2006 regulations.  This should provide greater clarity both for market participants as well as the Irish takeover panel and avoid undesirable confusion for all concerned.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Amendment No. 40 relates to the substitution of section 7D, being inserted by section 17 into the 1997 Act.  The revised section 7D is expanded in content to spell out more explicitly the powers of the Irish takeover panel when making rules and the circumstances when these can be the same or different, depending on whether the proposed action is for a takeover bid or a takeover or other relevant action within the meaning of the 1997 Act.  The remaining amendments in this group are all essentially self-explanatory technical or consequential amendments arising from what I have just described.</P>
        <P>During the course of my contributions in this House, I explained that Part 3 was designed to partly transpose and partly pave the way for the transposition of the EU transparency directive.  This directive deals with and requires disclosure of specific information by companies whose securities are listed on a regulated market.  The directive is due for transposition by 20 January 2007.  Due to the nature of some of the disclosure obligations arising, relating as they do to the financial situation of listed companies, it has been decided that the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority should be appointed competent authority in respect of these aspects of the directive.  The other competent authority for the transparency directive will be the financial regulator, which is also the competent authority in respect of the transposing law for several related EU directives dealing with the publication of prospectuses and market abuse.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 14 provides for the amendment of section 9 of the 2003 Act to enable IAASA discharge the role of Irish competent authority arising from the requirements of Article 24(4)(<i>h</i>) of the EU transparency directive.  Amendment No. 15 makes several amendments to section 10 of the Companies (Auditing and Accounting) Act 2003, which established IAASA, to facilitate it discharging the additional functions now proposed.  In particular, IAASA will have the power to apply to the High Court to secure compliance with any of its rules relating to, or arising from, its new functions under transparency regulated markets law.</P>
        <P>A further substantive amendment is being made by Amendment No. 16 by substituting section 29(7) of the 2003 Act in a way that accommodates the expanded grounds arising from these new functions that IAASA can petition the High Court to ensure compliance with its rules, etc.  Several other amendments were made in Part 3 to deal with such matters as providing parameters within which civil liability may be provided for <Col N="1561"/>in regulations to be made by the Minister, and ensuring that any administrative sanctions regime will apply in instances of breaches of rules made by IAASA, as they will apply for breaches of rules made by the financial regulator.  Section 87 of the Investment Funds, Companies and Miscellaneous Provisions Act 2005 added the legislation which implemented the prospectus and market abuse directives last year to those enactments to which sections 33C and 33AN and Schedule 2 of the Central Bank Act 1942 refers.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 45 make provision for the addition of the proposed transparency (regulated markets) law to the 1942 Act.  The purpose of the amendments to section 33C and 33 AN is to ensure the administrative sanctions which the regulator possesses under the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority Act 2004 for the separate purpose of regulating financial institutions do not apply to the transparency legislation.  The purpose of the second part of the new section is to ensure the financial regulator can discharge the functions of the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority arising under Part 3 and the whole of the upcoming Regulations implementing the transparency directive.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Returning to amendments made to Part 3, I draw attention to the amendments made to the definition of what is termed &ldquo;Transparency (regulated markets) law&rdquo;.  Senator Coghlan had tabled several amendments on Committee Stage in this House seeking to have such changes made, as did Deputy Hogan in the D&aacute;il, and the end result of the Parliamentary Counsel&rsquo;s reconsideration of this matter was the making of the amendments.</P>

	<P>I thank you, a Chathaoirligh, for allowing me to raise this matter on the Adjournment.  I thank the Minister of State for attending the House.  Some 2,006 years ago, there were problems with the maternity services in Bethlehem.  The story of the Blessed Virgin Mary giving birth in a stable and putting her new-born child in a manger is at the centre of our Christmas celebrations.  Today, however, there is little to celebrate for the people of Bethlehem, a town of 30,000 people which is in a state of turmoil with danger all around.</P><Col N="1563"/>
        <P>The Palestinians in that area are some of the most destitute people in the world.  The Palestinian Government has no funds to pay salaries or provide public services.  As the Minister of State is aware, yesterday, the Prime Minister of Palestine was prevented from bringing $30 million in aid that he had succeeded in raising in other countries to his people.  In addition, Israel is not allowing money due to the Palestinians from taxes to be paid either.  The only money that is getting into the area at the moment is foreign aid, and especially that which comes from the European Union.  There are terrible problems for everyone there, but one group of people, pregnant women, will now have even fewer maternity services.  Their well-being is seriously compromised by a lack of trained staff in the Holy Family Hospital and other small maternity units in the West Bank.</P>
        <P>For a long time, Irish Aid was involved in funding postgraduate courses in Bethlehem University.  Among other postgraduate courses, Irish Aid supported midwifery training for nurses.  It was hoped that a course with direct entry to midwifery might be established soon because there is an international shortage of midwives.  Two of my nursing colleagues have contacted me about this matter.  They felt that when Irish Aid withdrew its funding for postgraduate courses, it did not understand that the midwifery course would be affected as well.  In the recent past, an assessment was carried out by some British advisers who recommended that Irish Aid should stop funding these postgraduate courses in Bethlehem University and put its money into primary education, another area where there is considerable deprivation.  This has happened, so I am not complaining that our money is not going there.  However, even the United Nations has appealed for help to restart the midwifery courses.</P>
        <P>I have frequently expressed my admiration for Irish Aid.  It is not as if these nurses can travel elsewhere locally to attend another such course.  As the Minister of State is well aware, the area is very dangerous.  There is a course in Ramallah, which is 10 km down the road.  That seems nothing to us but, unfortunately, it is too dangerous for people to go that far at the moment.  Jerusalem is 20 km away, which is also impossible.  In addition, it is out of the question to travel to Gaza city, which is 80 km distant.</P>
        <P>The maternity unit in the Holy Family Hospital in Bethlehem is the only such service in the West Bank.  There was a hospital in Beit Jallour but it closed recently, along with the few maternity beds it had, because staff were not being paid.  I am quite sure no one in Irish Aid would want the situation for pregnant women and those delivering children to deteriorate in any way.  However, the lack of money to train midwives is exposing pregnant women to greater risk.  I respectfully ask the Minister of State to inquire if this aid can be restored immediately.</P>

	<P>I welcome this opportunity to make a statement to the Seanad.  I also welcome the Senator&rsquo;s initiative in raising this matter on the Adjournment.</P>
        <P>This year has been a difficult one for the Middle East and, in particular, for Palestine.  The difficult and often desperate situation of the Palestinian people is of grave concern to the Government.  Ireland has provided development and humanitarian assistance in support of the Palestinian people since 1993.</P>
        <P>In 2006, we provided &euro;6.4 million to meet the humanitarian and development needs of the Palestinian people, an increase of over 40% on the previous year and the highest level of assistance in the history of our aid programmes.  Ireland&rsquo;s core objective in providing assistance to Palestine is to alleviate the consequences of the conflict by enhancing the capacity of Ireland&rsquo;s partners in Palestine to respond to the current crisis and, where possible, to begin to meet future development needs.</P>
        <P>Irish Aid does not provide direct support for maternity services.  Support is provided through Bethlehem University to a wide range of training in the health sector, including occupational therapy, physiotherapy, emergency nursing and midwifery, including some support provided through the Order of Malta.  Ireland has supported Bethlehem University since 1987, the longest period of support for any institution in the aid programme.</P>
        <P>Since 2000, more than &euro;1.4 million has been provided directly to Bethlehem University from Ireland&rsquo;s bilateral aid programme.  The overall objective is to enhance the effectiveness of Bethlehem University as a medium of assistance to the Palestinian people by assisting the university with its community outreach projects.  The focus is on the development of local capacity and assistance to the most vulnerable sections of the community.</P>
        <P>Under Ireland&rsquo;s three-year country strategy for bilateral aid to Palestine, which runs from 2005 to 2007, funding of &euro;225,000 was allocated for Bethlehem University.  All this funding has been paid in full.  I am aware of the particularly difficult situation in which the university now finds itself, given the severe humanitarian crisis which has affected the provision of services.</P>
        <P>In light of the current emergency, I am conscious of the difficulties being faced by the university and I assure the House that I will continue to provide funding.  Clearly, Palestine is in an extraordinarily difficult situation.  The severe and intractable humanitarian crisis is rooted in a territorial conflict that is fundamentally political.  The search for a lasting and peaceful settlement of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has for many years been a central concern of Irish foreign policy under successive Governments.  We are consistently active on the issue in the European Union and at the United Nations.</P><Col N="1565"/>
        <P>In 2007, the Government will maintain the level of assistance which is being provided for humanitarian and development assistance in Palestine.  We are committed to the provision of support for the United Nations relief and works agency, UNRWA, which is a key partner for Ireland in the delivery of basic services to the refugee population there.  We will continue our support to the United Nations development programme for programmes in rural development and to the UN office for the co-ordination of humanitarian affairs &mdash; known by its acronym UNOCHA &mdash; for its important co-ordination function.  Last week, in New York, I discussed the Palestinian situation in detail with Jan Egeland who is the under-secretary general of the United Nations.</P>
        <P>We will also continue to support human rights, democratisation and social regeneration programmes through our support for civil society organisations.  I assure Senators that Ireland will continue to do everything within its capacity to alleviate the suffering of the Palestinian people.</P>
        <P>Senator Henry has raised a matter, which, if I had known about it in detail, I would certainly have included in my reply.  I will seek an answer from my officials and from Irish Aid with regard to the midwifery courses she mentioned.  We provide financial assistance to Bethlehem University for such courses.  I will check the details.  It may be that the college authorities, or someone acting on their own behalf, decided to drop that course.  I will certainly inquire into the matter, however.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PaulBradford"><NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I am grateful for the opportunity to raise this issue concerning the BUPA health insurance company.  As a result of the introduction of risk equalisation, BUPA has decided to withdraw from the Irish health insurance market.  Yesterday&rsquo;s announcement was disastrous news for the 300 people BUPA employs in Fermoy.  It was a bad day for BUPA&rsquo;s almost 500,000 customers and a disappointing day for competition in the health insurance market.  Yet the announcement should not have surprised anybody.  It has been flagged for at least five years that the introduction of risk equalisation in the format proposed by the Government would result in BUPA&rsquo;s leaving the Irish market.  As BUPA personnel have made clear in the past day they have not been in the business of making threats to the Government.  In the past number of years they have simply and calmly outlined clearly that it would be financially impossible for BUPA to survive in the Irish health insurance market if risk equalisation as proposed by the Government were introduced.  It is significant that in the High Court judgment a fortnight ago when the judge indicated the Government&rsquo;s political entitlement <Col N="1566"/>to introduce risk equalisation, he also stated clearly that risk equalisation could result in BUPA&rsquo;s becoming financially unviable.  It is disappointing the Government did not respond to this.  This crisis has been flagged and, sadly, should not surprise us.  It is disappointing the Government has not reacted differently in recent years.</P>
        <P>We often hear from the Minister and the Government that risk equalisation is necessary for community rating policy, which everybody supports.  However BUPA operates community rating.  Like VHI, BUPA takes clients from any age group in this country and has done so since it entered the Irish health insurance market ten years ago.  What sort of advertisement is yesterday&rsquo;s decision for competition in Ireland?  What sort of advertisement is it for Ireland abroad?  What sort of signals are we sending out when, on the one hand, we try to promote competition across a range of State services, but on the other hand we have put in place a risk equalisation policy that would inevitably end competition in the health insurance market, as it has done.</P>
        <P>The clock is ticking quickly.  BUPA&rsquo;s decision has been made and announced.  However the Minister is aware that this health insurance issue will come up for adjudication by the Competition Authority and the Health Insurance Authority in the next few weeks.  I pointed this out in the Seanad two to three weeks ago.  The Government must first ensure those reports are published quickly.  If, as some media indications suggest, those reports result in major changes in health insurance regulations, the Minister must meet BUPA in the near future to see if the new regime proposed, as we are led to believe by the Competition Authority and the Health Insurance Authority, would provide a mechanism whereby BUPA and other companies such as VIVAS could have a long-term future in the Irish health insurance market.  The Irish health insurance market is unique in that one company, VHI, is absolutely dominant with almost 80% of the market.  This critical factor makes it difficult to maintain and promote competition and is the reason risk equalisation, which works in other countries, could not work here.  I appeal to the Minister as we face the Christmas period, to use whatever resources are available to the Government, and whatever little windows of opportunity are still open, to seek urgent talks with BUPA.</P>
        <P>BUPA is a mutual society, a non-profit making organisation with health insurance policies in more than 100 countries across the world and a long and proud record of providing health insurance on a non-profit basis.  We should try to assist it, not drive it out of the Irish market.  It is urgent that in the next day or two the Minister for Health and Children and her Department make immediate and direct contact with BUPA and try to find a way around yesterday&rsquo;s disastrous decision.  It was shocking for Fermoy, disastrous for health insurance, bad for competition and <Col N="1567"/>goes against the ethos of what we have been trying to do in this country in the past 20 years.  While risk equalisation has a place in certain markets, with the size and scale of the Irish health insurance market and with a dominant, almost monopolistic company, risk equalisation could result only in what we saw yesterday, that is, bad news for consumers and competition.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ConorLenihan"><NameTxt>Mr. C. Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am taking the Adjournment on behalf of the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney.</P>
        <P>The Minister regrets BUPA&rsquo;s decision to leave the Irish market and, in particular at this time, the loss of jobs resulting from that decision.  The Minister, on behalf of the Government, has endeavoured to achieve a solution that would enable BUPA to stay, but would also protect the fundamental principles of community rating supported by risk equalisation.  This means health insurance is available and affordable for older people and those with illnesses.  The recent High Court judgment upheld the existing regulatory arrangements, including risk equalisation.  BUPA&rsquo;s view following the High Court decision was that it could not stay in the market.  Following the High Court decision, a meeting between the Minister and BUPA senior management was arranged, and Senator Bradford will take comfort from that.  After that meeting, further discussions took place involving senior officials of the Department of Health and Children.  Notwithstanding that both sides put forward positions and proposals, it did not prove possible to reach an outcome in which BUPA decided it would stay in the Irish market.  The best advice available to the <Col N="1568"/>Minister was that the positions she put forward were consistent with BUPA&rsquo;s being able to continue operating in the market and to make profits at a level close to that which it makes in the UK.  It is noteworthy that VIVAS is still in the market and has not said it will pull out.</P>
        <P>The Government continues to support sustainable competition and consumer choice in the private health insurance market. The Government will also support the stability of the community rated health insurance system and the safeguards provided to protect it, such as risk equalisation.  This policy is designed to benefit the insured population, particularly the elderly and the ill, who would otherwise be vulnerable to the effects of risk selection, and would find the cost of private health insurance unaffordable.  Risk equalisation seeks to remove an insurer&rsquo;s incentive to select preferred risks.  It is clear from health insurance markets around the world that a system of risk equalisation and community rating is not incompatible with viable, ongoing competition.  Risk equalisation is not designed to over-compensate any insurance undertaking for the share of the total community of sick and elderly.  It is about compensating for differential risk profiles.  It is not about transferring profits.  It is about ensuring that competition takes place on an equitable basis.  It is the Minister&rsquo;s view that the regulatory framework for private health insurance, including provision for risk equalisation, is appropriate, and that it would have been possible for BUPA to remain in the Irish market and make reasonable profits.</P>
