	<P>I have received notice from Senator Tuffy that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Transport to give an update as to when the railway order for the Kildare route project will be signed.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Henry of the following matter:</P>
        <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to report progress on his plans to change the <i>in camera</i> rule in family law cases to allow for general reporting of overall trends while continuing to respect the privacy of all those involved as promised in the agreed programme for Government between Fianna F&aacute;il and the Progressive Democrats published in June 2002.</P>
        <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

  <MainHeading Type="GD" LHead="Order of" RHead="Business"> 
    <Title>Order of Business. </Title>
      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>The Order of Business is No. 1, Investment Funds, Companies and Miscellaneous Provisions Bill 2006 &mdash; Committee and Remaining Stages, to be taken on the conclusion of the Order of Business until 12.30 p.m.; and No. 2, International Criminal Court Bill 2003 &mdash; Committee Stage, to be taken at 12.30 p.m. until 2.30 p.m.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to raise two issues on the Order of Business.  Could the Leader request the Minister for Transport to come to the House early next week to make a statement on the rules and regulations governing private airfields?  Following the story that has developed over the past few days, it seems that I could set up a private airfield tomorrow with no need for the presence of customs officers or members of the Garda <Col N="1302"/>S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Anyone could fly into the aerodrome bringing whatever they like, legal or illegal.  Very wealthy people who use executive jets can enter and leave the country without anyone knowing the cargo of the aeroplane.  It is very important that the Minister make a statement on the regulations.</P>
        <P>There was a sigh of relief when the Progressive Democrats came out from under their beds and gave qualified support to the Taoiseach following the controversy of recent days.  As an experienced former Minister in many Departments serving in many Governments, has the Leader ever come across a senior Minister being offered or accepting money for speaking in his capacity as Minister at an engagement or a series of engagements?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>Yesterday we spoke about the garda sergeant shot on the south side in the course of his duty.  At the time most of us had not read the details of the incident.  The garda was on duty outside a home, preserving the scene of a crime, when someone came up and shot him.  It did not happen as part of an assault; it was a cold, calculated shooting.  This goes straight back to the drugs trade and the issue of importation of drugs, which is linked to the matter raised by Senator Brian Hayes.  It is a much wider issue than that of airport security.  The same applies to boats or ships coming into the country.  There is no check on these, a matter I have raised before.  Air traffic control and the Irish Coast Guard should always refer incoming traffic to the appropriate authorities but this does not happen.  There is a requirement on people entering the country whether by boat or aeroplane to report to customs.  This puts pressure on honest people and provides an escape route for those wishing to break the law.  The current system has not and is not working and must be changed.  Also, our failure to sign up to the Schengen Agreement creates all sorts of complications at our borders.  </P>
        <P>No. 7 on the Order Paper in my name and that of Senator Coghlan is the Official Languages (Amendment) Bill.  We have chosen to delay moving that legislation until late next month.  To credit Kerry County Council and the Kerry county manager they have, by a substantial majority, supported the holding of consultations with the people of Dingle, An Daingean U&iacute; Chu&iacute;s, in regard to naming their town.  Members will be pleased to note that those consultations will take place in the next couple of weeks.  They may also be pleased to note that local authorities very often have more understanding of local issues than Ministers in Government.</P>
        <P>During the recess, the opportunities to study tr&eacute; Gaeilge sa chathair seo are almost imithe.  T&aacute; sean-Ghaeilge t&oacute;ghta de churaclam UCD agus n&iacute; f&eacute;idir anois gn&aacute;th-Ghaeilge a chur mar &aacute;bhar c&eacute;ime i UCD on night courses.  I believe the Mini<Col N="1303"/>ster for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs would make better use of his time dealing with such issues.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I invite the Leader to elaborate on her intriguing remarks at the end of yesterday&rsquo;s Order of Business in regard to the source of the leak which has transfixed the nation for the past week or so.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Ryan is not in the loop anyway.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>No, I am not.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator can sing that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>As some Members will be aware, following the somewhat traumatic loss of my seat from this House in 1993 I was offered financial support by a very successful businessman, a friend of mine, who offered to pay for a court case which I was at the time contemplating.  He then offered to pay the cost of my next election campaign.  I had the wit to say &ldquo;No&rdquo; to him at a time when I was only a very junior backbencher.  I am surprised others did not have a similar level of wit when under pressure.  It was obvious to me that it would have been foolish of me to take money from a businessman even though he would not have benefited one way or the other given he lives in Switzerland.  What good would I be able to do a businessman anyway, I do not have the credibility to effect those sort of decisions?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator should stick to today&rsquo;s Order of Business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>If I sought favours people would immediately suspect there was something wrong.  Nevertheless, I am glad I had my wits about me at the time.  N&iacute;l m&eacute; chun aon rud a r&aacute; faoi logainmneacha bailte beaga san iar-dheisceart.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Ryan should refrain from speaking on that item until the appropriate time.  I ask that he speak only to toady&rsquo;s Order of Business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Is trua go raibh an t-am ag an Seanad&oacute;ir O&rsquo;Toole.  Bh&iacute; mise chun a r&aacute; n&aacute;r luadh an cheist liom i m&iacute; a chaith m&eacute; sa cheanntar le linn an tsamhraidh.  Bh&iacute; a l&aacute;n ruda&iacute; n&iacute;os t&aacute;bhachta&iacute; le pl&eacute; ag muintir an ceanntair n&aacute; logainm an bhaile bheag.  T&aacute; br&oacute;n orm, n&iacute; luafaidh m&eacute; a thuilleadh &eacute;, t&aacute; m&eacute; fed up ar fad leis.</P>
        <P Just="Left">During the Ryder Cup, which was a glorious success, although I am not sure it was watched by the billions we have been told watched it, honorary degrees were conferred on two people by UCD.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1304"/>
      <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>This House has no control over the conferral of degrees by UCD.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Universities Act imposes all sorts of responsibilities on universities and is restrictive in terms of the right to the title &ldquo;university&rdquo;.  I am, therefore, entitled to wonder if those granted that privilege by way of legislation enacted by the Houses of the Oireachtas are meeting the required standards.  The conferring of honorary degrees in the presence of a major benefactor of the university does not impress me in terms of the quality of university life.  When I hear from Senator O&rsquo;Toole chomh maith go bhfuil siad ag &iacute;sli&uacute; st&aacute;das na Gaeilge san ollscoil c&eacute;anna, I worry about what our universities are doing.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>They ignored the captain of the Kerry team.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Ryan has made his point.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Brian Hayes asked earlier that the Minister of Transport be invited to the House.  Perhaps when he is here he will deal with enforcement of safety equipment requirements for airlines registered in Ireland.  Following the recent tragedy on board an aircraft owned by the biggest airline operating out of Ireland, a doctor and two nurses spoke of the unavailability of rudimentary first aid equipment on board the aircraft.  It now appears the 25 year old woman might have died as a result of the absence of that equipment.  Airlines have legal obligations in this area.  I would like if the Minister could tell this House when an official of the Department of Transport last carried out an inspection of safety equipment on board aircraft in this country.  We are all aware of the laxity in terms of the implementation of regulations regarding heavy goods vehicles.  The recent tragedy may have happened as a result of a lack of enforcement in regard to safety equipment requirements..  </P>
        <P Just="Left">What has happened to the Oireachtas Library?  I have received a wonderful document from the Board of Works outlining the architectural joys of the Oireachtas Library.  However, it no longer has a monitor which broadcasts what is happening in the Seanad.  The only monitor in the Library is broadcasting what is taking place in the D&aacute;il.  While I respect the other House, this House is entitled to the same respect.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I call on the Leader to consider holding an early debate on the costs of energy.  The regulator has approved a 23% increase in electricity prices from 1 January 2007.  However, the cost of oil is decreasing.  Earlier this week Flynn Fuel of the Downs in Mullingar was <Col N="1305"/>charging &euro;580 for 1,000 litres of heating oil.  That is, as far as I am aware, the lowest price for home heating oil in Ireland.  One year ago, 1,000 litres of oil cost &euro;660.  Petrol and diesel prices are also decreasing.  </P>
        <P>I take this opportunity to remind the Fine Gael Party to update its website in regard to rip-off Ireland.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad Senator Leyden took the time to read it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator is obsessed with us.  He must visit the website every day.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>It was last updated on 7 August 2005.  That is very current.  I knew Fine Gael was out of touch, I just did not realise how out of touch it was.  The Fine Gael Senators should visit the Fianna F&aacute;il website which is very much in order.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>It is the paper trail that matters.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I believe RIP relates to Fine Gael seats in the next election.  However, that is another day&rsquo;s work.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>That matter is not relevant on the Order of Business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>Perhaps someone could explain that joke to me again.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>No.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I intend to reactivate my name and shame campaign and ask that Fine Gael reactivate its rip-off Ireland campaign.  I welcome the increase in free units from 1,800 to 2,400 as announced by the Taoiseach some weeks for social welfare recipients.</P>
        <P>I know the Cathaoirleach will join with me in sending best wishes to the Roscommon minor football team which won the all-Ireland after 55 years.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator is out of order.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I am very proud to say Roscommon beat Kerry 1-10 to 9 points.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>That matter does not arise on the Order of Business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>What position did Senator Leyden play? Was it full-back?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Leyden referred to the increase in energy costs.  Many of us fear the projected increases in electricity and gas prices from 1 January 2007.  Senator Leyden also referred to the drop in oil prices.  The Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources <Col N="1306"/>will possibly extend an invitation to the regulator to meet with us to discuss this matter.  </P>
        <P>If one looks at an ESB bill one will note that VAT is paid at 13.5%.  Also included on the bill is a standing order charge and a public service obligation which equate to approximately 21% of one&rsquo;s overall bill.  The Government takes a dividend of approximately &euro;80 million from the ESB.  There is also an onus on the Government to take action if it wants electricity prices to decrease.  If prices escalate out of all proportion, which is currently the case, we must consider reducing the VAT element of electricity bills.  Liberalisation of the market has meant nothing to domestic consumers who have no choice other than to use the ESB.  Perhaps Senator Leyden will ask the Minister for Finance to reduce VAT.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>Will that be Fine Gael policy in the next general election?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>It would be much more credible than Government policy. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, to come before the House to discuss the Water Services Programme 2005 to 2007.  As we are now halfway through the programme, we should discuss progress and in some cases the lack thereof at both local authority and departmental level.  Some counties have taken two years to prepare compliance with planning for projects scheduled for 2005 and 2006.  I ask that the Minister take remedial action where necessary. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>A few weeks ago, I and many others watched as a helicopter performed an efficient rescue off Howth Head, during which a stretcher was dropped to a person who had been injured on the cliffs.  I was very impressed by the crew&rsquo;s ability.  The reason I mention this incident is that I understand a rescue helicopter must first load up before travelling to a hospital to collect a medical team and flying to the site of an accident to carry out a rescue attempt.</P>
        <P>Last week, my attention was drawn to the rescue of a man called Richard Hammond in Britain.  Mr. Hammond, the presenter of the &ldquo;Top Gear&rdquo; programme on the BBC, was rescued by an air ambulance.  Afterwards, his wife asked that those who wished to send flowers to the hospital should instead send donations to the air ambulance services in Britain, of which there are eight.  I was surprised to learn that these services are primarily supported by charity.</P>
        <P>Ireland does not have an air ambulance service.  If Senator Brian Hayes&rsquo;s request that the Minister for Transport come to the House to discuss air services is acceded to, it would present a useful opportunity to determine whether the Government is in a position to operate an air <Col N="1307"/>ambulance service similar to those in operation around Britain.  If it is true that an air ambulance must first load up on equipment and collect a doctor from a hospital before attending the site of an accident, it clearly reduces its rescue ability.  I intend to raise this matter during any debate the House may have on air services.</P>
        <P>Yesterday, I watched a television interview with Richard Branson on the volume of fuel used by aeroplanes.  He pointed out that considerable fuel savings would be achieved if the common practice of switching on aeroplanes&rsquo; engines and taxiing them on to runways up to 40 minutes before take-off were to cease and aeroplanes were instead towed onto runways.  This is a good idea.</P>
        <P>Mr. Branson also made the point that air traffic control in the United States is centralised in one authority, whereas almost every country in Europe has its own air traffic control system.  I understand centralisation of air traffic control in Europe would eliminate the requirement to have aeroplanes circle around airports.  Returning from Brussels last week, the aeroplane on which I flew circled Dublin Airport for 20 minutes.  I spoke to someone whose aeroplane had circled for 25 minutes on arrival from Nantes.  Perhaps last week was a particularly busy one.  Centralisation rather than the principle of subsidiarity should apply to this function.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>I share Senator Ryan&rsquo;s criticism of the outrageous example of elitism in which University College Dublin engaged last week in stealthily conferring a number of degrees which, I understand, are not worth the paper on which they are printed.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Seanad has no control over those on whom universities wish to confer degrees.  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate that but the House passes legislation on universities.  Given that nobody has raised this issue, it appears it is to be accepted.  Two distinguished Members of the House, Senators Maurice Hayes and Quinn, have honorary degrees.  It does not reflect well on a university that it would devalue something for purely elitist purposes.  I understand the degrees conferred are not worth the paper on which they are printed.  </P>
        <P>Last week, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, travelled to New York to attend the United Nations General Assembly.  During his visit he took the opportunity to meet representatives of Irish emigrant groups in New York and the coalition of Irish emigration centres.  Will the Leader consider asking the Minister to come to the House before Christmas to outline Government policy on funding overseas Irish groups?  Funding in excess of &euro;12 million per <Col N="1308"/>annum is now available for this purpose.  The demographics of Irish people in the United States has changed completely and there is a growing need for finances, resources and capacity building to address the needs of elderly Irish people.  This is a mainstream issue among Irish emigrants in the United Kingdom but I never thought it would become an issue in the United States.  I commend the Government for significantly increasing funding for emigrant groups by 45% in last year&rsquo;s budget and look forward to an even greater increase in this year&rsquo;s budget.  I ask the Leader to consider this as a subject for discussion.</P>
        <P>It is extraordinary that I agree with Senator Ryan on two matters.  Before the summer recess, I advised the House about what was happening in the Oireachtas Library.  What is taking place downstairs is a disgrace.  Members of this House serve on the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission which is supposed to attend to these matters.  It is unacceptable that Members are now bereft of a library facility.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>As a member of the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission, I will convey the Senator&rsquo;s concerns to a meeting of the body later today. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Brian Hayes&rsquo;s call regarding the lack of controls on private airports and airfields.  There appears to be a frightful gap which leaves Ireland wide open.  God only knows what has been coming in or going out through these facilities.  I also take on board Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s point regarding customs at ports.  I hope the Minister will inform the House how he proposes to provide proper controls at these points of entry. </P>
        <P>Like Senator O&rsquo;Toole, I also welcome the overwhelming decision of Kerry County Council to proceed with a plebiscite.  I hope the Minister and Government will respect the outcome of a democratic vote and look forward to joining the Senator in moving a Bill on the Order Paper following the plebiscite which will be held in a few weeks.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomMorrissey"><NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Leader to arrange with the Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen, a debate on the State Airports Bill and outstanding issues with regard to Cork Airport, the restructuring required in Shannon Airport and the development of Dublin Airport.  Passenger throughput at Dublin Airport is expected to increase by 3 million this year.  The business plans need to be addressed.  </P>
        <P>I congratulate the Minister for Transport on the fantastic successes he achieved over the summer months.  Following a meeting yesterday, he will announce reforms in the bus market and Dublin Bus will receive the buses it seeks.  In addition, the Government no longer runs hotels.  The Minister also oversaw a highly successful flo<Col N="1309"/>tation of Aer Lingus.  While some might argue the company was sold too cheaply, the flotation was oversubscribed.  I want the State Airports Bill to be enacted.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>With regard to the leaking of confidential information from tribunals, the Leader indicated yesterday that she did not believe the leaks originated from Opposition parties or the tribunal and stated that we must look nearer home on this matter.  Will she elaborate on that remark?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>That question has been asked.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>It is appropriate that a Garda investigation into leaks from tribunals is under way.  If the Leader has additional information, is she prepared to co-operate with that investigation?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>I am always prepared to co-operate with the Garda. </P>
      
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I support calls for greater security and more customs checks at small airports, ports and harbours.  I call for the relevant Minister to come to the House to explain the improvements it is intended to make to ensure that drug trafficking is at least curtailed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Ms White</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Leader to arrange an early debate on ageing and ageism in society.  I would like the relevant Ministers to attend to deal with the various forms of discrimination for which their Departments are responsible.  Despite an acute shortage of qualified staff in many parts of the public service, we force thousands of public servants to retire at 65 who wish to stay on and contribute their skills and experience.  A survey published in <i>The Irish Times</i> on 12 September 2006 confirmed that the majority of older people do not want to retire at 65, yet they are forced to do so.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Since I first raised the issue I have received numerous pleas for help on forced retirement from people nationally.  Very kindly, the Cathaoirleach facilitated an Adjournment debate on 29 June 2006 on the continued obligation in the general medical service on general practitioners to cease at 70 years of age to treat their public patients despite being allowed to continue to treat their private patients.  The Minister of State with responsibility for the elderly, Deputy Se&aacute;n Power, told the House that he was open to changing the rule and would forward the matter to the group considering the modification of the general practitioner contract.  However, three months later the Department of Health and Children has yet to take a stance on the issue, never mind remove the bar at age 70.</P><Col N="1310"/>
        <?oasys _cl11.5- ?><P>This weekend, the British Government will introduce legislation which prevents people from being forced to retire before the age of 65 and allows them to negotiate to stay in employment after that age.  It is very important to halt the discrimination which forces people to retire at 65 years.  I am on a mission to bring this change to fruition.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.  It is not &ldquo;Mission Impossible&rdquo;.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelCoonan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coonan</NameTxt>
	<P>Over the last 24 hours, we have heard about the dig-out and the whip-around.  Last night, on my way from this renowned building to the place I stay, which is just across the road, I encountered four people sleeping in doorways.  I thought about how serious it was and wondered how the Members of this distinguished House could continue to turn a blind eye to the homeless.  The homeless are the people to whom we should give a dig-out and for whom we should have a whip-around.  I ask the Leader to invite the Minister with responsibility for housing matters to have a debate on social and affordable housing, the policies on which are not working.  Local authorities are being forced away from building programmes, which is just one of many issues in this area I would like to debate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government gave the builders a dig-out.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelCoonan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coonan</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Leader to invite the missing Minister for Agriculture and Food to the House for a debate on farming matters, especially the sugar industry and compensation.  We are entering the harvest season, but beet farmers have no crop nor do they have compensation.  The Minister must come to the House to address the issue if we are avoid a flight from the land and the addition of sugar beet farmers and producers to the ranks of the homeless.  It is a serious issue.  As we have not had a debate on agricultural issues for quite a while, I ask the Leader to organise one.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Mr. Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Leader to request the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources to attend the House for a debate on new technologies.  Over the last 20 years, we have seen the blossoming of three new sectors.  While the Internet, computers and mobile phone telecommunications have been blessings which have provided employment and opportunity, they have also been abused by people sending anonymous communications.</P><Col N="1311"/>
        <P>I would like to focus in the debate on the use of mobile phones to send vile, almost diabolical text messages to bully people anonymously.  Every year, we hear of this bullying and perhaps of a child who has taken his or her own life because he or she could not cope with the pressure that has placed on them.  In adults, the practice is vile and insidious.  I call on the communications companies to provide full co-operation at all times to ensure that people know that if they use mobile phones in this way, they can and will be tracked.  A policy must be put in place to ensure that people know that if they involve themselves in this type of activity, they will be caught.</P>
        <P>I support the call for a debate on energy.  At one filling station on the Dublin quays, it costs &euro;1.30.9 for a litre of petrol, which is incredible.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>They have no customers.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Mr. Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>It is especially annoying in that it is the only filling station which leads to the western motorway and represents the only chance for a great number of miles to obtain petrol.  One is left without the opportunity to shop around on the route despite the fact that there is another filling station in Dublin which sells petrol for &euro;1.02.9.  How can there be a divergence of &euro;1.27 per gallon in the price of petrol?  It is a very significant sum of money given that the price of oil is down to $60 per barrel, with each barrel representing 80 gallons.  Such divergences are unacceptable, especially where people have no choice.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on domestic violence as early as possible.  It is some time since we held such a debate while recent reports inform us that the incidence of domestic violence continues to increase.  While domestic violence affects women for the most part, I wish to recognise also that some men fall victim to it.  In the upcoming budget, I would like the Minister for Finance to increase funding for the voluntary organisations which deal with the victims of domestic violence.  It is timely to have a debate on the matter.</P>
        <P>Fine Gael will certainly support Senator White in her work on ageing.  Fine Gael calls on the Government to abolish the compulsory retirement age of 65.  Given the facts that people are much healthier and wish to work for longer, it is time to review the policy.  The abolition of the compulsory retirement age is also among the recommendations of the Pensions Board.  The abolition of the retirement age will help to address the pensions problems of many people by allowing them to work longer and defer taking pension payments thereby increasing their eventual size.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="1312"/>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly"><NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Morrissey&rsquo;s call for information from the Minister for Transport on the reorganisation of the airports.  I seek information also on the new Open Skies policy, about which there has been a great deal of discussion between the EU and USA.  The discussions do not seem to be going anywhere currently.  The House would like an indication from the Minister of the arrangements which will be put in place should the negotiations between the EU and USA fail to reach a conclusion.  Hopefully, the current policy will remain in place until a new agreement is reached.</P>
        <P>Can the Leader arrange for the Minister for Social and Family Affairs to attend the House to explain the reorganisation of community organisations at local level?  There has been discussion on extending the remit of some of the organisations while rationalising others which deal with child care and other matters.  There should be rationalisation of the various organisations dealing with issues at a local level.  There is a major reorganisation taking place and the Minister should indicate his objective in making these changes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMauriceHayes"><NameTxt>Dr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator White&rsquo;s request for a debate on aging.  Unlike Senator Terry, I must declare an interest.  As she said, however, life expectancy has increased by about ten years in the last 30 years.  People are living longer, which leads to problems not just with those in work but with people who have Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease and similar conditions.  It would be an appropriate subject for the Seanad to discuss.</P>
        <P>Senator Finucane &mdash; I mention him partly to show that I recognise him today &mdash; and Senator Leyden raised the question of energy costs.  That brings us into a broader debate about inflation because these are inflationary pressures and they might be dealt with by a variation in excise duty.  Perhaps the Minister of Finance might come into the House to discuss inflation because it is beginning to creep up.</P>
        <P>I support the Members who have referred to the Oireachtas Library.  It is currently a triumph of form over function.  It would be nice to have an 18th century drawing room but, basically, we want a working library, which I hope can be achieved.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Mr. Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senators Morrissey and Daly in their calls for a discussion of the State Airports Act.  Some serious difficulties have arisen at Shannon Airport as a result of Dublin Airport Authority&rsquo;s insistence on rationalisation taking place over the heads of the workers.  Efforts are being made to close and limit services in the bar and restaurants under the guise of re-rostering of workers, where not enough staff are provided to keep the facilities open.  This has <Col N="1313"/>been brought about by a consultant who has been engaged to rationalise in a way that attempts to bully workers into submission.  Everyone recognises that there must be rationalisation at Shannon Airport but management must enter meaningful negotiation with the workers as soon as possible because this affects the future viability of the airport and the region.  The bully boy tactics of the last week have been wholly unhelpful and prove that the separation has not taken place.  A worse situation now exists where Dublin Airport has its boot on the throat of Shannon Airport.</P>

	<P>I would like the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to check how information on Senators is collected and verified by the Eircom directory, where I am listed as a Labour Party Senator elected on the industrial and commercial panel.  I do not wish to cause alarm to my colleagues here or, still more, to Senator Ryan, but if I was going to defect to the Labour Party, which I am not, I would do so by means other than the green pages of the Eircom directory.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>I would say the Labour Party would be delighted to have Senator Mansergh.  Senator Brian Hayes raised the lax rules governing private airfields.  We have all been alarmed by the laxness over who comes and goes and where they go.  There is a mobile Customs and Excise group that visits small, private airports but it is not satisfactory that we hear about events like this on the news.  I will ask the Minister for Transport to discuss the matter here.  The Senator also asked me if I have been offered or accepted money and I have not.  Women are not offered money for some reason but we can get it anyway.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Senator O&rsquo;Toole again raised the matter of the garda who was injured just standing outside a particular home to protect it and mentioned that there are no checks on small boats coming into the country.  He also raised the issue of Dingle.  We have all been informed through the newspapers of the plebiscite which Senator O&rsquo;Toole and Senator Coghlan have pressed and which Kerry County Council is carrying out.  When the results are known, perhaps the Senators can press their amendment to the Bill.</P>
        <P>Senator Ryan does not have much sympathy with the discussion about Dingle.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Ryan then raised the issue of the honorary degrees for the captains of the two Ryder Cup teams.  I was surprised by this myself.  The parent body of NUI was not brought into the discussions apparently.  He also raised the issue of the medical equipment which would have helped a young woman travelling on a major airline.  The whole matter was sad.</P>
        <P Just="Left">He also asked about the Oireachtas Library, pointing out that there is no Seanad monitor.  A note has been put in about that.  The refurbishment of the Oireachtas Library is almost complete and a second monitor will be placed there at the end of this week.  We hope all of the work will be finished next week.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>As a member of the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission, which a Senator tried to blame, I would like to point out that the commission exists to work on behalf of the Members and the Houses.  The Oireachtas Library needed to be refurbished and I am sure it will be back in full operation to everyone&rsquo;s satisfaction in due course.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Leyden called for a debate on energy, advising Fine Gael to update its website.  He slipped the great feat for Roscommon in nicely, and, as a native of that county, I agree with him.  They were a great little team.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>This is not relevant to the Order of Business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Coonan asked about the various charges on the ESB bill which add up to 20% of the total, and the Government dividend that has been taken from the board of ESB, asking if it could be waived, something that would be of assistance to consumers.</P>
        <P>Senator Brennan asked for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to come into the House to discuss the water services programme, particularly the varied ways county councils respond to that programme, with some moving quickly and some delaying.</P>
        <P>Senator Quinn pointed out that we do not have any air ambulance services.  He also mentioned the increased fuel efficiency resulting from aeroplanes being towed to the runway, as Richard Branson pointed out, instead of taxiing.  Passengers, however, may feel alarmed to feel themselves being towed.</P>
        <P>Senator Mooney was in total agreement with Senator Ryan on what he thought were disgraceful awards made by UCD.  He wants the Minister for Foreign Affairs to attend the House to discuss funding for Irish bodies in the US and the UK, which he is glad has been increased.  Senator Coghlan referred to the lack of control over small <Col N="1315"/>airfields, as well as the plebiscite in his own county.</P>
        <P>Senator Morrissey wishes the Minister for Transport to attend the House to discuss the culmination of the State Airports Bill.  The legislation was to put many things in place which did not come about.  When the Bill was debated here I spoke strongly about it and I knew that would be the outcome, although what has happened is quite amazing.</P>
        <P>On foot of Senator Cummins&rsquo;s remarks, I would be pleased to liaise with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I have always done so, am in good standing and would like to do so.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>

	<P>The Leader should continue on the Order of Business without interruption.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Exactly.  Senator White sought a debate on aging and retirement.  She said the point she raised in an Adjournment debate had not yet been fulfilled, namely, that a doctor in private practice can treat someone over 70, but a doctor in public service cannot.  </P>
        <P>As regards Senator Coonan&rsquo;s remarks, the Minister for Agriculture and Food is not missing.  She is all over the newspapers today, having attended the ploughing championships.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelCoonan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coonan</NameTxt>
	<P>She was missing all summer. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>No, she was not.  She is doing her job.  The Senator sought a debate on housing, homelessness and social and affordable housing.  Such a debate was also sought yesterday by Senator Maurice Hayes.  I will be glad to facilitate those requests.  Senator Coonan also referred to the sugar beet compensation money that has not been paid.  That has been the cause of some alarm so perhaps we can invite the Minister for Agriculture and Food to the House to discuss the matter.   </P>
        <P>Senator Hanafin wants the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources to attend the House to debate new technology, including computing and the Internet.  He spoke in particular about the practice of anonymous text messages being sent to mobile phones, which frighten young people.  That matter has also been brought to my attention.</P>
        <P>The Senator also referred to petrol prices, including a filling station on the quays.  If drivers go out the western road there are two stations which are competitive on price.  In Mullingar, County Westmeath, petrol is selling for less than &euro;1 per litre, which is good news.</P>
        <P>Senator Terry sought a debate on domestic violence against women and men.  She wishes to see an increase in funding for this area prior to <Col N="1316"/>the budget.  I will endeavour to arrange a debate on that matter.  She supported Senator White on the abolition of the retirement age and said that Fine Gael would support that call.  I am sure Senator White will be pleased with that.</P>
        <P>Senator Daly referred to the open skies policy, which has been spoken of for about ten years.  He sought a debate on the reorganisation of State airports, with particular reference to Shannon Airport.  The Senator also wants the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs to attend the House because much reorganisation has been mooted for community groups at local level.</P>
        <P>Senator Maurice Hayes said he would support Senator White&rsquo;s remarks and also said that he had a vested interest in the issue she raised.  A few of us have.  He also sought a debate on how energy prices are leading to an increase in inflation.</P>
        <P>Senator Dooley referred to the State Airports Bill and the attempt by the DAA to bully the workforce.  I knew it would all come to this concerning Shannon.</P>
        <P>To our dismay, Senator Mansergh stated that he is listed as a Labour Senator on the industrial and commercial panel in the Eircom pages.  We will have to get that changed, otherwise it would be a massive slur upon him.</P>

	<P>I thank Senators for their valuable contributions.  We had a useful debate on Second Stage in July.  This is technical legislation covering a number of different areas of company and consumer law.  I wish to record my appreciation of the input of Senators to the debate.  These provisions are necessary to allow Irish companies to continue to compete on international markets, thereby allowing us to maintain our competitiveness in key areas where it has been established.  In addition, key provisions are included to <Col N="1321"/>allow for the smooth and effective transposition of EU directives relating to takeovers and transparency.  It is imperative that we provide for civil and criminal liability and sanctions in these areas and this must be done by primary law.  Should any further amendments be made in the D&aacute;il I will, of course, bring the Bill back to the Seanad when Senators will have a further opportunity to give their views.  </P>
        <P>I thank the staff of the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel and the Attorney General&rsquo;s office for their assistance in drafting the legislation and my own staff for the work and effort they put into bringing the Bill to fruition.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Minister of State has said, the Bill is largely technical, but necessary because of the new directives dealing with takeovers, transparency and related matters.  The most important element of the Bill is how it deals with competitiveness to put us on a level playing pitch.  Once the British Government had decided to increase the audit threshold, I considered it was important that we were not at a disadvantage with regard to our neighbouring jurisdiction in the northern part of the island.  The Minister of State was of the same view as he took this aspect on board when we first mentioned it.</P>
        <P>I welcome the audit limit exemption increase to &euro;7.3 million, which is an important factor.  I urge the Minister of State to continue to hold an interested watch on such matters.  I look forward to coming back to deal with the Bill again if amendments are made in the D&aacute;il.</P>
        <P>I thank the Minister of State and his officials with regard to what has been achieved.</P>

        <P FLI="0">These are technical amendments designed to introduce an element of consistency to the definitions section of the Bill.  The Minister will be <Col N="1322"/>aware that other paragraphs in this section use singular or collectively singular nouns whereas &ldquo;choses in action&rdquo; or &ldquo;proceeds&rdquo; are unnecessarily plural.  Since the more commonly used term is &ldquo;chose in action&rdquo;, it would add uniformity and clarity and if the word &ldquo;any&rdquo; were inserted to define each term in the singular.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 12, subsection (1), line 4, to delete &ldquo;who&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;, whatever his or her nationality, who, whether in or outside the State,&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">These are extremely important amendments which tie in with my opposition to section 12.  The essence of amendment No. 3 is to convert genocide and crimes against humanity into crimes of universal jurisdiction rather than of national jurisdiction.  Universal jurisdiction has been exercised world-wide for over a century and has its origins in the criminalisation of piracy and slavery.  Just as pirates and slave traders were denied safe haven by universal jurisdiction in the past, those who would perpetrate genocide, crimes against humanity or war crimes, are denied it now.  These three crimes covered by the Rome Statute are the most despicable of our time and sadly, those who commit them too often do so with absolute impunity.  The more universal jurisdiction is extended by responsible nations to these crimes, the greater the likelihood that such impunity will be shattered.</P>
        <P>On 29 April 2004, Amnesty International published a set of comments and recommendations on the Irish International Criminal Court Bill 2003.  Foremost among these were the recommendation that universal jurisdiction, already provided for in the Bill with regard to war crimes, should also be extended to cover genocide and <Col N="1323"/>crimes against humanity.  These amendments will extend the jurisdiction of all three of the crimes within this Bill to cover crimes committed by any perpetrator of any nationality who commits one of the crimes within or without the State.</P>
        <P>In order to do this, the amendment proposes two changes, the first being to replace the word &ldquo;who&rdquo; in sections 7 and 8, with the phrase &ldquo;whatever his or her nationality, who, whether in or outside the State,&rdquo;.  This is the crucial change which extends the scope of the Bill to include any person of any nationality in any location in the world who commits any of these three offences under the Bill or any ancillary offence.</P>
        <P>I refer to the Second Stage changes to remove section 12 which deals with the extra-territorial jurisdiction of the Bill as it stands.  The section currently provides for universal jurisdiction for war crimes but only provides for extra-territorial jurisdiction over genocide and crimes against humanity where such crimes are committed by Irish nationals or on Irish ships or aircraft.  I hope that sections 7 and 8 will be amended as section 12 will then no longer be necessary.  This amendment will extend the jurisdiction of the Bill to cover heinous crimes committed all over the world.</P>
        <P>The Bill accepts the right to use universal jurisdiction for war crimes.  This amendment is not introducing any new legal principle.  The effect of it is to make the same provision on jurisdiction for crimes against humanity and genocide as are applied to war crimes.  The Rome Statute of the ICC is clear that domestic efforts are crucial to international justice.  The preamble of the statute states that effective prosecution must be ensured by taking measures at the national level by enhancing international co-operation.  It also states that it is a duty of every State to exercise its criminal jurisdiction over those responsible for international crimes.  It is only by harmonising domestic and international efforts that we can be certain that those who perpetrate these evil and despicable crimes will be brought to justice.</P>
        <P>The enforcement of the law in any community is not the sole responsibility of central authorities.  In order for a law-abiding community to exist, all members of that community must take seriously their role in upholding the law and the international community is no different.  The International Criminal Court cannot of itself prevent the commission of these horrendous international crimes unless individual states fulfil their responsibilities and do everything in their power to see that the law is enforced.</P>
        <P>As a democratic, peace loving nation, Ireland has a moral responsibility to see that these heinous crimes do not go unpunished.  We have already lived up to that moral responsibility with regard to torture and war crimes.  We now have the moral responsibility with regard to genocide <Col N="1324"/>and crimes against humanity.  I hope the opportunity will be seized by the adoption of these amendments.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The proposed amendments would extend the jurisdiction of the State with respect to International Criminal Court offences to any ICC offence committed by a non-Irish national outside the State.  This would mean, in effect, that the Irish court would have just as much jurisdiction as the International Criminal Court itself in dealing with International Criminal Court cases.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Section 12, which Senator Cummins proposes to delete, concerns the jurisdiction of the State in respect of ICC offences committed outside the State.  Section 12(1) relates to taking jurisdiction for ICC offences committed by an Irish national outside the State.  Subsection (2) provides this State with jurisdiction with regard to a person of any other nationality who commits an act outside the State that, if done within it, would be an offence both under section 3 of the Geneva Conventions Act 1962, as amended, and as a war crime under Article 8.2 of the Rome Statute.</P>
        <P>The question of the jurisdiction to be adopted by the Bill was subject to legal advice from the Attorney General.  The advice given to the Department concluded that Ireland could only exercise universal jurisdiction for crimes already attracting universal jurisdiction under the generally recognised principles of international law.  This is a constitutional argument.</P>
        <P>Universal jurisdiction, extending jurisdiction to any offence committed in any state by a person of any nationality, was previously adopted in respect of grave breaches in international armed conflict of the Geneva Convention of 1949 and the first additional protocol of 1977, as implemented by the Geneva Conventions Acts of 1962 and 1998.  As many of the grave breaches under the Geneva Conventions are comparable with ICC offences, universal jurisdiction is, in effect, also adopted in the Bill for those ICC offences that are also offences under the Geneva Conventions Acts of 1962 and 1998.</P>
        <P>Ultimately it will be a matter for the Irish courts to decide, depending on the facts of a particular case, on whether an ICC offence is comparable with a grave breach for the purposes of exercising universal jurisdiction.  As the proposed amendments would extend the jurisdiction of the State with respect to ICC offences beyond the universal jurisdiction adopted in the Bill for those ICC offences which are also offences under the Geneva Conventions legislation, on the basis of legal advice from the Attorney General I cannot accept the amendments.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>It is unfortunate the amendments cannot be accepted.  I accept the Attorney General has given an opinion on the matter but I <Col N="1325"/>still feel the amendments put forward would put us in a better position in acting against genocide and other heinous crimes.  Although it is unfortunate they cannot be accepted, I realise the position the Minister is in with regard to advice he has taken.</P>

        <P LI="1">In page 12, subsection (3), line 11, to delete &ldquo;is set out in the Schedule to the 1973 Act&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;in the English language is set out for convenience of reference in <i>Schedule 2</i>&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The purpose of this amendment, which seems to have been accepted by the Minister, is to pick up on the fact that if the 1973 Act were to be repealed, the Schedule to the Act would also be repealed.  Therefore, it would seem appropriate to set out a reference to the text of the genocide convention in the Bill.  That is what we set out to do in amendments Nos. 4 and 21.</P>
        <P>I see the Minister has put forward alternative amendments.  I accept he is entitled to do so.  Amendment No. 5 may have better wording, but why did the Minister put forward the alternative to amendment No. 21?  I believe amendments Nos. 21 and 22 are the same.  Was there any reason amendment No. 21 could not have been accepted?</P>
        <P>I welcome that the Minister has seen the same issue that we have pointed out and that he has, in effect, accepted our amendment in principle.</P>

	<P>I express my gratitude to Senator Tuffy for tabling the amendments.  On reflection and reconsidering the issues that arose in respect of Opposition amendments tabled on Committee and Report Stages in the D&aacute;il, it is appropriate to publish the text of the Schedule.</P>
        <P>With regard to the differences between amendments Nos. 21 and 22, I am not certain they are totally identical.  I will give the Senator the courtesy of saying that it is her amendment that we are, effectively, copying in amendment No. 22.</P>

        <P LI="2">&ldquo;and the court shall, unless it sees sufficient reason to the contrary, give&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This amendment is necessary for constitutional reasons.  As the section stands, a criminal court would be obliged in all circumstances to give liberty to re-enter were the proceedings postponed in favour of a request from the International Criminal Court.  This could cause serious interference with the independence of the Judiciary, where, for example, a judge could take the view that by reason of excessive delay any further adjournment would be contrary to the constitutional rights of the accused.</P>
        <P>As a result, some measure of discretion is necessary to save the section from being struck down as unconstitutional.  We are providing this discretion by means of this amendment.  On Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il I understand the Minister indicated that the court has an inherent jurisdiction, but we believe the Bill does not state this.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>This amendment deals with a situation where the Director of Public Prosecutions withdraws proceedings with liberty to re-enter.  The amendment would amend the subsection to provide that the proceedings be withdrawn &ldquo;and the court shall, unless it sees sufficient to the contrary, give, liberty to re-enter&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>The Office of the Attorney General advised that the proposed wording is too prescriptive and could be capable, curiously, of being seen to interfere with the Judiciary&rsquo;s independence.  We are all very concerned to preserve the Judiciary&rsquo;s independence.</P>
        <P>The Office of the Attorney General feels in trying to redress the issue raised by Senator Tuffy, we might end up trenching on the independence of the Judiciary from the other direction.  It would be better to leave it as it is for the reasons I mentioned in the D&aacute;il.</P>

        <P FLI="0">For constitutional reasons, we believe the High Court should not be made a rubber stamp and should be given some discretion in the matter of inquiring into the authenticity and sufficiency of documents presented to it.

        <P LI="1">In page 21, subsection (2)(<i>a</i>)(ii), line 2, to delete &ldquo;<i>ne bis in idem</i>,&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
        <P LI="2" FLI="0">&ldquo;<i>ne bis in idem</i><?oasys _cf7- ?>1<?oasys _cf7- ?>,&rdquo;.</P>
        <P LI="3" FLI="0"><?oasys _cf7- ?>1<?oasys _cf1- ?>autrefois acquit, autrefois convict or double jeopardy.</P>
        <P FLI="0" Just="Left">The Minister is aware the term <i>&ldquo;ne bis in idem&rdquo; </i> is a Latin phrase meaning &ldquo;not twice for the same&rdquo;.  It describes the legal doctrine which comes to us from Roman civil law and prevents the trial of a person twice for the same offence.  It is more commonly referred to as <i>autrefois acquit</i> and <i>autrefois convict</i> depending on the circumstances.  Most laymen know it as double jeopardy.  It is a legal principle which has been established in Irish law for a considerable time.</P>
        <P>The first mention of it in statute was in section 14 of the Interpretation Act 1937.  It has been referred to in case law since 1963, including in well-known cases such as Attorney General (O&rsquo;Maonaigh) <i>v</i>. Fitzgerald which effectively established the doctrine of <i>autrefois acquit</i> at common law and the State (Attorney General) <i>v</i>. Judge Deale, which recognised <i>autrefois convict</i>.  However, as far as I am aware, there is no mention of the doctrine of <i>ne bis in idem</i> in Irish statute law or case law.  It comes to us from civil law but it appears in section 25 of the Bill.</P>
        <P>I assume this is due to an effort to mimic the terms used in Articles 20 and 89 of the Rome Statute which is not unreasonable.  However, I must ask whether it is wise that this term enters our Statute Book out of the blue without any definition of what it means or how it should be applied.  In this respect, a simple footnote to the Bill offering alternative terms for what effectively is the same doctrine would help to place the term in common law perspective, particularly since the Bill will operate in a common law jurisdiction. <Col N="1329"/> Failing that, the Minister must make an amendment to define the term <i>ne bis in idem</i> in the Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>One of the great aspects of having a computerised statute book is that someone such as Senator Cummins can stand up and assert with confidence that the phrase <i>ne bis in idem</i> does not appear anywhere else in the statute book.  Ten years ago he would have been brave to state it but one can make such statements with far more confidence.  I see the point the Senator makes.  However, if we are to deal with unprecedented activity, I am told it would be unprecedented to incorporate a footnote in this way.</P>
        <P>I will consider the matter between now and Report Stage.  The problem is that <i>ne bis in idem</i> has a Rome Statute meaning.  I am slightly wary of accepting a common law variant of it on the hoof.  It is interesting to note that when we were in law school the word <i>autrefois</i> in the phrases <i>autrefois acquit</i> and <i>autrefois convict</i> was pronounced with a silent &ldquo;s&rdquo;.  However, a book by Glanville Williams states that in England the &ldquo;s&rdquo; is pronounced.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 12:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 24, subsection (1), to delete lines 1 and 2 and substitute the following:</P>
        <P LI="2" FLI="0">&ldquo;31.&mdash;(1) The Minister shall postpone the making of an order under <i>section 30</i> where the period referred to in <i>section 27</i> has not expired, and may, on or following the conclusion of that period, postpone the making of such an order&mdash;&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This section is necessary because a contradiction arises between sections 30 and 27.  Section 27(<i>a</i>) requires a certain timelag, namely, a minimum of 15 days, between the making of a surrender order by a court and the surrender of a person, in addition to any period during which the court&rsquo;s jurisdiction is challenged.  However, section 31(1) states the Minister may postpone the making of an order which would give an authorised person custody over the defendant where the court&rsquo;s jurisdiction is challenged.  If the Minister decided not to postpone the making of an order, section 30(2) would come into play and the authorised person would be entitled to convey the defendant out of the State.  This is inappropriate until such time as the period specified in section 27 has expired.  The relationship between sections 27 and <Col N="1330"/>30 and whether the minimum period still stands should be clear.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Senator implies, paragraph (<i>a</i>) of section 31(1) provides that the Minister can postpone the making of a surrender order until the ICC has determined any challenge to the admissibility of a case or to its jurisdiction.  The proposed amendment will have the effect of altering the wording of the first two lines of section 31(1).  The result would be an explicit reference to the Minister postponing the making of an order for the surrender of a person to the custody of the ICC or a state of enforcement as the case might be where the time period referred to in section 27 had not expired.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>The matter was examined by the Office of Parliamentary Counsel which takes the view that the suggested alternative wording is unnecessary as section 27 already provides for a mandatory time lapse before a person committed under a surrender order made by the High Court will be surrendered.  Under the scheme of the Act, the Minister will make the necessary arrangements for transfer pursuant to an order under section 30.  Any such order is subject to the mandatory time lapse provisions provided in section 27.  The Minister cannot direct that the person be surrendered until the requirements of the part including section 27 have been complied with.  Reflecting on the matter and taking into account the advice of the Parliamentary Counsel, I do not believe the amendment is necessary and I do not propose to accept it.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 13:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 25, subsection (3), between lines 31 and 32, to insert the following:</P><Col N="1331"/>
        <P LI="2" FLI="0">&ldquo;(<i>a</i>) with the consent of the person and of the state of enforcement, that any sentence or balance of a sentence which the person is liable to serve in the State shall be served in the state of enforcement,&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This amendment is designed to avoid a shuttlecock situation whereby a person liable to a sentence in Ireland is surrendered on the basis that following the processing of that person in another country he or she will be returned to Ireland to serve the balance of the sentence.  We suggest that with the consent of the person arrangements could be made to serve all sentences together.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Section 35 applies to a person who is already serving a sentence of imprisonment or detention in the State and is also subject to a surrender order pursuant to a request from the International Criminal Court.  The surrender order may include conditions in respect of the return of the person concerned into the custody of the State following the completion of the ICC proceedings.</P>
        <P>The amendment proposes that if the person and the state of enforcement consent then any sentence, or balance thereof, which the person is liable to serve in the State, will be served in the state of enforcement.  It relates to sentence enforcement issues which are distinct from, and broader than, the relevant provisions of the Rome Statute.  The amendment seeks to combine two discrete areas &mdash; enforcement of ICC sentences and existing arrangements for transfer of sentenced persons, pursuant to the Council of Europe Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons.  The advice given to me is that these two matters should be kept separate.  The objective of the Bill is to ensure that the State and the organs of the State meet their obligations to give effect to the provisions of the Rome Statute.</P>
        <P>The Rome Statute deals specifically with the enforcement of sentences following conviction of persons by the ICC for ICC offences.  It provides, for example, that any such imprisonment will be subject to the supervision of the ICC.  In addition, the ICC may, at any time, decide to transfer a sentenced person to a prison of another state.  The Rome Statute does not address the enforcement of any domestic sentence which a person is liable to serve.  We are mixing two concepts and the concern is that the ICC would have no jurisdiction under its statute to supervise or make arrangements in respect of domestic sentences that someone might be serving.</P>
        <P>If a person serving a sentence here wishes to serve the remainder of the sentence in the person&rsquo;s home state, the person can apply for transfer under the Transfer of Sentenced Persons Acts.  The transfer procedure is entirely voluntary.  However, EU proposals to provide for <Col N="1332"/>involuntary transfer are under consideration.  At the moment Ireland is unconvinced that this would be appropriate.  The sentenced person, the state to which he or she is seeking a transfer and the state where he or she is serving a sentence all must consent to the transfer under the present law.</P>
        <P>The proposed amendment does not address issues such as the level of sentence to be transferred.  For example, the Council of Europe Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons uses two concepts regarding the level of sentence to be transferred.  On the one hand, there may be continued enforcement which means the sentence as originally imposed is transferred.  On the other hand, the sentence may be converted through a judicial or administrative procedure into a decision which substitutes a sanction prescribed by an administering state&rsquo;s own law for the sanction imposed in the sentencing State, which shows that complexities exist.  Whereas I appreciate that the Senator&rsquo;s proposal is intended to avoid shuttlecock situations, my concern and that of the Department is that we do not somehow purport unilaterally to create a situation in which the ICC would end up acting in some sense <i>ultra vires</i> the Rome Statute.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 14:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 28, between lines 10 and 11, to insert the following subsection:</P>
        <P LI="2" FLI="0">&ldquo;(5) Where a freezing order is made, and proceedings are pending in the High Court or another court, in which relief referred to in the definition of &ldquo;realisable property&rdquo; in <i>section 41 </i>is claimed, the High Court shall, on the making of a freezing order under this section, order the discharge of those proceedings and any interim or interlocutory order in the nature of a freezing order made in those proceedings.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">The purpose of this amendment is to avoid many applications for freezing orders related to the same property.  Section 36 already provides that <Col N="1333"/>where a freezing order is made under other legislation an order cannot be made under section 37 of the Bill.  However, the Bill does not deal with cases where an application for a freezing order under the legislation is pending at the time that a freezing order is sought under this Bill.  We suggest that a freezing order in favour of the International Criminal Court should take priority and accordingly, on the making of such a freezing order, any application for a freezing order related to the same property under other legislation should be discharged.  We do not believe it would be right to seek several inconsistent and incompatible applications relating to the same property, only one of which could succeed in practice.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>The amendment proposes to insert a new subsection (5) in section 38.  The existing subsections (4) to (10) of that section provide that the High Court may issue a freezing order prohibiting any person from dealing with the property of the person to whom the request relates, provided that the High Court is satisfied that the ICC has or is likely to impose a fine, forfeiture or reparation order against the person concerned.</P>
        <P>The amendment proposes that when a freezing order is made and proceedings are pending relating to the relief referred to in the definition of realisable property in section 37, the High Court, on the making of the freezing order, must order the discharge of those other proceedings.  It effectively proposes that ICC freezing orders will discharge interim or interlocutory orders made under other enactments.  However, if the ICC does not impose a fine, or make a forfeiture or reparation order against the person concerned at all, then the opportunity is lost for freezing assets for domestic purposes as the other orders will have been discharged.  For example, if the CAB got a freezing order against a person in Ireland and the ICC showed an interest in the same property on the same basis, the effect would be that the CAB&rsquo;s freezing order would be extinguished by the making of an order by the Irish courts.  If the ICC decided not to order a fine or reparation, the CAB would have lost its freezing order and, provided it found out in time, would have to rush into court before the person in question could dispose of the property.</P>
        <P>I accept the general proposition that it is undesirable to have a number of orders in respect of the same property when they are not all capable of being reconciled but this provision could have a negative effect if it simply extinguishes all domestic freezing orders once the ICC mechanism is triggered.  The tidiness intended by the Senator&rsquo;s amendment would come at the expense of the certainty that people would not be able to escape a freezing order simply by reference to an order made by the High Court in favour of the ICC which was later discharged when it was not <Col N="1334"/>possible to intervene immediately to re-establish the first order.  Effectiveness requires that we allow existing domestic orders to continue in respect of the same property.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 15:</P>
        <P LI="1">In page 31, subsection (9), line 38, after &ldquo;order&rdquo; to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="2">&ldquo;which appeared to the High Court to be a sum which might be realised by the person to whom the order is directed&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0">This is an important amendment which concerns the circumstances in which a person may be imprisoned for failure to pay a fine.  There are strong international legal prohibitions against the imprisonment of individuals for the inability to pay monetary sums.  This section is adapted from the provisions in the Criminal Justice Act 1994 with regard to imprisonment for failure to pay confiscation orders made following convictions for drugs trafficking offences.  However, the critical feature of the imprisonment system under that Act is that a confiscation order may only be made for such amounts as the court thinks might be realised, as opposed to the total amount of profit gained from the drug trafficking.  For example, where a person makes a profit of &euro;10,000 from drug trafficking but spends &euro;5,000 on drugs for his or her own use and is left with &euro;5,000 in realisable assets, the Circuit Court can only make a confiscation order for the &euro;5,000 which is capable of being realised.  In other words, under the Criminal Justice Act 1994, a person is not liable to be imprisoned for failure to comply with a confiscation order in circumstances where he or she is unable to comply with the order because he or she has spent or otherwise used the money.  There should therefore be no question under the Criminal Justice Act of imprisonment because of inability to pay.</P>
        <P>However, this safeguard is conspicuous by its absence from section 39.  Under subsection 39(9), the High Court is empowered to order a person to pay the full amount of an ICC order with imprisonment of up to ten years for default.  As this is objectionable in principle and raises concerns with regard to constitutional implications, we propose the insertion of a qualifier so that the amount would have to be an amount which the court considers to be realisable.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The amendment proposes to insert an additional wording in section 40(9). <Col N="1335"/> Subsection (9) already provides that if at any time after the making of the enforcement order it is reported to the High Court that any sum payable under the ICC order remains unpaid, the court may order the imprisonment of the person to whom the ICC order relates.  The amendment proposes that the provision will only apply in cases of sums payable under the ICC order which appear to the High Court to be a sum which might be realised by the person to whom the order is directed.</P>
        <P>I am advised that the amendment is unnecessary.  A court is not going to imprison a person if that person cannot realise his or her assets.  Subsection (10) provides that no order under subsection (9) can be made unless the person to whom the ICC order relates has been given a reasonable opportunity to make representations to the court.  In that context, the person can outline to the court any factors which affect his or her ability to pay in compliance with the ICC order and we believe that the capacity to make submissions to the court necessarily implies that a person who cannot realise the asset cannot be imprisoned or punished for failing to do so.</P>
        <P>Subsection (9) is modelled on section 19(2) of the Criminal Justice Act 1994, which deals with the general enforcement of confiscation orders.  In practice, it has been found that the existing wording is sufficiently flexible and that the issue raised by Senator Tuffy does not warrant an amendment.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>While I accept the points made by the T&aacute;naiste, we do not know for certain that the courts will not make an order in respect of moneys that cannot be realised.  The purpose of our amendment is to provide a protection so that the court will not make such an order.  If that protection is provided for in, for example, the Criminal Justice Act 1994, should it not also form part of this Bill?</P>

	<P>There is a need for the Minister for Transport to sign the railway order for the Kildare route project.  The Minister announced the route in August, which I took to mean that he would sign the order immediately.  A week ago, I enquired at what stage works were because I am anxious that they proceed.  I discovered that Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann was waiting for the order to be signed before starting the significant infrastructure works.</P>
        <P>The Kildare route project will be beneficial to the constituency in which I live, including the area of Lucan and Clondalkin, but will also be of benefit to the country.  It will improve the intercity service, including the Dublin to Cork train.  Those in north Kildare, Lucan, Clondalkin, Heuston Station and beyond will also benefit.  This has been on the table since at least 2000.  As a councillor, I was presented with plans for the project and told the completion date was 2005.  There is no reason why it has not gone ahead in the past nine years the Government has been in power.  The infrastructure exists and must be improved to allow greater capacity for trains and new stations in Lucan, Clondalkin and Parkwest.  This work should not be put off any longer.  The Minister should sign the order.  I hope the Minister of State&rsquo;s reply will confirm that is what he intends to do.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>Go raibh maith agat.  I thank Senator Tuffy for giving me the opportunity to outline the current position on the Kildare route project.</P>
        <P>This major railway investment is critical to the development of a high quality suburban rail system for the greater Dublin area and will deliver benefits for all users of the line including, inner and outer commuter services to Dublin.  It <Col N="1343"/>will also enhance intercity services to Cork, Limerick, Kilkenny and Waterford.</P>
        <P>The project will facilitate dedicated tracks for intercity services and separate tracks for commuter services thereby enhancing capacity, frequency and reliability on all services using the route in and out of Heuston Station.  New stations on the route will also open access to commuter services for more communities, providing a real alternative to the use of the private car within the catchment area.  The project will deliver the capacity to meet projected peak hour increases from 2,000 passengers in 2005 to 5,300 passengers per hour in 2009.  In the longer term, the project is a vital step in linking the Kildare route with the planned interconnector through the city centre and incorporating services into an expanded DART network, integrated with Luas, Metro and bus services.</P>
        <P>On 13 August last, the Minister announced his decision to grant the railway order for the Kildare rail project in line with the recommendations of the inspector to the public inquiry into the project.  On that basis, the draft order has been sent to the Office of the Attorney General for legal drafting.  I understand every effort is being made to expedite this.  When that process is complete, the order will be submitted to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government seeking his consent for the provisions of the order affecting roads and will be signed by the Minister immediately afterwards.</P>
        <P>The railway order will allow Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann to proceed with the land acquisition and construction of new tracks and stations along the route between Hazelhatch and Heuston Station.  Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has in the meantime commenced enabling works and is proceeding with detailed design and procurement with a view to completion of the project in 2009.</P>

	<P>I welcome the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform back to the House and congratulate him on and wish him well in his new position.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>I, too, welcome the Minister back to the House.</P>
        <P>The Minister will be well aware that the family courts are some of the most important in the country and are, quite rightly, held <i>in camera</i>.  He will also be aware that the Law Reform Commission report on the family courts published in 1996 expressed concern about the disadvantages of <i>in camera</i> hearings.  Page 15 of that report reads:</P>
        <P LI="1">In the Consultation Paper, concerns were expressed about some of the consequences of holding family law proceedings behind closed <Col N="1344"/>doors.  It is increasingly recognised that the absence of any opportunities for external scrutiny of family proceedings, even if it does not in fact affect the quality and consistency of judicial behaviour, creates an unhealthy atmosphere in which anecdote, rumour and myth inform the public&rsquo;s understanding of what goes on in the family court.  Comments and submissions on this matter echoed these concerns, but were allied to a strong desire to continue to protect as far as possible the privacy of family members.</P>
        <P FLI="0">While there have been certain changes within the Judiciary in that there is now far more discussion between members of the Judiciary about cases, I do not know how far these can extend into the family courts.  The Law Reform Commission recommendations in regard to the privacy of family proceedings states:</P>
        <P LI="1">Bona fide researchers and students of family law should be permitted to attend family proceedings.  Access by a bona fide researcher to family proceedings should not be refused by a judge except on the basis of compelling and stated reasons.  The attendance of students of family law should be at the discretion of the judge.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">There should be a general principle, applying to all family proceedings, prohibiting the publication of information which tends to identify the parties and members of their families.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">Court staff should be enabled to record more judgments in family cases and thereby make available more transcripts of final reports.</P>
        <P FLI="0">That recommendation provides for a greatly changed scenario.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Some years ago, when the T&aacute;naiste was Attorney General, the Courts Service appointed a young barrister to the family courts to act as an intermediary between it and the general public.  It is particularly important that Members of the Oireachtas have some idea of the complexity and seriousness of what takes place there.  However, I recall that when Attorney General, the T&aacute;naiste decided that <i>in camera</i>  meant <i>in camera</i> and this was reflected in the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004, which allows for the reporting of law court proceedings and for persons approved for search purposes to attend at family law court sittings.</P>
        <P>In early June this year, the Courts Service placed an advertisement in the newspapers inviting proposals for the provision of family law reports, judgments, trends and other statistical information.  It was stated that experience in the area of legal reporting, the collection and analysis of statistical information and its presentation and publication were essential.  It further stated that the Courts Service proposed to commence reporting arrangements on a pilot basis in a selected number of High, Circuit and District Courts. <Col N="1345"/>It appeared from that advertisement that more than one person would be involved.  I would be grateful if the Minister could tell me what progress has been made on this important issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to inform Senators of the progress being made in the area of reporting of general trends in family law cases.  I know from the debate in this House and in the other House during the passage of the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004 that the subject of family law and the <i>in camera </i>rule is of great interest and import to Members of both Houses.</P>
        <P>I readily acknowledge that there is a dearth of information on the reporting of family law cases.  That is why, in the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004, I sought to introduce a system whereby general trends and information relating to family law cases could be reported.  Section 40 of the Act provides for a relaxation with regard to the <i>in camera </i>rule.  Of paramount importance in amending the <i>in camera </i>provision was that the confidential nature of family law cases would continue to be respected.  Many people, based on anecdotal material and rumour, had a black view of the family law court system.  Given that all proceedings were held <i>in camera</i> there was no opportunity for rebuttal or examination as to the<?oasys _jy ?>validity of what was being said against the<?oasys _jy ?>courts.</P>
        <P>However &mdash; I want to stress this point &mdash; some people had a wholly over-ambitious view in regard to the extent to which the rule could be relaxed.  For example, to allow any significant relaxation as to who could attend family law cases in, say, a rural town where a Circuit Court was administering family law would be to tear apart, in effect, the secrecy to which some people are entitled.  The most intimate details of sexuality, psychology, emotions and so on are dealt with by the family law courts.  Some people believe one can allow perfect strangers to attend proceedings so long as they are bound by a degree of secrecy or non-publication.  Were we to provide that, locals from a rural town could attend the proceedings of a case, say, involving two people in court to deal with a difficult matrimonial situation.  In such circumstances, the inhibition to proper disposition of the case would be significant.</P>
        <P>Section 40(3) of the Act will be of particular relevance to Senators.  It provides that nothing in a relevant enactment shall operate to prohibit the preparation of a report of proceedings in family law cases or the publication of the decision of the court in those proceedings.  The report may be prepared by a barrister at law, solicitor or person falling within a class of persons specified in regulations made by the Minister.  The section goes on to state that the identity of the parties to the case <Col N="1346"/>or any child to which the proceedings relate must not be disclosed.  The attendance of any person to report on a case must be in accordance with rules of court.</P>
        <P>Senators will be aware that in 2005 I made regulations under the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004 in which I specified the following classes of persons for the purposes of the section: family mediators who are accredited to the Mediators Institute Ireland, nominated by the Family Support Agency and approved by the Minister; persons engaged in family law research who are nominated by a body specified in the Schedule to the regulations and approved by the Minister; and persons engaged by the Courts Service to prepare court reports of proceedings under relevant enactments.  Under these regulations I have already approved several persons engaged in family law research who were nominated by a body specified in the Schedule to the regulations.  I have not as yet received any reports on this basis but expect I will do so in due course.</P>
        <P>The Courts Service, in the context of its proposals to commence family law reporting arrangements on a pilot basis in a selected number of High Courts, Circuit Courts and District Courts, in July of this year invited proposals from suitable persons for the provision of family law reports, judgments, trends and other statistical information in those courts.  My understanding is that the responses to this invitation have been evaluated and the Courts Service is in contact with the preferred candidate.  The Courts Service hopes to be in a position to appoint the successful candidate in the coming weeks.  As the Senator stated, this is a pilot scheme and the fact that I use the singular person in this context does not mean this position will become permanent.</P>
        <P>While progress has been made towards obtaining better information and data about the operation of the family law courts since the passing of the Act, this will take time.  It occurs to me that it should be possible to produce simple, non-labour intensive statistical abstracts from cases on questions such as: which spouse was awarded custody of the children; what proportion of capital was allocated under a property decision; and what proportion of earnings were allocated.  It should be possible for staff of the court to do simple trends of this kind without having people sitting at the back of the court listening to entire cases to find out this information.  It should be possible, almost on a tick box basis, to create a flow of information out of the family law courts which would be totally anonymous and would tell us that, for example, mothers receive custody in 92% of cases.</P>
        <P>These are interesting statistics and the example I use is based on conjecture; I have no reason to believe this to be the case.  Legislators are entitled to have a picture of what goes on but it is not necessary to have a person separate from the <Col N="1347"/>administration of the courts sit through whole cases to get statistical information of, admittedly, a superficial kind but which would guide us as to what is going on in the courts.</P>
        <P>Reporting of general trends in family law cases must, of necessity, be based on a considerable number of such cases and this will take time.  The progress outlined is evidence of the commitment of the Government and Courts Service on the <i>in camera </i>rule.  The primary and secondary legislation is in place to allow for the relaxation of the <Col N="1348"/><i>in camera </i>rules and it is now a matter of implementing it to the best possible extent.</P>
        <P>As I indicated, simple reporting of cases is one thing but information can also be extracted on a non-report basis.  This information will be, if not as valuable to some form of academic research, of huge importance from the point of view of giving the Houses a picture of what is happening in the family law courts.</P>
