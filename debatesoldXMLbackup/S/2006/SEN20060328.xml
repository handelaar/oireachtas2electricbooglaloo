	<P>I have received notice from Senator Ulick Burke that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P LI="1">The need for the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children to intervene with the Health Service Executive, western area, to appoint a school dentist at Portiuncula Hospital, Ballinasloe, as 24 national schools in the area have been without dental services for the past three months.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Feighan of the following matter:</P>
      <P LI="1">To ask the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children to provide a new health centre in the village of Keadue, Boyle, County Roscommon.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Kenneally of the following matter:</P>
      <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to clarify the problem of recruiting clerical staff to work in Garda stations due to the Civil Service recruitment embargo.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I have also received notice from Senator Bannon of the following matter:</P>
      <P LI="1">The need for the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs to clarify the position with regard to one-off funding for Kenagh Community Centre, County Longford.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment. I have selected those raised by Senators Ulick Burke, Feighan and Kenneally and they will be taken at the conclusion of business. Senator Bannon may give notice on another day of the matter he wishes to raise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">In a reference to drug bosses in Dublin a few months ago, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform spoke about &ldquo;the last sting of a dying wasp&rdquo;. There are clearly many wasps around the place, given the events on the M50 over the weekend. Can the Minister come into this House some time in the next two weeks to set out his position on the issue of increasing drug-related crime in Dublin? Automatic weapons were used on the M50 last weekend in Dublin, where one gang was pitted against another and innocent bystanders could easily have been shot dead as a result of the gangs&rsquo; actions. A promise was made to introduce a new offence on gangland membership and membership of such gangs was to be prohibited by law. That promise was made more than a year ago, but we have not yet seen an amendment made to the Criminal Justice Act 2004.</P>
      <P>The Government needs to make its position clear on this area. We are dealing with a new type of criminal who is young, amoral, thuggish and vicious and who would shoot people as quick as he would look at them. People in this city are genuinely concerned about their safety. Innocent people, such as the woman in north Dublin a few weeks ago, will be caught up in the gunfire. The Government needs to reply to such concerns.</P>
      <P>No. 24, motion 23, on the Order Paper was mooted by Senator Norris and it concerns Mrs. O&rsquo;Keeffe from Cork, who unsuccessfully took an action in court last week regarding child sex abuse in a school. Schools were outside the remit of the Residential Institutions Redress Board when it was established, but the State has an obligation to pay the costs of her case. This is a test case and it has given a degree of certainty to the law in this area. Mrs. O&rsquo;Keeffe is to be congratulated for the brave stance she has taken and for her courage in bringing this case. She should not be pursued for costs in this matter. I ask that the Government act immediately to ensure that costs for this case are borne in full by the State so that <Col N="239"/>the legal certainty that has arisen in this judgment might apply to other victims too.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>As we go about our business in Ireland, it is worth looking at the rest of Europe. Over the last year we have seen strikes in Italy, Belgium, France and Germany. Today, France and the UK are shut down entirely, with rail travel, education, and health care affected. We may ask ourselves why that is not happening in Ireland. That there is not such disruption here and that we have recently had fewer days of public service strikes than any other country in western Europe can be ascribed to what the previous Minister for Finance, former Deputy McCreevy, described to me in private conversation as &ldquo;the grand prize&rdquo;. We delivered something through a formula that boils down to two expressions, &ldquo;social partnership&rdquo; and &ldquo;benchmarking&rdquo;. The next person who stands up to ask whether it was worth it and whether we gave away too much should remember that is the prize that we have delivered.</P>
      <P>On another issue that I would like us to examine, we have regularly discussed the Lisbon Agenda. The Heads of Government are meeting this week to discuss economic and other reform in Europe and progress on the agenda. The reality is outlined very well in this week&rsquo;s Charlemagne column in <i>The Economist</i>. It states that we need what has been achieved in Finland, which is now a model for reform in the area. &ldquo;TEACHERS, teachers, teachers&rdquo; is the subtitle. It goes on to state that we can do it without examinations, a national curriculum, or testing. All we need is good teachers with the responsibility and freedom to get on with their work. To get good teachers, we must simply allow them professional responsibility and pay them well.</P>
      <P>A good start has been made within the last hour in the announcement of the establishment of the Teaching Council, a move forward. Let us keep such matters to the forefront of our minds when considering discussions in Government Buildings on public service pay, benchmarking, the cost of teachers and so on. We are the beneficiaries. Senator Ormonde and I particularly welcomed aspects of the report on third level education published by the OECD within the last year, especially since it finally accorded freedom to the institutes of technology by giving them annual grants through the Higher Education Authority. We bemoaned the fact that they had no access to doctorates, but that is now being addressed under the Government plan in the budget.</P>
      <P>We must carefully consider how we can move matters forward positively. The only danger would be if we did not have a properly paid public service or failed to deal with the issues causing problems in France or affecting lower-paid migrant workers. There are issues to address, and the prize is as good now as last time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>I join with Senator Brian Hayes in raising the shoot-out on the M50 and N4 near Lucan, which is in my constituency. I am seriously concerned at the incident. Last night I attended a public meeting at which I was approached by a constituent who told me that she feared for the future, wondering what kind of place it would be to raise children. That is the feeling on the ground; people are afraid. Matters seem to have spiralled out of control very quickly.</P>
      <P>The shooting only stopped when the car being pursued pulled in to the Texaco garage at the N4 in Lucan. Even at that time of the day, there would have been people in the vicinity, since it is a very busy garage. Innocent bystanders might have been shot. People in their beds in neighbouring estates would have heard the shooting. I have read newspaper reports, and the information emerging is surreal. A person was shot a few weeks ago, and those involved, who were very young, wore bullet-proof vests. A certain individual seemed to have amassed great wealth at an early age, but we do not know how. There is a problem and I would like the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to come to the House and, instead of going on the defensive and trying to prove this, that and the other with statistics, to outline what he will do to solve it. Will he demonstrate leadership because strong leadership is needed in the face of this problem? We need to know what policing measures will be introduced to tackle gang warfare and the drugs issue, which has been allowed to go out of control by the Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomMorrissey"><NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
	<P>More than 100,000 people, the majority of whom are young, are on a waiting list for the driving test. A number of them have been on the list for more than 12 months. The Minister for Transport has tried to implement a scheme over the past 12 months, which would have involved outsourcing driver testing, to reduce the backlog. However, two weeks ago, the Civil Service arbitrator shot it out of the water and turned it down on the basis that an article in Sustaining Progress prevents the outsourcing of core business. Senator O&rsquo;Toole stated the grand prize was delivered but, in return, reform and delivery of service should be provided. I would like a debate on Sustaining Progress. The article in Sustaining Progress has hampered all Departments and it has implications for them in the delivery of services. It should, therefore, be debated. I would also like the Minister for Transport to come to the House to outline how he proposes to deal with the waiting list over the next 12 months. The backlog is not entirely of his own making but he has been hampered over the past 12 months in his attempts to resolve this issue, which is costing young people thousands of euro in premia they should not have to pay. I seek debates on Sustaining Progress, which has hampered the Govern<Col N="241"/>ment, and on how the issue of driver testing should be resolved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>I seek permission to move First Stage of the Housing (Stage Payments) Bill 2004, which is designed to eliminate the practice of consumers being forced to make stage payments on houses on housing estates. This is a blatant anti-consumer measure and the Bill is intended to eliminate such payments and make savings for consumers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde"><NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s comments. The Lisbon Agenda will be discussed later this week and we must focus on our teachers to achieve a knowledge-based economy. If teachers are not given the freedom to administer their responsibilities, it will not matter what kind of education system we have because it will not work. I welcome a debate on this issue.</P>
      <P>The Higher Education Authority has taken over the funding of all third level institutions. A debate on how it will administer funds to institutes of technology and how benchmarking will be rated would be worthwhile. This is a significant responsibility and I welcome the concept of putting the funding of all institutions under the one roof but this issue needs to be teased out so that postgraduate courses and doctorates provided by the institutes of technology can also be funded. I would like to ascertain how funding will be allocated and benchmarked, as it is worthy of a debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Brian Hayes for raising No. 23 on the Order Paper regarding the child abuse victim from Cork. I am pleased that both Fine Gael and Labour Party Members signed the motion but, on the basis of my contacts with Fianna F&aacute;il and Progressive Democrats Members, everybody feels the same way, whether they are at liberty immediately to put their names to the motion. The woman was a victim and she took an important case very courageously. She illustrated a principle in law, which will be helpful. Normally one does not go after people in those circumstances and mulct them in damages or legal costs. This woman has two small children. We hear a great deal about cherishing all the children of the nation equally and it would be awful if a decent woman found her home was sold over her head. I hope the Leader will have something positive to contribute in this regard.</P>
      <P>I welcome the fact the European Commission appears to be about to act on roaming phone charges. It is iniquitous that people who answer calls when they are abroad are charged. This is wrong and I hope the Government will follow up on it.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senators Brian Hayes and Tuffy that the shooting on the M50 is an appalling business. It is apparent these people were expecting it because they were wearing bullet-proof vests. The driver had just been released from hospital <Col N="242"/>after a previous shooting. The situation is getting like that in Chicago in the 1920s. I remember as a child going to see films such as &ldquo;The Rise and Fall of Legs Diamond&rdquo; and the &ldquo;The St. Valentine&rsquo;s Day Massacre&rdquo; and because they were in black and white and the bloodshed was all cosmetic, we found them great entertainment. Now, Chicago would be a safer place than Dublin. The kind of activity seen in those films has taken root here. I would support whatever measures are necessary to curtail this horrendous activity.</P>
      <P>I mentioned the idea of cherishing all children of the nation equally. A phone call came to my office a few days ago from an elderly lady who would not give her name or telephone number because her husband would be upset and ashamed if he knew attention was brought to the matter. This woman wanted the Oireachtas to be aware that people like her and husband who live on very low incomes &mdash; all she had was the non-contributory pension &mdash; are very glad that the cold weather spell seems to be over because they had such difficulty in keeping themselves warm. We need to realise that elderly people who live on minimal State support are in difficulty. We used to have a fuel supplement or subsidy and I wonder if it still exists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid=""><NameTxt>Senators</NameTxt>
	<P>It is still there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>That information should be made known as widely as possible. Sometimes people are ashamed to take up such subsidies because they think they are getting something for nothing. They are not. We should encourage all elderly people with this difficulty to take what is their due in terms of allowances and fuel vouchers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Leader provide time in the near future for a debate with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, to discuss the implementation of section 15 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Bill 2004, which enables the establishment of a Garda reserve force? The Minister is committed to this measure. However, it would be a grave mistake to allow such a significant change in the way our police force is staffed to pass without considerable reflection &mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>He is going to speak about it tonight, is he not?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>This House is the perfect forum for such a reasoned debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFeighan"><NameTxt>Mr. Feighan</NameTxt>
	<P>Did the Senator vote against it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>The right to disagree or agree is fundamental in a properly functioning democracy. We in Fianna F&aacute;il are a Government party and although we may only be the bread in the sandwich, we are 90% of the sandwich.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>We may not be the sweet meat, but we are the Government. The reason I am making this point is &mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Because there is an election coming. We all know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will find this sandwich difficult to consume at the next election, as will many members of the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senators Brian Hayes and Tuffy and others in their call for action on street crime, particularly following the incident on the M50 over the weekend. Although we give out about crime constantly, we have become complacent. It is as if we take it for granted but the time for talking is over.</P>
      <P>We need to see action taken against these armed criminals who now go about their business prepared for conflict, wearing bullet-proof vests in case they come up against one of their enemies and are shot at. We cannot stand for this any longer and need to see action from the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. He must come to the House to outline the measures or rather the action he is going to take. We do not need any more measures. We want to see action that will give the streets back to the ordinary people of the country so that they can go about their business in the knowledge that it is safe to do so.</P>
      <P>Senator Norris made a very good point about older people and keeping warm. Older people get a fuel allowance but it is insufficient. The allowance is only paid from the end of September to the middle of April but nights can be cold for longer than that period. It can be cold at night in May as well as October and it has been particularly cold this month. While the fuel allowance has improved, it still does not fully address the needs of older people. I urge the Minister for Social and Family Affairs to consider increasing the allowance in the next budget. People are still cold, as Senator Norris has pointed out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrMauriceHayes"><NameTxt>Dr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not sure whether Senator Leyden was telling us that he was the ham in the sandwich.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy McDowell is the ham.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrMauriceHayes"><NameTxt>Dr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I disagree profoundly with him, but in a civilised way, on the question of the Garda reserve force. I ask the Leader to ask the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government what steps he is taking to safeguard the site of the Battle of the Boyne, which is a matter of considerable interest to many people in Northern Ireland. It is an important element in North-South relations and a significant part of our heritage that should be protected. <Col N="244"/>If sensible planning steps are taken in time, we may be able to avoid the sort of dispute that arose over Tara and the M3. Problems can be foreseen.</P>
      <P>I support Senator O&rsquo;Toole on the question of teachers. The best steps we could take for teachers are to reduce class sizes and give them as much support as we possibly can. I am not keen on the idea of giving them <i>carte blanche </i>because we are finding difficulties with other professions but we should be able to ensure that good teachers are rewarded for staying in the profession. We should ask ourselves why people do not want to take up headships in schools. It may be that the Teaching Council can find ways to civilianise many administrative chores and the same applies to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>I am sure I am not the only member of the Seanad who wishes to congratulate the Minister for Transport on securing Mr. Gay Byrne as chairman of the new statutory road safety authority. Senator Morrissey will be glad to know that the issue of unaccompanied learner drivers is one of the first he intends to address. I support Senator Morrissey&rsquo;s call for a debate on road safety, which should also address the issue of over-tiredness and people falling asleep at the wheel as a major cause of accidents. I was astonished to find that the civilian drivers of Ministers of State work on a week-on, week-off basis. They drive between 90 and 120 hours per week, which does not seem safe. It is an area I wish to see addressed when the Minister comes to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Ms White</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the appointment of Mr. Gay Byrne as chairman of the road safety authority. Mr. Byrne is an icon in society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>We will not have a debate on that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Ms White</NameTxt>

	<P>That is the Government&rsquo;s job.</P>

	<P>Mr. Gay Byrne is 72 years of age.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator White, we cannot discuss this in the House. I would prefer if the Senator addressed the Order of Business. I always dread when names of non-Members are mentioned in the House. A discussion may take place on an individual in which that individual may find some remark offensive. I know Senator White would not be offensive but other Senators might be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>To whom it concerns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryMWhite"><NameTxt>Ms White</NameTxt>
	<P>I call for a debate on the issue of aging and ageism, with particular reference to the mandatory retirement age of 65 years. The indi<Col N="245"/>vidual, whose name I will not repeat will, at 72 years of age, bring tremendous experience to chairing the Road Safety Authority. I support the comments made by Senator Norris on pensions. In my research on ageism and aging, I noted from a report from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, OECD, that 27% of Irish people over 65 years of age live on a wage below the poverty line. The OECD report considers living on a weekly earning below &euro;185 as poverty. Our non-contributory pension, to which Senator Norris referred, is &euro;182 per week. Some 120,000 people over 65 years of age are, according to the OECD, living in poverty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFeighan"><NameTxt>Mr. Feighan</NameTxt>
	<P>I join in the condemnation of the recent gangland outrage. It was a miracle that no one was killed. What can be done about these drive-by shootings? Mike Tyson and his entourage must have felt at home. It is no wonder he escaped to the west. Young men, with automatic machine guns and bulletproof vests are trying to murder one another. I appreciate Garda resources are available but not enough is being done about these gangland activities. An article in today&rsquo;s <i>Irish Independent</i> pointed out that those who take cocaine are indirectly fuelling these gangland murders. We must ensure the sale of cocaine is stopped.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>Last night at 6 p.m. I listened to an interview on the radio about the Morris tribunal. The language in the radio interview was distasteful and wrong for 6 p.m. Words were used that I will not repeat in the Chamber. On the other hand, the newspapers dealt with the subject matter in a more tasteful manner by using the phrase &ldquo;the husband was having an affair&rdquo;. The Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources should highlight with radio programmers the use of such unnecessary language at that time in the evening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>I endorse Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s comments on social partnership and would be very glad to debate it at any time. If one governs by decree and does not go before Parliament, one cannot be surprised if national strikes and industrial chaos ensue.</P>
      <P>The question of driver-testers has been lamentably a long-standing problem that did not arise just last year. I am not a fan of the outsourcing of road, rail, air or any other safety agencies. Given that people who want a test have to pay a significant level of fees, which I imagine more or less covers the cost of administering and conducting the test, I cannot see why the appropriate number of people cannot be recruited. Perhaps a semi-State agency could be established for that purpose but I do not necessarily see much merit in outsourcing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>On occasions in the past, Senator Ross has spoken about the need for this House and the Lower House to debate social partner<Col N="246"/>ship before such decisions are made. The example that Senator Morrissey has provided shows exactly what we should be doing. If the solution to coping with the large number of people who are not able to sit driving tests is outsourcing but it was determined not to go through with it at the negotiations on Sustaining Progress, that situation would benefit from a debate both here and in the Lower House. That is one area which concerns road safety.</P>
      <P>The selection of the new chairman of the road safety authority was an inspired choice. The new chairman has said he will be the first to step aside if he does not get the required Government action. That is not unlike what happened with the chairman of the National Safety Council who criticised the lack of action that was taking place at Government level. His contract was not renewed or perhaps the council does not exist any more for that reason. The threat by the new chairman of the RSA will create an impetus for the Government to take the necessary action.</P>
      <P>The question of cocaine was also raised. I am told that while it is illegal to sell cocaine in a public house, I doubt if it is illegal to snort &mdash; I think that is the correct word &mdash; cocaine. Therefore, many public houses and other places, including well established restaurants and hotels, are being used for the consumption of cocaine. I gather there is a doubt over whether such behaviour is illegal. It is illegal to sell it but not necessarily for premises to be used for that purpose. That may be one of the reasons we are having gangland shootings and killings, such as occurred last weekend.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree with Senators Morrissey, Quinn and others who have called for a debate on social partnership. I also want to raise the issue of the over 130,000 people who are awaiting driving tests, to whom Senator Morrissey referred. I agree wholeheartedly with him. I am not pushed one way or the other as to whether the solution to the problem is outsourcing or taking on more people within the Department on short-term contracts. Something needs to be done by the Government, however, to ensure the backlog is cleared. The Minister for Transport should take some positive action in that regard as soon as he possibly can.</P>
      <P>I also wish to raise another social partnership matter with the Leader of the House, indeed perhaps we should have a debate on social partnership with the Minister for Finance. Community employment schemes are constantly raised in the House and an issue of continuing concern is the cap that exists for people over 50 years of age who must retire from such schemes after three years. That cap should be removed as part of the current negotiations on social partnership. In that way, the vital service many such people provide in various voluntary associations around the country will be allowed to continue. There are not many job opportunities for people over 50, <Col N="247"/>particularly in rural areas. Therefore, the cap should be lifted as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>I agree with my colleagues who have raised recent incidents of gangland crime in Dublin. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform should attend the House to discuss his responsibilities, instead of having a go at Opposition spokespersons for doing their various jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>We have an ideal opportunity to ask the Minister for Transport to attend the House to inform us why he has appointed the new chairman of the road safety authority. It would be wrong if we were not allowed to debate an appointment of such extraordinary importance. I do not share the otherwise unanimous view of this House that it should be welcomed without question. It is an ideal opportunity for the House to show its worth by asking questions of the Minister about why Mr. Byrne was appointed and what qualifications he has.</P>
      <P>I take on board what Senator White stated and agree that we could also have a debate on ageism. If those to whom problems are addressed, in this case the young people who are the main culprits and offenders in road accidents, do not identify with the people appointed to administer and regulate those problems, we may have made a wrong appointment.</P>
      <P>Anyone reading three of this morning&rsquo;s newspapers will see a photograph on the front pages of the Minister for Transport and Mr. Gay Byrne. Certain people get a great political advantage for a day in making appointments of high-profile people who are charismatic on television. However, it may not necessarily be more than a gimmick in terms of the good of the nation. We should seriously debate the matter. It is an extremely serious problem.</P>
      <P>As the Leader will ask the Minister to come to the House to explain the appointment, she should take the opportunity to also ask him to debate the issue of Aer Lingus with us.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceCummins"><NameTxt>Mr. Cummins</NameTxt>
	<P>When is it intended to introduce the new gaming and lottery Bill, which has been on the Government&rsquo;s legislative programme for the past three years? While an interdepartmental report was made in 2000, no action has been taken and it does not appear to be coming before either House of the Oireachtas. What is the reason for the delay and when will it come before this House? Private member card clubs are being established throughout the country. These clubs gradually develop into casinos. The Minister indicated there is a loophole in the law which he <Col N="248"/>intends to plug soon. When does he intend to introduce legislation to address this problem?</P>
      <P>On the road safety issue, last year I highlighted the fact that Garda cars are not subject to NCT tests as is every other car. This endangers the lives of members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the public. When will this situation be addressed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Mr. Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I share in the call for a debate on ageism. It is entirely appropriate that the Seanad debate this in light of the fact that the word &ldquo;senate&rdquo; comes from the Latin word &ldquo;senex&rdquo;, which means old man. The association is immediately made with wisdom and it is true that wisdom comes with old age. Ageism exists in this country and I believe every Senator has received representation from a person in their fifties seeking a job who finds it extremely difficult at a time of full employment. I look forward to that debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonLydon"><NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
	<P>I also support the calls for a debate on ageism. I am sure we recall that when former US President Ronald Reagan was at the age mentioned by another Senator, namely 72, he went to the country and received the largest youth vote ever. I am sure all Senators read <i>De Senectute</i> in their schooldays and know the value of the wisdom which comes with old age, particularly for Senators.</P>

	<P>To whom is Senator Lydon directing his final remark?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Brian Hayes remembered the words of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, some time ago, about a particular murder being the &ldquo;last sting of a dying wasp&rdquo;. The Senator referred to the spiralling drug problems, gang warfare, and gangland membership which the Minister has promised will be covered in the criminal justice Bill.</P>
      <P>He also raised the matter of Louise O&rsquo;Keeffe from Cork. I will reply to this question when responding to Senator Norris because he and the Independent Senators tabled the motion. Senator Brian Hayes, however, is right to associate himself with this motion.</P>
      <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole talked about the mayhem in France and the United Kingdom today saying that they do not have social partnership and benchmarking as we do. He also mentioned the Lisbon Agenda and Finland. He spoke about what the teaching council will mean for teachers. I recall the President of the ASTI when I was teaching pushed that agenda hard.</P>
      <P>Senator Tuffy spoke about the shoot-out on the M50. I too hear people say that physically and mentally they fear for their lives. It is horrifying to hear it casually said that the people involved were wearing bullet-proof vests, as if we put them on every morning, as a fact of life. The Senator asked that the Minister show leadership on the matter.</P><Col N="249"/>
      <P>Senator Morrissey referred to the outsourcing of driving tests, quoting Senator O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s term, saying that although we have achieved the &ldquo;grand prize&rdquo;, it has not delivered on this matter because a Civil Service executive has deemed that it cannot be outsourced. He also asked for a debate on Sustaining Progress. I remind the House that we had a debate on Sustaining Progress some time in February so I am not sure we could have another one. We can, however, try, when more people have examined the document. Maybe some people did not speak during that debate. The Senator may well have delivered himself brilliantly but I cannot recall.</P>
      <P>Senator Coghlan sought permission to move First Stage of his Bill. A Chathaoirligh, is it up to me to accept this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

	<P>Can I accept a formal amendment if the Senator so moves or is that up to the Cathaoirleach?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>No, it is not up to me. The matter will be dealt with on another occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Cathaoirleach find out when that might be? I approve of what Senator Coghlan has done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

	<P>Senator Ormonde wants a debate on the Lisbon Agenda, particularly on how the money will be allocated by the Higher Education Authority, which has undertaken to fund all third level institutions, including the institutes of technology, particularly in respect of benchmarking</P>
      <P>Senator Norris mentioned Louise O&rsquo;Keeffe from Cork. Ms O&rsquo;Keeffe has contacted me several times, as no doubt she has contacted other Senators. When I called the Taoiseach&rsquo;s office his adviser told me that Ms O&rsquo;Keeffe wanted to persuade the Minister for Education and Science, and the State Claims Agency to waive their rights to collect these costs. I understand that neither the Department nor the State Claims Agency will move to collect their costs to date.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>That is helpful but I was told to say clearly that this refers to the costs to date.</P>
      <P>Senator Norris also spoke about roaming telephone charges, and compared the M50 shoot-out to events in Chicago in the 1920s. He said that the cold spell which lasted longer than normal affected elderly people. This could return. Somebody else also said we should have an enhanced fuel allowance.</P><Col N="250"/>
      <P>Senator Leyden wants a debate on section 15 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Bill. I fully agree that, although we are all enthusiastic about the principle, we should debate this issue.</P>
      <P>It is not enough to hear it shouted at us that the electorate will deal harshly with those who do not want the reserve force. We want it but we want to know the terms, conditions and all the details. It is not enough to present it on a plate &mdash; be it a sandwich or otherwise &mdash; and say &ldquo;that is it, take it&rdquo;. I am in favour of the principle of the reserve force but we want to know the details and have the right to hear them. Senator Leyden has done a service by raising the matter and I will find out if the Minister will discuss it and also address the crime problem. He is fond of talking and is good at it. Just because the decision on the reserve force is to be made by the Government does not mean we cannot discuss it. I never heard anything so puerile. We need to discuss it.</P>
      <P>Incidentally, the Cathaoirleach in his exalted position would not of course be attending public meetings, but people are certainly asking questions and seeking answers. We look foolish when we do not have any details and people want to know why we do not have them. If the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform attended the House we would get those details.</P>
      <P>Senator Terry spoke of crime on our streets, which we take for granted. I find it chilling that people can drive by in cars and fire seven shots on each side, and it is just another statistic. Senator Terry also suggested the Minister for Social and Family Affairs might consider increasing the fuel allowance.</P>
      <P>Senator Maurice Hayes asked what steps were being take to safeguard the site of the Battle of the Boyne and supported Senator O&rsquo;Toole in regard to rewarding good teachers. Senator Henry congratulated Gay Byrne on his appointment. She noted that there are almost 0.5 million drivers on the roads who have not been deemed fit to drive by means of a test. Mr. Byrne said this was one of the issues he wanted to tackle. Senator White noted that Mr. Byrne has tremendous experience, which he has, and called for a debate on the driver testing issue. She also quoted OECD statistics on poverty, and asked for a debate on ageism.</P>
      <P>Senator Feighan spoke of the drive-by shootings and the sale of cocaine. He has been one of the consistent voices in the House on drug use. He also objected to the coarse language used on the 6 p.m. radio news item on the Morris tribunal. I heard the programme and I suppose it was relaying what was actually said. Maybe one should just close one&rsquo;s ears but I presume the report was factually correct and was not an enhanced take on events.</P>
      <P>Senator Mansergh supported Senator O&rsquo;Toole and noted that government by diktat is never very successful. Speaking of driver testing, he said that generally speaking, outsourcing of many Government functions is not a good idea.</P><Col N="251"/>
      <P>Senator Quinn said Gay Byrne was an inspired choice for the chairmanship of the road safety authority. He also asked if it were not a legal anomaly that it is illegal to sell cocaine but not to snort it. Senator John Paul Phelan spoke about the driving test backlog and gangland crime, and said the cap on community employment scheme involvement should be removed. Senator Ross called for a debate on road safety and questioned Gay Byrne&rsquo;s appointment, saying that people in such positions should be able to engage with young people. Gay Byrne could engage with anyone &mdash; he is that kind of person, which is one of his strong points. I do not agree with Senator Ross that Mr. Byrne&rsquo;s appointment was a gimmick. The Senator also asked for a debate on Aer Lingus.</P>
      <P>Senator Cummins asked when the gaming and lotteries Bill will be published. I hope to know tomorrow. Senator Cummins also spoke of private members&rsquo; card clubs developing into casinos. As he is aware, there is a loophole in the relevant law, and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has said he wishes to plug it. Senator Cummins also pointed out that Garda cars are not subject to the NCT. With regard to the Garda car involved in a fatal accident, the question of its roadworthiness is a moot point. There were diverse opinions as to whether the tyre treads on the Garda car were worn.</P>
      <P>Senator Hanafin called for a debate on ageism and I agree with him that wisdom comes with age. Senator Lydon called for a debate on ageism and referred to former President Reagan&rsquo;s achievements. The Senator also referred to the wisdom accruing to older Senators.</P>

    <Title>Finance Bill 2006 <?oasys _cf1- ?>[<?oasys _cf2- ?>Certified Money Bill<?oasys _cf1- ?>]<?oasys _cf3- ?>: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Finance Bill contains the legislative proposals to implement the tax changes I announced in the budget last December. This year, in addition to the significant improvements in tax credits, allowances and bands, the changes I am bringing forward include a significant measure of reform of the taxation system. A large part of this reform is based on the review of tax schemes I had carried out over the past year. The relevant extensive reports on this were published last month.</P>
      <P>This Bill continues and builds on the successful policies of recent years that have delivered a personal tax environment that fosters and supports effort and enterprise. For those on average pay, these policies have delivered one of the lowest tax wedges in the OECD, as well as taking many taxpayers out of the tax net altogether. The provisions of the Bill will also ensure that, from 2007, <Col N="252"/>the small number of high income individuals who up to now have been able to reduce or eliminate their tax liability through the use of tax incentives and reliefs will generally have an average tax rate of about 20% each year. On foot of the Bill, therefore, a higher percentage of the tax take will be paid by high earners; a lesser percentage is being paid by lower earners; the tax changes being implemented favour low income groups; and there are new limits on the use of tax reliefs by the very well off.</P>
      <P>I believe this year&rsquo;s Finance Bill will bring about real change and reform of our tax system. The budget on which it is based has been described by the Economic and Social Research Institute as &ldquo;perhaps the most progressive budget package for many years &mdash; poorer households did proportionately better than rich ones&rdquo;. The reforms in the area of tax incentives, pensions tax arrangements, the tax liabilities of high earners and the measures to close off potential tax loopholes are evidence of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to a tax system that is fair and equitable and that underpins the country&rsquo;s continued economic and social progress.</P>
      <P>Before outlining the main provisions in the Bill in a moment I wish to highlight for the House the main measures it contains. The Bill proposes the following: to remove all of those on the minimum wage from the tax net; exclude workers on the average industrial wage from the higher tax rate; confirm the restrictions on the use of tax reliefs by high income taxpayers to secure greater equity in the tax system; phase out various existing tax schemes and exemptions and amend other schemes to secure better value for the Exchequer; end the current unfair remittance basis of taxation; continue the stamp duty exemption for young trained farmers for a further three years; increase the tax exemption limits for income from farm leasing for over five years; and extend certain existing reliefs to cover the EU single farm payment entitlement in appropriate circumstances.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The Bill also proposes to introduce a new scheme of tax relief for heritage property donated to the proposed Irish Heritage Trust; provide for the &euro;10,000 income tax disregard for certain persons minding children in their own home as announced in the budget; prevent the use of certain pension investments to cut one&rsquo;s tax bill enormously; increase VAT registration thresholds to help small business; and exempt biofuels from excise duties and reduce excise duties on certain home heating oils, namely, kerosene and LPG. These measures were all announced in the budget. </P>
      
      <P Just="Left">In addition to these, the Bill proposes to introduce a new initiative aimed at encouraging low income earners who hold SSIA accounts to transfer funds into pension schemes; provide significant improvements in the film tax relief aimed at enhancing Ireland&rsquo;s competitive position as a film location; provide for automatic reporting by <Col N="253"/>financial institutions and Departments of interest and certain other payments made to taxpayers; get more notice and information on certain tax avoidance schemes; ensure that landlords will have to meet their statutory registration requirements as a condition of getting generous tax relief; tighten up the relevant contracts tax to combat fraud and tax evasion; include a range of provisions to facilitate business in maintaining lreland&rsquo;s competitiveness; and close off a series of abusive tax loopholes in the areas of film leasing, transfer of Irish assets into a foreign company, potential misuse on interest relief, capital gains tax and certain corporate VAT reliefs.</P>
      <P>I will now deal with some of the main provisions in the Bill in more detail. I will listen carefully to the contributions of Senators and try to respond to the points they make when I reply to the debate.</P>
      <P>On income tax, the various income tax measures and reliefs announced in the budget are dealt with in sections 2 to 7. These widen the tax bands and increase various credits, including the basic personal credit and employee tax credit. The effect will be a reduction in average tax rates and the removal of those on the current minimum wage from the tax net.</P>
      <P>Section 8 revises the tax relief provisions in respect of local authority waste charges to maintain the value of the relief for taxpayers following the introduction of the pay by use principle. The existing provisions governing the relief require adjustment to take account of the revised charges structure at local level. Section 9 confirms the budget day announcement and Financial Resolution abolishing the loophole whereby relief could be claimed for interest on loans taken out for property speculation with effect from 7 December 2005.</P>
      <P>Section 11 links mortgage interest relief on rental properties to the registration requirements of the Private Residential Tenancies Board so as to encourage compliance with the registration requirement. Section 13 confirms the budget day announcement of a childminding relief for individuals minding up to three children in their own home provided the income in question does not exceed &euro;10,000 in the tax year.</P>
      <P>Section 14 contains a number of important changes to the tax treatment of pension provision. First, the rate of age-based tax relief applying to all pension products is being increased where the contributor was 55 years or over at any time during the tax year to 35% of net earnings or remuneration for those aged 55 and over and to 40% for those aged 60 and over. This is aimed at incentivising individuals who have underfunded their pension over the years and now wish to improve their position as they approach retirement. The overall benefit limit of two thirds final salary will still apply.</P>
      <P>Second, an annual taxable 3% imputed distribution is being applied to the value of assets in approved retirement funds. This will be phased in <Col N="254"/>over a number of years. Third, the maximum tax free lump sum for draw-downs from a pension fund made on or after 7 December 2005 will be &euro;1.25 million. Fourth, a cap is placed on the maximum allowable pension fund on retirement for tax purposes at &euro;5 million or, if higher, the value of the fund on 7 December 2005. Finally, the current annual earnings limit of &euro;254,000 for certain contributions to pension schemes is to be indexed from the tax year 2007 to maintain its value in the future, as will the &euro;5 million and &euro;1.25 million amounts just mentioned.</P>
      <P>Section 15 provides for the discontinuance of the remittance basis of taxation with effect from 1 January 2006 in respect of employment income in so far as the employment is exercised in the State. This will ensure that all employees are treated alike in respect of income earned in the State. Section 16 contains a number of provisions which are designed to ensure that tax that should be deducted under the PAYE system is in fact deducted. These provisions deal with the use of intermediaries and non-resident employers, situations where foreign and domestic employment are involved, and the position of mobile workers. Sections 15 and 16 reflect the changed profile of the labour market here as a result of significant and welcome immigration.</P>
      <P>Section 17 provides for the measure announced in the budget which will place a limit on the use of tax reliefs by those on high incomes. The measure will ensure that such taxpayers will not be able to use specified tax reliefs to reduce their tax bill in any year below approximately 20%. A full list of the reliefs which are covered is included in the Bill. Broadly, these are the various property based reliefs and other incentive reliefs such as film relief, the business expansion scheme and donations. However, the normal expenses of business, including standard depreciation allowances and losses, will still be allowed in the normal way.</P>
      <P>Section 18 provides for a major improvement in the relief for investment in film production. The percentage of expenditure that is eligible for tax relief is being raised to 80% for all films, up from the existing levels of 55% or 66% depending on the film budget. In addition, the ceiling on qualifying expenditure for any one film is being increased from &euro;15 million to &euro;35 million. These changes are subject, as before, to EU Commission approval.</P>
      <P>Section 19 increases the annual cap on the amount that can be claimed for expenditure on farm pollution control measures to the lesser of &euro;50,000 or 50% of qualifying expenditure, with effect from 1 January 2006. Section 20 extends the scheme of tax relief for donations to approved bodies to include the donation of publicly quoted securities, which will be treated in much the same way as cash donations of equivalent value.</P>
      <P>In line with my Budget Statement, section 22 abolishes the stallion and greyhound tax exemptions from 31 July 2008. Discussions are to take <Col N="255"/>place with the industry and the EU Commission on a replacement scheme.</P>
      <P>Section 23 includes the proposed Irish Heritage Trust in the list of approved bodies for the purpose of the tax relief on donations scheme. This will facilitate the trust in building up an endowment fund for the maintenance of its heritage properties. Three other provisions relating to the trust are contained in sections 73, 115 and 122, to which I will turn in due course.</P>
      <P>Section 24 amends section 817 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 and is designed to counter certain tax avoidance schemes that involve shareholders taking money out of companies as capital receipts rather than income in order that they can benefit from the lower 20% capital gains tax rate. This change to section 817 will reinforce the original provisions in the light of more recent versions of these avoidance schemes.</P>
      <P>Sections 25 to 34, inclusive, set out the termination dates and transitional arrangements with regard to various tax relieved property schemes, the details of which were announced on budget day. Sections 35 to 39, inclusive, deal with capital allowances for private hospitals, psychiatric hospitals, nursing homes and child care facilities. I am extending the clawback period for such facilities from ten to 15 years and what are known as the &ldquo;tax life&rdquo; rules will be revised to facilitate investors in transferring their interests to other investors within the 15 year clawback period. These provisions will apply to facilities commencing in use after 1 February 2007.</P>
      <P>The tax relief for residential units linked with nursing homes, which was due to expire on 24 March 2007, is being extended to 31 July 2008 on a transitional basis in line with the phasing out of other property incentive schemes. I intend to examine this tax relief in more detail for next year&rsquo;s budget and Finance Bill.</P>
      <P>Section 40 amends section 812 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 to ensure that interest on securities, including dividends, remain subject to tax in all cases. Sections 41 and 42 set out requirements for those who wish to invest some or all of their SSIA funds in a pension product. The purpose of this initiative is to encourage holders of special savings incentive accounts, SSIAs, on the lower end of the income scale to provide themselves with improved retirement arrangements by transferring moneys from their SSIA accounts into pensions. A sum of &euro;1 will be added for every &euro;3 transferred from an eligible SSIA account into a personal retirement savings account, PRSA, a retirement annuity contract or an additional voluntary contribution, AVC, subject to a maximum bonus of &euro;2,500. In addition, the exit tax to be paid on the SSIA moneys so transferred into individuals&rsquo; pension accounts will be refunded.</P>
      <P>The scheme is aimed at lower earners and will not be available to taxpayers who pay at a rate of 42%, who already have access to very consider<Col N="256"/>able incentives. This bonus is available for those making additional new contributions to their pension. It should be emphasised that this is a once-off special pensions initiative relating to lower earners with SSIA funds. The wider issues relating to improving global pension coverage as discussed in the recent report of the Pensions Board will be examined by the Government over the coming months.</P>
      <P>Section 43 seeks to put beyond doubt the obligation on persons who are resident outside the State to apply relevant contracts tax, RCT, when they operate as building or other relevant contractors in the State. Section 44 amends the law relating to relevant contracts tax which principal contractors are obliged to deduct from payments made to certain subcontractors in the construction, meat processing and forestry areas in order to tighten controls and to discourage fraud and evasion. Applicants for C2 certificates will face more stringent application criteria and the payment limit that Revenue operates for some subcontractors in respect of C2 payments is being put on a statutory basis.</P>
      <P>Sections 45 to 47, inclusive, 49, 53 and 107 provide for measures of a substantive, clarificatory and technical nature to assist in the development of the funds industry in Ireland, which is an important part of the international financial services sector. Section 48 amends legislative changes included in the Finance Act 2005 to ensure that the 23% exit tax on the proceeds of a life assurance policy cannot be deferred indefinitely by the continual rolling over of a policy without it becoming chargeable to the tax. While the changes are in response to certain points made to me by the industry, I am determined to ensure that the tax deferral available to investors is kept at reasonable levels and is not deferred indefinitely.</P>
      <P>Section 52 amends Chapter 1A of Part 27 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, which deals with the taxation of investment undertakings covered by the &ldquo;gross roll-up&rdquo; regime that was introduced in the Finance Act 2000. The amendment clarifies that in common with other companies, securitisation companies which invest in money market funds may receive payments from such funds without the imposition of an exit tax, provided the necessary conditions, such as the completion of a declaration procedure are adhered to.</P>
      <P>Section 54 ensures that life assurance companies only benefit from group losses and certain other loss reliefs at the corporation tax rate of 12.5%, as opposed to the standard income tax rate of 20%, which applies for the income and gains of policyholders from such policies. Section 55 is aimed at preventing abuses of the patent income exemption through re-categorising franchise licence fees as patent royalty payments. It also limits the amount of exempt patent royalty distributions that may be made by a company in certain circumstances to the aggregate of its <Col N="257"/>research and development spend over a three year period.</P>
      <P>Section 57 removes the requirement to deduct withholding tax on interest paid on quoted registered eurobonds, bringing the treatment of such bonds in line with that of those in bearer form. Section 58 extends the termination date for the ring-fencing of losses and capital allowances in qualifying shipping trades to 2010.</P>
      <P>Section 65 is the next major section and gives effect to the budget announcement on the restriction of interest relief under section 247 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 in the context of transactions between related companies. This is an important anti-avoidance measure. However, I appreciate that this section is being used by many firms in a perfectly appropriate way and it is not my intention to cut off genuine use of this section.</P>
      <P>Section 66 deals with the research and development tax credit which is just one of the Government&rsquo;s actions in incentivising the development of research and development in Ireland. The section provides that a proportion of expenditure on machinery or plant which is to be used partly for research and development will qualify for the tax credit. Where plant and machinery is included in the incremental spending calculation, but is in dual use, that is, both research and development and production, there will be a proportionate allocation of the expenditure for the purposes of the credit. Section 67 improves the legislation on the taxation of shipping-related profits by providing for a clearer, more streamlined process for applicant companies electing for the tonnage tax regime.</P>
      <P>With regard to capital gains tax, section 70 gives effect to the budget proposal that the EU single farm payment entitlement will qualify as an asset for the purposes of the capital gains tax retirement relief, provided the farmer in question fulfils the ten year rule in respect of the ownership and usage of the land which is disposed of at the same time as that entitlement. The section also caters for when a husband and wife are co-owners of land but only one of them becomes a partner in a milk production partnership.</P>
      <P>Section 73 deals with relief from capital gains tax on the disposal of certain works of art where prior to the disposal they were on loan to, or displayed in, an approved gallery or museum. The minimum period of loan is being increased from six to ten years and the section is being extended to apply also to such loans made to the proposed Irish Heritage Trust. Section 75 is an anti-avoidance measure dealing with capital gains tax in certain circumstances of a disposal of a chargeable asset to a spouse, a separated spouse or a former spouse. Section 76 and 77 provides that the Revenue Commissioners can obtain information for capital gains tax purposes regarding the issue of shares to the members of a mutual life assurance company or a mutual building society on the occasion of these ceasing to be mutual companies.</P><Col N="258"/>
      <P>Parts 2 and 3 deal with excise duties and VAT. Sections 78 to 91, inclusive, set out a range of changes with regard to excise duties, including confirmation of the budget day reduction in excise duty on kerosene and LPG used for heating, and the reduction of betting duty from 2% to 1% with the industry bearing the liability. In recognition of the environmental issues we face, the House will welcome the large-scale scheme I have provided for in the Bill to promote biofuels. The new scheme will assist biofuels in achieving an initial target of 2% penetration of the transport fuel market by 2008. This relief, when fully operational in 2008, is expected to support the use and production of some 163 million litres of biofuels per year. The scheme will help to limit our dependence on conventional fossil fuels, reduce our CO<?oasys _cf8- ?>2<?oasys _cf1- ?> emissions and stimulate activity in the agricultural sector. This is complemented by providing a new vehicle registration tax relief to promote new flexible fuel vehicles and the extension of the existing relief to dual electric or petrol vehicles.</P>
      <P>Sections 92 to 101, inclusive, contain a number of important revisions to the VAT code. Sections 95 and 101 confirm the increases in the VAT registration thresholds for small businesses from 1 May 2006. The revised thresholds are &euro;27,500 for services and &euro;55,000 for goods. Sections 94 and 96 amend the VAT Act to provide for the taxation of the private use of deductible and non-deductible business services. Section 95 also contains an anti-avoidance measure designed to strengthen the VAT grouping provisions in order to ensure the related companies are appropriately treated for VAT purposes without loss of tax revenue. Sections 93, 97 and 99 replace the existing rules on the VAT treatment of the supply of a package of services composed of two or more elements which attract VAT at different rates. Sections 98 and 99 provide for the granting of deductibility for VAT incurred on costs associated with the issue of new stocks, shares, debentures and other securities made to raise capital, where that person is entitled to VAT deductibility.</P>
      <P>Part 4 of the Bill deals with stamp duties. Section 103 extends to a foster child the stamp duty reliefs available to a natural or an adopted child. Section 104 provides for an amendment to the exemption from stamp duty on any instrument made for the purposes of, or in connection with, the demutualisation of an assurance company which carries on a mutual life business. Section 105 gives effect to the budget announcement extending the exemption from stamp duty for transfers of land to young trained farmers for another three years until 31 December 2008.</P>
      <P>Section 106 will exempt from stamp duty donations of publicly-quoted securities to approved bodies that come within the scheme of tax relief for charitable and other donations. Section 109 provides for an exemption from stamp duty on the sale, transfer or other dispo<Col N="259"/>sition of an EU single farm payment entitlement. Section 110 gives effect to the budget announcement regarding the abolition of companies&rsquo; capital duty for transactions effected on or after 7 December 2005. Section 111 ensures that where a combined ATM and debit card is used solely as an ATM or debit card, the charge will be &euro;10, whereas if it is used for both functions, the existing &euro;20 charge will apply.</P>
      <P>Part 5 of the Bill deals with capital acquisition tax and section 115 is concerned with the clawback of the exemption granted to heritage objects contained in a gift or inheritance if such objects are sold within six years after the valuation date of the gift or inheritance. This clawback does not apply if the objects are sold by private treaty to one of the qualifying bodies referred to in section 77(3) of the Act and the proposed Irish heritage trust is now being added to the list of qualifying bodies. Section 118 gives effect to the budget proposal that the EU single farm payment entitlement will qualify as agricultural property for the purposes of agricultural relief under capital acquisitions tax rules. Where land which qualified for agricultural relief or business relief is disposed of in the period commencing six years after the date of the gift or inheritance and ending ten years after that date, the section provides that the relief granted will be clawed back in respect of the development value of the land at the date of the gift or inheritance.</P>
      <P>Section 122 provides a new scheme of tax relief for heritage property donated to the proposed Irish heritage trust as announced in the budget. To qualify for relief, the heritage property will have to be approved by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government by reference to the criteria set out in the section. There will be a ceiling of &euro;6 million on the aggregate value of the heritage properties that can be approved in any one year. Allowing the proposed trust to avail of this scheme will be important to its successful launch.</P>
      <P>Section 125 and 126 are important tax administration provisions. The first of these will allow the Revenue Commissioners, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, to introduce regulations governing the automatic reporting to the Revenue Commissioners by financial institutions of interest and other profit payments made to customers as well as certain payments made by Departments. The Revenue Commissioners and my Department will consult the financial institutions before implementing this reporting system.</P>
      <P>Section 126 addresses the use of tax avoidance schemes by way of a surcharge of 10% on undisclosed transactions that are ultimately determined to be tax avoidance transactions. The surcharge will not apply where full details of the transaction are disclosed in a protective notification process to the Revenue Commissioners within a specified time limit. People who are open <Col N="260"/>about their tax planning arrangements will be able to show them to the Revenue Commissioners and will not be surcharged if the arrangements concerned are later determined to be in breach of anti-avoidance rules.</P>
      <P>There are many important provisions in the Bill to stimulate the economy, reward effort and to promote enterprise, while at the same time seeking to safeguard what must be at the core of any proper tax system, which is the fair treatment of all taxpayers by reference to their ability to pay. I hope that Senators agree with these principles and I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister and his officials to the House to discuss this Bill. He has provided an exhaustive report of the different sections of the Bill and I welcome many of them. I especially welcome the effort made by the Minister to close a number of loopholes which existed in the tax system and which allowed for potential abuse through tax avoidance. I broadly welcome his actions on pension provision and he has made a step in the right direction in this respect.</P>
      <P>At the outset, the Minister spoke about the extension of the film tax relief. I was a member of the Joint Committee on Arts, Sport and Tourism when I first entered the House. The Minister for Finance&rsquo;s immediate predecessor seemed to be steering the Government towards getting rid of the relief, but the current Minister seems to be steering in the opposite direction. Can he enlighten us on the thinking behind that reversal? I agree with him and the improvements in the film tax relief scheme are to be welcomed.</P>
      <P>Extremely wealthy people in this country have avoided paying any tax and I welcome the Government&rsquo;s efforts to tackle them. I take a measure of satisfaction from that announcement in the budget, as it was highlighted extensively by the Labour Party and the Fine Gael Party that this anomaly should not be allowed to continue. I am glad the Minister has started a process that will ensure such people will effectively have to pay a 20% rate of tax in the future.</P>
      <P>There are aspects of the Bill about which I have reservations. After the 2002 general election, the Government announced that it would begin to remove the remaining property-based tax incentive schemes. This was to happen by 2004, but that was extended to 2006 and it now appears that some of the schemes will be extended further to 2008. I have no problem with the economic theory behind incentive schemes. They were developed for a specific purpose and they often achieved their objectives. However, for the past six or seven years these schemes have been part of the problem rather than part of the solution. At the moment, they are fuelling huge increases in property values across the country. The Government seems to be prevaricating again and is extending some of these reliefs until 2008. A recent report into these schemes on behalf of the Department informed us that &euro;1.6 billion had <Col N="261"/>been foregone to the Exchequer as a result of these property-based schemes, which is a significant amount of money. Following that report, it is clear that action needs to be taken rather than ensuring that these schemes are extended into the future. The problems they are currently causing need to be neutralised and the schemes should be removed completely and as quickly as possible.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>Following the publication of the report into the property-based tax schemes, the Minister stated that cost-benefit analyses should be carried out on schemes before they are introduced. Such analyses should be conducted into the schemes for private hospitals and nursing homes. Those schemes serve a purpose and I am not opposed to them on principle, but it is quite apparent that some of those hospitals and nursing homes are not managed in accordance with public health policy. It would be useful to have a cost-benefit analysis of how those schemes are progressing. As I said, I have no political hang-up or objection to tax-based incentive schemes. In future, we must examine other areas of the economy that might benefit from them. It is clear that we have 300,000 people directly involved in construction, currently producing approximately 80,000 housing units per annum. Most people would agree that such a rate is unsustainable. However, if something happened to the construction industry tomorrow, it might have very serious consequences for the rest of the economy, and the Government should consider other areas. We have a serious problem providing transport infrastructure, and the Minister and his officials might usefully examine tax-incentive schemes for road, rail and other types of infrastructure. Anyone who becomes redundant in the property sector could be redeployed in infrastructural projects.</P>
      <P>At every opportunity, I have brought up capital gains tax and roll-over relief with the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, and the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, and I wish to raise them again. It is at the very least inequitable that an unwilling seller of land to the National Roads Authority for road infrastructure should be subject to the full rate of capital gains tax. I recently spoke to a farmer in Kilkenny through whose farm the new Waterford-Dublin route is going. He is losing 20 to 30 acres and his home, but he will be subject to the full rate of capital gains tax, although he is a completely unwilling seller. He will have to find land to replace what he is losing as a result of the road. Since it is being built through his area, all his neighbours will be in the same position, with a knock-on effect seen in the cost of land there. A few years ago, the Government introduced a scheme of roll-over relief that would have addressed the situation where someone is involved in farming or otherwise self-employed. I urge the Minister to act as soon as possible to review the U-turn of a few years ago as it is quite unfair.</P><Col N="262"/>
      <P>In his remarks, the Minister mentioned his initiatives on biofuels. I welcome the budget announcements in the area, but the Government is setting itself the rather miserable target that 2% of the market should be provided by biofuels by 2008. He mentioned a significant impact on the environment but it will not have any impact as the market for fuel is expanding every year and by that date it will certainly be larger than at present. Any 2% of such a market will have a negligible effect.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister will be able to address this in his answer, although it is not directly related to the Finance Bill. On the Order of Business, points were raised regarding social partnership. I agree with other speakers on its importance in developing the economy over the last few years. It may have been overstated, but it has been very valuable. I would like to see several issues addressed in the ongoing discussions.</P>
      <P>Senator Mansergh and others mentioned outsourcing, and I am not particularly hung up about whether it should be used for driver testing. However, we must ensure in the new partnership deal, if one comes about, that vital Government services can be outsourced. Driver testing was given as an example, and it is a good one. If a backlog emerges in any sector that could be addressed by employing contractors from outside, it should be resolved by contracting out the difficulty in question. That should be addressed regarding social partnership.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I raised the issue of community employment schemes. At present, anyone on such a scheme who is aged over 50 has a three-year cap, after which he or she must leave. In the context of social partnership, I ask that this be reviewed. Community employment schemes provide vital services in rural and urban communities up and down the country, and the harsh reality is that anyone over 50 who is unemployed will find it extremely difficult to re-enter the employment market. The current cap should be removed, and I urge the Minister to do so as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Another issue to which the Minister did not refer but that constantly arises is competitiveness. Our competitiveness has been seriously eroded in the last five or six years in particular, and the Government has played a major role in doing so. Since 2002, there has been an 86% increase in Government charges. Public utility costs have increased by 40%. Gas and electricity charges have gone up much more than in any of our European neighbours. Regarding gas and electricity in particular, we have established a series of regulators, but what are they doing to get a straight answer on why we are seeing such spiralling costs in the economy? I do not believe they are doing enough.</P>
<?oasys _dc14- ?>
      <P>A rather startling statistic is that last year&rsquo;s export performance was the worst since 1974. Not many people commented on it during discussion of the Finance Bill in the other House, and the Minister did not refer to it in his remarks here. It is the <Col N="263"/>third year in a row that we have seen a significant fall in exports, and that is a clear indicator of our problems with competitiveness. Perhaps it might be useful to discuss that at some stage.</P>
<?oasys _dc0- ?>
      <P>There are also serious issues regarding telecommunications and the knock-on effect on competitiveness of our broadband problems. Like other Senators, I have raised it at various intervals regarding the economic outlook. At a time when it looks like Eircom will soon find itself in the hands of an Australian company, there are serious difficulties, particularly in rural areas, with the roll-out of broadband. Large swathes of the country still have no coverage, and we are far and away the worst among European colleagues when it comes to broadband coverage. That will be extremely detrimental to future growth prospects, particularly in regional centres. I ask that the Minister and the Government ensure that something be done to bring greater competition to the market and give rural and provincial areas some level of broadband service.</P>
      <P>I welcome many provisions in the Bill, particularly the Minister&rsquo;s efforts to close loopholes. However, significant errors have been made, especially in further extending property-based tax reliefs. I ask the Minister to revisit that as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister and his officials. I allowed myself a little smile when I heard reference to competitiveness. While a decline in exports would be something to be concerned about, we have a &euro;30 billion trade surplus, which is significantly more than 15 years ago. I was also intrigued to find an article in <i>Le Monde</i> a few weeks ago, which, without a hint of criticism, described Ireland as &ldquo;the fiscal champion of Europe&rdquo;. That is a considerable compliment to the way in which the economy has been managed over the past ten to 20 years. We do not merely have a competitive tax system; we have a system that generates significant revenue.</P>
      <P>The Minister, in his summary of the Bill, stressed a number of the key features such as the removal of those on the minimum wage from the tax net, the exclusion of workers on the average industrial wage from the higher tax rate and restrictions on high income tax payers. His budgets and Finance Bills have had a corrective, egalitarian tone. For example, the Green Party decision at its conference at the weekend to withdraw proposals to raise income tax and corporation tax was significant. Any party that seriously aspires to Government must accept the economic management argument has been won hands down by the Government. Despite what one may hear from different parties, proof that Sinn F&eacute;in is not seriously interested in Government is evidenced by the party maintaining its proposal to increase corporation tax by 5%. I defy Opposition Members to put their fingers on a proposal in the budget or the Finance Bill that can be said to <Col N="264"/>have been inspired by a conversation in the Fianna F&aacute;il tent at the Galway races, even though one hears this clich&eacute; about once a week.</P>
      <P>The Finance Bill implements the main provisions of the budget, which include an 8.8% increase in the standard rate income tax band and a 17% in the employee tax credit. The Minister deserves credit for his firmness in resisting a great deal of behind the scenes pressure &mdash; perhaps the pressure people in theory think is applied in the tent at the Galway races &mdash; to modify or withdraw his proposals on the remittance system. He also deserves credit for increasing the allowance for families to employ carers from &euro;30,000 to &euro;50,000. It is expensive to look after old or infirm family members. We receive representations in this regard practically every week and this is an enlightened measure, as is the &euro;10,000 income disregard for child minders. I was a member of the tax strategy group in the 1997-2002 period and this issue was batted backwards and forwards. A disregard of &euro;6,000 rather than &euro;10,000 was mentioned in those days but the nettle was not grasped. Nobody has attacked or criticised the Minister&rsquo;s measure because it is pragmatic and it will genuinely take care of part of the child care problem.</P>
      <P>I highly approve of what the Minister has done on pension funds. People will be encouraged even more to make provision for themselves but there will not be an unlimited underwriting by the State of Rolls Royce pension arrangements, which is scandalous, otherwise, beyond a certain point, the State would subsidise multi-million euro pension packages for people who are perfectly capable of looking after themselves.</P>
      <P>As part of the tightening up needed regarding the flouting of employment laws, the Minister has included a provision relating to agencies and mobile workers. It could be argued this is a new version of the non-resident accounts of ten or 20 years ago with people trying to find ingenious ways to get around employment laws, minimum wage levels and so on.</P>
      <P>The Minister is introducing a limit on reliefs on incomes in excess of &euro;250,000. As the Minister said, it must not be forgotten when people highlight the 20 or 30 people who pay no tax, which is a scandal, that, nonetheless, most income tax is paid by wealthy and well paid people.</P>
    <P>Most of the property reliefs made a huge contribution but such reliefs only make economic sense if they are time limited and if they are abolished at a certain point. There is no better time for them to go, as the construction industry is clearly booming. The Minister indicated he will have to consider the utility of a form of incentive for park and ride facilities following expansion in public transport and residential units for older people. In my wider family, I have known people who are in a sheltered environment attached to a medical facility, which gives them freedom and independence. That is a worthwhile form of provision.</P><Col N="265"/>
      <P>The Minister has put a cap on the relief for artists and writers, one of two particularly enlightened measures taken by his predecessor, Charles J. Haughey, in 1969. The regime will still be more favourable than anywhere else, other than countries such as the Bahamas where nobody pays income tax. It is possible that a number of people, probably foreigners, who are earning significant money, may be tempted to look elsewhere.</P>
      <P>The Arts Council submission to the Minister contains a proposal for consideration that has merit and it relates to dance compositions. I am not as convinced about screen direction. On the other hand, the relief may be administered too lightly in other areas. Though this may seem disloyal, I do not see why, for example, ministerial memoirs should benefit from artists&rsquo; tax relief, as that is not why it was devised. The relief should be for people whose main income comes from writing or whose work is clearly creative.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The Minister has been working in close consultation with the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, Deputy O&rsquo;Donoghue, on film relief. We have played around with the film relief over the past few years and there has been much discussion on the issue in the Joint Committee on Arts, Sport, Tourism, Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. There is no point in being mealy-mouthed about the relief. We should do it properly or not bother with it at all. It is recognised, even by the Opposition, that the beneficiaries will, inevitably, be relatively wealthy. The question must be asked whether we need to provide relief if we want to have a film industry in this country, and the answer is we do.</P>
      <P>I regret the necessity to bring an end to the current form of the stallion tax relief. The Cheltenham races have vindicated the regime built up on that basis over almost 40 years. I looked at a 1935 report in the Oireachtas Library by Mr. Justice Wylie &mdash; who is also known in the 1916 context &mdash; into the horsebreeding industry which was clearly underdeveloped at that time. Stallion owners used have to pay a schedule D tax.</P>
      <P>National heritage provisions have been welcomed. I draw the attention of the Minister to the fact that a full submission has been made to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government with regard to heritage houses that are open to the public where the owners have relatively small incomes. If they are on substantial incomes, they can offset expenditure and this is a relatively simple procedure if they adopt the national heritage route. However, this may not suit every family&rsquo;s circumstances. A suggestion was made that investors could get some relief for investing in a heritage house which is not their own. The Minister has the detail on that proposal and I suggest he and his colleague could examine the matter, without prejudice.</P>
      <P>I welcome the measure on biofuels. In general, I admire the great improvements in the administration of the tax system. Twenty years ago there <Col N="266"/>were nightmarish aspects to taxes with self-employed people getting vast estimates. I have received a complaint from one practitioner who had difficulty getting through to helplines and this is something that must be examined.</P>
      <P>In the context of the Kyoto Protocol, considerable concern has been expressed in the House that it appears rail freight is being completely phased out. Most countries operate modest subsidies in this area and this is something that should be considered in our transport policy.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Senator John Paul Phelan raised the matter of the roll-over of capital gains tax in the agricultural area. I have some sympathy with his case. I have less sympathy with a roll over in the case of land sold in towns and cities. We pay vast sums of money, not to build transport infrastructure but to compensate people for little strips of land. I was in France last week and happened to hear an item on a news programme about Budapest building its first metro line for &euro;800 million. This is a fraction of what is proposed here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share my time with Senators Ross and Henry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>Is that agreed? Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I examine Finance and other Bills to see whether we are taking the right direction for the long term. I had an interesting meal last month with Elaine Chao, the US Secretary of Labour. She is the first young Asian woman to sit in the US Cabinet. She said that her Department&rsquo;s objective is to create the environment where the private sector can create jobs because it was not the job of those in Cabinet to do so. This is something we do not hear said often or loudly enough. Consider what has happened in France where it was believed it was the Government objective to create jobs. This belief led to dramatic errors such as the 35-hour week. There the Government is trying to claw back through youth employment initiatives and this is presenting problems.</P>
      <P>Each year the Finance Bill is an opportunity to stand back and look at how the economy is doing from a long-term perspective. In the past two weeks we have seen two forward-looking and optimistic forecasts, up to 2020. I have a long enough memory to recall 1994 when the ESRI published what then seemed an absurdly optimistic forecast up to the end of the century. As matters turned out, the ESRI erred in that economic results were far better than its forecast. The point I wish to make is that our general readiness not to believe the forecast led us into a trap, the consequences of which we are still paying for today. We did not believe the ESRI forecast and our housing, infrastructure and population were not ready for the even better results.</P>
      <P>We must do a better job now. We must consider the forecasts and try to decide whether they <Col N="267"/>are in the right direction. The forecasts have pointed out the direction our economy is likely to take. We must look at them and ask whether the Minister is taking the right steps. In general terms I agree he is.</P>
      <P>Theodore Roosevelt said: &ldquo;In any moment of decision, the best thing you can do is the right thing, the next best thing is the wrong thing, and the worst thing you can do is nothing.&rdquo; I look at the Bill and wonder whether there is a danger the Minister is tending to step back and do almost nothing because there is only a year to an election. I am not saying this is what is happening, but there are many signs that the Minister did not present a dramatic budget.</P>
      <P>The failure to make proper plans will be far more costly the next time round. It may well be that we have not judged the situation correctly and that the future has a few tricks in store for which we are not ready. If there is something worse than not planning properly for future growth, it is not planning properly for a downturn. We do not have to look too far back to find ourselves guilty of that. At the height of the millennium boom even the straight-laced mandarins of the Department of Finance seemed to have thrown caution to the wind and I remember how difficult it was for me to make myself heard when I tried to sound a note of caution. The dotcom collapse came and we had some setbacks.</P>
      <P>This Minister has in general handled affairs well, but there is a danger that he may pander to some calls such as the one Senator Mansergh mentioned regarding the cap on artists&rsquo; income. On balance the Minister may have made the right decision. The artists&rsquo; exemption was a win-win situation. When it was introduced by former Minister for Finance, Mr. Charles Haughey, Ireland did not have any income from artists because if they earned a lot they went abroad. The concept of a zero tax rate on artists&rsquo; income was sensible and it played well for us in many ways.</P>
      <P>We have had a number of innovative proposals in recent years, such as tax incentives for the building of car parks, park and ride facilities and hotel rooms. That was an example of encouraging private enterprise through incentives. Senator Mansergh mentioned private retirement homes, about which I have a query. The Minister for Finance has increased the claw-back period from ten to 15 years, the objective of which is to ensure that property that was built for one purpose is not used for another. However, there could be a danger that the ultimate objective of more nursing homes may fall foul of that change.</P>
      <P>We need to plan for an increasingly optimistic future but also for a decline in the market in case the latter happens. We need to plan for a situation in which our economy grows to the extent that economists have been forecasting, while also planning for the opposite eventuality, that our economy is struck by a downturn, driven <Col N="268"/>in part by the ways in which the world changes or by something like bird flu or SARS. We need to plan, regardless of whether the crystal ball gazers are right. The tragedy for this country, which given our recent history is not unlikely, would be if we failed to plan properly for either eventuality. That is the outcome I fear most and the one against which I warn today. The Minister for Finance has taken the right steps but he must be reminded of the danger of going in only one direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>I was struck by Senator Mansergh&rsquo;s comments, obviously made from a partisan position, although that does not mean he is wrong, that the economic management of this economy has been sound over a long period. That is a very fair judgment and one which many on this side of the House would share, although we obviously would not agree on every detail of this Finance Bill or on the concessions made to certain vested interests. In general, however, it is an incontrovertibly accepted fact that in the last ten to 12 years, the Irish economy has been run in an extraordinarily successful manner. It is very difficult to find fault with the figures. It is equally difficult to deny the fact because we have performed so well in comparison with our competitors. Presumably, that is the benchmark by which we wish to be judged. It is very easy to say that a great deal of luck was involved or that one or two policies worked very well but if one compares Ireland with any of our European neighbours, its performance has been outstanding.</P>
      <P>One might ask why this is so and I agree with Senator Mansergh that it is because the economy has been so well managed during that time, mostly by Fianna F&aacute;il Ministers for Finance. Furthermore, although it might be unpalatable in political terms to mention this, it is a fact of life that while we are fully fledged, paid-up and supposedly loyal members of the European Community, our loyalty in economic terms and the measures taken have been far closer to the economy of the United States of America. That is something which we see in its raw form when the rows break out in Europe about the actions we are taking relating to tax matters. I commend the fact that the previous and current Ministers for Finance and the Taoiseach have stubbornly refused to yield to the pressures from Europe to harmonise taxation in ways which would be damaging to Ireland. It is a measure of the courage and individuality of the last two Governments on this issue that when it came to Ireland&rsquo;s vital national interests, particularly concerning corporation tax, they did not make the concessions the French, Germans and others wanted. That may have been difficult, though not terribly so. It was an area on which they stubbornly refused to give in, resulting in Ireland being the most fiscally successful nation in Europe.</P>
      <P>We have an economy which reflects the ideology of a transatlantic nation more so than a Euro<Col N="269"/>pean one and thank God for that. Had we followed the European model as closely as our neighbours would have liked, we would have been going down the same sluggish economic road they have been going down for many years. They may be recovering somewhat now, but our growth rate still far outstrips that of the French, Germans and others. We have attracted multinational industry to this country because of our low taxation regime and that is good management. That is what Senator Mansergh would refer to as good management but he would not put it in the same terms as I would do.</P>
      <P>Let us welcome the fact that we are now the most globalised economy in Europe, which means that we welcome outside investment unapologetically and do not wrap the green or European flag around ourselves when we are running our economy. We are prepared to say that we are chasing prosperity and are willing to allow outside interests to help us to become prosperous. That is the reality of the Irish economy.</P>
      <P>There are contradictory views on this subject, as there are on all economics-related issues. Last week the NCB published a report of dubious responsibility which argued that we will be prosperous, come hell or high water, for the next 15 years. That is a difficult argument to justify because one must anticipate every single unfortunate event and dismiss it as unlikely to happen. That report also maintained that our dependence on multinationals was limited. Another report was released yesterday suggesting exactly the opposite, namely, that we are very dependent on multinationals. We should not be ashamed of the fact that our dependence on multinationals has been partly responsible for our growth and largely responsible for our increased prosperity. The Government should take the credit for welcoming them in and standing up to our European neighbours in that respect.</P>
      <P>I regret the fact that the Minister for Finance did not renew the bank levy. It was both a useful and punitive source of revenue. I see no reason taxation should not be used in a penal way to punish those institutions that have deliberately and knowingly broken the law. That is one of the reasons the 1% levy was introduced, if we are to be honest about it. It was politically acceptable and the banks were being punished for breaking the law. When institutions break the law, the individuals within them never pay the price but now it appears that nobody will pay the price. The banks can afford to pay the 1% levy. We should not take our feet of their throats at this point because they continue to abuse their customers in an unacceptable way and their shareholders are well aware of that.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister specifically address the privatisation of Aer Lingus? It would be useful if he addressed the privatisation programme he intends to introduce. The State has no business in any of the enterprises in which it is involved. Will the Minister justify why he will raise only &euro;400 <Col N="270"/>million, an absolute pittance, out of the sale of Aer Lingus? Why is the Government going to such lengths to raise so little money on the airline&rsquo;s flotation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry"><NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to raise the issue of tax relief schemes which are of benefit to high income earners. The Minister rightly put a stop to those schemes which were causing unjust benefit to very high income earners in allowing them not to pay any income tax. In section 17, the Minister has included those who earn over &euro;250,000 and who give donations to universities, cultural institutions and so forth. The provision will not come into play until 2007. The universities and the National Gallery believe that from then on, few will give money in excess of their income to cultural institutions or even a children&rsquo;s hospital.</P>
      <P>The money, however, does no good to the high income earner but is of great value to the institutions to which it is given. The report prepared by the Department of Finance on tax relief on donations to charities recommended the retention of the provision. It rejected the limiting of deductions from such donations. The report stated the evidence to date does not suggest the Exchequer is duly exposed. It continued to recommend that the State should encourage a wider culture of giving.</P>
      <P>That culture has started to develop. I am sure that it is an unfortunate oversight that this provision has been included in section 17. I ask the Minister for Finance to rectify it. Universities, the National Gallery and various hospitals are dependent on high value gifts from high earners. The earners get no benefit from it but the institutions gain a great deal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMinihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Minihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Parlon, and his officials.</P>
      <P Just="Left">In my statement to the House on budget day, I referred not just to how it was a demonstration of the right Government choices in action, but also an unambiguous illustration of the approach of the Progressive Democrats. Some Members lazily conclude that the approach of the Progressive Democrats is one focussed, with a tunnel vision, on the economy. It is argued our mantras are &ldquo;economy first, society second&rdquo; and &ldquo;get the economy right; the rest will take care of itself&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The reality is more nuanced than that. To uncover the reality takes a little more inquiry and effort, practices that would serve our opponents better. The Progressive Democrats and the Government see economic policy as an instrument of social justice. Unlike our opponents, we do not deal separately with the economy and society. Unlike our opponents, we do not devise policy on the basis of simplistic choices. It is not a question of policy A being targeted at economic progress, policy B at a specific societal group or challenge, policy C at the environment, and so on.</P><Col N="271"/>
      <P>In shaping our eighth budget with our Government partners, we have again shown our commitment to the Progressive Democrats&rsquo; central tenet. We believe in a strong, dynamic economy that can deliver for all in society, most particularly the vulnerable. The Finance Bill reflects this approach. If the legislation were drafted by Fine Gael and the Labour Party, with some so-called help from the newly repackaged Green Party, the correct and successful approach would be absent. Lack of experience, clarity, agreement, maturity and freedom to follow the right course would create a finance Bill that would turn the economy back.</P>
      <P>The path we chose has delivered a strong, growing and dynamic economy, allowing the hard work of people to deliver the higher living standards they deserve. It is a path that allows improved social provision and the most favourable income tax system in the EU for people on low to medium incomes. As a small island, geographically on the edge of Europe, our prosperity depends on that forward-looking approach. We have succeeded by embracing change and openness, not shutting it out.</P>
      <P>The Bill is another solid step forward away from the failed policies of our opponents. Their policies not only failed them but also the country. Their policies delivered 17% unemployment, mass unemployment and mass emigration. In 1991, we passed the 1.1 million employment milestone, and the 1.9 million milestone last year. The sign ahead reads 2 million people employed in 2006, but only if we keep on this progressive path. We cannot afford three or four years of finance Bills drafted by those who want Ireland to rest and re-think.</P>
      <P>The extraordinary growth and increased tax revenue that resulted from the Progressive Democrats&rsquo; approach has increased the resources available for social provision. It has allowed real and substantial increases in social welfare payments, health and education. For example, the old age pension has risen by 67% since 1997. The Finance Bill 2006 not only ensures a fair tax system, but a more successful one. Fairness breeds compliance. Compliance means greater revenue for expenditure on social provision.</P>
      <P>Sections 2, 3 and Schedule 1 set out taxation rates and personal reliefs. These demonstrate the fair approach by allowing for increases in personal and PAYE credits. They will see the removal of those on the minimum wage from the tax net. They also provide that those on the average industrial wage will be excluded from the higher tax rate. Both these commendable developments are clear evidence of the Government&rsquo;s determination to keeping tax down on low and modest incomes.</P>
      <P>The Bill will restrict the use of tax reliefs by high income earners and introduce greater equity to the tax system. Members opposite should take note of this and refrain from erroneous future <Col N="272"/>pronouncements about the focus of the Progressive Democrats&rsquo; policy and action. I will not, however, hold my breath. I apologise to Senator McDowell who is taking the brunt of this as the Opposition benches are empty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>I am taking the brunt of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMinihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Minihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Section 13 represents concrete action on Progressive Democrats&rsquo; policy to increase child care supply and maximise choice for families. Increased supply will result in decreased costs. This provision inserts a new section into the 1997 Taxes Consolidation Act, a scheme of tax relief for income received from the provision of certain child care services. The &euro;10,000 disregard was a key element of the Progressive Democrats&rsquo; pre-budget policy. In conjunction with the early child care supplement, it provides a multifaceted and nuanced approach to assist families with child care costs with consideration of the variety of options chosen by parents.</P>
      <P>Section 17 provides further evidence of my party&rsquo;s commitment to provide a tax system that both promotes growth and limits the ability of high-income individuals to use tax reliefs. Where a person is a high-income earner, restrictions will be applied to the extent to which specified reliefs can be applied to reduce the individual&rsquo;s tax bill. Such an individual can only use reliefs to reduce his or her tax bill in any one year to 50% of the individual&rsquo;s adjusted income, which is to be welcomed.</P>
      <P>I have some concerns, however, regarding how proposed changes could affect substantial investments and capital plans, particularly those that have been made in the expectation that the law on reliefs would not be changed retrospectively. Any small enterprise will be aware that cashflow calculations often make assumptions or attempt to take into account the extent to which profit might be covered by certain reliefs, particularly for bank finance purposes.</P>
      <P>In most cases, capital investment takes some time to organise, as does progress through our planning process. I am aware of concern from the hotel trade, for example, that legislative change to schemes designed to attract investment could have a negative impact on individuals who have invested in improving products and services for Irish and international consumers. I would be grateful to hear the Minister&rsquo;s view on this issue.</P>
      <P>Section 40 inserts another new provision in the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997. This contains an incentive for SSIA holders on lower incomes to invest some or all of their SSIA funds into a pension product when their SSIA matures. Under the Bill a new pension initiative aimed at lower-income SSIA holders and those with underfunded pensions is to be introduced. Given that research shows that only half of those working who require private pension cover have a pension scheme and that some 50% of these private <Col N="273"/>pensions are totally inadequate, this initiative is particularly commendable.</P>
      <P>On a less publicised element of the Bill, I would be interested to hear the Minister&rsquo;s views on the changes to the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 proposed in sections 47 and 48. Any change that could excessively increase compliance costs and negatively impact on international competitiveness should be handled with caution.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Governments are aware that unduly complex tax calculations can deter investment funds that market investment internationally. They are mindful of the costs of amending systems to cater for complex tax calculations and different treatment for Irish versus EU investments, as they can encourage business to avoid certain investments and/or encourage investment abroad. Irish investors should have maximum choice available to them. I would be grateful if the Minister could today, or at some time in the near future, set out his views on how sections 47 and 48 may impact on the investment sector.</P>
      <P>We are continuing on our successful course that fosters enterprise and initiative, drives competition and efficiency, and provides the most generous tax and welfare system for single-income families in the world. That course has meant that in today&rsquo;s lreland we are generating more jobs and have more workers. Some 20 years ago, the challenge was to end the misery of unemployment and emigration as well as ending the cracked policy approach taken by successive left-driven Governments. Today&rsquo;s challenge is, thankfully, very different. It involves sustaining our progress and prosperity, working harder to protect and provide for the vulnerable, reforming public service delivery where necessary, integrating our immigrant workers, and further protecting our environment.</P>
      <P>We must still guard against allowing a reversion to the policy approaches of a left-driven Government. This Bill is a step towards that end, as it demonstrates that the Progressive Democrats core belief, namely, that economic development and the provision of employment are the best defenders against poverty, is the right one for all in our society. In this context, I welcome this legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>It is always my good fortune to have an opportunity to speak after the point where control of the House slips into the hands of the Progressive Democrats following inflammatory comments from Senator Ross, after which he promptly disappears. On more than one occasion this has tempted me down a number of culs-de-sac, most of which I will try to avoid today.</P>
      <P>I wish to begin with a nakedly sectarian point of which I was reminded when Senator Mansergh referred to <i>Le Monde</i>&mdash; that it would be appropriate today to express our solidarity with French workers and students as they seek to resist the efforts of the Minister of State&rsquo;s <i>confr&egrave;res</i> in the <Col N="274"/>French Government to undermine the standard of living of young French people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>Let me avoid further culs-de-sac. I want to spend most of my time speaking about what I consider to be the guts of the Bill, which is the manner in which it deals with capital allowances and the special reliefs and incentives that have been in place, in some cases, for 30 or 40 years.</P>
      <P>The reports published by the Minister made for fascinating reading. I compliment the Minister for having commissioned the reports and I also compliment those who compiled them. I am sure anyone who has read them will agree that the content, presentation and standard of the internally-produced Department of Finance report was at least as good as the one for which we obviously paid a lot of money to Goodbodys and Indecon. We might bear that in mind in future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell"><NameTxt>Mr. McDowell</NameTxt>
	<P>We must approach this matter from two angles. One involves what these incentives and reliefs sought to achieve. The other concerns the reason we stood back and examined them at this time, which is their effect on particularly high-earning taxpayers or non-taxpayers in some cases.</P>
      <P>I wish to start with the second angle. The scheme that the Minister and the Department have come up with in section 17 is a good one, which has been ingeniously worked out. I have one problem with it in that I am not convinced we should allow a roll-over in the fashion that is set out in the section. That is a quibble, however, and the scheme generally is a good one.</P>
      <P>I would counsel against looking even now to produce exceptions. It is always tempting to say that this particular type of investment or donation should not actually be part of the cap. For reasons I perfectly understand, Senator Henry sought to make exactly that case only a short time ago. If we are insisting that high earners must pay at least or approximately 20% in tax annually, then we must adhere to that principle irrespective of the merits of the investment or donation which people might otherwise make. Let us not go down the road of putting in place what I think is a decent provision but then immediately dilute it by making an exception, however reasonable that exception may seem to be.</P>
      <P>Looking at it from the other angle, in some sense it is a relief to find that the consultants endorsed the major expenditure, which has been the urban renewal scheme. They said that approximately 74% of the total cost to the Exchequer went in the property-based urban renewal schemes, which is a good thing because all parties in this House supported them. The <Col N="275"/>results are there to be seen in the centre of Dublin where previously there had been a market failure, dereliction and a lack of commercial and construction activity of any kind. It is crystal clear that without the benefit of tax reliefs and incentives that market failure would not have been corrected. Unfortunately, however, as we went through the 1990s and the first few years of this century, we started adding on reliefs, sometimes for no good reason at all or for misguided reasons. That happened sometimes because we thought something was a good idea. Some of those good ideas proved not to be so good, however, while others did not work out.</P>
      <P>The two Ministers who were responsible for most of these reliefs &mdash; Deputy Quinn and the former Deputy McCreevy &mdash; came at the matter from totally different philosophical angles, although the effect was the same. The former Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, identified a market failure and decided this was a way the State could become involved in solving it.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>The former Deputy and Minister for Finance, Mr. McCreevy, did exactly the opposite. He stated that the private sector should be allowed to sort out this market failure. The end result was exactly the same &mdash; we ended up subsidising the private sector to do something we were not prepared to do ourselves. It was a remarkable philosophical difference in that both Ministers could stand by what they did in their own terms without apparently being able to see the other side of the story. We must take a number of measures, including a cost-benefit analysis to know what we seek to achieve. In one way, that is stating the obvious. The Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Parlon, and the Minister for Finance are blue in the face stating they carry out cost-benefit analyses. We discovered that perhaps this is not the case in one major scheme which will continue, namely the private hospital scheme, as all that is required is HSE certification that the conditions in the Act have been met.</P>
      <P>We must ask two preliminary questions before we go any further. The first is whether an area of activity is one in which the State should be involved. Examining the range of incentives provided, we must be careful about getting involved in what I broadly term the commercial sector. With the benefit of hindsight, I cannot see the provision of hotel rooms and holiday cottages as a matter in which the State should have been involved. It was virtually certain that over time the market would have made available those hotel beds in so far as tourists were ready to take them up. We must consider carefully before we go down the commercial or semi-commercial road again.</P>
      <P>The second question is whether only the State should take action. The issue of park and ride facilities was mentioned earlier. The argument was made in Dublin five, six or seven years ago <Col N="276"/>that park and ride facilities were required at DART stations and the former Minister for Finance, Mr. McCreevy, introduced a specific section in a Finance Bill to encourage it. It did not work and he subsequently amended it in order that a park and ride facility could include other property developments. It still did not work. We should have asked whether it was in the public interest to have this facility and, if so, either do it directly or finance a local authority or State company to do it.</P>
      <P>Another example of where the issue might arise is in the increasing privatisation of leisure facilities. We have fewer and fewer local authority swimming pools. We had community and voluntary facilities, often run by football clubs or the GAA but now a huge number of people are members of gyms. Whether they use them or not is another matter. I am surprised that nobody has come up with the bright idea of giving tax incentives for such leisure facilities. I am sure it will cross the Minister&rsquo;s desk sooner or later. This is exactly what we should not do. We should tell local authorities, as happens in every other country including the UK and Northern Ireland, that they are expected to provide a certain amount of publicly-funded facilities and run them on the basis that they will be available to everybody within the area.</P>
      <P>Having answered those preliminary questions and deciding that an area is one in which the market has failed and it is appropriate for the State to get involved, we should then apply the sensible and important criteria mentioned by Goodbodys. They state we should take into account any genuine development potential in an area. Harsh though it may sound, the evidence now suggests that the area covered by the rural renewal scheme in County Leitrim simply did not have the development potential we would have liked. For that simple reason, the scheme did not work. The consultants are clear in stating that no such similar scheme should be contemplated. We must ensure the potential is there to fill the market gap as it appears. The other eight or nine criteria set out by Goodbodys are good and sensible and we should also take them into account.</P>
      <P>I will speak specifically on the one major scheme not being terminated, namely the hospital beds scheme. It is by no means clear to me what it seeks to do. However, it seems likely it seeks to make good on the Government&rsquo;s commitment in the health strategy to provide an extra 3,000 beds notwithstanding the large amount of resiling from that commitment during the four or five years since it was made.</P>
      <P>I do not have a problem in principle with the notion of providing incentives for the provision of private beds. The important matters are how access to those beds is decided and the standard and nature of care people receive. It is crucial to have joint waiting lists and that people receive access to hospital beds, whether private or public, <Col N="277"/>on the basis of their medical needs and not on the amount of money they have in their back pockets. This is a complicated problem. I am convinced the policy articulated by my party at the last election, namely a universal insurance scheme, is the best way to introduce a market mechanism to give choice while at the same time ensuring access is based on need. That is a debate for another day.</P>
      <P>I am genuinely unclear as to where this is going. We seem to be intervening in and interfering with the private-public mix in a way that does not make any sense and is not coherent within the overall health policy of the Government. The Government discusses having consultants on public-only contracts. I presume those consultants would not be facilitated, or working, in private hospitals. The Government seeks to encourage consultants to provide more of their time in public hospitals while at the same time seeking to construct more private beds.</P>
      <P>We must go one of two ways. As I stated, I believe access controlled through a health insurance scheme is the best way. However, if we do not do so, we must make a strict delineation between public and private so they exist on two separate levels. Private should mean a facility built and run with private money for profit where people pay for the facility and the treatment they receive.</P>
      <P>While I agree with the thrust of the pension provisions in the Bill, they do not go far enough. A few months ago, the Pensions Board produced an interesting report with a number of recommendations, most of which I agree with although they do not go far enough either. My view is that we must provide for compulsory contributions over and above what people now pay through PRSI. A voluntary system will not work because too many people are on too low an income and the choice is too distant for them. Many people will not be in a position to make genuine proper provision in the future.</P>
      <P>That aside, we must deal with the scandal of people abusing the provisions introduced for pension provision in order to avoid income and inheritance tax. The Minister sought to do so through introducing caps which are too low. Provision for lump-sum payments of &euro;1.25 million is not necessary. It should be much less than that. We should not tolerate a situation where people can have pensions of up to &euro;5 million which can then accumulate. I assume &euro;5 million is the total cap including accumulation and increase of assets retained in the fund. Those numbers are far too high. While I am not an actuary, I believe a pension fund of that nature allows for an annual annuity of much higher than what people can reasonably claim they need to live. When the PRSI scheme was introduced many years ago, a cap was introduced which is now approximately &euro;40,000. We should go down the same route here. The State should seek to provide assistance on an EET basis to provide for a proper pension. <Col N="278"/>However, beyond a certain level people are well able to look after themselves and do not need tax incentives or benefits.</P>
      <P>I agree with what has been done on the artists&rsquo; exemption scheme. We hope the relatively small number of people, amounting to a couple of dozen, seriously impacted by the measure will stay. If they do not do so it will not be a loss to the Exchequer as they do not pay anything in the first place. I approve of the provisions made.</P>
      <P>In the nine or ten years in which I have spoken on Finance Bills, this is the first occasion I have chosen not to mention income or corporation tax. The reason is that after ten or 12 years of changing income and corporation tax rates and a great deal of debate, we must be open and honest and state we have reached a time when no serious party argues for an increase in rates. By any objective examination of where the economy stands, we do not need an increase in tax income to bring about the social progress and improvement in public services for which parties such as mine argue. Choosing to ignore these issues is a signal to the Minister that we will not play that game.</P>

	<P>This year&rsquo;s Finance Bill will bring about real change and reform of our tax system. The ESRI described the budget on which this Bill is based as &ldquo;perhaps the most progressive budget package for many years &mdash; poorer households did proportionately better than rich ones&rdquo;. Fr. Sean Healy of the Conference of Religious of Ireland, CORI, describes it as a fair budget, looking after those in society who need help. The ESRI and CORI are reputable organisations.</P>
      <P>It is Government and Health Service Executive policy to try to keep elderly people at home for as long as possible. For this strategy to work it is vital that the services provided are affordable and dependable. The addition of 13.5% VAT to its cost has a major impact on the affordability of the service. This charge does not apply to home care in the United Kingdom or other EU countries where the service is exempt from VAT. If the service is licensed and regulated the European Commission will not take issue with it.</P>
      <P>To keep an old person in a residential home can cost up to &euro;1,000 a week, whereas a professional home care service of three hours a day, five days a week costs less. Many business people and entrepreneurs see an opportunity to provide professional home care services whose staff are <Col N="279"/>properly trained, insured and paid to provide a home care service. It is far better for older people to be in their own homes than to be in residential home care. It is important to do away with this additional 13.5% on the cost of the home carer. This should happen as part of the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s plan to keep older people in their own homes. Most of those in residential care do not need to be there full time.</P>
      <P>I am happy to have put the issue of child care on the political radar last year. I have been on a mission in recent months to put aging and ageism on the political radar. I held three meetings on this topic in Dublin South-East. At each meeting people cried out for help because they do not want to retire at the age of 65. This mandatory retirement age is discriminatory. Normally we react to EU directives but in this case we should take the initiative, and in the spirit of Council Directive 2000/78/EC, take this upon ourselves. People live longer and are healthier than in the past and many do not want to retire.</P>
      <P>In the public sector people must retire at 65. When a person takes up a job in the private sector an obligatory retirement age is set in the employee&rsquo;s contract. The result is that thousands of older people must retire against their wills every year, even though they have the ability to retain their jobs. That is ridiculous for people who are skilled and experienced. Gay Byrne, at 72 years of age, is a perfect example of an older person bringing his skills, experience, and leadership to bear on road safety.</P>
      <P>With regard to women, when I got married in 1969 I had to give up my job because I was working in the public sector.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Parlon, to the House, and thank Senator White for sharing her time with me.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Finance Bill which builds on the progress made over the past seven or eight budgets and their respective Finance Bills. Much has been said about planning, evaluation, review, a change of economic circumstance and climate, and how we plan for that. That constant evaluation and reform is also necessary in the tax system. This has been ongoing from the day this Government and its coalition predecessor took office in 1997. The Government has striven to make the tax system fairer and more transparent and to identify and eliminate the devices used by professionals to get around our tax laws. By making the system more transparent and equitable, the aim is to encourage greater compliance among taxpayers in general.</P>
      <P>Tax policy must achieve a delicate balance between promoting enterprise and employment for the creation of jobs and providing for, and facilitating the creation of, a better quality of life for everyone. This Government presides over one of the best performing economies in the world. The standard indicators bring that home forcefully, including, the lowest unemployment rate, the 2 million employed, which is a record for the State, the increase in the number of jobs created last year, and the tax system which remains highly competitive and is ranked first for both personal and corporation tax, inflation or investment.</P>
      <P>Opposition spokespersons and the media have recently teased out the question of investment in infrastructure. Some say that despite the recent remarkable increase in infrastructural investment which was used to promote economic development, competitiveness and regional balance, we should fast-track it further and borrow more to spend more on infrastructure. That is neither wise nor prudent. The Government&rsquo;s massively increased funding for development reflects an attempt to make up for a significant deficit in this area, which retarded the potential for economic development and job creation. Our economic progress reflects the increase in this respect. The plans for the future are prudent and achievable.</P>
      <P>Some speakers referred to capital investment. The Government seeks value for money, is committed to proper management of public spending and is determined to get the best possible return for this. There are many examples to support this.</P>
      <P>The Minister announced 12 new measures late last year to increase the efficiency of returns from capital investment. These measures are aimed at eliminating occurrences of wasteful expenditure. Of the most prominent examples, 19 of the 22 major road projects valued above &euro;15 million are on budget and ahead of schedule. That is not to say that everything is perfect. The Minister&rsquo;s <Col N="281"/>actions and decisions late last year are clearly indicative of his appreciation that much more needs to be done to bring about even greater efficiencies, a greater degree of value for money and thereby greater competitiveness.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I did not hear Senator John Paul Phelan speaking so I cannot comment on his contribution but Senator Quinn and others referred to planning for the future. I compliment Senator McDowell for being balanced and positive in his approach. I have served in both Houses since 1981, and if one looks back on the history of Governments through the years and at the planning or lack of it and the rollover of policies, programmes and finances from year to year, any fair-minded or objective observer would have to compliment this Government, the Minister for Finance, the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, and the Minister&rsquo;s predecessor, Mr. McCreevy.</P>
      <P>There is ample evidence of forward planning. I accept it was never more necessary, essential and vital because coming from where we were in the dark times of the 1980s. Our current phenomenal success, both economically and socially, is unsustainable without ongoing evaluation, review, reform and planning. We are frequently reminded we are a very small and open economy and are exposed to changes in the world market over which we have no control. Accordingly, we must play to our strengths at home. There are now fewer manufacturing jobs than there were ten years ago. We have a major reliance on the building industry. Our cost competitiveness has declined, relatively speaking, and we must ensure our inflation rate is lower than in competitor countries. Our dependency ratio is an added factor. These are the main target areas on which the Government has focused and for which it is planning ahead. I compliment the Government on the various, extensive programmes it has set out.</P>
      <P>Senator White referred to ageism. The pensions area has been targeted by the Government from an early stage. It might seem trivial to the casual observer but it is very significant in terms of future implications and contingency plans which need to be in place for the ageing profile of our population. The former Minister for Finance, Mr. McCreevy, set up the National Pensions Reserve Fund to take on the burden which will inevitably be placed on State pensions in the next 25 to 30 years. His successor as Minister, Deputy Cowen, and the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, are taking on a related aspect, the inadequacy of private pension provision by those in employment.</P>
      <P>I commend these approaches. It is significant in terms of long-term planning and the implications it will have for the finances of the State. Important basic ground-work and planning has been done. I also commend the measures to close off the loopholes which have been availed of by certain very wealthy people. The figures indicate it is not the great number of dodgers we are led to <Col N="282"/>believe, nevertheless, the few involved have used very clever devices. I commend the Minister for taking on that issue and making firm decisions on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State and his officials, both in the House and in the antechamber. When we considered the Finance Bill two years ago I was amazed to learn there were so many Department of Finance officials both in the antechamber and in the House. Perhaps it is a reflection on the Seanad that they travel in such numbers.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I was glad I heard the last few minutes of contributions. Senator White reminded me of the typical Fianna F&aacute;il spin. In the budget, the big announcement was about the &euro;1000 child care grant. That has now turned out to be &euro;750, which will be paid only from August next. One cannot blame the public for being cynical when the big fanfare last December was about &euro;1000. People are now being short-changed again, getting &euro;750 instead, and from what I understand they will be lucky to see it in August.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I was glad Senator White also reminded me of the announcement during the budget of the home help packages amounting to &euro;150 million, which we learned a little later was &euro;50 million per year over three years. I am amazed when I hear people on the Government side saying that 29% of people in nursing homes should not be there and should be at home in their own environment. I challenge the Government to prove that and explain to us how many people have now left nursing homes and are being adequately cared for in their own houses. I do not believe the figure of 29% is realisable.</P>
      <P>One needs to go through everything the Government says with a fine tooth-comb. My colleague Senator Brian Hayes this week got a reply from the Minister of Finance which showed that more people than ever are now paying the top rate of tax. It is a myth that we have a low-tax Government or economy.</P>
      <P>We have also seen major squandering of public money by the Government. A certain amount of arrogance is now creeping into the Government, especially perhaps into the Progressive Democrats. They genuinely think the world cannot go on without them. I saw the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform give that impression on &ldquo;The Week in Politics&rdquo; last week, rubbishing any potential partnership down the line with the Green Party. Unfortunately, Senator Minihan has caught the same bug this week. If the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, is attending his parliamentary party meeting today, he might tell his colleagues in Government that the world was founded without the Progressive Democrats and Fianna F&aacute;il and will go on without them in the future.</P>

	<P>I remind Senator Minihan that in the years 1994-97 we had the first budget surplus, unemployment was consistently falling and the economy was very well managed. There is no point in the Government giving the impression it knows all the answers because it does not. It has regularly squandered public money. The PPARS system was a fiasco and Fine Gael had to highlight that before the Government realised it. Fine Gael also highlighted the nursing homes debacle. The e-voting system, which cost &euro;60 million, collapsed and, of course, nobody resigned or was accountable. Unfortunately the taxpayer had to pick up the tab not only for that but for the ongoing costs and depreciation of the machines.</P>

	<P>Did Senator Browne see the poll on Sunday night?</P>

	<P>The Senator should stick to the subject.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FeargalBrowne"><NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
	<P>If the Government had not wasted so much money in the past few years and had managed the economy properly it could now be introducing major tax cuts. Unfortunately, this Government does not seem to realise that money squandered could be tallied with the benefits which it could give to taxpayers, and the improved public services it could fund. Up to &euro;0.5 billion has been spent on the Dublin Port tunnel and the roof is still leaking.</P>
      <P>I accept more people have returned to work, but that puts great pressure on the Government to provide better facilities for people. If we go out of our way to encourage more women back into the workforce it is obvious and logical that we must improve child care facilities. The Government has taken steps in that direction but in many cases too late and too slowly.</P><Col N="284"/>
      <P>I came to the House today to speak in particular about the Comerama issue. I am disappointed that in the Finance Bill the Government missed a unique opportunity to rectify a wrong done a number of years ago when the Comerama factory closed. The workers were promised by the T&aacute;naiste and then Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, that the new, enhanced redundancy package would apply to them. That was witnessed by Government Deputies as well as by the Opposition. The Finance Bill could rectify the matter but the Government has missed its chance.</P>
      <P>I have attended many public meetings in Castlecomer and public demonstrations outside the gates of Leinster House. Deputies McGuinness, Nolan and others have also attended. The Government had the opportunity to rectify the matter but has flunked it. An amendment could have been tabled on Committee Stage of the Finance Bill. Deputies McGuinness and Nolan are members of the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service and it is regrettable they did not take the opportunity to table a Government amendment to rectify the wrongdoing.</P>
      <P>Ordinary workers in the Castlecomer area are down about &euro;10,000. If they had known they could not avail of the enhanced redundancy package they could have continued working for one extra day per week, and that would have got them into the time period for the new package. Only a small number of workers are involved.</P>
      <P Just="Left">It is disgraceful that a Government could be so arrogant. Many crocodile tears have been shed by Government Deputies. Even Fianna F&aacute;il Deputies said it was the fault of the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, and that when a Fianna F&aacute;il Minister came into the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment everything would change. What happened was that the Fianna F&aacute;il Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin, did not acknowledge letters from the group. That is an indication of the arrogance. After the party had a bad result in the local elections in the Castlecomer area one would imagine it would have learned a lesson. The outgoing Fianna F&aacute;il councillor was blamed and unfortunately lost his seat. The Government still does not listen. It had an opportunity in the Finance Bill to table an amendment to rectify the wrongdoing but did not do so.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Will the Minister of State give an indication, for example, in next year&rsquo;s Finance Bill, that the Government would support an amendment? While the House can table a recommendation it is weak in the sense that it cannot amend a money Bill. Perhaps Senator John Paul Phelan and I will table a recommendation from this side of the House and ask the Minister to look at that particular aspect with a view to rectifying the position. Ordinary workers in the Castlecomer area are down &euro;10,000 on a redundancy package. <Col N="285"/>Some of the workers involved received the enhanced redundancy package because they continued to work. The reason they left early was to save a sister plant in Donegal for which they got no reward but were in fact penalised.</P>
      <P>We continue to hear from the Government of the huge amount of money in the economy. This problem could be solved with a small amount of money. Some years ago the T&aacute;naiste took a keen interest in the National Sweepstakes and rectified a wrong. This case is similar.</P>
      <P>When replying to the debate I ask the Minister to indicate whether his party has learned anything from the local elections? His party is acutely aware of it, given that it cost the PDs a seat in the local elections in Kilkenny. A relation of the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, stood for the party. Were it not for that issue he would have been elected. Will the Minister of State clarify whether it is intended to address that issue in the Finance Bill and explain why the Government did not avail of the unique opportunity to do so when the Bill was going through Committee Stage in the other House?</P>

It is to the credit of the Government that the economy continues to perform so well and the success may well continue for another 12 years.</P>
      <P>The Finance Bill is about real change and reform of the tax system. A recent ESRI report said this is one of the most progressive budgets for many years and that poor households will do better than rich households.

	<P>This Bill will remove all those on the minimum wage from the tax net. It will exclude workers on the average industrial wage from the highest tax rate. I have done some think<Col N="286"/>ing on this issue. Let us compare 1997 with 2006. In 1997 the average industrial wage was &euro;19,400 whereas in 2006 it is &euro;32,000, an increase of about &euro;12,000.</P>

    </Speaker>

	<P>Income is increasing while tax is reducing. Let me repeat that, income is increasing while tax is reducing. That is a lovely line. I ask Senators not to forget it when they are out and about. It is a nice line to have in one&rsquo;s thinking. It also means one has more money in one&rsquo;s pocket. I could not ask for more than that. Everybody would like to think they have more money in their pockets.</P>
      <P Just="Left">
        
        The proposal regarding SSIAs target the lower income group. That the Minister is enticing people to put their money into a pension fund is welcome. They will also get money back. However, a public relations job must be done on this issue. We are not getting across the message on the simple things of a quality of life and more money in one&rsquo;s pocket. When I am out in the evening and having a chat I like to be able to say in simple language that one has more money in one&rsquo;s pocket and that one can put one&rsquo;s SSIA money into a pension fund, particularly if one is below a certain income and can avail of a tax rebate. These are the issues I like to talk about.</P>
      <P Just="Left">In regard to care of the elderly and childminding, one can earn up to &euro;10,000 tax free. These are welcome measures. I could continue to speak on them for the next hour but time does not permit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Ormonde for sharing time. I wish to share time with Senator Maurice Hayes. I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, to the House and the Minister, Deputy Cowen, who was here earlier. I welcome also senior officials from the Department of Finance. That senior officials are present to listen to the views of Senators gives greater recognition to the House. The officials, who are specialists in particular areas, come from different sectors of the Department of Finance.</P>
      <P>This is one of the best budgets of the century. The issues were dealt with very favourably. For example, the Shannon tax corridor is being phased out in a reasonable manner. This will allow people to adjust. All sides of the House lobbied the Minister, Deputy Cowen, and he <Col N="287"/>responded extremely well as did the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, who would have supported it.</P>
      <P>The urban renewal scheme has been a phenomenal success. I am not sure whether it can be renewed but I ask that it be reconsidered. There are parts of County Roscommon and elsewhere in need of urban renewal. At present major urban renewal work is taking place in Roscommon town. That scheme was implemented in conjunction with Roscommon County Council, of which I was a member, and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, and the areas designated will boost the centre of the town.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I compliment the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, for pushing the decentralisation programme. All politics is local. That Land Registry is being decentralised to Roscommon town and will be a great boost for the town. Roscommon will become the registry centre of Ireland. If, as I hope, I can have my Registration of Wills Bill passed it will be implemented at the General Register Office in Roscommon. It took many years to bring the General Register Office to Roscommon town. People should be patient in this regard. In 1992, when I was a Deputy&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>Senator Leyden to continue without interruption.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>That was what I said on the night but everyone disagreed with me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden"><NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
	<P>That is fair enough. I encourage the Government to push ahead with decentralisation. When the General Register Office came it was as welcome as when it was announced and it has meant so much to the town of Roscommon. The Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, was present for the turning of the sod. The office has now been built. I will not dwell on the new road structures.</P>
      <P>Great interest has been shown in the issue of private-public development of hospitals. A private hospital located with a public hospital is a good combination.</P>
      <P>The Minister responded well to the intensive lobbying on the Shannon tax corridor, the fuel allowances and other aspects of the budget, including biofuels. The announcement yesterday regarding geothermal heating systems that were <Col N="288"/>approved, heat pumps and all the alternative energies encouraged in this budget are welcome. There has never been a more receptive Minister for Finance than this Minister. He listened patiently to Members of the House and others outside it and his budget reflects the care and attention given to it by him and his senior officials. I take this opportunity of congratulating him on the budget. I know the Bill will be passed unanimously by this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrMauriceHayes"><NameTxt>Dr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I am grateful to Senators Ormonde and Leyden for sharing their time with me. Since they got hassled somewhat, perhaps the Leas-Chathaoirleach might consider giving me a minute or two of injury time.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and congratulate him not only on this budget but on his stewardship of the economy in recent years, which has provided stability and certainty for business and others and an environment in which growth can take place. That is a wonderful achievement.</P>
      <P>I want to deal with the small print in the Bill, especially section 20. I congratulate the Minister on making it possible for people to make donations to charity by way of securities and so on as well as money. That will be hugely important to universities and others but it raises the point of the need for governance in the field of charities. I hope the Minister will give some impetus as a result of this measure to the emergence of a charities Bill, which would provide for transparency and accountability in the provision of accounts by way of a registrar of charities or some sort of control in that field. The responsible bodies are anxious that such a measure would be brought forward. I congratulate the Minister on behalf of the voluntary charities and institutions with which I am involved. It is a courageous and forward-looking measure, as is section 23 providing for the protection of the national heritage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>With the permission of the House I wish to share my time with Senator Ulick Burke.</P>

	<P>Is that agreed? Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House and echo the words of Senator Maurice Hayes. I congratulate the Minister on the budget, a sentiment I expressed on budget night. I particularly welcome the move he made on an issue I raised with him last year, namely, the importance of taking the minimum wage out of the tax net &mdash; it was done &mdash; and on the issue of child care, which I also raised with him. I recognise the advances that have been made in those two difficult areas. There are many other aspects of the Bill on which I could dwell but it is moving in the right direction. There are areas in which I would like to see more advances. There are aspects with <Col N="289"/>which I am not completely happy and there are suggestions I would like the Minister to take on board.</P>
      <P>I want to make a few points which I know have been dealt with in the other House. I am hardly the person the Minister would expect to be making a case for private hospitals but I examined closely the various submissions sent to us and from a business point of view and in view of this, lengthening the capital allowance period from ten to 15 years in section 5 makes it difficult for those institutions to make money. In fairness to them, it is a Government decision that it should be included. I am not sure whether it is a good decision generally but if it is to be included it should be left at ten years in terms of a business plan. They need that small support.</P>
      <P>I realise the question of the Arts Council has been raised with the Minister in terms of those issues it has raised with many of us on many occasions over the past year, and I am aware the Minister met with members of the council. I met John McGahern after he met with the Minister and he was thankful on a number of fronts for the hearing they got. The issue was dealt with sensitively. On the last occasion we debated the matter in the House I said the issue should be left as it is but the Minister chose to make some changes. I accept they were done in a sensitive manner which has maintained the integrity of what it was intended to do from the outset. However, the proposal the Arts Council made to the Minister to extend the artists&rsquo; exemption scheme to other areas like choreography should be done. That is something that might be examined.</P>
      <P>I know what the Minister&rsquo;s officials will say when I talk about VAT exemption on certain issues. They will say we hear this every year in respect of education and so on but the question of VAT exemption on supply of goods or expertise to non-profit making events of an artistic nature, which have been so defined, should also be included and I ask the Minister to examine that.</P>
      <P>I want to make an important point to the Minister. I realise this is something he and I have touched on many times on a one to one basis but I ask him to consider, when speaking to my good friends sitting behind him, that there is chaos in Europe today. There are problems with transport, health, education and local authorities throughout France. The same is the case throughout the United Kingdom. We have already seen similar incidents earlier this year in Italy, Germany and Belgium. The reason they have not happened here &mdash; I said this earlier and I am sorry to be repeating myself &mdash; is because of social partnership and benchmarking.</P>
      <P>Whatever anybody says about benchmarking, it has delivered stability in the public service. A good example of it was when a colleague from the other side of the House highlighted earlier an issue that he felt social partnership did not cover or deal with adequately. I thought to myself that <Col N="290"/>was just one issue out of all the issues dealt with in social partnership. We have the best strike record in Europe and I ask the Minister to keep that in mind as we go forward.</P>
      <P>The Minister might read the Charlemagne column in this week&rsquo;s <i>The Economist</i> with a view to altering the viewpoint and attitude of the Department of Finance towards the teaching profession. I believe he will find it very helpful and it will be a pin-up picture for some of my friends sitting behind the Minister in that it will make life very interesting. I ask the Minister to read and enjoy it.</P>
      <P>In my contribution to the debate on last year&rsquo;s Finance Bill I asked the reason we could not get back to the issue of grants for eco-friendly changes to houses. I refer here to micro-generators, wind and water generators, solar panels, geothermal heating and so on. I express my appreciation for the announcement made this year on that issue, which is a progressive step.</P>
      <P>I wish to mention another announcement which did not get enough debate. Approximately six months ago I had a row in this House with the Minister for Education and Science on the OECD report on third level education. Attempts at depriving the institutes of technology in doctorate research and the awarding of doctorates was a backward step. I was delighted with the budget announcement of the additional resources and investment in the doctoral area and the requirement that it be spread around the third level institutions. That is the way forward in the future because there should be no absolutes or inflexibilities attaching to this area. That announcement was very welcome.</P>
      <P>I will leave the Minister with a progressive thought.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator has two minutes remaining if he wishes to share time with Senator Burke.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister has indicated he will give me a minute of his time; I thank him for that. The biggest issues we are facing currently are eco-environmental issues. They were raised over the weekend by the Green Party but we are aware of them. They are issues of dependency on oil and the problem of waste and wasted energy. I end my contribution with this thought. I did some research on this area and looked at west Kerry as an example. The energy needs of all of west Kerry could be catered for with three 1.5 MW output wind generators. They would cater for everything and put something into the grid. Similarly, west Kerry could deal with all its waste. If any community is prepared to look after all its waste and energy needs and feed more back into the grid, those communities should get some reward in the form of a tax break for doing so. It is an opportunity to do something creative and progressive. All politics is local, as the Minister and I know, and every time there is a proposal, <Col N="291"/>whether it is for an incinerator, a wind energy project or whatever, an objection is made but let people buy into this idea. Give them control and responsibility for their own environment and let us look at doing something creative. I ask the Minister to consider that for next year&rsquo;s budget.</P>
      <P>The energy regulator has refused to accept for the next two years any more applications for alternative energy connections to the national grid. Rational reasons were given for this decision, although it sounds irrational. I understand the reasons and agree with some, but not all, of them. However, this is not the way forward and we should take steps in this respect. Significant advances in micro-generation have been made. When I was first elected to this House, everyone, including me, thought that we had more or less reached the limit in terms of hydroelectric energy. Now, with the advances in micro-generators, that is no longer the case and smaller rivers and areas can also be developed. However, this would probably require a tax break.</P>
      <P>I regard the Minister&rsquo;s proposals to lift excise duties on various forms of biofuels to be positive and progressive. I have spoken to people involved in the industry to inquire why more people and farmers have not become involved in it. The explanation was simple and pertained to a lack of certainty. People require a fixed timescale and someone must state that it is planned to hold the excise duties in this fashion for the next ten years, in order that people can enter the industry at agricultural, supply and product levels.</P>
      <P>While I would like to discuss some other issues, I cannot do so. I welcome the Finance Bill and applaud the Minister for many of the advances he has made. I also look forward to hearing his next budget. I ask him to take on board some of the issues I have raised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank Senator O&rsquo;Toole for sharing his time. I welcome the Minister to the House and I welcome many aspects of the Finance Bill and the last budget, in so far as they have reduced the PAYE burden, as well as the tax take in general. In that regard, is it possible to find some mechanism for people who have overpaid their tax? I refer to those who are not particularly vigilant and are not aware that they may have done so. The recent statistics provided by the Department of Finance show that millions of euro, which are properly due to be repaid to the taxpayers, still remain with the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
      <P>Over the years, I have often requested that a valuable and worthwhile tax incentive for the upper Shannon region should be extended to the middle and lower Shannon regions. The scheme gave new life to the upper Shannon area, particularly to County Leitrim. It would also give new life to the areas adjoining Lough Derg and particularly to east Galway. The results of a report have shown that the highest percentage of real poverty <Col N="292"/>in Ireland still exists there. I hope the Minister will consider this possibility in the future. If the middle Shannon area was to receive the benefit of the same kick-start which was given to the upper Shannon region, it could lead to development and to an increase in the income of many people there. At present, incomes in the area are low.</P>
      <P>In the few minutes which remain to me, I want to raise the question of the introduction of stealth taxes. I refer to increases in electricity bills and increases by local authorities. At present, one of the most pressing issues is that local authorities are introducing increases for services charges, some of which will never be provided by them. While the Minister has provided property-based tax reliefs in the budget, local authorities have clawed them back, particularly in the area of planning, for service charges, parking, amenities and so on. At present, local authorities do not know where to stop and someone in the Government should call a halt to it once and for all.</P>
      <P>I also wish to mention the Government&rsquo;s present financing of the Department of Agriculture and Food. Proportionally, this has decreased substantially in recent years. While the single payments that now constitute part of agriculture were to be straightforward and simple, that is not the case. I know this is not part of the Minister&rsquo;s brief, but significant numbers of people are without such contributions thus far this year in respect of last year&rsquo;s payments, and have not yet been paid. Something must be done in this respect, as well as to recognise agriculture to some degree. While it will never again be the primary industry, the present rate of the flight from the land in the Minister&rsquo;s constituency and my adjoining constituency will inevitably lead to a deserted area. I ask the Minister to consider the Government&rsquo;s commitment to agriculture by providing financial support to keep young people on the land. At present, many young people do not consider the installation grant to be worth applying for because of the hassle involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I sincerely thank all Members who contributed to the debate. I wish to reply to some of the key points made. As for various comments made by Senator John Paul Phelan on the review of reliefs and incentives, I must point out, by way of background, that I have ordered the review of two dozen tax incentive schemes in the past year to ensure we get value for money. As a result, I propose to phase out or modify many of these incentives. Some are being left in place because they can deliver value for money for the public. These reviews have been published so that members of the public can judge for themselves the actions which the Government is taking and the reasons for those actions. I am pleased with the outcome of this thorough review process.</P>
      <P>Senator McDowell made a thoughtful contribution about tax reliefs and their role in stimulating various sectors of the economy. His remarks <Col N="293"/>showed that he had carefully studied the various reports into tax reliefs which were carried out in 2005 and which were acted on by me in the 2006 budget and Finance Bill.</P>
      <P>The cost of tax reliefs and the question of who benefits from them is as follows. Page B.23 of the budget 2006 booklet contains a table detailing the destination of tax reliefs. Members will note that of the &euro;10.8 billion in relief for the tax year 2002, the latest year for which figures are available, a sum of &euro;5.6 billion or 52% went on personal tax credits and reliefs, a sum of &euro;3.4 billion or 31% to help fund pensions and savings, and significantly, more than &euro;1 billion or 10% went on capital allowances for traders, including farmers, to ensure their viability and job creation capacity. Those tax credits and reliefs include mortgage interest relief, medical insurance and medical expense relief. Hence, the vast bulk of tax relief each year goes to ordinary taxpayers at all income levels and to sustain business investment and jobs. This point is often forgotten about in this debate.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Senators John Paul Phelan and McDowell have quite rightly pointed out that tax reliefs and incentives can be very effective. Tax incentives have the capacity to deliver economic benefits to our people as a whole. Senator Mansergh also made this point. The evidence for this is there for all to see in the shape of significant developments, regenerations and improvements which have resulted from some of these incentives in Dublin. Examples include the development of the Custom House Docks area, Temple Bar, the successful development of Tallaght town centre and, more recently, the major development of the HARP area in Smithfield, in which more than &euro;200 million was invested between 1999 and 2004. Outside of Dublin, one can point to various urban renewal schemes which have helped to revitalise and transform the inner city areas of Galway and Limerick in particular. It has also worked very well in many other towns.</P>
      <P>Tax incentives have a role to play in economic management. It is right to use them at the right time and in the right circumstances. However, as Members on all sides have noted, they can outlive their usefulness. Senator John Paul Phelan has suggested that I should have terminated the various reliefs and incentives immediately. This is not the approach suggested by the consultants. A &ldquo;soft landing&rdquo; approach is being adopted in order not to damage our very successful economy.</P>
      <P>As for Senator Phelan&rsquo;s call for a cost-benefit analysis of the scheme of relief for the construction of private hospitals and nursing homes, I remind him that the schemes were reviewed by Indecon Economic Consultants as part of the overall review of property tax incentives in 2005. Indecon consulted widely in the course of its review, including consultations with the Department of Health and Children and the Health Service Executive. Its report was published on 6 February 2006 and is available on the Depart<Col N="294"/>ment&rsquo;s website. The consultants recommended that capital allowances for private hospitals and nursing homes should continue.</P>
      <P>Private health care is a long-established feature of the system of health care provision in Ireland and acts as a strong complement to the publicly-funded system. Members should consider the number of private nursing places that have been provided under the tax incentive schemes introduced by the former Minister for Finance, Mr. McCreevy. Had the Government not done so, I would hate to think of where our care for the elderly programme, which already has service pressures, would be at present. The Government is committed to exploring fully the scope for the private sector to provide additional capacity in the health system.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>The key objective is to provide the required extra capacity, whether this is in the public or private sectors. A number of Government policies support the co-existence of public and private health care such as the designation of private and semi-private beds in public hospitals; income tax relief on private health insurance premiums; income tax relief on medical and dental expenses, including nursing home fees; while the National Treatment Purchase Fund sources capacity in private hospitals for public patients which has greatly decreased waiting times.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The average waiting time for medical procedures was the big issue in health when this Government took office. There are now other service pressures, such as overcrowded accident and emergency departments, with which we must deal. The synergy between public and private health care can work for a greater public good, especially for public patients. The T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s policy direction to the Health Service Executive to build private hospitals on public sites will free up beds for public patients in public hospitals and is another example of how increased capacity can be created, benefiting public patients and others. The idea that private sector investment excludes a benefit for public patients is patently ridiculous.</P>
      <P>I am glad to note the support expressed by Senators for section 17, which contains the measure on the restriction of reliefs. Senator Henry and others referred to the listing of the donations scheme in section 17 which related to the restriction of reliefs. I considered this issue very carefully and discussed it with Opposition spokespersons on Committee Stage of the Bill in the D&aacute;il. Omitting the scheme from the specified reliefs list would reduce the effectiveness of the restriction, the aim of which is to increase the effective tax rate of those on high incomes towards 20%. A tax relief is available for donations, once it is used as part of the 50% availability for tax relief. The suggestion has been made that if people already use that relief for other purposes, they should have the private discretion to provide for further relief for donations. Such a discretion would be differen<Col N="295"/>tiated by a person&rsquo;s income at any given time, as opposed to those who do not have that prospect.</P>
      <P>I have sympathy for the point, but the focus of this budget has been to bring about a situation where we eliminate the possibility of high-income earners paying no tax at all. Let us deal with that first and let us observe how the specified relief scheme works during the course of the year. I am open to the idea of developing philanthropy and I am aware that there are more and more high-income earners in this country who may be interested in allowing some of their resources to be diverted into areas of public good. Given that the proportion of high-income individuals who will be affected by the restriction is relatively small, the effectiveness of the donations scheme will be unaffected in most cases.</P>
      <P>Where relief under the donations scheme has been denied in any one year as a result of the restriction, it can be carried forward to the next year and the following years. In other words, if the 50% limit for relief is used up in one year, it can be availed of again in the following years. It is not a question of people being denied relief, rather it is more like a deferral of the relief in the interest of the equitable principle of people paying tax in any given year. A balance of principles must be achieved.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Senator John Paul Phelan asked me the reason for the changes in film relief. The significant improvements in the section 481 relief for film production were introduced in light of the representations made by the Irish Film Board and supported by the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism and his Department. The key argument was that the Irish film industry faced significant challenges from the increasingly competitive international tax environment for film production. Particular significance was placed upon upcoming changes to UK tax legislation. The arguments of the Irish Film Board, supported by the analysis of the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism, persuaded me that there was a case for improving the relief. Accordingly, I proposed an increase in the overall cap on expenditure that can be raised under section 481 from &euro;15 million to &euro;35 million and increased the existing 55% to 66% limit on the proportion of a film budget that can be raised under section 481 to an overall limit of 80%.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Senator Phelan also questioned the effectiveness of the five-year scheme of targeted excise relief for biofuels with a view to assisting biofuels to achieve an initial target of 2% penetration of the transport fuel market by 2008. I disagree with that view. This is a major expansion of the current two-year pilot scheme. It was sought by the line Department involved and I simply acceded to that request. It is an area we must develop.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to deal with the issues that were raised by Members and much work has been done to achieve that.</P>
      <P>The relief to which I referred when fully operational in 2008 is expected to support the use and production of around 163 million litres of biofuels per year. This is 20 times the current level of biofuels that is relieved of excise. We are starting from a very small base, but if I bring forward an initiative that increases capacity twenty-fold, it is a just question of building up that capacity to deal with the increase. I also introduced, for a pilot two-year period with effect from 1 January 2006, VRT relief of 50% for new flexible fuel vehicles, that is, vehicles capable of running on both conventional fuel and high-grade biofuels.</P>
      <P>Senators Ross and Mansergh recognise the success of this Government in managing the economy. As has been rightly pointed out, our taxation regime regarding personal income tax and business tax has had a significant role in the success of the Irish economy in recent years. Senator Mansergh pointed out that we are at an important stage in our political development when the Green Party has decided that it will not be seeking increases in income tax rates or corporation tax rates. I presume that is not because it wants to get into Government, but because it is the right thing to do.</P>
      <P>Our taxation regime has had a significant role in the success of the Irish economy. A low income tax wedge is vitally important for employment because by lowering costs it makes it easier for companies to take on additional employees. This is an important part of Ireland&rsquo;s competitive edge. Senator Quinn suggested a note of caution in future economic planning. The major challenges for the next five years include continuing to achieve high growth, rising living standards and full employment, supporting families and achieving cost-effective and world class public services. These are challenges which the Government will strive to meet. We acknowledge that the job is not complete, but we must work towards it all the time.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The Senator wondered whether we are making the right decisions for the long term and I believe we are doing so. He stated that it was not a dra<Col N="297"/>matic budget. There have been changes in pension relief. Tax changes have helped the low paid and the ESRI stated that this is a most progressive budget in that respect as it has favoured lower income groups more than others.</P>
      <P>There have been changes in the rental market and landlords must now register under the Private Tenancies Residential Act 2004 if they are to receive tax relief. A strategic innovation fund of &euro;300 million has been set aside for higher education over the next five years. A significant package has been provided for child care, costing over &euro;1.5 billion. These decisions are right for the long term because they reflect the greater economic participation by women in our society and the need to cater for policy initiatives to deal with that social change.</P>
      <P>Long-term decisions have also been made on the National Pensions Reserve Fund. This strategic decision has been examined by my colleagues who are in the midst of pension crises in their own countries within the European Union. Long-term decisions have been taken in other areas, such as the strategic innovation fund and the setting up of the NTMA.</P>
      <P>All of those significant, milestone decisions are being taken with a view to the long term. When we hit a bad patch in 2002 during an international recession, the Opposition told us to raid the National Pensions Reserve Fund immediately. The advocates for short-termism were on the Opposition benches rather than the Government side. However, the Government insisted on maintaining the statutory autonomy of the National Pensions Reserve Fund regarding our paying at least 1% of GDP into it annually and enabling it to decide its own investment portfolio within the usual international investment criteria.</P>
      <P>All those decisions provide confirmation of our need to look forward to demographic changes over the next ten, 15 or 20 years, thus avoiding the problems and learning the lessons of what has now come about in continental countries, which have a more advanced demographic profile than ours. We have an opportunity to cater for the future by making provision over successive years up to 2055 under the legislation that established the National Pensions Reserve Fund.</P>
      <P>I contend that there are strategic decisions, and not only regarding how we have attracted foreign direct investment and achieved the lowest taxation wedge for workers. It has all been done in the context of social partnership, where the macro-economic consensus is followed. One hopes that next year&rsquo;s election will help people see that there is broad macro-economic consensus as a result of the Green Party conference last weekend, and I am sure we will hear the same responsible noises from the Labour Party this weekend.</P>
      <P>In Opposition and even Government, people contended that high taxes were the litmus test of commitment to public services. Low rates have increased the overall taxation take, enabling us to <Col N="298"/>make sustainable improvements in public services year-on-year, rather than the boom-and-bust situation that we had previously because we lacked a consistent overall approach. I agree with Senator Quinn&rsquo;s suggestion that it must be the foundation of progress, as well as a benchmark of sustainability.</P>
      <P>It reflects the direct experience of Government and how this country&rsquo;s economic affairs have improved, as well as being a measure of our political maturity, that people recognise that if we want to keep 2 million people working rather than 1.2 million, such taxation and fiscal policies best guarantee the prospect. Some Senators have referred to the need for taxation equity in the code. In response, I wish to say that, since 1997, average taxation rates for all categories of taxpayers have decreased significantly. Earners retain a greater proportion of income and take-home pay. Since 1997, a single person on the average industrial wage will have seen his or her pay rise by over &euro;12,600 and a tax bill cut by over &euro;400 per annum against that year. In the same period, the person&rsquo;s average tax rate has dropped by 12% percentage points, from 27% to an effective tax rate of 15%.</P>
      <P>A person on the minimum wage and working a standard week no longer pays income tax. That is a third of the current working population, up from a quarter in 1997. A person on the average industrial wage does not pay above the standard rate of 20% on an average working week. Ensuring equity in the taxation system must be among the Government&rsquo;s main objectives. It is important to point out that in 2006, the top 1% of income earners will pay approximately 20% of all income tax collected, compared with 15% before we took office. There is a progression when it comes to ensuring that those on higher wages, the top 1%, pay a greater proportion of tax while those at the lower end either do not pay any tax or do so at a rate they can afford.</P>
      <P>As Senator Minihan has pointed out, the Government&rsquo;s commitment to equity is underlined by the rules that I am introducing in this year&rsquo;s Finance Bill aimed at ensuring that taxpayers are unable to use specified reliefs to reduce their tax bill in any year below approximately 20%.</P>
      <P>It has been suggested that I did not go far enough in capping pensions, but I do not agree. This Finance Bill contains significant pension reform. From now on, the size of an individual&rsquo;s pension fund will be limited to &euro;5 million, and a tax-free pension lump sum may not exceed &euro;1.25 million. Moneys kept in approved retirement funds, which could hitherto be used to defer tax payments on pension provision, will now be subject to tax on the basis of a notional draw-down from the funds concerned.</P>
      <P>The effect will be that an individual can no longer take enormous lump sums tax-free, use tax incentives to build up an unreasonably large fund, or indefinitely defer the payment of tax by hold<Col N="299"/>ing moneys in approved retirement funds. I am confident that those changes will have the intended impact and create greater equity in pensions tax relief. Regarding general pension provision, the Government will be considering the recently published national pensions review in considering how to move forward in this very complex area.</P>
      <P>I thank Senators for their contributions to the debate. I have listened to Senators Brian Hayes and O&rsquo;Toole since the drafts were prepared, and I will take up the points that they have raised, in addition to the many constructive points made by Senators during this debate, which I always find refreshing compared with that in the Lower House.</P>

    <Title>Shot at Dawn Campaign: Statements.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I very much welcome this timely debate on a very important issue, particularly for the families of those unjustly executed.</P>
      <P>This year marks the 90th anniversaries of the Easter Rising and the Battle of the Somme. For too long, the experiences of lrishmen who fought in the First World War, and the losses suffered by their families, were not talked about or commemorated as they deserved. In recent years, we have taken steps to change that, something perhaps best exemplified by the joint inauguration by President McAleese and Queen Elizabeth II of the Memorial Peace Park at Messines in 1998. There, supported by Government funds, a round tower has been built using stones from every county in Ireland.</P>
      <P>On those foreign fields, the men of the 16th Irish Division and the 36th Ulster Division fought side by side, just as other young men from this island fought side by side for four awful years from the Somme to Gallipoli. Altogether, perhaps 50,000 young men from this island did not return. As long ago as 1966, the late Taoiseach, Se&aacute;n Lemass, commented as follows.</P>
      <P LI="1">In later years it was common &mdash; and I was also guilty in this respect &mdash; to question the motives of those men who joined the new British armies formed at the outbreak of the war, but it must, in their honour and in fairness to their memory, be said that they were motivated by the highest purpose.</P>
      <P FLI="0">We share that sentiment and will therefore mark the anniversary of the Battle of the Somme in a fitting manner in July. This year will also mark the 90th anniversaries of the deaths of eight of the 26 young Irish volunteers executed while serving in the British army during the First World War. For their families, as for the families of each <Col N="300"/>individual who fell at the Somme, those were terrible and painful events which had a permanent impact on their lives.</P>
      <P>It was in the spirit of recognising the experience and sacrifice of all our countrymen who fell during the First World War that the Government lent its support to the campaign to secure pardons for the 26 Irishmen shot at dawn, that is, executed for military offences between 1914 and 1918. In October 2004, the Government formally submitted a comprehensive report on the issue to the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office through our embassy in London. Prepared using material from the original British Ministry of Defence case files, the report thoroughly evaluated the men&rsquo;s courts martial and sentencing.</P>
      <P>In its findings, the report described a military system of justice that was seriously flawed, that appeared to ignore clear evidence of medical afflictions, and that was marked by class bias and a disparity in the treatment of different nationalities, including in particular Irish soldiers. This report is not an attempt to rewrite history or to impose today&rsquo;s norms on the past. The simple reality is that the offences for which these men were executed, and the manner in which they were tried and found guilty, were the subject of concern and controversy at the time. In response to increasing public concern and political campaigning both during and after the war, the British Parliament decided by 1930 that these offences should no longer carry the death penalty. It is clear, therefore, that these executions during the First World War gave rise to grave concern 90 years ago and they continue to do so today, so much so that they have become the subject of an ongoing campaign in Britain and Ireland. The Irish Shot at Dawn Campaign has attracted overwhelming support across political and religious divides, North and South. In 1999, Mr. John Hume and the Reverend Ian Paisley together sponsored a Bill on this subject in the House of Commons.</P>
      <P>A substantive response to our report by the British Government has been delayed by a legal petition for pardon on behalf of the British soldier, Private Harry Farr, lodged by his daughter. The latest hearing in this case was held yesterday and it is our hope that a judgment will be forthcoming before the end of July. The Farr case has the potential to be resolved in a manner that would set a wide precedent affecting the Irish cases and, therefore, while that case is before the courts, the British Government has indicated that it is not in a position to respond comprehensively to our concerns. Nevertheless, we are in regular contact at official level to ensure a satisfactory resolution to this matter is secured in the shortest timeframe.</P>
      <P>However, to facilitate a fully informed debate in the Seanad, I decided to lay the Government&rsquo;s report on this issue, which we gave to the British in October 2004, before the Oireachtas. The text of the report has not been released until now, <Col N="301"/>although the case files have been publicly available since 1990. The report also draws on the published research of the Irish campaign headed by Peter Mulvany &mdash; whom I met earlier and who is present in the House &mdash; and of respected authors such as Dr. Gerard Oram, Julian<?oasys _jy ?>Putkowski, Julian Sykes and Myles Dungan, among many others.</P>
      <P>We have been in regular contact with the British Government on this issue since the submission of the report and it is our firm hope that this will lead to a mutually agreeable solution. While there are differences between ourselves and the British Government on the issues raised in the report, the British Government is cognisant of the need to address them. In our contacts, the British Government has made clear it is also motivated by an enduring desire to ease the pain and suffering of the families of all the 306 men who were shot at dawn, including the 26 Irish cases examined in our report. Our unwavering objective is to engage in finding an agreed resolution on this issue that would bring comfort to the families of those executed.</P>
      <P Just="Left">This issue is emotive but the merits of our arguments are strong and compelling and that is why they have gained such widespread support. The full force of this issue is, however, impossible to comprehend without firmly grounding it in the human experiences of those involved. It would be wrong to take one case to stand for the others. I therefore recommend that anyone with an interest in the issue should take the time to read the report and the case histories it contains. However, it would be equally misguided not to try to imagine the conditions in which these volunteers found themselves &mdash; the situations in which some were charged and executed for cowardice or deserting their post, without any proper recognition of medical conditions like shell-shock or the appalling pressures soldiers on the front faced on a daily basis.</P>
      <P>One testimony from a member of the Irish division caught in a poison gas attack at Loos in 1916 gives an idea of the nature of this war and its overwhelming effect on the young men who found themselves in the middle of every awful aspect of it, namely, the shelling, the trenches, the charges into no-man&rsquo;s land, the shell-shock and, in this case, the poison gas. He stated:</P>
      <P LI="1">Luckily for us, with the rising sun the wind began to change and we immediately counter-attacked and drove the enemy off, but the Dublin Fusiliers had been caught unawares and their casualties were very heavy. When it was over, I had the sad job of collecting and burying the dead. They were in all sorts of tragic attitudes, some of them holding hands like children in the dark. They were nearly all gassed and I buried about 60 of them in an enormous shell hole.</P>
      <P FLI="0">A total of 338 Irishmen died in that attack. Tom Kettle, one time Nationalist MP for Tyrone, was <Col N="302"/>killed at the Somme. That year he wrote to the leaders of the Easter Rising stating: &ldquo;These men will go down in history as heroes and martyrs; and I will go down &mdash; if I go down at all &mdash; as a bloody British officer.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It is the intent of the Government that this is not how he or any of the Irishmen who fought in the First World War should be remembered and it is our intention, therefore, to honour their memory. As in the case of those &ldquo;shot at dawn&rdquo;, it is our objective to recover their memory from the dishonour that was done to them 90 years ago. It is an act of national solidarity with those of our countrymen who volunteered to fight in a truly terrible war and with the always complex and often tragic experiences of previous generations as a whole. It is the whole range of our experiences across all traditions that has shaped our present from which we are determined to build a shared future on this island never rewriting the past but always seeking to understand it better, and honour the memories, sacrifice and vision of all those who came before.</P>

	<P>I wish to share time with Senator Feighan.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and I thank the Government for providing time for this important debate. Senator Mooney, who has a long-standing interest in this issue, Senator Norris and I have sought a debate for a long time. I also welcome Mr. Peter Mulvany and his campaign team to the House. They have done trojan work in recent years to ensure this issue is taken seriously at political level. I welcome the production of the report on these soldiers by the Minister&rsquo;s Department, which was sent to the Foreign Office and it is important that pressure be maintained in this regard.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The debate is important now because the case of Private Harry Farr is before the British High Court and a determination in the case will be made shortly. We will have to wait to see whether the case has implications for the other 305 victims in this scenario. The debate is also important because I was heartened to hear from a colleague, Lord Alfred Dubs, who raised a question on the floor of the House of Lords in this regard recently. A total of 30 Lords backed his position that the British Government needs to move on this issue and that is encouraging. Cross-party support was achieved in both the House of Commons and the House of Lords. It is also important to debate this issue now because the British Prime Minister has a great knowledge of Ireland and the peace process and he recognises the importance of this as an outstanding issue in terms of moving forward together in reconciliation while acknowledging our troubled past.</P>
      <P>My great grandfather was taken prisoner at the Battle of Mons, ten miles from Brussels, in 1916. He was held for two years in a German concentration camp before returning in 1918 to a country that had been totally transformed as a result <Col N="303"/>of what happened in 1916. He spoke passionately to older members of my family about the awful events in the trenches and the huge contribution made by Irish people, North and South, from all backgrounds to that awful campaign. My father was in the RAF in the Second World War, of which I am proud. He, along with many other people, took a stance against Naziism and the rise of fascism. There is a long-standing connection between the British Army and Ireland, in which we should take genuine pride because of the contributions of many thousands of Irish people during the First and Second World Wars.</P>
      <P>One of the great stains on that noble tradition and connection is that 306 people, 26 of whom were Irish, were butchered as a result of appalling courts martial during and following the First World War. I do not see this as rewriting history in any shape or form, but as a means of righting a wrong and ensuring that their great contribution is recognised, not just by their families but by this country and Britain, their place in history is never forgotten and their position is cherished.</P>
      <P>We have new evidence which questions the full nature and scope of the courts martial and I ask the British Government to respond to this issue. We know, for example, that many executions were commuted at the time because of the involvement of King George V or because of one&rsquo;s class. If those sentenced were from a well-to-do background, their execution was commuted, despite being guilty of appalling offences &mdash; offences that in the 1930s became irrelevant.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Has the Government examined the possibility of introducing legislation in this area to, in effect, give a retrospective pardon to the 26 Irish people? When we gained independence in 1921, we automatically took responsibility for all of the laws in place prior to that date. One of those laws allowed heinous courts martial which permitted execution. Have we examined the possibility, through the Attorney General, of providing our own retrospective pardon for the 26 Irish people killed in this manner? New Zealand has pardoned its people who were involved, but it is a member of the Commonwealth. We should consider this because we have a responsibility for all Acts passed, albeit by a foreign Parliament, before 1921. The issue of the executions is an issue the New Zealand Government raised successfully.</P>
      <P>Those who took part in the war and who followed the advice given by John Redmond at Woodenbridge, &ldquo;We must go where the fighting is fiercest&rdquo;, were volunteers and not conscripts. They fought for Ireland, their country and the home rule and independence cherished at that time. We must remember them and ensure their memory and contribution to this country are never forgotten. In doing that, we must embrace the mutual understanding of history which allows green and orange come together and allows a new reconciliation North and South. The fact that two diverse politicians such as John Hume and Ian <Col N="304"/>Paisley could sponsor a Bill on this shows that this is an issue that can bring people together.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I welcome the Bill published by Andrew Mackinlay, MP, a Labour Party member and colleague of ours on the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body. He and others have done an important job in this area as has our Government. I hope we can move forward together on this issue over the coming weeks or months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFeighan"><NameTxt>Mr. Feighan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Brian Hayes for sharing time with me. I welcome the Minister to the House and welcome this debate. I went with Senator Mooney and the Connacht Rangers to Flanders 18 months ago and was taken aback by the huge sacrifice of soldiers and of the Irish regiments there. When Irish people who fought in the First World War returned home they returned to a different political climate and much of the time were not recognised for their valour during that awful war.</P>
      <P>Files kept secret by the British Government for 75 years and released in 1990 indicated that 26 Irish-born soldiers were shot at dawn, part of the 306 British and Commonwealth soldiers shot. Most of those soldiers suffered from shell-shock and many of them were underage boys. It was encouraging to note that the 16th Irish Division and the Unionist, 36th Ulster Division fought side by side at the Battle of Messines. It is encouraging that both sides can come together. We can do the same again.</P>
      <P>None of the men who were shot were charged with what would be viewed as a serious military crime, such as treachery, deserting to the enemy or mutiny. The real cowards in the executions were the powerful elite. It is wrong that this issue was not dealt with years ago. I pay tribute to those on all sides and the Government on their effort to clear the names of these men. Senator Brian Hayes highlighted the fact that those in higher officer were granted clemency by King George V. Now is the time to exonerate the 306 soldiers, among whom were the 26 Irish soldiers who fought valiantly. At the time they displayed a sense of adventure and were fighting for a united Ireland and home rule. They should be shown clemency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, to the House. This is an historic debate. In my time here I have not seen a subject that received such overwhelming support across all sections of the House. The spirit of conciliation that permeates the Minister&rsquo;s contribution demonstrates that this issue is about reconciliation, not blame or criticism. I hope the contribution of the House goes some way towards advancing the desire of the surviving families of those shot at dawn for a final resolution of the problem.</P>
      <P Just="Left">It is salutary to note that during and following the First World War, over 3,000 men were sentenced to death under the Army Act between <Col N="305"/>August 1914 and March 1920, but that 90% of those verdicts were commuted. In echoing the Minister&rsquo;s emotive and correct interpretation and relation of the history of those times to a present day audience, it is salutary to remember that the daily average casualties during the war numbered 2,000 and included 400 fatalities. It was absolute carnage.</P>
      <P>Senator Brian Hayes rightly referred to the lack of awareness in the British military establishment of shell-shock and the impact of war, particularly on young servicemen. The reason the establishment carried out the executions &mdash; I know it is difficult to look back and get one&rsquo;s head around circumstances and attitudes of the time &mdash; was as a deterrent. Anthony Babington&rsquo;s 1983 book, the first published on this matter, was aptly entitled <i>For the Sake of Example.</i> The report states that while execution may have been effective in that respect, a general read through the case files of the 26 Irish soldiers reveals starkly that each man was subjected to an inconsistent, capricious and unpredictable court martial system. It is obvious from reading this painful report that the military establishment at the time was not only flawed in its judgment but had a strong anti-Irish bias.</P>
      <P>While it is true that his happened a long time ago, the British Government suppressed the details of the shot at dawn soldiers for 75 years. It kept the information under lock and key, such were the sensitivities involved. It is only since the details emerged in 1990 and the seminal book on the subject, <i>Shot at Dawn</i>, by Mr. Julian Putowski and Mr. Julian Sykes was published, giving the excruciating, painful and emotive detail of how these people were shot, that the issue came into the public arena.</P>
      <P Just="Left">An English soldier called Private Ingham of the Manchester Regiment was shot at dawn on 1 December. At the time, the authorities had written to his father to tell him that his son had died of gunshot wounds. When he found out the truth years later he insisted that the Commonwealth graves commission, which is responsible for maintaining graves of servicemen all over the world, put the following inscription on his son&rsquo;s tombstone:</P>
      <P LI="1">&rdquo;Shot at dawn</P>
      <P LI="1">One of the first to enlist</P>
      <P LI="1">A worthy son of his father.&rdquo;</P>
      <P FLI="0">Even then, there was an awareness among the families that a cruel injustice had been done to their kinfolk.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The current campaign comes about as a result of the increasingly close relationship between the United Kingdom and Ireland. It is also due, as the Minister pointed out, to a belated but welcome acknowledgement that those who joined the Irish regiments of the British army and those of Irish birth who joined in the United Kingdom, were no less Irish than those who subsequently fought for <Col N="306"/>Irish independence. The shadow of the rising darkened the judgment of that generation and while the rebellion of 1916 was the catalyst for subsequent events, it was the period between 1919 and 1921 which delivered a sovereign Parliament, albeit a partitioned one, and many of those who fought for independence during that period learned their military skills in the Great War and had worn the uniform of the British army.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I wish to acknowledge the outstanding work of Mr. Peter Mulvany and also the great grand nephew of Private Downey, one of the men referred to in the recently published report. I also wish to acknowledge the enormous contribution of Mr. Andrew Mackinlay, our colleague on the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body, over many years, against the odds and the wishes of some at the highest level in his own party. I also salute Lord Alfred Dubs who, following the joint initiative of myself and Senator Maurice Hayes at the plenary session of the interparliamentary body in Edinburgh in November, took up the case again in the British House of Lords. That debate, to which Senator Maurice Hayes referred, has also rekindled a great deal of interest across all parties in the United Kingdom.</P>
      <P>Given the ongoing discussions that Senator Maurice Hayes and I are having with our colleagues in the British Parliament, it is clear that this issue is not going to go away. Support for this issue is increasing among those of all parties and none and through the case of Private Farr in the courts, it is drawing the attention of the general media in the United Kingdom. I wish to outline, for the record, the aforementioned case.</P>
      <P>Private Harry Farr enlisted in 1910 in the West Yorkshire Regiment, at the age of either 16 or 17, although he told the recruiting officer he was older. He was involved in various activities in the early part of the First World War with the British expeditionary force and at the Somme in 1915. On 14 and 15 September, his battalion moved up to the front line, near Guillemont, which Senator Feighan and I visited two years ago. The private fell out and reported himself sick at the transport lines the next day. When the medics allegedly refused to examine him, he was ordered to accompany a ration party as it went up the line.</P>
      <P>Private Farr remained behind and later that day was seen by a sergeant, who had ordered his return to the line. Private Farr told the NCO that he felt unable to return to the line. The intervention of a corporal, who had been detailed to escort the private was also unsuccessful, as was a forceful attempt to drag the soldier off.</P>
      <P>A trial took place on 2 October 1916 and in spite of his earlier shell-shock in 1915, no medical examination was carried out. The location of Private Farr&rsquo;s execution is unknown and his grave, unusually, was not identified after the war. He is commemorated in the Thiepval memorial to the missing, which overlooks the Somme battlefields. One cannot imagine how Private Farr&rsquo;s family must have felt at the time and how <Col N="307"/>his 91 year old daughter feels now, as she battles the British military establishment in the courts to obtain justice for her father who was unjustly and cruelly executed. It is now widely accepted that shell-shock is a serious medical condition of warfare.</P>
      <P>This issue transcends all party considerations, religious traditions and political ideologies on this island. As has been noted, the Reverend Ian<?oasys _jy ?>Paisley, Mr. John Hume and Mr. Ken Maginnis, when the latter was an MP at Westminster, all sponsored the Andrew McKinlay Bill. I wish to acknowledge that the spirit of reconciliation which permeated the Minister&rsquo;s speech is also to be found in this House, which is perhaps the strongest message that can be sent to the British Government, namely, that there is agreement across party lines and traditions going back to the foundation of this State.</P>
      <P>While there may have been discrimination in life for the 26 Irish men who were executed, there has been no discrimination for them in death. The graceful, dignified, quiet, grey tombstones of the soldiers who fell in the Great War, those who fought and died and those who were executed, lie side by side and are the most powerful retort to those in Britain who believe this issue should be kept quiet and not addressed.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share time with Senator O&rsquo;Toole and perhaps with Senator Ross, who may have an opportunity to join us.</P>
      <P>I welcome this discussion and express my admiration for the work done by Senators Mooney and Hayes. Until quite recently, I was not aware of the considerable body of work they have been doing through the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body, which is a very useful forum in which to do such work. I have raised this issue on a number of occasions in the past because I was contacted by the Shot at Dawn Campaign, initially by the British campaign and also by Mr. Mulvany and his group in Ireland. They have produced a most excellent, heart-rending and moving briefing.</P>
      <P>I listened carefully to the Minister&rsquo;s speech and was glad to note the generous comments by the late Taoiseach, Mr. Se&aacute;n Lemass, of which I was unaware. That is very important and to be welcomed. The Minister also said that the soldiers had the highest possible motivations for enlisting <Col N="308"/>and that is true, to a certain extent. However, some of the Irish men, most poignantly, were motivated by sheer poverty. People joined the British army because there was damn all else for them in this country. Having come from such conditions and to then be treated in the manner in which they were by the British army, is absolutely shameful and an attempt to dishonour them.</P>
      <P>Senator Mooney is a much more Christian person than I am, which I have known for a long time. I have no problem criticising the then British Government and the officer class. Both richly deserve that, even though my father fought in the First World War, was heavily decorated and among others was awarded the Lloyd&rsquo;s medal, colloquially known as the marine Victoria Cross. As a small child I recall him being horrified by these events. So many of the people who fought valiantly on their side disassociated themselves from these events.</P>
      <P>The Minister refers to the men being executed. In my opinion, they were murdered; it was nothing less than judicial murder. Anthony<?oasys _jy ?>Babington, for example, indicates no due process was involved. It was a drumhead court martial, where the soldiers were unrepresented and did not even have a prisoner&rsquo;s friend. They were alone, often ill, shell-shocked, disturbed when brought up before these cursory procedures to be then taken out and shot. It was done as other Senators stated, as exemplary justice. <i>Pour encourage les autres</i> or, as was more the case, <i>pour d&eacute;courager les autres</i>.</P>
      <P>Leonard Sellers in his work <i>For God&rsquo;s Sake Shoot Straight</i> stated:</P>
      <P LI="1">It was a great shock when I opened the file listing details of executions in the Great War. What I found amazed and deeply troubled me. There were names, ages and details. I discovered that they were so young, so vulnerable and so alone . . . In only three cases did the prisoner have the benefit of a prisoner&rsquo;s friend. These young men, on trial for their lives, went before their superiors without legal representations or assistance. The knowledge of this is horrific, and has deep implications.</P>
      <P FLI="0">It is inappropriate for the British Government to procrastinate on the matter. It is easy for it to use the case of Mrs. Harris, the daughter of Private Harry Farr. Why is the British Government appealing the case? It must acknowledge that a gross injustice has been done as Ireland, Scotland and New Zealand have. The New Zealand Government not only issued a retrospective pardon but re-issued whatever medals those shot had won. There should be some similar appropriate measure from our Government.</P>
      <P>I am glad to learn a friend and former colleague from the English department in Trinity College, Dublin, Dr. Gerald Morgan, has adopted five of these Irish soldiers at a ceremony near Lichfield in Staffordshire. He has suggested a small but dignified memorial to salute the human <Col N="309"/>experience of these men should be erected at Islandbridge. They are part of the tragedy of the First World War. Some part of that has been achieved by the recording of their names. It is shocking to learn their names were not even dignified by being recorded but dishonoured.</P>
      <P>It is important that what these soldiers went through is recognised. Shell-shock is a real condition. I remember one gentleman in the choir at Christ Church Cathedral suffered from it. I will conclude with a quote from Wilfrid Owen&rsquo;s poem <i>Dulce et Decorum Est</i>.</P>
      <P LI="1">If you could hear, at every jolt, the blood</P>
      <P LI="1">Come gargling from the froth-corrupted lungs, ...</P>
      <P LI="1">...My friend, you would not tell with such high zest</P>
      <P LI="1">To children ardent for some desperate glory,</P>
      <P LI="1">The old Lie; <i>Dulce et Decorum est</i></P>
      <P LI="1">
        <i>Pro patria mori</i>.</P>
      <P FLI="0">We owe it to these tragic victims.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Norris for sharing his time.</P>
      <P>I compliment Senators Brian Hayes and Mooney and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, on the work they have done on this case. It is important for the sake of the memory of these soldiers that we recognise what they went through. We are learning much about our past. Many people who lost family members this way have been forgotten. They have had to live with memories. Many families often had to cover it up. They were afraid to explain what had happened as it was a matter of shame, despite the fact these soldiers had done no wrong. They were not guilty of any crime and tried in the absence of due process without a prisoner&rsquo;s friend or military lawyer to put forward their cases.</P>
      <P>Members will recall the pictorial record of the First World War from which one saw the trenches with the rats, the dirt, the bodies and body parts and the countryside wrecked. Years later walking through acre after acre of serried rows of white crosses on the French battlefields, it is difficult to think that these soldiers were not remembered there. In every French town there is a memorial to <i>les garcons de ville</i> lost in the Great War. Some form of memorial must be erected for the soldiers in question.</P>
      <P>Last night when I watched the woman speaking of her father on the BBC, it hit me how close historically it was to us. She was speaking about her mother living into her 90s, fighting her husband&rsquo;s case that he was never a coward or a traitor. People were ordered at gunpoint out of the trenches to run without bullet-proof vests into machine gun fire. If there were people to be dragged before the courts, it was certainly not the victims.</P><Col N="310"/>
      <P>A space must be found at one of our war memorials to give recognition to those shot at dawn. It was not just those from the British army who were written out of the history of the time but also RIC personnel. Those soldiers in the Great War did their best. Many were there as an escape from hunger at home or they were urged to enlist by John Redmond. They did what they thought was right. To call them cowards or traitors utterly wrongs their memories. To their families and their descendants we must reach out with a memorial to them. Under the authority of the Westminster Acts, do we have the power to pass legislation to grant pardons to these soldiers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes we do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMinihan"><NameTxt>Mr. Minihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The issue of those shot at dawn is one I have watched for several years. It is of particular interest and concern to me, given my experience in the military, and most importantly, my absolute belief that the 26 Irish-born soldiers executed during the First World War must get justice.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>This is an issue not just for Ireland. Archives released in 1990 by the British Government after 75 years indicated that during the First World War, 306 British and Commonwealth soldiers suffered the so-called ultimate penalty. The word &ldquo;penalty&rdquo; implies an offence. Would any reasonable person consider that such an offence was actually committed? Were these 306 soldiers, including the 26 Irish soldiers, 22 Canadians, five New Zealanders and one young Jamaican boy, actually killed by the British military merely as an example to others? These are just two of the questions the Shot at Dawn Campaign has posed and they must continue to be posed to the British authorities.</P>
      <P>There is, however, a specific cause for concern in Ireland. Dr. Gerard Oram&rsquo;s work indicates that in most British army groups one in every 2,000 to 3,000 troops was sentenced to death. That is a shocking statistic. However, the execution rate for Irish soldiers sentenced to death by British courts-martial is even more distressing at more than one in every 600. The numbers indicate that there were consistently more condemnations of troops serving with the Irish than in other battalions and that, on average, seven death sentences were passed in every Irish battalion but only four in other battalions. Why were more Irish troops executed in the British army than any other nationality?</P>
      <P>We know that more than 134,000 men were recruited in Ireland during the war. The memory of this entire group has suffered an injustice over the years. The issues of Irish independence and unity were injudiciously applied or equated to taint the memories of brave men and their families, which is simply unacceptable. A more terrible and deadly injustice was applied, however. While New Zealand had a similar <Col N="311"/>number of men enlisted at 112,000, there were 23 condemnations, while there were 239 condemnations in Irish units.</P>
      <P>Use of the word &ldquo;penalty&rdquo; is not the only one with which I have a problem. As recently as yesterday, when new consideration for the executed Private Harry Farr was, thankfully, announced, I heard phrases such as &ldquo;justice for cowards&rdquo; and &ldquo;cowardice campaign&rdquo;. The word &ldquo;coward&rdquo; is so inappropriate. A coward is defined as &ldquo;one who shows disgraceful fear or timidity&rdquo;. Is a man to continue to be labelled a coward having suffered severe psychological trauma? Private Farr was physically unable to cope with the shocking scenes he had to witness. He had been admitted to hospital where nurses noted that he trembled so severely he was unable to hold a pen. Such a soldier was subsequently found guilty of cowardice and sentenced to death. That is abhorrent.</P>
      <P>Those who share my belief that justice must be delivered are, less importantly, also labelled for condemning the events of a century ago from a modern-day perspective or for seeking something inappropriate or impossible. What we are seeking is very simple, namely, a pardon for soldiers executed for action such as so-called cowardice, desertion or attempted desertion, disobedience, quitting a post or throwing away their arms. They were executed as an example.</P>
      <P>Can we be sure what constitutes desertion? I can remember many a court-martial during my own military career involving long-term absentees who were charged with desertion or absence. I recall that desertion had to involve a clear intent that one would never return. Was that definition applied to those soldiers?</P>
      <P Just="Left">Today we have a clear understanding of shell-shock and post traumatic stress disorder, conditions that were not entertained 80 years ago. What can we do now? Having had the report laid before us, the Houses of the Oireachtas should send a unanimous and unequivocal message to the British Government stating our firm belief that, first, pardons should be granted to the 26 soldiers born in Ireland who were executed in these circumstances and, second, we must record our support for the British Labour Party backbencher Andrew Mackinlay&rsquo;s wider Pardon for Soldiers of the Great War Bill. This would allow for the granting of pardons to all qualifying soldiers executed during the First World War.</P>
      <P>I understand the Bill was due for its Second Reading in the House of Commons on 10 March but, when contacted yesterday, the House of Commons information service stated the measure had been dropped. Perhaps the Minister or his officials could inquire, if and when appropriate, as to how this Bill&rsquo;s progress is to be facilitated by the British Government.</P>
      <P>As a representative of our Government, the Minister could relay to his British counterpart Ireland&rsquo;s request that the implication of the statistics I have set out on the high proportion of <Col N="312"/>executions among Irish soldiers be investigated and explained. This is an issue that transcends individuals and pertains to our status as a nation. Was execution more or less likely on the basis of nationality and, if so, why? If that was the case, our nation deserves an explanation if not an apology.</P>
      <P>As regards pardons, we are not seeking a precedent. As Senator Brian Hayes pointed out, the New Zealand Government has granted such pardons to five of its soldiers. New Zealand&rsquo;s Pardon for Soldiers Act clearly recognises that the execution of these soldiers &ldquo;was not a fate that they deserved but was one that resulted from the harsh discipline that was believed at the time to be required; and the application of the death penalty for military offences being seen at the time as an essential part of military discipline&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>My military experience informs me of how such an atmosphere and regime can develop, although not with these terrible consequences. Nevertheless, in a military environment, where a group of soldiers must be controlled by a small number of superiors, in unforgiving circumstances, we can see how harsh discipline can emerge. The label of dishonour attached to these soldiers and their families has compounded that horror.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the measure passed in New Zealand five years ago &ldquo;was to remove, so far as practicable, the dishonour that the executions brought to those soldiers and their families&rdquo;. It allowed a dignified closure for the families of soldiers executed in the First World War.</P>
      <P>I encourage the Minister and his Department to follow through on the momentum that will no doubt follow the publication of the report. Should Oireachtas or party support be required or desired for the Government to do so, then let us get those explicit statements. Justice must be restored, honour returned to and blemish removed from the reputations of those concerned. On behalf of the Progressive Democrats, I support all appropriate efforts to make this happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>I fully support and commend Mr. Peter Mulvany and the Shot at Dawn Campaign. I also commend the Minister and the Department of Foreign Affairs for their work on this report. My colleagues Senators Mooney and Brian Hayes have led the way on this issue. The executions were an awful episode in an awful war. The Irish were volunteers and this was dreadful recompense for often intrinsically minor disciplinary offences.</P>
      <P Just="Left">There is no doubt that this was directed right from the top but, unfortunately, officers were not concerned to spare life in general. There is shame on all involved. I accept in the moral sense what Senator Norris said about judicial murder. I am afraid to say that included a first cousin of my grandmother, a Captain Mansergh who presided over one of the worst cases, that of Private Downey from Limerick. There is no doubt that <Col N="313"/>there were class factors, national bias and perhaps religious issues. I can only express the deepest regret to his family, including his great nephew, for the little that it is worth.</P>
      <P>It is possible for the Government, representing a successor State, to pardon but it would be much better for the British to do so. The repeal of the legislation in 1930 tells its own story. I was in the Irish Embassy in Bonn in 1976 when the Prime Minister of Baden-W&uuml;rttemberg, who was involved in a court-martial in 1944, had to resign for saying that what was just then cannot be unjust now. Of course, that related to a criminal regime and nobody is accusing the British Government in 1916 of having been that.</P>
      <P>It is important for reconciliation, however, that this matter should be seen through to a conclusion. I support the proposal for a special memorial at Islandbridge so that, at least, honour would be restored to the 26 people involved.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I also commend Mr. Mulvany, his colleagues, Senators Mooney and Brian Hayes, Mr. Andrew Mackinlay and the Minister on the efforts they made in this regard.</P>
      <P>My father was in the British army during the First World War and I grew up with many of the survivors. If one saw what those survivors were like in later years one would have some idea of the trauma and suffering of the people who were there. We should concentrate on reinstating the reputation of these men. I do not believe they were shot because of a particularly anti-Irish bias. The people who would send 80,000 people to their death in the morning thought little of shooting one or two the following morning. I recently finished reading a biography of Sir Henry Wilson and that can be seen running through it.</P>
      <P>This was a time when there was no conception of shell-shock, except for officers who were sent to Craig Lockhart hospital, and no idea about post-traumatic stress. There was a brutal approach to man-management and there is no doubt these people were shot, as Senator Norris stated, <i>pour encourager les autres</i>. They were the victims of a flawed process involving an extremely dodgy court martial system and a review that was not a review in most cases but simply an endorsement on the grounds that people could not be seen to weaken at any time. We should continue to press for a full pardon for these people. I commend the Minister on that. I also support the idea of some recognition by way of a memorial.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senators for the views expressed. It is clear from all they stated that there is cross-party support in this House, and I have no doubt in the other House, on this issue. My predecessor, Deputy Cowen, originally agreed to examine the issue and raise it with the British, mainly through the efforts of Peter Mulvany and his people. As a result of meetings that took place when I took office between the British and my officials 25 files were made available. To the best of my recollection, the other file was with the Canadians. I compliment my staff on the painstaking work they carried out in going through all of the notes in the case files and compiling what is an excellent report.</P>
      <P>Initially when this issue was brought to my attention I had the usual view that people held in 2005, that this was history and perhaps it is better to look forward not backwards. However, when I read some of the testimonies and case histories, I saw major validity in having this matter promoted on behalf of those families left behind. The report casts serious doubt on the safety of some of the court martial convictions and subsequent executions.</P>
      <P Just="Left">What particularly struck us was the apparent disparity of the treatment of Irish soldiers when compared with those of other countries. We were also struck by the disparities between lower and higher ranks at court martial. Regarding the treatment of Irish prisoners, the report makes clear that on average, an Irish soldier was four times more likely to be executed in these circumstances than any other nationality. A comparison with the New Zealand cohort in the British army during the First World War which had similar numbers shows an Irish soldier was ten times more likely to be executed for the offences committed. In some instances examples were made, as the book stated, for the sake of example.</P>
      <P>Through examining the notes, it is also clear that significant omissions were made by those presiding at the courts martial when they did not take into consideration medical ailments or extenuating circumstances. Soldiers were executed to set an example to others. Considering the cases either on an individual basis or cumulatively makes clear there are sufficient grounds to merit a re-examination. Over the years Labour and Conservative British Governments have ruled out full pardons. History shows this was an issue as early as 1915. It is not a recent issue. There was great unease in Britain about what happened at the time and subsequently and speakers acknowledged that the law on the death penalty was changed in 1930.</P>
      <P>A number of Senators raised the issue of the Irish Government and State passing what, in effect, would be a pardon. I am not sure whether it is legally possible. We discussed this with the Shot at Dawn Campaign, which made clear from the outset that it wants a pardon from the British Government which ultimately is the successor of <Col N="315"/>those responsible. I am not sure whether it would be legally possible to pass legislation exonerating these people. We have not examined the issue but neither have we closed our minds to it. Neither do we know whether it would be acceptable to the families of the 26 people.</P>
      <P>Our focus, as requested by the Shot at Dawn Campaign, is to get the British Government, as the successor of those who carried out these acts, to make recompense. It stated it will not give a full blanket pardon. Based on the precedent of the New Zealanders, we want to persuade the British Government to examine this option. The Farr case has complicated the issue from our point of view in that the British Government and the Ministry for Defence stated they will not comment on our report until such time as the Farr case has been disposed. We hope the case will be disposed on 31 July and that we will then receive a more comprehensive response from the British Government.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Regarding Andrew Mackinlay&rsquo;s Bill, we understand he will attempt to include it in the annual army Bill in May. However, we are not hopeful of success in that respect. I thank the Senators for their support.</P>

	<P>This is a Seanad Bill which has been amended by the D&aacute;il. In accordance with Standing Order 103, it is deemed to have passed its First, Second and Third Stages in the Seanad and is placed on the Order Paper for Report Stage. On the question &ldquo;That the Bill be received for final consideration&rdquo;, the Minister may explain the purpose of the amendments made by the D&aacute;il. This is looked upon as the report of the D&aacute;il amendments to the Seanad. The only matters, therefore, which may be discussed are the amendments made by the D&aacute;il. For Senators&rsquo; convenience, I have arranged for the printing and circulation of the amendments. The Minister of State will deal separately with the subject matter of each related group of amendments. I have also circulated the proposed grouping in the House. A Senator may contribute once on each group. I remind Senators that only the amendments made by the D&aacute;il may be discussed. In the first group, the definition of the Eurocontrol Convention is the subject matter of amendments Nos. 1 and 8.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be received for final consideration.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendment No. 1 is grouped with amendment No. 8. This amendment is necessary to clarify the protocol on the accession of the European Community to the European Convention. It is not an amendment to the European Convention.</P><Col N="316"/>
      <P>Amendment No. 8 was proposed in the D&aacute;il by Deputy Shortall and accepted by me as it is considered prudent to include the text of the EU protocol as a Schedule to the Bill. Ireland will be required to provide separate instruments of ratification for the revised convention and the EU accession protocol.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. P. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and hope that we can give a speedy passage to the final phase of this Bill. Broadly speaking, Fine Gael has supported this Bill and its passage through the D&aacute;il and this House. Nonetheless, there was and is room for improvement in this, as in most Bills. When it was going through this House I highlighted specific areas where it fell short of what it could and should achieve, as did my colleague, Deputy Olivia Mitchell, in the other House.</P>
      <P>Both Fine Gael and the Labour Party have expressed reservations about some of the powers conferred by the Bill on Eurocontrol, notwithstanding the valuable and crucial work the organisation undertakes on behalf of the other 34 countries involved. Unfortunately, these concerns, as expressed to us by the industry and by the Irish companies in Ireland, fell on deaf ears and the Minister of State did not accept the amendments I tabled.</P>
      <P>This Bill will pass with a fundamental flaw, despite the important things it will enact. I wish to highlight again five issues which I raised on Second and Committee Stages. One is that it will discourage Eurocontrol from expeditiously collecting moneys owing to it. It will create an easy target for Eurocontrol to pursue for debts accrued and remove the obligation on Eurocontrol to pursue the entity that incurred the charges. It will impose disproportionate burdens on aircraft owners and leasers and identify the wrong party as the legal wrongdoer in situations where Eurocontrol fees have not been paid.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>In the third group the amendment of the Aer Lingus Act 2004, and the Aviation Regulation Act 2001, is the subject matter of amendments Nos. 4, 5, 7 and 9.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendment No. 4 is a technical amendment intended to avoid doubt. It stems from an administrative oversight concerning the commencement of certain sections of the Aer Lingus Act 2004, which provides, among other things, for the establishment of the employee share ownership schemes. Based on the authority provided for in the Act, shares representing 9.9% of the issued share capital of Aer Lingus were transferred to the employees&rsquo; share ownership trust on 20 August 2004. The establishment of the scheme formed part of the agreement with trade unions on radical transformation measures provided for in the company&rsquo;s survival plan in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks in the United States on 9 September 2001, and the ensuing crisis in the aviation industry.</P>
      <P>These share transfers took place in the context of an agreement between the Ministers for Transport and for Finance, the company, the trustee for the employees&rsquo; share ownership programme and the trade unions. It came to light only a year later that the relevant provisions of the Aer Lingus Act 2004 had not been commenced before the transfer of the shares took place.</P>
      <P>The Minister signed the commencement of provisions order 2005 on 28 September 2005, which provided for the coming into operation of section 7 of the Aer Lingus Act 2004, and section 2 of the Act concerning the repeal of section 5(2) of the Air Companies (Amendment) Act 1993, which proposed a cap of 5% on the proportion of company shares which could be held by employee share ownership schemes. In practical terms nothing has changed but for the fact that we were <Col N="318"/>advised that it would be important to have this embodied in primary legislation. That is what we are doing now. No one is losing anything as a result of this. The amendment provides for the relevant parts of the Aer Lingus Act 2004 to be deemed to be commenced on 19 August 2004, the day prior to the transfer of the shares.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 5 designates the Commission for Aviation Regulation, CAR, as the body to enforce the denied boarding regulation. CAR&rsquo;s role is to enforce the EU regulation and to receive complaints from passengers in cases where an airline fails to meet its obligations under the regulation.</P>
      <P>The Commission for Aviation Regulation was already designated as the denied boarding enforcement body under the European Communities compensation and assistance of air passengers denied boarding, cancellation or long delay of flights regulation, SI 274 of 2005, made by the Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen, on 31 May 2005. After making the statutory instrument, which was done in consultation with CAR and the Office of the Attorney General, it emerged there may be some doubt as to whether CAR&rsquo;s levy, which is provided for in the aviation regulation 2001, could provide for any expenses incurred by CAR in enforcing the denied boarding regulations. The Department, CAR and the Office of the Attorney General concluded that formally restating now in the Act which sets up CAR that the commission is formally responsible for the enforcement of the denied boarding regulations will clarify beyond all doubt that CAR&rsquo;s levy, provided for under the 2001 Act, can include any expenses incurred by CAR in carrying out that enforcement.</P>
      <P>Since the statutory instrument was made under the European Communities Act, it only allowed for summary offences and associated penalties for infringements. CAR and the Department have now reached the view that this opportunity should be taken to recast the commission&rsquo;s enforcement role in primary legislation by amending the Aviation Regulation Act of 2001 which will allow the commission to pursue prosecutions on indictment in the event of serious breaches of the legislation. This amendment simply inserts a new section into the Aviation Regulation Act of 2001 to provide for a sanctions regime for CAR so that it can enforce the denied boarding regulation. The CAR can therefore issue directions directly to airlines if they are not complying with the denied boarding regulations, instructing them to comply. Non-compliance is then deemed an offence which can be pursued as either a summary or an indictable offence. CAR can take summary prosecutions while it will be a matter for the DPP to pursue indictable offences if CAR refers serious cases to the DPP.</P>
      <P>Also included are technical amendments made in the D&aacute;il to sections 13 and 40 of the Aviation Act 2001. The amendment to section 40 of the Act will extend the maximum time available on <Col N="319"/>an appeals panel established by the Minister under that section from two months to three months. It also extends from one month to two months the time given to the CAR to consider any matter referred back to it from the appeals panel. There is a related amendment to section 13 of the Aviation Regulation 2001 Act. Currently, section 13 allows for the appointment of a member of the staff of CAR as deputy commissioner to carry out the functions of the commission when the membership of the commission is vacant, including any referral that may be made to CAR by the appeals panel. While the explanation is quite long, this is short and technical and we are advised it is necessary to take the opportunity to introduce these amendments at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. P. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State and welcome this section. With regard to amendment No. 4, can the Minister of State say if it is retrospective legislation? Does this make everything retrospective back to 2004? On amendments Nos. 7 and 9, does the power to detain or stop people from boarding also extend to the other 34 countries? Have other countries and airlines the same powers as we are putting in place by means of this legislation, or will they be taking initiatives to put such powers in place?</P>
      <P>Yesterday, the Minister for Transport said Aer Lingus could be privatised by means of a public flotation later on in the year. I hoped this evening would provide an ideal opportunity for the Minister of State to comment here, rather than outside the House, as to how he views progress on the privatisation of Aer Lingus or the additional funds going towards it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I doubt if that is relevant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope"><NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
	<P>It is relevant. Senator Burke raised the question of retrospection. Even if we had not amended the legislation, things would not change for those who will own the shares in the trust. When we took advice from the Attorney General and the officials in my Department, it was felt this should be written into primary legislation. It provides for the relevant parts of the Aer Lingus Act 2004 to be deemed to have commenced on 19 August of that year, the day before the transfer of the shares to the trust. It will confirm that all those who expect to receive shares in Aer Lingus under the scheme will have their expectations fulfilled in accordance with the agreement reached between the Ministers of Transport and of Finance, along with Aer Lingus and the trade unions. It was the officials in my Department who rightly raised this issue, and we can now convince those who might have had any fears that they should not have any.</P>
      <P>There will be another opportunity to discuss Aer Lingus and I do not want to transgress as the <Col N="320"/>Cathaoirleach is not giving me the right to address the issue.</P>

I thank Mr. Se&aacute;n Hehir from the AIG group in Dublin whose company put a lot of work, worldwide and especially in America, into the financing and leasing of aircraft and insuring aircraft throughout the world.

I thank my colleague, Senator Paddy Burke, for facilitating the speedy passage of these amendments through the House this evening.

I am particularly grateful to Senators for their support and understanding, and for accepting the amendments put forward concerning the employee share ownership scheme for Aer Lingus, and the appeals process regarding decisions of the Commission for Aviation Regulation. As some Members of the Opposition noted, nobody is waiting with bated breath for the enactment of the Bill when it is signed by the President, but it is important legislation. It will allow us to ratify the revised Eurocontrol Convention which, in turn, will provide for the necessary institutional reforms required to achieve a uniform European air traffic management system for the control of general air traffic in European airspace at and around airports.</P>

      <Speaker pid="UlickBurke"><NameTxt>Mr. U. Burke</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Tim O&rsquo;Malley. The matter concerns the need for the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, to intervene with the western health executive to appoint a school dentist in Portiuncula Hospital, Ballinasloe, where there are 24 national schools in the area without a dental service for the past three months. That is a reasonable request.</P>
        <P>A quick look at the history of the dental service in the schools in east Galway will clarify the urgent need and the poor service provided to the schoolgoing children in the area. On 20 January 2006 the dentist in that area resigned, having been appointed on 28 April 2005. By coincidence I raised on the Adjournment that he be appointed at that time. He was appointed to provide a two-day per week service to the 24 national schools. Approximately 1,500 students in the catchment area were served by that dentist. Since 20 January 2006 an emergency service operates three days per month. It responds only in the case of an emergency, that is, when somebody is in exceptional pain.</P>
        <P>In the last days of December 2005 the dental practitioner for County Galway also resigned. Neither of those posts have been advertised in the meantime. It is time the Minister of State and the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children intervened in order that children in the area be provided with a proper dental service. It is unbelievable that such primary care is not provided at an early stage for children. There have been many campaigns and much money has been spent on promoting dental care, particularly among the young. Given the response of the Health Service Executive it is appropriate that the Minister of State and the T&aacute;naiste intervene to ensure a proper service is provided for children in the 24 national schools in east Galway, from Ballinasloe to Portumna.</P>
        <P>Given that the Health Service Executive cannot hold on to these appointments something must be wrong. In the past we were told we could not get orthodontists in the west. The position now is that we cannot retain dental practitioners. Hence the region has had a stop-go service for the past six years. It has had a dental service for a short period which, until recently, only operated two days per week. That is not good enough. The <Col N="322"/>backlog means that many children have serious dental problems and nothing is being done for them. I look forward to a positive response.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TimOMalleyPD"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. T. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>The Health Act 2004 provided for the Health Service Executive, which was established on 1 January 2005. Under the Act, the executive has the responsibility to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services. This includes the delivery of school dental services. Nonetheless, I am happy to set out the position as regards the development of policy in this area, as well as to convey the information provided by the Health Service Executive on the specific question raised by the Senator.</P>
        <P>At present children in specific classes in national school, usually second, fourth and sixth class, are targeted for preventive measures under the school-based approach. The children in these classes are screened and referred for treatment as necessary. The programme has been specifically designed to ensure that children are dentally fit before they leave national school. The screening provided in second, fourth and sixth classes ensures that follow up appointments for examination, treatment or orthodontic review are made, as necessary, with the dental surgeon in the clinic designated for the particular school.</P>
        <P>The Health (Amendment) Act 1994 amended the Health Act 1970. The regulations made under this Act &mdash; the Health (Dental Services for Children) Regulations 2000 &mdash; extended eligibility for free primary dental care to all children under 16 years of age, who have attended national school. Additional funding of over &euro;5 million has been provided to the health service for this extension of eligibility.</P>
        <P>The Department of Health and Children has been informed by the Health Service Executive that the vacancy arose at the dental clinic at Portiuncula Hospital, Ballinasloe, when the dentist working there moved away. Furthermore, the Department has been informed that the dental department of the Health Service Executive, western area, has a policy to recruit dentists wherever and whenever a vacancy arises. At present the Health Service Executive, western area, is pursuing a recruitment campaign in respect of vacant dental posts, including the post in Ballinasloe. In the meantime there is provision in the western area of the Health Service Executive for emergency treatment for all children under 16 years of age to be available where required.</P>
        <P>There are ten dental teams delivering the school screening services in the Galway area of the Health Service Executive and it is inevitable that vacancies will arise from time to time. I am satisfied, based on the information provided by the Health Service Executive, that where such vacancies arise the process of recruitment is initiated in a timely manner.</P>

      <Speaker pid="FrankFeighan"><NameTxt>Mr. Feighan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House. I raise the very serious issue of the provision of a new health centre in Keadue, Boyle, County Roscommon. I speak on behalf of people in the area who want to establish a new health centre in Keadue. The premises from which the health centre currently operates is in a very poor state of repair and is inadequate to provide the full service to the outpatient population base. The area has grown extensively in recent years and a health centre that can deliver the various practices in an area is essential.</P>
        <P>The centre urgently needs to employ a practice nurse. It is trying to run specialist asthma and diabetic clinics from a room measuring 5 ft. by 11 ft. It is the only spare room the centre has in the premises and at peak times there is a need to have an extra room. Unfortunately, because there is no extra room, the public health nurse is unable to attend and, in addition, the psychiatric service was withdrawn. The public health nurse cannot hold development clinics for children. We would very much appreciate funding or even a timeframe for the allocation of funding to ensure this problem will be rectified and a new health centre provided in Keadue, Boyle, County Roscommon.</P>
        <P>Keadue is equidistant from Carrick-on-Shannon, Drumshanbo and Boyle. It is in the parish of Kilronan, which includes Arigna and Ballyfarnon. It is a growing area and I hope the Minister has a positive reply to ensure the issue of this health centre would be dealt with.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TimOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Mr. T. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Feighan for raising this matter and I am happy to have the opportunity to respond.</P>
        <P>The question of the provision of health centres is the responsibility of the Health Service Executive under the Health Act 2004. The role of the Department of Health and Children in regard to capital is to monitor and evaluate the executive&rsquo;s capital programme overall and to ensure that the programme, under the multi-annual capital investment framework, is in line with service priorities and policy objectives.</P>
        <P>The approval of the capital programme of the executive is the responsibility of the T&aacute;naiste. The HSE has informed the Department that a priority list for health centre developments in County Roscommon has been drawn up and that, following consideration of the populations to be <Col N="324"/>served and the staff to be accommodated in each location, Keadue has been placed fourth on that list.</P>
        <P>The HSE is currently examining all such proposals from around the country in the context of available capital funding for 2006 and future years. It is therefore a matter for the executive to progress this particular proposal in the context of its overall capital programme.</P>
        <P>The national strategy, Primary Care: A New Direction, is the roadmap for the future development of primary care services in Ireland, both as the appropriate service for the delivery of the majority of people&rsquo;s health and social care needs and to complement the services provided by acute hospitals. Up to 95% of people&rsquo;s health care and social services needs can be met in a primary care setting.</P>
        <P>At the heart of the strategy is the aim of developing services in the community to give people direct access to integrated multidisciplinary teams of general practitioners, nurses, therapists, health care assistants, home helps and others. The strategy is also about the reorientation of existing resources to develop new ways for clinicians and other professionals to work together to provide more accessible primary care services to people in their own communities.</P>
        <P>In order to support the further development of primary care services in 2006, additional revenue funding of &euro;16 million has been provided. Of this, &euro;10 million has been earmarked for the development of primary care teams. The objective is to establish between 75 and 100 primary care teams to include 300 additional frontline posts. The HSE has indicated that funding will be targeted to provide the potential for each local health office to establish and enhance up to three primary care teams.</P>
        <P>I understand each local health office will identify local opportunities in partnership with general practitioners and other stakeholders. The focus will be on creating a critical mass of primary care professionals &mdash; GPs and their support staff, nursing and other professional staff &mdash; who will work within a primary care team model in line with the national strategy. This approach is a very effective way of harnessing the significant existing capacity in our community services, and supplementing this important resource with new additional staff. I am sure the Senator will welcome this investment.</P>

      <sTitle>Garda Deployment.</sTitle>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanKenneally"><NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for allowing me to raise this matter on the Adjournment and the Minister of State, Deputy Tim O&rsquo;Malley, for coming to the House to take it.</P>
        <P>The proposal I put forward is self-explanatory. There is a problem with garda&iacute; doing clerical work in that they are not doing what they were trained to do. We send them to Templemore for 18 months or two years; I am not sure about the <Col N="325"/>period of training. If we wanted them to work in offices we could send them to secretarial school. We have talked for many years about putting garda&iacute; on the street and employing civilian staff to carry out the duties in the various Garda stations.</P>
        <P>I have spoken to senior garda&iacute; both in Waterford city and county and it is my understanding that because of the Civil Service embargo, they have a problem in recruiting the additional clerical staff they currently need. They are trying to minimise, as much as possible, tying up garda&iacute; with clerical work but it is causing its own difficulties. They can get somebody from F&Aacute;S or elsewhere on a temporary basis, perhaps for nine or ten months. That person is trained to a certain extent but he or she must then move on. If they are fortunate enough they may get somebody else but again that will be somebody who does not know the system, which is not satisfactory.</P>
        <P>I understand that under current legislation the statements garda&iacute; take must be provided in advance in writing to those involved in various court proceedings. Many of those statements are sent in handwritten form. They are handwritten by the garda&iacute; and obviously that is not satisfactory. The Minister may not be able to read my writing and I may be unable to read the Minister&rsquo;s, and God knows what could be lost in the translation. Other work is backing up as a result of that. This is happening at a time when Garda numbers are on the rise, on which I commend the Government. They appeared to stagnate somewhat in the mid-1990s but they have risen steadily since then. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform promised to increase the strength of the Garda to 14,000. He is living up to that promise because at the end of this year, between garda&iacute; who are fully attested and those in training, there will be 14,000 garda&iacute; on the streets, which everybody will welcome.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">8 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>On that, I commend the chief superintendent in the Waterford-Kilkenny division on what he has done in the past day or two. In Waterford city he has increased the number of community garda&iacute; by six. There are now two sergeants and 12 garda&iacute; assigned to community policing. That has been warmly welcomed because everybody wants to see more garda&iacute; on the street. All Members believe that greater contact with the public will lead to benefits to all in future. There are disadvantages in other respects. It is entirely a matter for the Commissioner, and not a matter for the Minister or the Government, as to where garda&iacute; are deployed. However, Stradbally, which is a village in County Waterford, lost a garda on the retirement of the incumbent. He has not been replaced despite the fact that the village is close to Dungarvan and is growing considerably. This is an example of the frustrations which exist.</P>
        <P>I firmly believe that it would help if some garda&iacute; could be freed from clerical duties. I am told this can be done and has been done in other <Col N="326"/>areas, where one can get a derogation or permission to take on additional clerical staff. Perhaps the Garda authorities could conduct an exercise to demonstrate that the acquisition of a given number of additional clerical staff would facilitate the deployment of extra garda&iacute;, whatever the number might be, on the streets. This might be a useful exercise and perhaps everyone could live with it. It could be a sensible way to move forward. Perhaps the Minister might examine this possibility.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TimOMalleyPD"><NameTxt>Mr. T. O&rsquo;Malley</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Senator Kenneally for raising this matter on the Adjournment. Unfortunately, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is unable to be present. However, on his behalf, I am delighted to take this opportunity to clarify matters regarding clerical recruitment for the Senator and to inform him of the substantial progress that has been made by the Government in increasing the civilian and other staffing resources available to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>
        <P>As the Senator may be aware, at present 1,857 civilians are employed in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which works out at almost 13% of total staff. This figure includes approximately 1,000 staff carrying out clerical and administrative duties, as well as 49 staff employed in professional and technical areas such as financial accounting, information technology, teaching, nursing, research, and human resources. The remainder are employed on general duties as traffic wardens, cleaners, services attendants and general operatives.</P>
        <P>At present, the equivalent of 42 civilian posts are vacant within the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Of these, just 15 posts are at clerical officer or staff officer level, with the remainder in professional, technical and general services grades. At any point in time, there will be a number of vacancies in the system arising from the time lag between a post becoming vacant and the sourcing of a replacement from the central transfer list or by recruitment through the Public Appointments Service.</P>
        <P>The Minister is committed to filling all civilian vacancies in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and his Department works to ensure the length of time that posts are left unfilled is kept to a minimum. Where necessary, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has the capacity to employ staff on a temporary basis. pending the recruitment of permanent staff. In the Waterford-Kilkenny division, two clerical officer vacancies exist at present. One arises from work sharing and the other from a career break. In both cases, replacements have been provided on a temporary basis.</P>
        <P>Hence, there is no embargo on the filling of clerical vacancies in Garda stations. As the Senator is aware, there is a cap on Civil Service numbers. However, as the figures show, this has not been allowed to have an impact upon the filling of vacancies in Garda stations. The Government has decided to transfer 300 staff from the Department of Agriculture and Food to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform <Col N="327"/>to assist with the civilianisation programme in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>
        <P>The first phase of this transfer is under way, with the establishment of the Garda information service centre, GISC, in Castlebar which, when fully operational, will employ more than 160 civilian staff. The Garda information service centre has already yielded considerable benefits to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as it frees garda&iacute; from entering data on PULSE and from reviewing that data for quality assurance.</P>
        <P>The GISC is just one part of a civilianisation programme which is making significant progress. A total of 113 civilian finance officers have been appointed and carry out the district finance officer duties which were hitherto performed by garda&iacute;. A number of other posts that were previously held by members of the force have been, or are in the process of being, civilianised. Discussions are under way with staff interests with a view to transferring responsibility for civilian staff to the Garda Commissioner under the terms of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005. This transfer is due to take place on 1 October 2006.</P>
        <P>In addition, the Department, working with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, reviews the possibility of civilianising other posts on an ongoing basis. This is in keeping with the understanding that civilianisation allows certain jobs to be done at a more economic cost and allows garda&iacute; to focus on work more suited to their training and skills, thereby increasing overall operational capacity within the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. While the level of civilian vacancies in Garda stations is low, a number of posts filled by members of the force could be filled by <Col N="328"/>civilians and the Minister is determined to make progress on this issue, notwithstanding some obstacles, including the equal pay case taken by the Civil and Public Services Union, which is currently under appeal.</P>
        <P>However, I assure the Senator that the Minister is determined that the additional garda&iacute; being recruited under the current historic expansion of the force will be deployed to frontline, visible and effective policing duties. I should also note that the timescale for achieving the target strength of 14,000 members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in line with the commitment in An Agreed Programme for Government will be met. The phased increase in the strength of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to 14,000 will lead to a combined strength, of both attested garda&iacute; and recruits in training, of 14,000 by the end of this year. This project is fully on target and will be achieved.</P>
        <P>The Minister values the contribution that civilian staff make to the success of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. The Minister is committed to further civilianisation of posts in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Pending the full implementation of the civilianisation programme, the Minister is determined to ensure that vacancies in Garda stations are filled without undue delay.</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister of State for the his reply. His comment that a number of posts that are filled at present by members of the force could be filled by civilians echoes my point. I hope the Minister will be in a position to sort that out as soon as possible.</P>
