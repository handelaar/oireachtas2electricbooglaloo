    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane"><NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
	<P>Anyone who read their ESB bills recently would have noticed a rapid escalation in the cost of electricity. The OECD in a recent economic evaluation stated that in the six years of liberalisation of the market in this country, very little has happened in regard to true competition. The Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources recently commissioned a report by Deloitte &amp; Touche in regard to energy policy, in particular electricity policy. The report, which cost over &euro;1.2 million, was published last December yet its findings appear to be secret. One talks about accountability and transparency but the contents of the report are known only to the Minister, his Department, senior Department of Finance officials and the Office of the Commission for Energy Regulation. When I recently asked the energy regulator whether the information contained in the report would be made accessible I was told that as far as it was concerned, its lips were sealed.</P>
      <P>The Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources is examining the energy situation. It has employed a consultant and is meeting the various representatives in order to frame a document regarding its concerns on energy issues. The Department is also preparing an energy policy document. It is farcical that a committee is preparing a document when a <Col N="174"/>comprehensive report has been produced which could impact on and help the committee&rsquo;s work.</P>
      <P>Why is the information being withheld? Is it because, as is commonly known, it contains unpalatable truths on generating capacity and the opening of the Irish market? In that context, the Government possibly does not want confrontation or discussions with the ESB unions in the year prior to the general election. If that is the reason, it is a shabby one. The report should be open and accessible so we can all have an input on future energy policy.</P>
      <P>The Oireachtas committee recently met representatives of the large energy users. They expressed their extreme concern that Ireland is no longer as attractive a proposition as it had been because our electricity costs have risen out of all proportion to other costs. Given the 15 years of economic growth which is projected, what will stultify that growth, apart from factors such as housing demand, is escalating cost increases, by stealth or otherwise. Electricity is a main component of such costs.</P>
      <P>Taxpayers funded the &euro;1.2 million report, not the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey. As a starting point, its contents should be revealed. Let us have proper discussions on the report and frame energy polices which are applicable to Ireland&rsquo;s future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>No. 15 on the Order Paper, the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Bill 2006, is in my name and that of the Independent Senators. The Leader will recall that the Bill was to deal with the question of seeking warrants for the continued interrogation of suspects who walked free because they were in court while the issues of a case were being discussed. The object of the Bill is to ensure that the time spent arguing the case in court was not counted as part of the 24 or 48 hours. I got a response from the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform indicating that he is sympathetic to the objective of the Bill, believes it needs to be dealt with and would be disposed towards dealing with it in the forthcoming criminal justice Bill. I will talk to him about that and this is a positive response on the issue. The House generally was in favour of what I was trying to achieve in this regard.</P>
      <P>The most threatening news of the day is that we are facing up to 15 years of plenty in terms of the NCB report. While that must be seen in a positive light, we need to ensure we direct and harness it. Returning to first principles, the most fundamental basis and foundation of any economy is a well-educated, healthy population. That is where we need to begin in terms of our infrastructure, or at least it needs to be given an equal footing with other areas. We should fast-track the infrastructure not only for broadband and road and rail, which are crucial, but also the health and medical infrastructure.</P>
      <P>In that respect, I wish to repeat a point I made last night. We jump up and down here in outrage <Col N="175"/>regularly on the basis of gun crime and people dying by the gun or as a result of road accidents, but there are more unnecessary deaths among women from cancer each year. There are twice, if not three times, as many deaths among women from cancer as the cumulative number of deaths resulting from gun crime and road accidents. The lives of at least 1,000 women a year could be saved and they could be alive if we were to ensure the roll-out of the cancer screening programme to all parts of rural and provincial Ireland. The current position is disgraceful. We are more agitated about avian flu and the possibility of an outbreak of SARS in China than we are about burying many of our own people unnecessarily year after year. We need to address that. The Minister for Health and Children should come to the House and it should be pointed out to her that this is an infrastructural issue which is hugely important. This issue is only one aspect of health care &mdash; there are many more. However, this is one aspect which, if addressed, could have an immediate impact and bring about positive results. I ask that we discuss this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am as aware as anybody else of issues related to our declining competitiveness. It is worth pointing out that the Scandinavian countries are mostly in the top ten while we are in the bottom 20s in terms of international competitiveness. Therefore, when we deal with issues such as electricity and energy we need to make sure that what we will do is what will work. We have attempted to introduce what we call competition into the telecommunications industry &mdash; which most people now recognise is an unmitigated disaster, with our broadband infrastructure having fallen behind as various speculators have rewarded themselves once or twice by manipulating the ownership of our major telecommunications company &mdash; which is now acknowledged by international advisers as being wonderfully good at out-manoeuvring regulators. The first thing we need to do is to learn how to regulate and when we learn that we can deal with how monopolies should be dealt with. However, if we do it the other way around, we are simply turning a public monopoly into a private monopoly and it will then proceed to run rings around the State and make enormous amounts of money for a small <?oasys _dc28- ?>number of people, and that is not good for anybody.<?oasys _dc0- ?></P>
      <P>We should attach some reality to the forecast of 15 years of limitless growth that apparently faces us. It would serve the country well if this House were to regularly debate the medium and longer-term issues that will confront us and, perhaps, persuade some Minister to begin to look a little beyond the next six months. A major issue faces us in terms of energy, as Senator Finucane has often pointed out, and will face us in terms of oil supply in approximately 15 years time. Some countries are planning for an oil-free future, but we are sitting here hoping the problem will go <Col N="176"/>away. If this House has a purpose it ought to be to get Ministers to think a little beyond next week, next month or even the next election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>We have plenty of ten-year plans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>We have never got a plan from the Government, rather a succession of aspirations and promises that were never kept.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCoonan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coonan</NameTxt>
	<P>There was a promise to reduce waiting lists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Transport 21 was perhaps the nadir when the Government produced a loose-leaf paper with a proposal to spend &euro;30 billion. That was not a plan but the problem is that the Government thinks it is. The sooner we all figure that out the better.</P>
      <P>When a rottweiler runs away from a rabbit there is a strange political climate. In that context, I want to record something I found profoundly offensive, namely, that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform said that the sort of people who damaged his party&rsquo;s offices were the sort of people who go on anti-war protests. That is a wonderful claim because it does not single out an individual.</P>
      <P>I record that, with the exception of Senator Norris, I have probably been on more anti-war protests than anybody in this House, and I hope to continue to do so for as long as I am able to walk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Let us get a box of matches.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I would not wish for anything else to damage the PDs but I am entertained by the fact that on the same street as its offices there is a premises called Gormleys. I wonder did the PDs get a little cross, miss the target and hit their <?oasys _dc28- ?>own premises instead of Gormleys because I cannot help being amused by the coincidence of names.<?oasys _dc0- ?></P>
      <P>Yesterday morning a number of Members said they would welcome the Medical Council&rsquo;s investigation into the consultants who investigated Dr. Neary. There is a much more profound question here about the Medical Council and how it agreed to a procedure that enabled Dr. Neary to select the cases his investigators would examine. That relates to another question, that of the mystique of self-regulating professions, whether it be the legal profession or the medical profession. I would like us to have a debate on the appropriateness of these self-regulating professions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>It seems that self-regulating professions regulate themselves in the interests of the profession not of the consumer. I am a member of the engineering profession, which is nominally self-regulating. It has unfortunately to live in a much more competitive market-based model of <Col N="177"/>activity than the other professions I mentioned and because of that it has failed miserably in any attempts &mdash; of which there have been a few &mdash; to create a sort of closed shop. It has always failed to do so. A similar experience would be very good for the medical and legal professions. We could have a useful debate on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>One of the best measures of competitiveness is high sustained growth and, in that respect, we have been top of the list for approximately the past 15 years.</P>
      <P>I would like to express my deep satisfaction at the permanent ETA ceasefire, which is clearly in part at least based on the model of the Irish peace process. The Government should congratulate Mr. Zapatero, the Prime Minister of Spain who, like the Taoiseach and some of his predecessors, took serious risks for peace. We should also pay tribute to a well-known Redemptorist priest&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Hear, hear.</P>

       &mdash;&mdash;who seemingly has played nearly as important as part in the Basque peace process as he did in the Northern peace process. I believe that those who tried but unfortunately were unable to demonstrate here would appreciate the number of lives that have been saved by his endeavours.</P>
      <P>On a lighter European note, we are three months into the year of a very important commemoration. I am talking about the 250th anniversary of the birth of Mozart. I am a little disappointed that our concert organisers, opera companies and so on seem to show no signs of having any&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>There was a fortnight of events in the National Concert Hall, one night after the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>I have not seen much about it. Manchester is organising the playing of the piano concerto&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>We were the first in Europe to organise such events.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>I hope the Senator is right and that events will be organised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole"><NameTxt>Mr. O&rsquo;Toole</NameTxt>
	<P>No, they have been organised. On a point of order, we have already had concerts in the National Concert Hall.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>I have one final point to make.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not know if events organised outside this House are relevant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister for Arts, Sports and Tourism should monitor the situation to <Col N="178"/>ensure that the anniversary is properly commemorated because one of the main witnesses of the life of Mozart was the famous Irish tenor, Michael Kelly. According to experts, playing the music of Mozart is very good for babies. Do Members agree that politicians need <i>eine kleine nachtmusik</i>?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>The matter is not relevant to the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCoonan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coonan</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the call by Senator Finucane for a debate on energy and ESB charges. I am not sure whether the Government will take seriously a report which cost &euro;1.2 million when one considers that the Minister said that &euro;143 million is not a significant figure. One wonders how he would regard a figure of &euro;1.2 million. He would probably consider it to be small change which is not worth bothering about.</P>
      <P>The debate should be broadened to include the quality of service provided by semi-State bodies like the ESB. I experienced a number of difficulties when I contacted the ESB to get a connection. There was no office in the area which I could visit and I was forced to wait 41 minutes to get through to a representative when I phoned the ESB. I was then asked to press a range of buttons to access various services.</P>
      <P Just="Left">We should examine the disgraceful quality of service provided to the public by some of these semi-State bodies. Not only is a person forced to wait 41 minutes to talk to an ESB representative, he or she must also endure the strains of &ldquo;Have I Told You Lately?&rdquo; by Van Morrison when he or she is going berserk trying to get through to someone. The Leader should broaden the scope of the debate to include the quality of services provided by semi-State bodies to ensure that bodies like the ESB have local offices or, at least, local contacts which people can access. Can one imagine what it is like for young mothers with children waiting on the phone to speak to someone? People who are not computer-literate experience real problems with the ESB because it is impossible to obtain forms. The bureaucracy attached to a simple task, such as getting a connection, is stifling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>It is particularly noteworthy and gratifying for all of us that Ireland is now acknowledged as a country which exports peace to other trouble spots in the world. The peacemakers are the only antidote to hostility and war. It may appear at times that they will not succeed and yet history shows us that they have been repeatedly successful simply because they are truthful and sincere and have an amazing human tenacity which enables them to stick with their task.</P>
      <P>Fr. Alec Reid is an example of such a peacemaker. We are all aware of and it is important that we acknowledge the misrepresentation he has endured over the years. I am pleased that his <Col N="179"/>native county of Tipperary is honouring him this year with the Tipperary Person of the Year Award. It would also be very welcome if Fr. Reid could be invited to address this House because he has so much to offer us. We have discussed the situation in Iraq, Northern Ireland and international difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely"><NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a matter for the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu"><NameTxt>Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;</NameTxt>
	<P>People like Fr. Reid are at the heart of such matters. It would be wonderful if we could listen to somebody like him who has shown us what we can achieve in the cause of peace and justice. I hope that in the very near future, the Committee on Procedure and Privileges will consider extending an invitation to Fr. Reid to address the Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn"><NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Leader to draw the attention of the Minister for Foreign Affairs to the case of Abdul Rahman, about which I heard last night. Mr. Rahman is being tried this week in Kabul, Afghanistan, for converting from Islam to Christianity. Afghanistan has been rescued from the Taliban by international forces, particularly those of the US. Mr. Rahman could face the death penalty, which is being sought by prosecutors. I saw footage of him on television this morning and he appears willing to be a martyr for Christianity. It is akin to going back almost 2,000 years to hear about someone who is accused of converting from one religion to another and who is willing to give up his life for his new religion.</P>
      <P>We must do something about this case. Germany, Italy and the US have drawn the Afghan Government&rsquo;s attention to the country&rsquo;s constitution which allows the death penalty for converting from Islam to another religion but we should draw the Afghan Government&rsquo;s attention to the outrage that we in the rest of the world feel about Abdul Rahman&rsquo;s case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldineFeeney"><NameTxt>Ms Feeney</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Senator Ryan&rsquo;s call for a debate on self-regulation. The time is right for such a debate, which would be very useful.</P>
      <P>In view of the upcoming commemoration of the 1916 Rising, could the Leader ask the Minister for Defence, Deputy O&rsquo;Dea, to give some special recognition to the brave women who took part in the rising? We all know and acknowledge the great work and contribution of Countess<?oasys _jy ?>Markiewicz. However, other equally brave and fearless women like Dr. Kathleen Lynn, Winifred Carey, Margaret Skinnider and Rose McNamara played an equally important part but, sadly, are largely forgotten. The time is ripe for us as a nation to look for some special recognition for these women. I am sure nobody in this House would disagree that we all talk about the men of 1916 but rarely mention the 50 brave women who took up arms and fought for this great country.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="180"/>
    <Speaker pid="JoeMcHugh"><NameTxt>Mr. McHugh</NameTxt>
	<P>I received a letter yesterday evening from the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell. I assume every Member received the same letter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>We all received one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeMcHugh"><NameTxt>Mr. McHugh</NameTxt>
	<P>This letter is a perfect example of reactionary politics and political spin. The Minister is reacting to a situation in such a way as to justify his own position. In doing so, he referred to one part of the country, namely, Dublin. When the Minister is drawing up these analyses, could he outline how many new garda&iacute; are sitting behind desks and engaged in administrative work, rather than serving on the beat?</P>
      <P>There is life outside the Pale. When the Minister gets his civil servants to perform these detailed analyses to protect him and react to a situation, could he look outside the Pale and give those of us who live in the country an analysis of the increase in garda&iacute; in places like Cork or County Donegal? When the Minister carries out an analysis of a city like Dublin, he must also take Derry city into account. Derry city is the fourth largest city on the island, although it is outside our political jurisdiction. Towns like Killea, St. Johnston and Muff border Derry city but the area does not receive one additional resource because the fourth largest city on the island is on its doorstep. The Minister should take this fact into consideration when he is engaged in reactionary politics, justifying himself and fighting to perform for the Progressive Democrats in the next general election. It is a further example of regressive, rather than progressive, party politics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGerardHanafin"><NameTxt>Mr. Hanafin</NameTxt>
	<P>I join with those speakers who congratulated Fr. Alec Reid this morning and welcome the ceasefire announced by ETA. We also heard arguments concerning the anti-war movement and marches against the war in Iraq. I believe everyone in this House is anti-war. Perhaps it is time to have a debate on the situation in the Middle East, particularly because the US now recognises that there is a reduction in the threat of terrorism and has lowered the national threat level for the US mass transit sector. Perhaps it is time to examine the situation at Camp Delta at Guantanamo Bay and whether a full judicial procedure should be established. This would mean that those prisoners who should be released are released, while those who must pay for any crimes they have committed are tried within the judicial system.</P>
      <P>I look forward to the day when US soldiers return to barracks in Iraq, having brought about the restoration of democracy. Senator Quinn referred to the liberation of Afghanistan from the Taliban. This is exactly what happened; the country was liberated. I look forward to the day when both countries have thriving democracies. I also look forward to the day when having won the war, they achieve peace and the US will have <Col N="181"/>achieved in the Middle East what it achieved in Europe after the Second World War.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>Like everyone else in the House, I welcome the ceasefire announced by ETA. I salute the work done by people like Fr. Alec Reid, of which I learned this morning on the radio. However, before we cover ourselves in congratulations that the Irish model was followed in the ceasefire, we should reflect on the fact that at the beginning of the campaign ETA took its inspiration and its filthy trade of death from the thugs of the IRA, on which it was modelled. There is no unqualified cause of congratulations here today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><NameTxt>Dr. Mansergh</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">While I am pleased they have at last learned, it is a great pity that so many innocent civilians, including women and children, had to be slaughtered by these people. It is time they woke up. They are a disgrace to Europe, as are the provisional thugs.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>I would like to have a debate on the privatisation of Aer Lingus, which was discussed yesterday by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport. It is clear that the answers given by the Government in the other House were until recently unsatisfactory and incorrect. There should be no difficulty about the State investing in Aer Lingus; we have invested in a number of other airlines, including British Airways. I do not understand why we should not invest in our own airline. It is a cause of concern to some of us that the person appointed to advise on the disastrous Eircom situation is now being invited by the Government to advise on Aer Lingus. We know what happened to Eircom, which was a flop. Far from investing in it, the so-called &ldquo;fat cats&rdquo; came in, asset stripped it and we now have one of the worst services in Europe because of a total lack of investment.</P>
      <P>We should also investigate the operation of the redress board in which this House played an important role. I have been approached by a number of people who say they were abused 40 years ago or more. They have waited all this time and because of delays in the system and an insufficient number of judges, they are still being denied justice.</P>
      <P>We should continue to monitor operations at Shannon Airport, especially in light of reports in today&rsquo;s newspapers that the Council of Europe has advised that United States flights, especially CIA flights, should, and must be routinely inspected and that this is a legally binding requirement on governments. This is the report of the Venice commission, which also indicated that a degree of collaboration, which has existed by refuelling these rendition torture flights, constitutes complicity and that victims who survive may have a case against the Government because of its complicity in it. Not only that, the Govern<Col N="182"/>ment is required to intervene if, without landing, these aircraft pass through Irish air space. The committee that was almost established by this House should have examined that aspect.</P>

It takes courage to shake hands. Some 99% of people do nothing and make no changes in society. Just 1% of people make any change and President McAleese has done her best. She comes from the North.

	<P>I agree with my colleague, Senator McHugh, who raised the issue of the letter from the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. It is surprising to have received the letter yesterday following his mealy-mouthed apology the previous day for his outrageous <Col N="183"/>remarks on Monday. We received this letter of justification for his stance yesterday evening. I regard the letter in the same way as Senator McHugh and I am sure many others. Serious issues were raised by Deputy Bruton and others and the Minister would be more usefully employed if he tackled these issues rather than trying to justify his stance and his outrageous behaviour on Monday.</P>

	<P>Has the Senator a question?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPaulPhelan"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Phelan</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Leader arrange for a debate in this House on the report published by the Automobile Association, which is covered in a number of today&rsquo;s newspapers? This highlights accident black spots on the major roads throughout the country. The report indicates that a number of areas have been highlighted over a number of years and local authorities have not been in a position to implement safety measures because they have not got sufficient funding from the Government.</P>
      <P>There are two major causes for most fatalities on our roads, one of which is driver behaviour. Driver behaviour is being changed by the penalty points system. As someone who received penalty points, I can vouch for the fact that it has changed my behaviour. I am sure other Members have had penalty points and whose behaviour has changed as a result. There is a significant issue in regard to the condition of many roads in the country, including many of the main roads. It would be useful if we could have a debate on the report as soon as possible.</P>

	<P>I support the call for a debate on the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. I welcome the report, which clarified the position of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. It indicated that the rainbow coalition Government reduced the number of garda&iacute; from 10,900 to 10,700 during its term of office. Under the Fianna F&aacute;il-Progressive Democrats Government, the number of garda&iacute; has increased by 1,700 to 12,500.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to refer to a point raised by Senator Ryan, which is a completely different issue. The issue of self-regulation is a serious and relevant one. I was a stockbroker for some years. Stockbrokers were one of the early victims of self-regulation and no group deserved it more. The self-regulation of the Stock Exchange was a farce and it was run, as Senator Ryan rightly said, for the benefit of stockbrokers and not for the customers. Auctioneers are an example of that and it has been decided that they should lose the right to self-regulation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris"><NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
	<P>And lawyers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss"><NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Lawyers are another example. Any profession, including accountancy, which is allowed to self-regulate will abuse the customer and protect itself. This is a principle we should <Col N="186"/>discuss. There are vested interests in this House which can be flushed out or which can offer something to the debate. It is an issue which should be discussed seriously. It is an ideal subject for the Seanad with its vocational panels. Members represent vested interests and can talk about self-regulation in their professions and vocations.</P>
      <P>I welcome Senator Norris&rsquo;s call for a debate on the privatisation of Aer Lingus for which I have called on several occasions. Something has happened there which has made it far more relevant that we should have such a debate. Something strange happened yesterday, of which I am sure the Leader is aware. The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport decided to hold hearings on the privatisation of Aer Lingus. I do not know how or why that will happen because it will be a long process. I thought the decision to privatise Aer Lingus had already been made. I understood the Taoiseach said a decision had been made and that the Cabinet had to make a final decision next week about how this was to be done. What is the point of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport holding hearings, which go on into the summer, if the decision has been made? Are we to believe this is a signal for a delay?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
	<P>When will the Government publish the civil law Bill? Will it be introduced in the Seanad and what will be its main provisions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Finucane raised the issue of high ESB bills which people have been receiving. The thrust of his argument was that the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, of which he is a member, is doing a report without sight of that which the Minister has had for some time. No matter what the Minister&rsquo;s report contains, it would be good if it was published. We will ask his office if that can be done.</P>
      <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole referred to No. 15 on the Order Paper, the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Bill 2006, in his name. He said the Minister told him he intends to include it in the ever growing list of amendments to the criminal justice Bill. He talked about the 15 years of plenty but I never believe what economists say. I hope we have 15 years of plenty but I have never met an economist who has been able to read a crystal ball correctly. Economists usually find a reason to explain why they were wrong. Apologies to Senator Ross, who might be labelled an economist, but I think they want to get a bit of notice for themselves.</P>
      <P>Senator O&rsquo;Toole also talked about health infrastructure and, in particular, the number of women who are dying unnecessarily from cancer. The Senator and Senator Henry did a service to the House by tabling a motion in this House yesterday on which I was unable to speak.</P>
      <P>Senator Ryan spoke about competitiveness and about what the Minister for Justice, Equality and <Col N="187"/>Law Reform said, namely, that the people who damaged the Progressive Democrats&rsquo; offices were people who went on anti-war marches.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan"><NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>That is what he said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senator said he hoped to continue to go on such marches. He also referred to the mystique of self-regulating professions. Such professions always announce themselves with great pomp and glory. As Senator Ross said, self-regulation serves the professional and not the consumer.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Senator Mansergh referred to sustained growth. He raised the ETA ceasefire in the Basque region of Spain and praised the Spanish Prime Minister, Mr. Zapatero, who put out feelers early on. He also mentioned Fr. Alec Reid.</P>
      <P>Senator Mansergh also referred to the 250th anniversary of the birth of Mozart. This Chamber used to be a ballroom. Would it not be lovely to have a concert of Mozart&rsquo;s music? We could put the orchestra where the Cathaoirleach sits.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCoonan"><NameTxt>Mr. Coonan</NameTxt>
	<P>I wonder who would be the belle of the ball.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>It is something about which we should think. I do not know what the staff of the House would say.</P>
      <P>Senator Coonan called for a debate on energy and on the quality of service provided. I could not agree with him more. When one telephones with a query one is told to press a certain key but if one does not have a touch-tone telephone &mdash; none of the telephones in the Houses is a touch-tone telephone &mdash; one cannot get through and one ends up listening to &ldquo;The Rising of the Moon&rdquo; or &ldquo;Put Your Sweet Lips a Little Closer to the Phone&rdquo;. The Senator&rsquo;s point was solid and was about the quality of service provided by the semi-States.</P>
      <P>Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; was glad we were exporting the peace process and thought we should invite Fr. Alec Reid to the House but as the Cathaoirleach said, that is a matter for the Committee on Procedure and Privileges. Senator Quinn raised the case of Abdul Rahman who was accused of converting from Islam to Christianity. He faces death with serenity of mind. We can pass that information on to the Department of Foreign Affairs. As Senator Jim Walsh said, our voices should be heard in that regard.</P>
      <P>Senator Feeney would like the women of 1916 to be commemorated. They would have got 1916 and Cumman na mBan medals but I agree with the Senator. I was interested to read Tom<?oasys _jy ?>Clonan&rsquo;s recent article. He has been corrected but on small matters. There was a brave woman <Col N="188"/>from Athlone, Mrs. Eilish O&rsquo;Brien, who was in the Royal College of Surgeons. She was one of the 50 women mentioned in <i>The Irish Times</i> article. All of these women were courageous. I thought it interesting that Mr. de Valera gave the order that he did not want any women in Boland&rsquo;s Mills. He wanted complete purity of purpose in his endeavours. Be that as it may, the team responsible for the 1916 commemorations should pay attention to this aspect.</P>
      <P>Senator McHugh referred to the letter from the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. His party colleague, Deputy Bruton, raised the matter so I expect the Minister was responding to it. Now everyone will write to him, looking for the figures for counties Westmeath, Longford, Donegal, etc., and I would encourage Members to do that. Already, people are asking me what is happening in County Westmeath on the basis that they know Dublin is being looked after. Senator McHugh wants to know what is happening about County Donegal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeMcHugh"><NameTxt>Mr. McHugh</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not being well looked after.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Ms O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>He is looking after Longford. No doubt we shall hear from him, but he will hear from me, too, so it is all the same.</P>
      <P>Senator Hanafin raised the matter of Fr. Alec Reid and the Middle East as well as the thriving democracies he believes the United States will leave behind. I do not know about that, but it will take a long time.</P>
      <P>Senator Norris welcomed the ETA ceasefire, but brought up the matter to which I referred earlier. I am informed by Senator Mansergh, however, that ETA was two or three years in existence before Sinn F&eacute;in&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Senator John Paul Phelan referred to the AA report on road black spots throughout the country which could well merit a debate. Senator Walsh welcomed the letter from the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell.

    <P Just="Center">NEW SECTIONS.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Mr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 5, before section 1, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P LI="1">&ldquo;1.&mdash;The Minister shall within 6 months from after the passing of this Act prepare and lay before both Houses of the Oireachtas a report on the effect and operation of means tests overall in the social welfare system and in particular in relation to the carer&rsquo;s allowance.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">There has been much debate in recent times as regards the system operated by the Department of Social and Family Affairs. It is worthwhile at this stage to look at how various schemes are being administered. The Minister made an important announcement this week that has to be welcomed. Nonetheless, we need to look at the procedures and methods in place that deal with issues which may not necessarily have arisen when the methods now being used by the Department were first introduced.</P>
      <P Just="Left">A particular case has come to my attention recently concerning someone with a low-level literacy standard who cannot work or seek employment on grounds of ill-health. This a person who is unable to speak up for himself, and except for the benevolence of a neighbour, would be left behind by a system not designed to deal with such a specific case. This is a case involving someone <Col N="191"/>running a very small unprofitable farm who has applied for a payment but whose debts incurred are increasing rapidly year by year. A credit system is operated by the local creamery. The individual reached a point where he was physically no longer able to work and applied for a payment or award of &euro;28 per week.</P>
      <P>The nine cows on the 50-acre farm were got rid of while the majority of the acreage is mountainy and of no benefit to the owner. This has been calculated against the individual in question to whom a reduced payment of &euro;28 per week has been issued.</P>
      <P>The person in question qualifies for a medical card and has a cancerous lump on his neck. He is driven to Cork University Hospital three times per week by his brother who qualifies for a social welfare payment. This person does not have enough money to buy food or pay bills. The quality of life, or lack thereof, that this person must endure is a throwback to a bygone era. The failure of the system in this case highlights that it is not designed to cater for individuals who find themselves in circumstances of this kind. Any Christian who examined the case would accept its merits given the dire conditions, poverty and deteriorating health with which the person in question must live. It is not good enough that the system does not provide for specific needs such as those outlined. It must be overhauled.</P>
      <P>This is only one of many cases I have encountered in recent times. On previous occasions, I brought to the attention of the Minister another case involving a person whose application for a social welfare payment was refused. This is an important case because it is not isolated. I am certain it is replicated across the country because the circumstances I will describe extend beyond geographical boundaries. The person in question suffered from severe depression and was advised, when the depression eventually began to lift, to apply for a social welfare payment. The person had previously worked and paid PRSI contributions and always made a significant contribution to the State. Unfortunately, due to the nature of the illness, the person was not in a position to make an application for a social welfare payment.</P>
      <P>The applicant was initially informed that the level of contributions made was insufficient to qualify for a social welfare payment. The person then applied for invalidity benefit and allowance but was refused a second time. The person was called to attend a doctor and should have been treated with humanity. The doctor was not personable, however, and did not assist the applicant who was in the throes of trying to defeat depression. Following this rigmarole, a payment was refused and the applicant did not appeal the decision. This is not a unique case but to be fair to the Minister, he took a personal interest in it and I appreciate the correspondence I received on the matter from his private office.</P><Col N="192"/>
      <P>It is unacceptable that a person who experiences an illness such as depression will fail under our archaic system to qualify for a payment to which he or she is at least morally entitled. The application in this case did not survive the various checks and balances because of the nature of the system. Surely the system must be reviewed and the procedures and methods deployed to process applications engineered in such a manner as to cater for the particular needs of individuals such as those I described.</P>
      <P>The doctor in this case showed no interest. The Department should consider introducing other approaches which take into account all relevant information and under which the outcome of individual cases are determined on merit. Sufficient medical evidence is available to support what I have said. I ask the Minister to examine the ideology driving our archaic system which leaves many people behind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister to the House. Senator McCarthy has outlined a number of individual cases in which people were caught up in the means test arrangements. These reflect a large number of similar cases. I ask the Minister to keep the system under review and take into account a range of issues, including those raised by Senator McCarthy, when carrying out any such review.</P>
      <P>I will focus on the means test applied to carers. I take on board the Minister&rsquo;s comments on Second Stage on Tuesday in reply to my request that he consider abolishing this means test. He informed Senators that the cost of such a measure would be approximately &euro;140 million and indicated that he needed to consider whether it was preferable to widen the net or increase payments to carers.</P>
      <P>While it is difficult to argue with the Minister in this regard, as Senators are aware, many carers do not qualify for carer&rsquo;s allowance because of the means test. We must recognise the work done by carers and the sacrifices they make. While I recognise it will not be possible to do this immediately, I hope the Minister will consider abolishing the means test before the next budget in order that more carers will be brought into the net and have their work recognised and, more important, to ensure more people will take on the task of caring for elderly relatives.</P>
      <P>The Department should not work in isolation but hand in hand with the Department of Health and Children to facilitate older people returning home from hospital. We are all aware of the problems associated with the large number of older people occupying hospital beds. If we managed to encourage and financially reward more people to care for older people at home, we would do a service for many people by freeing up beds and allowing older people to be cared for at home. This would also recognise the work done by carers who are not currently financially rewarded. At the same time, the abolition of the <Col N="193"/>means test would bring other carers into the net. I ask the Minister to consider introducing such a measure in the year ahead or, failing this, to take action to improve the position for more carers.</P>
      <P>As I noted on Second Stage, figures provided by the Carers Association indicate that only 24,000 of 150,000 carers receive either carer&rsquo;s benefit or carer&rsquo;s allowance. Clearly, therefore, a large number of carers are not being financially rewarded for their work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>The amendment calls on me to lay before the House a report on means testing in the area of carer&rsquo;s allowance. While I cannot accept the amendment on technical grounds, this formula is often used to ensure a debate takes place on an issue. I am always pleased to lay reports before the Seanad whenever requested and to come before the House to discuss issues. While I have no difficulty with the spirit of the amendment, it is not possible to accept it on technical grounds.</P>
      <P>I was pleased to meet Senator McCarthy recently in Boston. When a person by the name of Senator McCarthy shows up at a function in the United States a shiver goes down spines but people were greatly relieved to learn that the Senator in question was a brand new, bright politician from Ireland as opposed to the subject of a current movie.</P>
      <P>As Senators will be aware, the carer&rsquo;s disregards were significantly increased in the recent budget to &euro;290 per week for a single person and &euro;580 per week for a couple. As a result of this change, a couple with two children may earn up to &euro;32,925 per annum and continue to receive the maximum rate of carer&rsquo;s allowance, while a couple earning up to &euro;54,400 would receive the minimum allowance. In effect, when allowances are made for PRSI and other expenses, most family sizes on average industrial earnings will qualify for the maximum rate of carer&rsquo;s allowance, which is indicative of the good progress made.</P>
      <P>The respite care grant, a popular relief for many people, has increased to &euro;1,200. Senators requested that I do more to promote this grant and I undertake to do so. The family income supplement, FIS, campaign is going well and I will give some thought to introducing a carer&rsquo;s campaign thereafter with the aim of attracting more people to avail of the respite care grant. I am always prepared to contemplate changes and the Department has made many changes in the previous two budgets. This legislation is surrounded by reforms. I am open to change and progress because, with regard to the welfare system, I fundamentally believe that while finance and income are critical, the social policy behind them is also important. In that context, I have an open mind on abolishing the means test, which, as I previously stated, would cost &euro;140 million. I am not convinced that represents the best use of &euro;140 <Col N="194"/>million, in so far as improving the disregards and raising income limits is probably more targeted than completely abolishing the means test. However, if a stage is reached where the efforts involved in administering the means test are greater than the cost would warrant, it may then be better to introduce a universal scheme. I will keep the matter under review as the year progresses. As the disregards are increased and more people are brought within the scheme, the cost of removing the means test theoretically decreases. However, provision must be made according to the resources available.</P>
      <P>According to the CSO, 40,000 people provide care for more than six hours per day, 8,000 between four and six hours and 15,000 for between two and four hours. Some 85,000 people &mdash; a significant figure &mdash; provide care for fewer than two hours per day. These figures were revealed in replies to a question in the 2002 census on the number of people providing unpaid personal care for a friend or family member with a long-term illness, health problem or disability. The latter 85,000 fall into a different category of care and, while I do not say we should ignore them, they should be borne in mind when the headline figure of 150,000 is quoted. These figures probably need to be re-checked because they date from 2002.</P>
      <P>The total cost of the budget package for carers this year is &euro;54 million and overall support for carers has increased from &euro;223 million in 2005 to approximately &euro;270 million for the current year. Some 34,000 respite care grants were paid last year at a cost of &euro;34 million and 2,268 claims were made for carer&rsquo;s benefit. I agree that carers should be recognised, valued and supported. An important issue also arises in terms of looking after the needs of carers so that they can see to the needs of others. Policy should now be focused on that.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 5, before section 1, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P LI="1">&ldquo;1.&mdash;The Minister shall within 6 months from after the passing of this Act prepare and lay before both Houses of the Oireachtas a report on introducing an earnings disregard for the purposes of social welfare benefits for relatives who assist in childminding similar to that for childminders.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">The Minister is correct in that these amendments are being brought to ensure the issue remains on the agenda. We cannot propose more forthright amendments because these would have fiscal <Col N="195"/>implications and would therefore be deemed out of order. Nonetheless, it is opportune to discuss these issues because child care is a political hot potato.</P>
      <P>The family members who provide invaluable services to the parents of young children could end up losing out as a result of their work. People have been pushed into commuter belts, where they are cut off from their families and the communities in which they grew up. House prices and other economic factors are significant factors in the lives of such people. We must have regard to the circumstances in which people on the lower end of the income scale are disadvantaged for providing a valuable service to family members. I urge the Minister to explore whether there is room for developing this issue. This amendment has already been debated on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il, where useful exchanges occurred between Opposition Deputies and the Minister. However, it is important that the issue be also raised in this House, to ensure that those who provide this service are dealt with sympathetically.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the amendment tabled by Senator McCarthy and congratulate the Minister on bringing childminders who mind up to three children within the home into the PRSI net. That worthwhile provision will ensure these people, the majority of whom are women, are entitled to contributory pensions and maternity benefits.</P>
      <P>I concur with Senator McCarthy that people who are in receipt of social benefits while minding children should be able to earn some form of compensation for their work without affecting their allowances, although I am not sure of the measures currently in place. Usually this money is paid under the counter and is not declared but people are entitled to payment in return for minding children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I have misgivings about this line of argument. The introduction of the disregard for earnings of up to &euro;10,000 was a good incentive for people to undertake child minding activities. Disregarding these earnings for social welfare benefits will create an anomaly in that the earnings of other people on low salaries are taken into account when their social welfare benefits are determined and they may also seek similar provisions. It is already possible to receive benefit while earning less than the disregard. A case might be made for excluding the &euro;10,000 from the payment, so that it represents net earnings. The tax benefit will not then be factored into calculations for social welfare purposes. However, disregarding the entire amount is not a sustainable argument.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>I appreciate Senator Terry&rsquo;s remarks on PRSI. Extensive discussion was held on this issue, which some felt was informal <Col N="196"/>income and, as such, should not involve either tax or PRSI. I took the opposite view. To ask women in particular not to have a PRSI contribution for a period, however small the income, would store up trouble for the future. Some other Minister may be standing here in 20 years time and be asked to backdate it, for example. I am glad the Senator spotted the issue and had been calling for it. I appreciate the comments.</P>
      <P>Senator Jim Walsh is correct in his comments on the &euro;10,000 limit. It is income and it would be going too far to disregard it for welfare purposes on top of normal income. Welfare payments exist to support people and must usually take income into account. In some cases, such as child benefit, it clearly does not. In many cases across the board, however, income must be taken into account and treated accordingly. This income would be exempt from taxation, which is particularly useful, and the disregard would be up to &euro;200 per week. If an extra disregard is put in, it would be difficult to integrate this into the social welfare system without introducing many other anomalies.</P>
      <P>I will give an example. A lone parent minding children in the home could earn up to &euro;200 per week before the payment would be affected. A lone parent minding children in a cr&egrave;che or on a community employment scheme could have his or her payment reduced once the weekly earnings reached &euro;146, which is the limit for lone parents. A specific disregard for child minding, as is sought in the amendment, could lead to poverty traps. Taking the combined income of welfare payments and allowable earnings, the incentive to increase earnings beyond the threshold, and thus move out of the welfare system, is likely to be removed.</P>
      <P>Another example would be if a spouse of a person with two children was on unemployment assistance or the recipient of disability benefit. Up to &euro;192 per week could be earned without affecting the payment, which would include qualified adult allowance and child dependent allowance additions for a spouse and children. In that case, the total household income would exceed &euro;500 per week. That would clearly bring about a poverty trap that would not be sustainable. It would be increasingly difficult to get people back into the workforce if that type of income was permitted to be built up through use of the welfare system. This is a good scheme which has been generally welcomed across the Houses.</P>
      <P>With regard to the &euro;1,000 per annum allowance for children under six years, the first payment is in August, the second is in September and I hope the third payment will be in December. Thereafter, payment will occur in the week following the end of the quarter. As Senators know, it is a quarterly payment. The tax exemption on &euro;10,000 of earnings should also help. I have no doubt that over the years these figures will only move in one direction.</P>

    <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Mr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 5, before section 1, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P LI="1">&ldquo;1.&mdash;The Minister shall within 6 months from after the passing of this Act prepare and lay before both Houses of the Oireachtas a report on continued anomalies affecting persons who were recipients of deserted wife&rsquo;s benefit.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">This issue was again raised on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il by Deputies Se&aacute;n Ryan and Penrose. The Minister is clearly aware of it. Deputy Se&aacute;n Ryan has been very insistent with regard to this amendment. He has indicated that only a small number of people are affected, and the case has been articulated quite well in the other House on the nature of the exact anomaly. The amendment proposes to deal with this, and I ask the Minister to deal with the anomalies where people could find themselves worse off as a result of changes made. Although the number of people affected is declining, I ask the Minister to keep the issue under constant review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Se&aacute;n Ryan has expressed strong views on this issue in the other House and on Committee Stage. I promised him I would keep it under consideration. It is difficult as the issue goes back to 1992, when an earnings limit was introduced for deserted wife&rsquo;s benefit. Following from this, the one-parent family payment, or the lone parent allowance as it is now called, was introduced in 1997. The deserted wife&rsquo;s scheme was discontinued with effect from 2 January 1997. The scheme was retained to the extent of existing entitlements already acquired in August 1992, when the earnings limit was introduced for new claimants, and in 1997 when the one-parent family payment was introduced. It has been preserved for existing entitlements.</P>
      <P>In the 2006 budget, the upper earnings limit to receive benefit for one-parent families was increased to &euro;19,500 of gross earnings per year, an increase of &euro;83 per week. A recipient of deserted wife&rsquo;s benefit with dependent children can transfer, which is an important point. If a person is on the old deserted wife&rsquo;s allowance, that person can transfer to the one-parent family payment if it is beneficial to do so. Such a facility is important.</P>
      <P>There are currently approximately 100 recipients of deserted wife&rsquo;s benefit on reduced rates due to earnings, of which 48 would be eligible to transfer to a one-parent family payment. It is an important issue for those people, as stressed by Deputy Se&aacute;n Ryan. The paper my Department published a few days ago on supports for lone parents gives us a chance to debate these issues. I hope we avail of the opportunity in the Bill to <Col N="198"/>debate these issues. I will keep the matter under review.</P>
      <P>Essentially what has occurred is that an old scheme was closed down, a new scheme was initiated, and some people stayed on the old scheme despite having the option to move to the new scheme. They found that their income may have increased and were caught by limits. In most cases, the issue has been that these people got additional earnings above the limit and were therefore not entitled to it. We will keep the matter under review, as we do with all schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    <P>Sections 1 to 3, inclusive, agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">NEW SECTION.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 6, before section 4, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P LI="1">&ldquo;4.&mdash;The Minister shall, within 3 months of the commencement of this Act, lay a report on the effectiveness of Child Benefit and Child Income Support as a tool for tackling child poverty, before the Houses of the Oireachtas.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I compliment the Minister on his thinking since he came into the Department of Social and Family Affairs, and the efforts he has made to bring about reforms in the short time he has been there. I agree with the Minister&rsquo;s argument that we can no longer solely accept that giving money to people in certain circumstances will improve a family&rsquo;s lot. The same could be said in the case of children.</P>
      <P>I agree that we must find better ways of tackling child poverty. It is a disgrace that we still have so many children in this country living in poverty. Money is obviously essential to unemployed people or those on low income and we must give financial assistance. Over the years, however, we have seen that merely giving money is not the only option for lifting people out of poverty. The Minister is taking an approach that takes this into account. I have not yet gone through the document launched by the Minister some days ago regarding support for lone parents, but I know there are many factors in it which will help lone parents. It clearly follows that it will also help children.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>I recognise that child benefit has increased significantly over the past number of years, but do we have any way of measuring if the increase has taken children out of poverty? Have we been able to measure the benefit of the increases parents have received? Many children still, unfortunately, go to school without a breakfast or warm clothes to wear and do not have a hot meal during the day. We use these indicators to distinguish children who experience poverty. Their attendance at <Col N="199"/>school suffers, affecting their literacy and overall education.</P>
      <?oasys _cl11.5- ?>
      <P>We are creating another cycle of poverty. If some people were trained to manage their income, meagre though it may be, they would have sufficient to feed their family properly. The key is managing the money they have. It is very difficult to live on social welfare benefits but there is a lack of training for certain families to manage their money and break the cycle of poverty that has affected them for generations. The Department of Social and Family Affairs, along with others, must adopt a multidisciplinary approach to tackle the curse of poverty affecting many families.</P>
      <P>I acknowledge the approach the Minister is taking. I do not say we should cut back on financial support but other things must be done to support families, such as providing training and other support mechanisms. Has the Minister any indicators that the improvements in child benefit have had a positive effect in taking children out of poverty?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Mr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>I support this amendment. Other methods must be employed to alleviate and eventually eliminate child poverty because, without being flippant, throwing money at the problem will not succeed. Senator Terry has eloquently outlined cases where children attend school without clean, warm clothing, fail to have a warm meal one in every two or three days and lack a sufficient red meat diet. These are worrying facts brought to us by the Combat Poverty Agency and other anti-poverty agencies.</P>
      <P>It is very important to bear in mind that many aspects of the Celtic tiger and the economic prosperity we have enjoyed in recent years have masked these problems. They have not ceased but exist under the surface. Many of those affected do not have a voice and cannot articulate their circumstances. The organisations studying these issues tell us that other measures must be put in place to alleviate child poverty. Has the Minister considered any measures, other than child income support and child benefit, to eliminate child poverty?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I was impressed by Senator Terry&rsquo;s comments. The manner in which she put forward the amendment struck a chord and made a lot of sense. Child poverty involves much more than the monetary amount coming into a household. There is a range of other issues, not least where a child comes from a family where education is not a priority and is often viewed with derision, putting him or her at a huge disadvantage. Although there are mechanisms that address this, there must be enhanced efforts to break the cycle so that people who come from such a background have a better chance. The <Col N="200"/>number attending third level education has increased considerably in the past decade and is a significant factor but some people are, despite our economic success, left behind. Attitude is an important factor and any mechanisms that address that should be put in place.</P>
      <P>There is great reluctance, which I understand and, to an extent, support, to introduce means testing for child benefit. However, there are people on six figure incomes who are in receipt of it. Given the reluctance to introduce a limit over which it would not be paid, perhaps there could be a voluntary scheme encouraging people on incomes exceeding, for example, &euro;100,000 or &euro;150,000, not to avail of the benefit. I do not know to what extent it would be taken up but I suspect some people, having had opportunities in modern Ireland which their parents or grandparents did not have, might see it as a chance to forgo money that can be better utilised for needy children or other causes. Maybe that is too optimistic and puts undue faith in people&rsquo;s altruism but I believe some people would act in that way and it might achieve the objective without imposing limits, which I feel would be resisted by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>If I had one wish for my time in this Department it would be for child poverty to disappear. There are many other priorities but that would be the one I would pick. In 21st century Ireland it is totally unacceptable that any child should live in poverty and a decent country like ours should not tolerate it a day longer. I feel strongly about it because the brashness of these days gives one to believe there are no children living in poverty, whereas the sad reality is there are. The 2004 official figure for child poverty, meaning children aged under 16, was 9%. We have made substantial moves in 2005 and 2006 so I suspect the figure has significantly reduced. The figure for people technically living in poverty in the population as a whole is 6%. I say &ldquo;technically&rdquo; because the figures derive from formulas and can be crude.</P>
      <P>I will put forward some examples of the measures we have introduced. The family income supplement, which we have advertised recently, provides a major support for low income families. Child poverty exists above all in lone parent families, followed by households where both parents are unemployed. Significantly, child poverty also exists in low income families, where a parent has earnings. The family income supplement applies to these cases. One, possibly extreme, example involves a family with four children, two aged under six, on an income of &euro;20,000. Although that is above the minimum wage it constitutes a low income when mortgage and bills are taken into account. That family can claim &euro;2,000 for child care, because of the two children aged under six, child benefit of &euro;8,000 <Col N="201"/>and family income supplement of a further &euro;7,977. It can also claim a back-to-school allowance of &euro;480. The figures are not always spelled out so I wish to put on record that such a family can get &euro;18,000 in welfare on top of income of &euro;20,000, bringing its total income up to &euro;38,000.</P>
      <P>Most of these provisions were made in the past two budgets and constitute a direct assault on child poverty. If it was not for the fact that such houeholds include four children the sums would not add up and those in question would not receive such funds. I will give one final example before concluding.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>Could the Minister go over those figures again?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes. A four-child family on &euro;20,000 gross income could receive &euro;2,000 in child care, &euro;8,000 in child benefit, &euro;8,000 in family income supplement and &euro;480 in back to school allowance, comprising a total social welfare package of approximately &euro;18,000 and giving a total income of &euro;38,000. Very little taxation would be involved due to the low income.</P>
      <P>Taking the example of an unemployed family with two children, both of whom are under six years of age, it will receive unemployment assistance of &euro;16,000. Using approximate figures, the family will also receive &euro;2,000 in child care, &euro;3,600 in child benefit and &euro;240 in back to school allowance and will probably qualify for the fuel allowance of approximately &euro;400, bringing the family&rsquo;s total income to &euro;22,000, an additional &euro;6,000 on the basic unemployment assistance figure.</P>
      <P>As Senators can see, all of the extra income is child-focused. If the family does not have any children, it will not receive the extra income. Keeping these numbers moving is the best way to get money into those families and tackle child poverty. There are dozens of other examples that I would like to publish at some stage, as they show what is possible.</P>
      <P>For this reason, tapering and phasing are required. The transition from being able to get these types of unemployment funds to enter the world of work must be smooth. Like an accelerator and a clutch, a person must rely on one while easing off the other. This is critically important in welfare, as people would stay in a poverty trap instead of moving in the direction they should, that is, to work, which is the best response to child poverty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister&rsquo;s statement warrants comment. The manner in which he spelled out the situation was informative but it could be circulated with other examples. As Senator Terry said, the Minister should be commended. There have been significant and focused improvements in social welfare, particularly in recent years. The Minister has taken a keen interest in the matter <Col N="202"/>and impressed everyone by the manner with which he has approached this portfolio.</P>
      <P>I welcome the encouragement given to people to escape the poverty trap. It is significant that in the example given, an additional social welfare payment of &euro;18,000 will be made to someone who works and earns &euro;20,000 as opposed to someone who is unemployed. I welcome this measure. The manner in which the Minister recently dealt with the lone parents issue shows the same philosophy of encouraging people to avail of opportunities in the workplace without penalising them. People have often tried to get jobs in the black economy and did not avail of better job opportunities because they might have lost their social welfare benefits pound for pound. It was a difficult and stark choice. While the Minister will agree that it is not a panacea, this encouragement will be a significant step in the right direction for people who are on modest social welfare or other incomes if progress continues.</P>
      <P>As Senator Terry stated, it is important to holistically tackle the range of other issues. Often, the problem is not monetary poverty, rather poverty of thinking and ambition. I am not speaking on a partisan basis because I speak my mind and, if I believed the Minister was wrong, I would say so. In this instance the Minister deserves every credit for what he has done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Mr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his illustrative examples of the social welfare packages that families could receive. I welcome these measures, as directing such child-centred payments towards the families in question is impressive. While I do not wish to detract from the importance of the figures, is there a concern in the Department of Social and Family Affairs that some of the money might not reach its targets? Unfortunately, some parents might not think like the rest of us or believe the money should be spent on their children, which highlights Senator Terry&rsquo;s amendment. If there is a concern, are there realistic ways of avoiding that situation? It may be impossible but is there a school of thought on how to ensure that children receive the benefit of the payments, which are not intended to improve the social lives of parents or provide luxuries? It would be good if we could ensure that the benefit of the money reaches its targets.</P>
      <P Just="Left">Senator Jim Walsh is correct in that investment in education is a large weapon with which to beat poverty. As he stated, we are not only speaking about monetary poverty, but poverty of ambition, which affects other aspects of the lives of the people involved. Does the Department have concerns about parents drinking away the money or spending it in a flaithi&uacute;lach manner instead of spending it to alleviate child poverty?</P>

	<P Just="Left">I thank the Minister for his response and for outlining the benefits. Payments have rightly improved significantly in recent years. Senator McCarthy made an important point in that, while none of us wants to say that unemployed people or those on low incomes should not have social lives, there should be some training and management of funds, which was my initial point.</P>
      <P>The Minister cited the back to school allowance, which is the only figure that must be vouched for. We are sure that it will be spent on children but other payments could be spent on anything. I am not saying that we should look for vouchers or receipts from people for their child care supplement spending, but there is a danger that the money handed out will not be spent on the children. The intention is to help parents with their child care costs but it is a universal supplement given to everyone with a child under the age of six years. While the supplement is welcome, we know that it does not go far in terms of the weekly costs of child care and can be spent in other ways.</P>
      <P>The back to school allowance is positive and ensures that children will get proper clothing. As has been raised here and in the other House, figures every September show us that the supplement is a small amount. I do not want to delay the House further on this amendment because we are all as one. We want to ensure that money is well spent and that children benefit from it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Senators are correct, child benefit is paid to the mother. The new child care allowance is not a vouched payment so, in theory, a family could choose to spend the child benefit and the new child care allowance of &euro;1,000 on something other than the child. There is no legal mechanism to address this but research indicates child benefit is used for family purposes in the broadest sense. In rare cases the Department may decide to pay the benefit to the father rather than the mother if family circumstances are brought to our attention. The officials in the Department are very sensitive and in cases where clear evidence shows the money is not being used to the benefit of the child it may be paid to the father or the guardian. Paying substantial funds to the child&rsquo;s mother involves a major element of trust. If we stop trusting the mothers of Ireland we are in serious trouble.</P>
      <P>The back-to-school payment is means tested and was greatly improved this year. We increased the allowance by &euro;40 per child, amounting to &euro;120 for children between two and 11 years of age and &euro;180 for those between 12 and 22, effective from June 2006. These targeted payments are very welcome and are not vouched. We pay them under the back to school scheme but if the mother decides it is time for a trip to Brown Thomas I cannot do anything.</P>

<?oasys _ic14- ?>
      <P LI="1">&ldquo;8.&mdash;The Minister shall, within 3 months of the commencement of this Act, lay before the Houses of the Oireachtas, a report on the review of social welfare payments for carers.&rdquo;.</P>
<?oasys _ic0- ?>
      <P FLI="0">We have had an interesting debate on carers but the means test is something we must review throughout the year. The take-up of the respite care grant is a matter I wish to keep under review to ensure people are aware of it. I meet people who would have been entitled to this grant but they were not aware of it or they did not have the wherewithal to fill out the forms. It would be worthwhile to keep this matter under review. The area needs to be expanded to bring more people into the net because it is the way forward for caring for older people or those with disabilities. It is a sign of the times that few people are in a position to care or undertake voluntary work. Many women and people who were unemployed have returned to the workplace and they are missed in the community. We must ensure we have a sufficient number of carers to look after people in their homes so the elderly do not have to end their days in institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>This has been dealt with in an earlier amendment. It is better to care for people in their homes and this is the preferred option and the policy of the Minister for Health and Children with regard to home care and the income supports for carers from my Department. We seek to make it financially attractive to care for people at home.</P>
      <P>In the recent budget the carer&rsquo;s allowance was increased to &euro;200. As I stated in the D&aacute;il yesterday, this is the highest single welfare payment in the State, higher than unemployment assistance benefit and pensions. This was done deliberately to show recognition for carers. The Departments of Health and Children and Social and Family Affairs need joined-up policy to ensure it is possible to care for people at home. I share the Senator&rsquo;s objective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>Could the application forms for these benefits be made as simple as possible? Some forms are most complicated and this poses a problem for many people. As the forms com<Col N="205"/>prise many pages and the questions are not clear some people do not bother applying for the benefit. I am aware booklets are provided with these forms but it has been brought to my attention that the forms are difficult to complete.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I will review the carer&rsquo;s allowance form, if the Senator is referring to that. We continually review forms to improve them but basic information is necessary. The Department makes more than 1 million payments per week and there is hardly a household in the country that does not receive a payment from it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>Senator Terry has indicated her opposition to this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
<?oasys _ic10- ?>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>The section refers to pre-retirement allowances. This was the only section to which Senator Terry&rsquo;s colleagues in the D&aacute;il seriously objected but in the end we reached a meeting of minds. The pre-retirement allowance was introduced in 1990 for older long-term recipients of unemployment assistance, those who had effectively retired from seeking employment and, by extension, the labour force. It was initially aimed at those aged 60 and over but this was reduced to 58 in 1991 and reduced to 55 in 1992. The allowance scheme for single women was integrated with the pre-retirement allowance in November 1992. The requirement to be available and genuinely seeking work dose not apply to those on the allowance so monthly signing is not required. It is paid weekly and is equal to the rate of unemployment assistance. It is unemployment assistance that does not have to be signed for, for which there is no requirement to seek work and which is paid from the age of 55. Participation is voluntary. Some recipients of long-term unemployment assistance over the age of 55 do not opt to take this payment but instead stay on unemployment assistance, which means they must seek work. PRETA numbers have decreased from a high of 15,300 in 1994 to 11,000 at the end of last year. Almost four fifths of these recipients are male. Some 68% of new recipients are under 60 years of age although significant numbers over the age of 60 continue to apply for the payment.</P>
<?oasys _ic0- ?>
      <P>In the legislation I propose that no new person will join this scheme from a date to be specified in September. As a result the scheme will be phased out over a period of approximately ten years as the current recipients, people over 55 <Col N="206"/>years, reach pensionable age. Those currently on the live register and aged between 55 and 66 who might have transferred to this scheme will no longer be able to do so. The proposed change will not affect existing recipients of the scheme. Although this reform will lead to an increase in the live register of approximately 2,000, based on current inflows, this increase will happen gradually over a year and will be offset to some extent by the impact of the employment action plan, which is being extended to all age groups. Under the employment action plan F&Aacute;S assists unemployed people to get jobs. It formerly did not apply to people aged 55 and over.</P>
      <P>The PRETA scheme came in when unemployment was high. To get people off the register the Government took the view that unemployed people over the age of 55 would never work again and there was no point in retraining, educating or talking to them. They were put on the shelf and paid the unemployment rate until they reached the age of 66 after which they received the pension. This is no longer appropriate. We should intervene with people over 55 years up to their pension age and beyond, help and encourage them to find new opportunities, training and education. I cannot touch the 11,000 people already on this because they have made lifestyle decisions and it would be unfair to interfere with them. It is not right to allow new people aged 55 to go onto a permanent pension with no arm of the State giving them any help, support or encouragement to find employment. That is not fair to them or to their dependants and that is why I have made this move.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister. I did not intend to oppose this section because I agree with the Minister&rsquo;s proposal. I can understand why this payment was there in past years and I thank the Minister for allowing those on that scheme to remain on it. In light of our changing economic climate and our healthier, fitter and longer-living population it is right that this scheme be abolished and that only those who are unemployed for very good reasons should receive unemployment assistance. The same is true in the private sector where one of the biggest mistakes has been retiring people at the age of 55. This had an impact on occupational pension funds. It was wrong to retire young people, and I consider 55 to be young. The same has to be said about people in this category, particularly the people now coming up to that age. Hopefully they will have been in employment, will be able to take on training and many will want to continue working when they reach the age of 65. We are making provisions to allow that to happen, which I welcome.</P>

    <P Just="Center">NEW SECTIONS.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 18, before section 28, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P LI="1">&ldquo;28.&mdash;The Minister shall, within 3 months of the commencement of this Act, lay before the Houses of the Oireachtas, a report on the position of one parent families.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I proposed this because I am interested in the document launched last week and I have asked that we examine and debate it in this House, which would be worthwhile. Many of its provisions are worthwhile and I like the Minister&rsquo;s thinking on how to support people in their efforts to improve their situation. We give them financial support but also make demands of them and give them the necessary supports to return to the workplace or to education. That is the way forward to help people out of poverty. I am concerned that not everybody is able to return to work. I am talking about lone parents, particularly some mothers who may find it difficult to cope with young children alone. Children might suffer more if their parents went back to work. In encouraging, helping and supporting people to return to work or education we must be careful not to put children in a worse situation.</P>
      <P>The cohabitation rule is outdated and needs reform, as proposed in the document. As we have a growing number of lone parents, we therefore have a growing number of young children who in many instances do not know who the other parent, usually the father, is. We should do all we can to ensure that, as far as possible, a child has two parents, regardless of whether the second parent is the natural parent. Although that will not be the case for many, we should encourage two-parent or two-adult families to care for children. The Minister&rsquo;s proposal is worthwhile, as are many other proposals that we will not discuss today. I call for a debate on that document as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad that document is published and I thank the lone parents&rsquo; associations and organisations whose representatives I met recently. I also pay tribute to the officials and working groups who put so much work into that document. Yesterday the Seanad Office asked me when I might be in a position to debate that matter in the House. I understand the debate is provisionally set for immediately after the Easter break, so we will be able to have a good discussion at that time. It is appropriate for me to leave the matter at that.</P>
      <P>At present total State spending on supporting lone parents is &euro;1.3 billion per year. One in three children born last year was born to an unmarried mother. The rate of poverty is approximately 6% in the population generally but it is three and a <Col N="208"/>half times that among lone parents &mdash; the official figures put it at close to 30%. There is significant concentration of child poverty as a result of lone parenthood, which is why our earlier discussion on child poverty is so important. A quarter of all lone parents did not go beyond primary education.</P>
      <P>I would like to deal with one myth. Only 2% of lone parents are teenagers. While 2% is too many, there has been a misinterpretation of the profile of lone parenthood. Most lone parents are substantially older than their teenage years. Approximately 60% of lone parents do some work but it is very low paid work, chosen deliberately to keep them under the threshold of &euro;146, so their allowance is not interfered with.</P>
      <P>I am excited about the reforms I believe we can put together. My Department has its inspectors knocking on doors, a job they do not like to do and which, in the 21st century, I am not sure it makes sense to do. The inspectors want to know whether the child&rsquo;s father is living in the house and, if so, the allowance is taken away.</P>
      <P>The report which has been published recommends solutions, although they are not easy solutions. I look forward to a good discussion on the report. I hope we can have early legislation. If I can achieve some form of consensus in both Houses, we should move quickly on this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Mr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for making the telling and important point that only 2% of lone parents are teenagers. There has been an orchestrated campaign in this regard led by senior academics and journalists who know better &mdash; it is not that they should know better, they do know better. It has been led in many respects by an engineer. Engineers know a lot about a certain subject but a professor emeritus of engineering in one of our universities is not an authority on lone parents. Nor should one of the broadsheets, <i>The Irish Times</i>, be allowed to get away with publishing last year the vile article by a columnist attacking lone parents. It used derogatory terms to stigmatise a group of people and was full of inaccuracies. The author of the article knew and knows better.</P>
      <P>I am glad the Minister has reiterated this important statistic. We must be mindful in regard to the debate on lone parents that only 2% are in the teenage category. The other factors which result in lone parenthood are death, desertion, imprisonment of spouses and so on. It is not just one issue. I commend the Minister on raising this important statistic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>One of the most important statistics provided by the Minister was that 25% of lone parents did not progress beyond primary education. This brings into focus the need to keep students at school until they have completed the process, an issue which is related to the poverty <Col N="209"/>traps to which we referred. Initiatives are being taken in this regard but we need to keep an emphasis on the issue.</P>
      <P>Many girls who have had children have dedicated themselves to rearing their children and sacrificed careers and job opportunities to do so. It is not good enough that the fathers of those children in many instances get away without fulfilling their responsibilities. The Department attempts to recoup some of the costs from the fathers but every father of every child has a responsibility and should be held to that in law. It is not good enough that the taxpayers at large would rear a family for somebody who may well father children with a number of girls, as happens. I call for a greater clampdown in this area. Any legislation brought forward should reflect this perspective.</P>
    </Speaker>

	<P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 18, before section 28, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P LI="1">&ldquo;28.&mdash;The Minister shall, within 6 months of the commencement of this Act, prepare and lay before the Houses of the Oireachtas, a report on the work of the Maintenance Recovery Unit of his Department.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">This is the amendment which Senator Jim Walsh will support.</P>

	<P>He might second it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>That fathers should and would support their children is an important point. The Minister might provide figures outlining how many fathers support their children. There is a sense of irresponsibility among some men who father children and simply turn their backs on the mothers. It is a serious problem for many mothers and impacts on their children. The financial aspect is not the only important aspect. It is also a factor that the father is not involved in the life of the child and that the positive influence a father could have is lost.</P>
      <P>The amendment considers the issue of maintenance recovery. I raised this issue in the House last December and I again ask the Minister what efforts his Department will take to try to ensure that fathers make these payments. What success is the Department having in recovering some of the money owed? What percentage of mothers name the fathers of their children? It must create a difficulty if no father is listed on the birth certificate.</P>
      <P>This is an issue we need to take more seriously. We need to let men know that if they father a <Col N="210"/>child, that child is for life and they have a financial and social responsibility towards him or her. It is a matter of concern &mdash; this is more prevalent in built-up areas, particularly disadvantaged areas &mdash; that men father children with a number of different women. This creates a problem, which is probably a matter for the Department of Health and Children rather than the Department of Social and Family Affairs, whereby children will grow up not knowing they are half brother or half sister to a child living in the same block or on the same street. It is an issue which needs to be addressed. I am interested to hear the Minister&rsquo;s response.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Mr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the amendment. No mercy should be shown to those who are found to be in dereliction of their duty to their children. Unfortunately, one could not call such people fathers because that is not how a father would behave. However, there are cases where people do not accept the responsibility that goes with parenthood, do not want to assume their duties and take no responsibility for the rearing of their children.</P>
      <P>There is an increased burden on the State in terms of resources and the higher dependence on the Department given that both parents are not operating as a unit or that co-operation is not being provided by the former partner. It is essential that the full resources of the maintenance recovery unit are in place to ensure that such fathers are hauled over the coals and that they contribute any expense that has accrued to the Department due to their inability to fulfil their obligations, duties and responsibilities to their children. That money should be recouped. In the same way that no mercy should be shown to tax evasion, none should be shown in this area. The full resources of the Department should be deployed to the maintenance recovery unit to recoup costs from people who, because of their inability, lack of understanding and lack of contribution towards the rearing of their children, have placed an increased financial burden on the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>I will not repeat what I said but I fully support everything that has been said by Senators Terry and McCarthy. I wish to make an additional point, raised by Senator Terry, relating to the health issues arising from people being unable to trace their parentage. We should be stronger in ensuring that all birth certificates must contain the registration of the father&rsquo;s name as well as the mother&rsquo;s name. That should be given legislative backing. In cases where there is doubt &mdash; of which there are not too many &mdash; DNA and other testing can identify the true father. In the interests of society and of ensuring that a father fulfils all his responsibilities to a child and to the mother of the child, we should be stronger in our approach to this aspect.</P>
    </Speaker><Col N="211"/>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>This is an area that needs considerable attention and reform. The document on lone parenthood which we recently published deals with this issue because I wanted to make sure that the maintenance issue was included. The applicants for a one-parent family payment are required to make ongoing efforts to seek adequate maintenance from their former spouses or, in the case of unmarried applicants, the other parent of the child. They have to satisfy the Department that they have made reasonable attempts to obtain such maintenance.</P>
      <P>This issue of maintenance payments is first and foremost a private matter and the manner of many such payments are resolved through the courts. However, the purpose of the Department&rsquo;s maintenance recovery operation &mdash; we have a unit in this area &mdash; is to recover some or all of the moneys being expended on social welfare payments for lone parents. In every case where a one-parent family payment is awarded the maintenance recovery unit seeks to trace the other parent, referred to as the &ldquo;liable relative&rdquo; in order to ascertain whether he or she is in a financial position to contribute towards the cost of one-parent family payment. The follow-up activity takes place within two or three weeks. All liable relatives are then assessed with maintenance liabilities. They are notified by the Department and then issued with determination orders. The amount assessed can be reviewed when new information comes to light.</P>
      <P>The number of one-parent family payment recipients being paid by the Department at the end of last year was 83,000. Included in that figure is approximately 900 payments to widowed persons where maintenance is not an issue. In the period January 2003 to December 2005, the maintenance recovery unit examined 56,000 cases and issued determination orders to 8,017 liable relatives. At the end of January 2006, the latest date for which figures are available, 2,193 liable relatives were contributing directly to the Department. The Department&rsquo;s records indicate that approximately 9,600 one-parent family payment recipients are in receipt of maintenance from their spouse or other parent of their child and, as a result, receive a reduced rate of one-parent family payments.</P>
      <P>There are a large number of issues involved. Senator Terry requested some figures. She wanted to know how many fathers were contributing to the maintenance of their children. The best figure I can give her is 15% and I will give a brief outline of the background. Last year we examined 16,000 cases and in 12% of them we found no trace of the father. In 17% of cases we found that the father was on social welfare. In another 17% of cases the liable relative was either unknown or there was violence in the household or other unusual circumstances. We determined that no contribution was due from <Col N="212"/>39% of those who had jobs because of their being on low income and other circumstances. That figure seems to be very high but I am sure there is a good reason for it. Determination orders were made in 15% of cases. In other words, 15% of all the samples examined &mdash; I have no reason to believe that it is not the same across the board &mdash; are required to make payments.</P>
      <P>We must do far better than that. These moneys generally are not paid directly to the spouse but to the Department in order that we can reduce the one-parent family payment. This is an issue I have discussed with my officials. We are asking a young father to pay money to a Department of State when he should be paying it directly to the mother. I wonder if it is possible to make that link and whether the latter is the direction in which we should be moving. That would be difficult because currently the policy is that payment from the father is a way of reducing the State&rsquo;s liability to pay the one-parent family allowance. The money comes to the Department and that may be a reason the figure is very low. I am only speculating about that and not certain about it. However, we can do more here.</P>
      <P>There is another side to this matter that I wish to briefly mention. It is that fathers&rsquo; rights groups cannot be forgotten. These groups claim fathers have difficulty in gaining access to their children. We must also consider grandparents who often lose contact with their grandchildren. It is not good social policy to have a situation where in a large number of cases, fathers and grandparents do not have access to a child. We have to get a system here where every father who can pay something must do so.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P Just="Left">In the UK all fathers are required to pay a minimum of &pound;10 a week, regardless of their circumstances. I have not thought about this matter any further at this point. The Child Support Agency in the UK got into difficulty due to computer and other problems and I would not want to follow that route. I am not interested in the finances of this issue so much as the social policy aspect. If a couple are not together, we should try to make sure that maintenance is available in such a way that strengthens, rather than weakens, the link between the father and the child. Our current system is not good enough in terms of strengthening the social contact link between the child and the father. We need to do more in that area. We could discuss this perhaps when we come to deal with the report on lone parents.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his reply and the way in which he is considering this issue with reform in mind, with which I agree. The figure for fathers contributing to the maintenance of their children is very low. It is not good enough that of the number of cases examined, only 15% of fathers are contributing. I would like to see an improvement in that figure and for fathers to <Col N="213"/>become more involved with their children. This issue is not only about money. While the Department of Social and Family Affairs must ensure the funds and benefits are well spent and that those who should pay are doing so, we also need to consider the wider social issues. In the context of the debate on the new report on lone parents we might be able to touch on this relevant issue.</P>
     <?oasys _dc14- ?><P>When we talk about lone parents we only tend to think of mothers. While we know there are lone parents who are fathers and who are rearing children, we must take account of the lone parent who is not living with the child and the responsibilities placed on that individual. We must recognise these social and financial responsibilities and tackle the social aspect of all benefits because, as I argued earlier, we must get away from the hand-out mentality. We must bring about change and create a better society. I look forward to the debate on the proposal for lone parents.</P>

    <P>Amendment No. 9 not moved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 10:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 20, before section 32, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P LI="2">&ldquo;The Minister shall, within 3 months of the commencement of this Act, lay before the Houses of the Oireachtas, a report on the support provided by the Back to Education Allowance.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">This matter was also debated in the D&aacute;il. In light of the recent court case, what does the Department of Social and Family Affairs intend to do to address the outcome of this case? I sympathise to some extent with the Minister&rsquo;s argument in the D&aacute;il that the back to education allowance is an excellent allowance which helps more people to get back into education. I am not sure whether people should continue to receive this allowance during the summer months. Will recipients automatically receive unemployment benefit or another benefit during these months? What is the financial difference between these benefits? I tabled this amendment to find out how the Minister intends to deal with the outcome of this court case and the impact it will have on other people receiving the back to education allowance. Once a decision is made, it cannot simply affect the person to whom the case pertains. It must also be made for other people receiving the allowance.</P>
      <P>We must support people who are returning to education and who find themselves without support for a short period of time when they are not attending college. Will these people receive the same financial benefit from unemployment benefit, particularly during the summer, that they would receive from the back to education allowance? Like all students, these people must go out to work during the summer. I recognise that we must support adults returning to education who have family and financial responsibilities. The question remains as to what is the best way to support them. We cannot ignore the decision of the courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>We are still examining the implications of the court case and are receiving advice on it from the Office of the Attorney General. I recall that 173 people signed up for that case. A determination has been made in the case of one of these people. In that instance, the Department lost the case and is, therefore, required to make repayment to the individual in question. I understand the court found that the Department is required to make repayment for the summer of 2003 because that particular student had a particular expectation.</P>
      <P>I stated yesterday in the House that, pending advice from the Attorney General, I would not be inclined to appeal such a judgment. Obviously, I must wait for the advice of the Attorney <Col N="215"/>General in the event that there are broader implications. Approximately 5,500 people were receiving the back to education allowance in 2003 and Senator Terry&rsquo;s colleagues in the D&aacute;il suggested that these people were entitled to something. However, I must be very sure-footed about the legal issues at play here because schemes end and conditions change. I would be very fearful of opening up a situation whereby when a scheme is ended, everybody who did not get to the gate in time, for whatever reason, had expectations they could show were legitimate. Such a scenario would be an additional burden on the State. I wish to be circumspect about the legal issues.</P>
      <P>Senator Terry&rsquo;s colleagues asked me to revisit the issue itself. The issue is whether the back to education allowance, which is approximately the same rate as unemployment assistance, should be paid for the summer months. The practice of paying the allowance during the summer ceased in 2003. I do not have any immediate intention of restoring it but, like all such matters, I like to keep an open mind and discern what is practical and necessary. It is the old question of whether once I have this money, I pay it to students in the summer or use it to improve the carer&rsquo;s allowance or pensions or alleviate child poverty. I suppose some students could claim that they study during the summer and, therefore, need the allowance. There are six people in my family and I never witnessed any of them study in the summer. Possibly other households have different experiences and certain people can make a case that they study during the summer. However, there is no reason they cannot obtain employment. If they cannot obtain employment, they are entitled to claim unemployment assistance. I suppose the point was that when they received the back to education allowance, which was supposed to maintain them while they were studying, they could work and receive the allowance at the same time during the summer. I do not know how they could work if they were also studying.</P>
      <P>We must be careful because we cannot throw money around too lightly. I will keep an open mind on the matter, although I do not have an immediate intention of restoring it for the summer months because people receiving the allowance can claim unemployment assistance in the summer if they cannot obtain work. The majority of people who claim the back to education allowance are fairly successful in obtaining employment.</P>
      <P>We should remember that virtually all of the 150,000 people who came to Ireland last year from the ten new EU member states obtained employment. The only exceptions were approximately 100 people who received unemployment assistance or satisfied the habitual residency rule. This is the kind of economy we live in. Therefore, the idea of paying the back to education allow<Col N="216"/>ance in August must be examined very carefully. I will keep an open mind on the matter but I do not intend at this point in time to restore the payment of the allowance during the summer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 11:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 20, before section 32, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P LI="2">&ldquo;The Minister shall, within 3 months of the commencement of this Act, lay before the Houses of the Oireachtas, a report on the position of jobseekers.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">To facilitate the House, I ask the Minister to give his response on the position of jobseekers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The term &ldquo;jobseekers&rdquo; is part of the new names we are applying to unemployment assistance or unemployment benefit. The names have been changed to take a more modern approach and to align them with what is happening in Northern Ireland, where the word &ldquo;unemployment&rdquo; is no longer in use and has been replaced by the term &ldquo;jobseekers&rdquo;. Some people might consider it a bit gimmicky, which is not the case. It is meant to describe what the person&rsquo;s job is, which is to be seeking work. We made the changes following consultation with the Irish National Organisation of the Unemployed.</P>
      <P>A number of measures have been introduced under the social welfare schemes to make them more employment-friendly. We are spending more than &euro;1 billion a year on more than 30 schemes designed to get people back to work. There are different training schemes, education schemes, CE type schemes, all of which add up to a significant amount of money. There is the one-parent family payment, and the disregards, so that people can get back to work. The upper limit is &euro;293, which will increase to &euro;375. There is a 40% disregard of net earnings from part-time work for unemployment assistance. There is a tapering in the rent and mortgage interest supplement and other secondary benefits. That tapering allows people to hold on to their rental and mortgage interest supplements while they go back to work. We allowed tapering in withdrawing the adult and child dependant allowance as the spouse or partner&rsquo;s earnings from employment increases.</P>
      <P>This is the clutch and accelerator effect to which I referred earlier. We have allowed this throughout the system to enable people to get back to work. There are facilitators who used to be known as jobs facilitators. They engage with people and help them to get training, employment and education. They ensure people know their entitlements. They help them to seek out job opportunities and so on. These facilitators do a first-class job.</P><Col N="217"/>
      <P Just="Left">Over the years, many thousands of people were sent to F&Aacute;S. A survey was carried out in September 2002 among 1,000 randomly-selected former back-to-work participants who had completed a certain programme between 1997 and 1999. It found that 88% of the people were no longer in receipt of social welfare payment, 79% did not return to social welfare payment at any stage, 10% were in receipt of short-term payments and just 1% were in receipt of a long-term unemployment payment.</P>
      <P Just="Left">It is clear from this that the activation programme and the activation reforms being introduced are designed to help people move from welfare to work. Helping to move people from welfare to work through myriad schemes, taperings and phasings is at the heart of welfare policy so that the slope is a gentle one rather than a cliff in trying to move from welfare to work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his response. I agree with the changes in title because they better reflect our modern way of thinking. It is good to see so many people back in the workplace, many of them for the first time, or even for the first time in generations. The initiatives facilitate people in getting back into the workplace. It is something which should be commended and kept under review to ensure it continues to work.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 12:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 25, before section 41, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P LI="1">&ldquo;41.&mdash;The Principal Act is amended in section 27 by the insertion of the following new definition:</P>
      <P LI="2">&lsquo;<?oasys _is0p2- ?>&ldquo;pension coverage&rdquo; means the number of people who are covered by pension plans;&rsquo;.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">As I said on Second Stage, the amendments to pensions are minor as far as I understand them. I am not sure how they will help to improve the pension payments of the thousands of people who have occupational pension schemes and I am disappointed that more is not being done in this regard.</P>
      <P>I am also disappointed that the Pensions Board is not doing more to improve the lot of those who have pension schemes. I acknowledge the enormous report from the Pensions Board, which will be debated in this House in the near future, and <Col N="218"/>I look forward to becoming involved with the Minister in discussions that may take place. I understand he will organise a forum shortly to which the members of the committee on family and social affairs will be invited, which I welcome. He recently met representatives of the pensions industry.</P>
      <P>Much more must be done to help pensioners and those who are paying into pension schemes. The debate very unbalanced because it is about the pensions of the future. While it is essential to plan for the future pension provisions of workers, we are abdicating our responsibility to current pensioners and those who are still at work and paying into pension funds.</P>
      <P>The Minister is trying to encourage young people like Senator McCarthy, and even younger people, to start providing for their pension. I am sure the Senator is not thinking about his pension, not to mention people younger than him. I would not encourage my sons, or anyone of that age, to start thinking about their pension. They have too many more important and pressing issues to deal with such as buying their first home or a car, and doing the things young people must do. After that, if they get married or become parents, there are other responsibilities with which they must deal.</P>
      <P>It is wrong to focus on telling young people to prepare for their old age, and that by paying into a pension fund now they will have a decent pension when they retire. I do not know if this is true. I can only base my assumptions on the people who are at work today and who are coming up to pension age. Many people who are now retired and who paid into pension funds did what was suggested. Many were compelled to join pension schemes. One could not join many companies without being a member of their pension scheme. This was a type of mandatory pension scheme, which did not work. I would like to see a more balanced debate in favour of the pensioners of today and those who are approaching pension age. This Bill does nothing to address that issue.</P>
      <P>The other day I mentioned providing some type of protection fund for pensioners, although it may not be working well in the UK. I understand the point the Minister made that people could become less responsible with funds because a protection scheme would be in place. If we imposed strong penalties on those who must access that protection fund, we will make people responsible. There are probably other areas in which we impose penalties on companies if they do not live up to certain standards. That issue must be considered. I agree we must provide for pensions for the future but we must be realistic and honest about it. We must, however, deal with people today which is, as the Minister knows, my problem.</P>
      <P>There are many things we could do but I welcome the improvements made in the budget. The <Col N="219"/>Minister for Finance took measures to ensure the wealthy in our country will no longer be able to put millions of euro into their pension funds and get tax relief. We heard of an individual who took &euro;25 million tax-free from his or her pension, and he or she was not the only one to do so.</P>
      <P>I wish to make an important point to the Minister. I said to his officials on one occasion that I could not get answers to questions. When interested parties from the pensions area appeared before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs, a question which was not answered was concerned the most an individual took from his or her pension fund as a tax-free lump sum. Nobody from the Department of Social and Family Affairs, the Department of Finance, the Pensions Board or the pensions industry could answer that question. That is not good enough. The answer was provided in the Indecon report, namely, that at least two individuals took out a tax-free lump sums of &euro;25 million from their pension funds. How did Indecon find the answer when officials from those Departments could not? It is not good enough that Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas cannot get that information. Perhaps there are reasons for not providing that type of information. It was shocking when that information hit the headlines. How can we enact legislation if we are not aware of all the facts and of the abuses by certain people? If we do not enact legislation to ensure these abuses do not take place, then we are not doing the work we were elected to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>Much good work was done in the pensions area, particularly under the stewardship of Charlie McCreevy when he was Minister for Finance. He opened it up and we must continue to progress that. Apparently, almost half the working population is without an occupational pension. While the Government has had the foresight to invest in the National Pensions Reserve Fund, which will be built up over the years, effectively, it will meet only social welfare and perhaps public sector pensions. There is a need for people in employment to be able to avail of an occupational pension in addition to the social welfare one. Often, the systems are integrated.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately during the 1990s many blue chip companies and employers moved away from the defined benefit schemes to defined contribution schemes. That was done because of black holes appearing in pension funds as a result of the downturn in the stock market. There has been a recovery and the stock market has been doing well, particularly in recent years. As they have moved away from such schemes, there is a need for the State to play a part in ensuring occupational pension funds are in place and are properly regulated. Normally, I would resist placing further impositions on employers because there <Col N="220"/>are too many impositions and regulations and perhaps too much employment taxation by way of PRSI, etc., on them from which they do not derive a great deal of benefit. Competitiveness is also a huge issue.</P>
      <P>We should be much more proactive in the area of occupational pensions. Any employer of significance should ensure staff, who may have given a lifetime of service, have a modest or a reasonable occupational pension. There should be some mechanism whereby the employer and employee contributes to such a pension. In the case of good defined benefit schemes, the employer was probably paying in anything from 10% to 14% and the employee anything from 5% to 6%. There was a ratio of 2:1. This should be considered in order to regulate the system in some way.</P>
      <P>There is also a need to look at other aspects of this from a regulation point of view. Investments and the managers of those investments &mdash; often stockbrokers, pension funds, insurance companies, etc. &mdash; need to be regulated to ensure the benefit accrues to the investor who may not be <i>au fait </i>with the process. Often the fees applied are astronomical and should be curtailed.</P>
      <P>While some relief has been given to people with private pension funds so they do not need to subsequently invest in annuities, there is a need to look at a system where anybody in any type of occupational pension scheme is not obliged to fall into the annuity scheme. Annuities provide mega profits for insurance companies. I have heard figures whereby of the amount invested, the annual payment runs at 3% to 4% which means the individual must live for at least 30 years to get back his or her capital sum even though the insurance company has this fund available to it throughout the period. This is a technical area which needs to be examined.</P>
      <P>People starting work now will seek to qualify for pensions in 2050 and by then, the demographics will have changed. We need to plan now for those changes. There is a need for regulation given the direction in which many employers have gone in regard to occupational pensions in the past decade.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan"><NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>I know of Senator Terry&rsquo;s deep interest in the pensions area. She has made a fine contribution to the House in this area, certainly in my time here. The Pensions Board report which was published recently has been laid before the House but I do not know if we have debated it. If not, I would be in favour of doing so and I will ask the Leader if we can find time for that. I have made the same request in the other House. I hope we can go through all the issues then.</P>
      <P Just="Left">The forum on pensions which I have called comprising interested parties and stakeholders will be on 5 May and I will invite members of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Social and Family <Col N="221"/>Affairs and Members of both Houses who are interested in the subject to attend. I will ensure the Members who spoke on the subject today are invited. It is a considerable area on which I had better not start with ten seconds to go. I could go on for half an hour on pensions.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatMoylan"><NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
	<P>As it is now 1.30 p.m. I am obliged to put the following question in accordance with an order of the Seanad of this day: &ldquo;That amendment No. 12 is negatived, that each of the sections and Schedules undisposed of is hereby agreed to, that the Title is hereby agreed, that the Bill is reported to the House without amendment, that Report Stage is hereby completed, that the Bill is hereby passed and that the motion regarding the earlier signature of the Bill by the President is hereby agreed to.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Seanad for a very fine debate. I have said many times since I took on this job that listening to public representatives on this subject is what it is all about. Members in their daily lives, between clinics and meeting so many groups constantly around the clock, know what is going on. They know how an amendment, change or allowance will affect the family. I appreciate that, which is why I have always made a point never to miss a minute in listening to the D&aacute;il or Seanad on these issues. The contributions of Members come from real life experiences.</P>
      <P>I can marry that with whatever good professional advice is available to me from the first-class staff in the Department. It comprises more than 5,000 people spread throughout the country who do great work day in day out. They take a positive attitude in helping people. A combination of what I get from public representatives, professional staff and good solid research allows us to keep this reform agenda going, while keeping up the day to day income of people who depend on it as a lifeline.</P>
      <P>This Bill is one of the most complicated and lengthiest pieces of welfare legislation that has appeared before the Oireachtas in many years. Once the President signs it, gone is the title &ldquo;old age pension&rdquo; forever while a range of other reforms will be introduced. Senators have done a fine job in their contributions to the legislation and in trying to get it passed early for submission to the President for signature. I appreciate that as it will enable us enact the results of what has been very solid of work. It will help people who need support and make some essential reforms. I am grateful to the Cathaoirleach and the Members of <Col N="222"/>the Seanad for their work on the Bill, and to all of the staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SheilaTerry"><NameTxt>Ms Terry</NameTxt>
	<P>I also thank the Minister for giving us of his time. Anytime we have had a Social Welfare Bill before the House the Minister has given his full time to the debate. He has never left the House and I want to thank him for his interest, and for the work he has put into the Department since he came into it. He has brought a breath of fresh air to the Department and I recognise his attitude to his work in terms of wanting to bring about reform, which is very necessary. The manner he is going about it will have lasting impact.</P>
      <P>I also recognise the work of officials in the Department who have had an enormous job to do in terms of putting the legislation together. It is no mean job to deal with all the amendments in both Houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcCarthy"><NameTxt>Mr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I, too, want to thank the Minister for the time he has given, and the officials for the amount of work they have put into the legislation. It is very good that we are changing the name of some of the schemes. We will look back in time and wonder how long we could have gotten away with calling the &ldquo;old age pension&rdquo; just that, because it is ageist, to say the least. Politically correct terms such as &ldquo;illness&rdquo;, &ldquo;allowance&rdquo; and &ldquo;State pensions&rdquo; are welcome developments.</P>
      <P>I deeply appreciate the Minister has put on record the fact that 2% of lone parents are in the teenage category. That banishes a myth and takes the wind out of the campaign of some leading academics and journalists who have a crusade against some of the most vulnerable people to come under the auspices of the Minister&rsquo;s Department.</P>
      <P>I should like to see a simplification of the language that is being used. Much of the language in the Bill is there for parliamentary purposes and a select number of people will have an interest in that type of communication. When it comes to ordinary customer service, however, there must be simplification, and not just in the explanatory memorandums and booklets attached to various schemes. It is important that people should be able to read user-friendly booklets in language that is easy to understand, to ensure optimal communication between the customer and the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh"><NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
	<P>As someone who is not always present at these debates as frequently as the other speakers, the cross-party support for the Minister in his initiatives is a fine endorsement of the work that he is doing in the Department. He has shown a great feel and sensitivity for the whole area. It is an ideal republican philosophy towards people who are under-privileged and who need assistance. That very much reflects my life-long opinion as to what true republicanism is about. I <Col N="223"/>wish the Minister well and I am sure we will have a fine debate on the pension report when it comes before the House.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 11, line 27, after &ldquo;fish&rdquo; to insert the following:</P>
      <P LI="2">&ldquo;, but for the avoidance of doubt does not include a seafishing boat&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">I welcome the Minister and his official back to the House. It was timely and fortunate that I had the pleasure of meeting members of the fishing fraternity &mdash; the drift net and draft net fishermen &mdash; outside the gates following yesterday&rsquo;s Committee Stage debate. I am not sure the Minister met the group but I am sure Senator Kenneally went outside to meet a few of his constituents. The fishermen who protested outside the House yesterday were drawn from communities around the coast, from the southernmost part of County Cork up to Gola, Tory and Inch islands in County Donegal.</P>
      <P>The fishermen I spoke to were aware that the legislation had been before the Seanad yesterday. They appealed for more common sense to prevail in the Government&rsquo;s approach to the fishing industry and welcomed the Minister&rsquo;s statement in the House that he intended, once the legislation was enacted, to broaden the debate on the marine industry and touch base with fishing organisations on how to move it forward. While exhaustive consultation is sometimes an evil, it is clearly vital in the case of the fishing industry if we are to determine how the sector is to be advanced.</P>
      <P>The amendment seeks to avoid ambiguity by stipulating definitively that seafishing boats are not covered by the definition of the word &ldquo;equipment&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Mr. B. Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>As I explained on Committee Stage yesterday, the amendment is unnecessary because the term &ldquo;se<Col N="224"/>afishing boat&rdquo; is separately defined in section 6 and is frequently used in the text. Having double-checked I am assured there is no question that references to &ldquo;equipment&rdquo; or &ldquo;fishing gear&rdquo; could be held to include a &ldquo;seafishing boat&rdquo;. The Senator will be aware that the powers available to confiscate fishing vessels will be removed when this legislation is enacted. For these reasons, the amendment is not necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment put and declared lost.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeMcHugh"><NameTxt>Mr. McHugh</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 15, between lines 25 and 26, to insert the following:</P>
      <P LI="1">&ldquo;(8) The master of an Irish sea-fishing boat may depart from the terms of any notice under <i>subsection (7)</i> where exceptional circumstances (such as <i>force majeure</i>, the safety of the crew or the safety of the vessel) so require.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">During our general discussion on a similar amendment on Committee Stage, I digressed a little to raise the grant aid available for health and safety features on vessels. The Minister responded positively, indicating that he would endeavour to expedite the matter as much as possible.</P>
      <P>On the issue of <i>force majeure</i>, the definitions and legislation governing the fishing sector have created some grey areas. While it is important that the master of a ship informs enforcement officers of the quantity of catch and the port at which it will be landed, provision must be made to take account of changing circumstances, for example, the necessity to change destination in inclement weather conditions. <i>Force majeure</i> must apply when vessels are forced to deviate from their intended course. The concept of <i>force majeure</i> is widely used in the Department of Agriculture and Food. This was particularly true of the allocation of single farm payments in 2002 and 2003 when stocks were at low levels.</P>
      <P>The Fine Gael Party favours strict legislation but seeks a level playing pitch for all players in the fishing industry. While it does not support special dispensations for those who break the rules, exceptional circumstances will sometimes force vessels to deviate from their specified routes. I ask the Minister to reconsider this matter, despite his refusal to do so on Committee Stage.</P>

	<P>When we discussed this matter on Committee Stage, I noted that the amendments proposed then could provide for a way around the legislation, although I accept Senator McHugh&rsquo;s bona fides when he denies any such intention. We are trying to tighten up the legislation as best we can and the Minister has indi<Col N="225"/>cated that provision for this matter was made elsewhere in the Bill. I fear that an amendment such as the one proposed by Senator McHugh will not be used by some for the purpose intended but will be exploited for different ends. For that reason, it is preferable not to include it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I did not quote the section concerned in my response to Senator McHugh when he raised this issue yesterday, although doing so may have been helpful. The proposed amendment would have the unintended effect of providing loopholes to people who want to exploit the law. A case recently brought before the courts and which is currently <i>sub judice</i> concerned an attempt to take advantage of a practice put in place to facilitate fishermen when their boats are detained in order to evade charges. I am afraid that some people in the industry have used every available loophole and have run to courts at every opportunity. The Senator&rsquo;s amendment would provide further opportunities for exploitation.</P>
      <P>I accept the Senator&rsquo;s bona fides as regards his amendment but it would go further than necessary because section 36 of the Bill already provides for a defence which anyone may use. The section states:</P>
      <P LI="1">Where an offence under a relevant provision has been committed by any person on board a sea-fishing boat, and where the master or owner of the boat is charged with having committed the offence, it is a defence for him or her to show that&mdash;</P>
      <P LI="2">(<i>a</i>) he or she used due diligence to prevent the commission of the acts alleged to constitute the offence and they were done without his or her consent, connivance or default, or</P>
      <P LI="2">(<i>b</i>) the acts were necessary to secure the safety of the boat or any other vessel or person in peril on the sea.</P>
      <P FLI="0">The Senator is trying to incorporate that in his amendment but it is already provided for in the Bill. Including it in a different format will only cause confusion, could create a loophole and would probably allow some lawyers to become rich by arguing that section 12 is in conflict with section 36. On that basis, I am not prepared to accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeMcHugh"><NameTxt>Mr. McHugh</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand the need to legislate for all ills. Recently, a councillor from the south suffered a wrathful response for asking that a special dispensation be granted to an old man who drove his tractor to the pub for two pints. There has to be a level playing field because legislation cannot be passed to allow some people to drink two pints, while prohibiting others from doing the same.</P>
      <P>We are at a crucial stage in terms of the future of the fishing industry. Some within the industry <Col N="226"/>have flouted the law but they are a small minority. As a result of their wrongdoing, the fishermen who operate within the law are being punished.</P>
      <P>Concerns arise with regard to the watchdog system. Calls have been made by garda&iacute; for a right of independent appeal with regard to decisions made by the Ombudsman. I hope we can devise mechanisms so that law-abiding fishermen do not suffer at the hands of an overly-zealous enforcement system. The Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources needs such a watchdog mechanism and, while the Minister is ultimately responsible, he does not have eyes in the back of his head. I hope he can devise mechanisms to protect the fishermen who work within the confines of the law, as well as enforcement officers.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 31, lines 43 and 44, to delete &ldquo;2 months&rsquo; and substitute &ldquo;1 month&rsquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">We discussed the length of prison sentences on Committee Stage. We propose to reduce the sentence from two months to one month. Our concern is that there may be instances of fishermen who make mathematical errors or mistakes when filling in log books, thus stepping outside the legal framework. Although we do not condone such actions, we do not want to turn fishermen into criminals.</P>
      <P>There have been cases where fishermen have flouted the law but others do not consciously do so. It is not the same as a person who drives at 60 mph in a 30 mph zone and who knows he or she is speeding. For one reason or another, there will be instances where log books are not properly completed. We do not want to criminalise fishermen. A fisherman told me quite recently that the industry is under pressure and we are looking at a scenario where the fishing industry may go in the same direction as the farming industry. Many coastal fishermen, from the west of Ireland and Donegal in particular, have a tradition of emigrating to places such as the United States, and a criminal record will certainly not increase their chances of being let in. This was a specific example I was given. If laws are broken deliberately, the perpetrators must be punished. I am trying to replace the proposed two-month prison sentence with a one-month sentence, and to replace the &euro;5,000 maximum fine with a maximum of &euro;3,000.</P>

    </Speaker><Col N="227"/>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>We had a similar discussion yesterday and I explained at that stage that the maximum possible period of two months imprisonment provided for in section 24(1) matches the maximum possible fine of &euro;5,000 which a court can impose for an offence of obstructing a sea fisheries protection officer in carrying out his or her function, as opposed to log book offences.</P>
      <P>With respect to the point being made, one cannot obstruct a sea fisheries protection officer without knowing it. A person cannot inadvertently knock the officer overboard, prevent him or her from getting on board or lock oneself in a cabin to prevent an officer from seeing if a log book is completed. Such actions cannot be carried out unknowingly. In any circumstances, obstruction of a sea fisheries protection officer is the same as obstruction of a garda or any official of the State who has a job to do. It is a serious matter which should be deterred through substantial penalties and the liability to be arrested as provided for in section 24.</P>
      <P>The provisions for two months imprisonment and &euro;5,000 fine are the maximum penalties. Neither the sea fisheries officer, the Minister nor a civil servant will decide whether a person will receive the maximum penalties, as the courts will decide this, judging all the circumstances in the case. The courts can impose these as a maximum.</P>
      <P>Section 25 deals with the maximum fine which a court can impose on summary conviction of a person for an offence. The courts have the right to decide the actual limit of the fine. If the offence is minor or inadvertent, the courts take this into account and can impose a fine of &euro;100, &euro;20 or &euro;5, for example. The courts must have the freedom to impose conviction in any particular case by reference to the gravity of the offence in question and the particular circumstances in which it was committed.</P>
      <P>Section 25 also prohibits and penalises assault on a sea fisheries protection officer. If the assault is serious, conviction and indictment would arise entailing a fine and/or imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years. This is correct because if we ask people to do jobs such as this which can sometimes be difficult and dangerous, protection must be provided through legislation. These people can then know they will be protected. Thankfully there have not been many incidents in the sea fisheries area where people have been assaulted. Not long ago there was a serious incident in the inland fisheries area where a life was lost. We must protect the people we are sending out to do these jobs.</P>
      <P>A point has been made on a number of occasions regarding log books. It has been intimated that it is a minor detail if a person is discovered by sea fisheries protection officers not to have the log book filled in or the wrong figure or area put in. The industry has tried to portray this as mere omission, that it is not important and that <Col N="228"/>people are getting tied up in bureaucracy, etc. I dismiss this type of argument. The log book is a fundamental part of the sea fisheries control and the conservation and protection measures, along with efforts made to ensure that everybody fishes within the limits set. It is part of a system to ensure that people are not overfishing or taking fish from fellow fishermen.</P>
      <P Just="Left">I accept that some mistakes are made, and people can argue their case. The notion that forgetting to fill in the log book or pages going missing, which occurs frequently, is a minor matter is akin to saying that people forgetting to fill in a tax return or completing it fraudulently is also minor. We should not pass any heed on that idea. The Senator mentioned farming, an area in which there have been many complaints. I have seen forms where people looking for headage payments, for example, made very simple mistakes on the form and lost thousands of euro, or perhaps their entire income, for a year or two years because the form was not filled out completely. The EU is not singling out the sea fisheries industry on this matter, which should be noted.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to minimise the issue. The idea has been mooted on a number of occasions and I did not get the opportunity to address it before. It is not a minor matter, as the log book is a specific EU Common Fisheries Policy requirement for all member states and everybody working in the industry. It is a basic tool to ensure the Common Fisheries Policy is being implemented. It is a serious matter for it to be interfered with or ignored, excepting the fact that people sometimes can make mistakes. In many circumstances purported mistakes are clear attempts to circumvent fishery control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeMcHugh"><NameTxt>Mr. McHugh</NameTxt>
	<P>I am singing from the same hymn sheet as the Minister in terms of obeying the law. The introduction of sanctions to make people adhere to the law will protect the overall industry. I wish to raise two issues, the first being due process. There is a fear that due process will not occur in many cases. What will due process be in terms of identification of a ship that is working outside the realms of quotas or tonnage, for example? What is due process in terms of malpractice, and how will such ships and their captains be identified?</P>
      <P>A few weeks ago there was an intensive intelligence operation in County Louth. The PSNI and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na worked for months on a particular case, and they did not come on site until months of investigation and due process were complete. Is this similar to what will occur within the fishing industry? It is easy to identify a boat at sea, and there are sufficient surveillance measures to do this. Will enforcement officers board a boat on suspicion of illegal activities? I am considering the rights of fishermen who work within the law, and I call for the protection of <Col N="229"/>these fishermen carrying out their business in a proper fashion.</P>
      <P>My second concern relates to the air of suspicion hanging over fishermen. What mechanisms are in place to protect the rights of fishermen who work within the law? We must work more on them. The Minister said there would be an exhaustive consultative process but I am trying to anticipate problems that will arise in the future and of which we should take note. These involve the protection of fishermen&rsquo;s rights and could take us into a whole new legal realm. The garda&iacute; cannot enter a premises, a building or a farmyard without a search warrant so I fear the future legal implications of this provision.</P>

      <P FLI="0">I will try not to deviate from the point but I am trying to provide as much information as I can in anticipation of the debate that will take place in the future.

	<P>I cannot accept the amendment because it could call into question the automatic forfeiture by the court of fishing gear under section 28(6)(<i>b</i>) on summary conviction for a second or subsequent offence. Only a court can convict for an offence, taking into account the circumstances of the case. Apart from the protections any fisherman has as a citizen of the State, if the Bill is enacted and a fisherman has reason to believe he is being unduly hounded or the victim of malpractice on the part of sea fisheries officers who board his boat or otherwise harassed he not only has the option of the courts but that of the Ombudsman. Appropriate appeal systems will be available to deal with such cases. The Senator will see that section 49 of the Bill provides for specific complaints procedures allowing people to pursue such matters. The Senator&rsquo;s point is dealt with in the Bill as it stands.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P LI="1">In page 38, line 3, after &ldquo;appealable&rdquo; to insert the following: &ldquo;save for an appeal to the High Court on a point of law&rdquo;.</P>
      <P FLI="0">This amendment was also discussed on Committee Stage. I refer again to the rights of the majority of fishermen who go about their daily business without breaking the law and who invest substantially in their fleets. Those fishermen have been facilitated by the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources with substantial grant aid and work long, hard hours to make repayments on substantial mortgages on their boats.</P>
      <P>The debate has gone pear-shaped against a backdrop of extreme frustration in the fishing industry over the belief that it has become an industry of contradictions. On one hand substantial European grant money and national Exchequer funds have been invested in the fleet, in addition to fishermen&rsquo;s own investments. On the other hand quotas have been introduced and days at sea have been reduced, as has fishing effort. Some measures were necessary on grounds of sustainability but competing with other European countries for a level playing field in terms of days at sea and fishing effort causes frustration. There is not a level playing field where the rights of Irish fishermen are concerned.</P>
      <P>Our coastline is a national resource which is both a heritage and an industry and fishermen are left frustrated with this legislation over the fact that investment handouts are being made but quotas reduced and tonnage taken away. In addition to that a small minority of fishermen have been breaking the law, as acknowledged by the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, and the vast majority of fishermen will suffer as a consequence. The Department is between a rock and a hard place because it must legislate against criminality.</P>
      <P>I am calling for mechanisms to protect law-abiding fishermen, as I have consistently done throughout the debate. This amendment proposes the right of appeal to the High Court. The Minister said on Committee Stage that it was provided for in another section but any measure that offers protection for law-abiding fishermen should be adopted. Senator Kenneally, on first reading the amendments we tabled on Committee Stage, accused us of trying to bend the rules and looking for loopholes but that is not the case. As legislators, we are all between a rock and a hard place. Fianna F&aacute;il backbenchers and we on this side all have problems with the legislation, even though it is an important Bill. We have all agonised over it, as it seems they have for some time in the Department. The Attorney General has even been involved. The Bill is not straightforward or easy. Neither is the matter as simple as my making outlandish statements about pro<Col N="231"/>tecting innocent people at all costs, only to fail to introduce measures. They must be introduced but there must be balance and common sense.</P>
      <P>The Minister&rsquo;s proposal yesterday was the light at the end of the tunnel, that is, to engage in a healthy ongoing consultation process with the fishermen&rsquo;s organisations. This matter does not relate only to sea fishermen. There is a plethora of issues with respect to fishing, such as angling tourists and drift-net fishermen who have specific interests, aquaculture and salmon fishermen. The only way forward is to roll out an exhaustive consultation process with the key people in the fishing industry. Everyone in the industry has an interest in it, whether it is someone with a B&amp;B who looks out on Mulroy Bay and sees a salmon cage or someone else. The industry has a future and it is our responsibility as legislators to represent its members who wish to continue therein.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Ms Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>I second the amendment. It is unusual that the section allows for the prosecutor to appeal the dismissal of proceedings. I do not know whether this provision is in other legislation but I have not seen it previously. However, I am sure that I have seen similar wording to &ldquo;an appeal to the High Court on a point of law&rdquo; in other legislation brought to the House by the Government. Why can these words not be inserted in this Bill? The Minister says that what the amendment intends to provide for is the case anyway but stating that something is not appealable is definitive. If that is the position, why not spell it out?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>Many provisions available to people are not put into all legislation passed by the House. Once a right is given, we do not keep rewriting it, as we would be left with unmanageable chunks of legislation. The amendment is unnecessary. Under current legislation, a Circuit Court judge is free to refer a point of law to the High Court by way of a case stated. If such a referral is not made, the decision of the Circuit Court judge is final in respect of the facts and any appeal, whether it is against a conviction or dismissal. However, any aggrieved party could seek a judicial review of a Circuit Court decision by the High Court on legal grounds. There is no need to specify this in legislation as it is an existing right. For this reason, I will not include the provisions of the amendment in the Bill.</P>
      <P>I acknowledge Senator McHugh&rsquo;s comments on the significant investment in the fishing industry by the State and fishermen. Considerable efforts have been made in different areas to try to ensure we have a modern fishing fleet with the necessary equipment, an aim the Government has strongly supported. The difficulty is that perhaps the EU did not commence its fishery protection measures in time. Now that everything has <Col N="232"/>become so efficient from a fishing point of view, scientific advice indicates that we are in serious danger of depleting our stocks below conservation levels across a range of species. We can ignore that advice and decide not to do anything about the matter, but all of the investment will be useless in four or five years time and probably less in respect of some species. The alternative would be to lower the quotas, which would cause a problem for the fishermen in the short term, have more stringent fishery protections and hope that we can conserve stocks for a longer period of time.</P>
      <P>The message must get through to the cowboys in the industry that they cannot hope to get away with depleting stocks and exceeding conservation limits willy-nilly. I agree with Senator McHugh that we must stamp out those activities. The industry and fishermen&rsquo;s organisations must take the lead, as they cannot be led by the nose by people they know in their heart of hearts are abusing that position and causing problems for genuine fishermen. If they do not stand up against such people, there will be no future for anyone in the industry.</P>
      <P>I look forward to meeting with the fishermen&rsquo;s organisations to talk about the future and how we might ensure that people abide by the law, quotas are respected and people are helped to survive and make decent livings. It will not be easy to do so unless everyone agrees on a shared vision for the future and puts this matter to the forefront of the debate, particularly over the next four or five years. According to the scientific evidence I have seen, we are speaking about a window of four or five years in which to try to salvage an industry in the long term.</P>
      <P>This legislation is required to ensure that the Irish or foreign people &mdash; I accept the points made by Senators on this matter &mdash; who do not share this vision and want to abuse their positions because they may have more efficient equipment or better methods of fishing are not allowed to do so to the disadvantage of everyone else. The sooner we sit down to develop a shared vision, the better. It will require leadership, not just mine or that of my Department but also that of the fishermen&rsquo;s organisations and fishermen themselves. I hope that leadership will be forthcoming.</P>

      <P>A long time seems to have passed since the Bill was published. There were extensive discussions on the Bill at meetings of the Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources. This Bill was debated in the D&aacute;il and the Seanad and has been immeasurably improved since the legislation was first presented. I would like to see other measures in it but I appreciate the Minister&rsquo;s commitment to meet with fishing organisations to discuss the future of the industry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeMcHugh"><NameTxt>Mr. McHugh</NameTxt>
	<P>We are faced with many dilemmas in the fishing industry, the greatest of which is balancing conservation and sustainability with livelihoods. Fishermen came to Leinster House yesterday from the area in which Senator Kenneally resides, from Mizen Head, from the west coast and Gola Island, Inch Island and Urris in north Inishowen. These fishermen spoke of surviving and of their traditional way of life with which we must strike a balance. The Minister is a smart man and realises that life in the fishing industry is not black and white. I believe the fishing industry has a great future and enough people in the industry wish to strike a balance with conservation. Fishermen must take the lead through their representative organisations. Some, such as the crab fishermen in north-west Donegal, produce scientific research with Trinity College and UCG on their own initiative.</P>

	<P>I thank the Minister and his staff. I am not as familiar with the debate as the other spokespersons, I am not my party&rsquo;s spokesperson and I came to the debate quite late. I am concerned that this legislation is stricter than that of other countries but I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s commitment to engage in dialogue with the industry. The legislation should be monitored and reviewed if necessary.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Mr. N. Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Senators for their co-operation in bringing the Bill to its conclusion. This Bill updates and con<Col N="234"/>solidates sea-fisheries legislation dating back to 1959. When it is signed into law it will provide for the implementation of the requirements of the EU Common Fisheries Policy. The Bill signals the need for proper conservation and management of sea-fisheries. While some may suggest we are too severe, we cannot ignore the scientific data that exist.</P>
      <P>Since the Bill was published many Senators, including Senator Kenneally, have made suggestions to improve it. Many of these were taken on board as the Bill grew from 71 sections and two Schedules to 104 sections and three Schedules. The major additions were to the sections on the sea-fisheries protection authority, moving fisheries protection from the political realm and the Department&rsquo;s remit to an almost independent regulator. It is important that Departments with responsibility for promoting particular sectors should focus on this task, with regulation provided by independent regulatory authorities.</P>
      <P>I reiterate the necessity for the Department&rsquo;s commitment to the sustainability of sea-fisheries and, in particular, to the coastal communities that depend on the sea, to which Senator McHugh referred. I hope the industry representatives can work with us to ensure we make progress. I am committed to working at EU level to secure better EU controls and penalties for illegal fishing and stronger measures to address the matter of foreign factory ships. We need a better method of monitoring and controlling foreign vessels in our waters. This weakness must be addressed.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
      <P>I also thank the members of staff of the House for their co-operation in arranging debates on this Bill. I do not wish to finish on a negative note but in almost 20 years in the D&aacute;il I have rarely seen such a concerted and organised campaign against legislation. This applies more to contributions made in the D&aacute;il than the Seanad. I have rarely seen such misinformation from those opposed to the Bill, mainly outside the Houses. A robust debate is healthy in any democracy but certain limits should not be breached. During the course of this debate certain remarks made were out of order and very unfair to the civil servants dealing with this Bill. I am not referring to Members of this House.</P>
      <P>As a politician and a Minister I am accountable to the Houses of the Oireachtas. I have no difficulty accepting criticism and can stand here and defend myself. However on a number of occasions during the passage of this Bill a number of people, although not in this House, went over the top with personalised attacks on civil servants in my Department dealing with this area. This is unfair and should not happen. I was also annoyed by anonymous attacks on civil servants by people outside the Houses in newspapers and other publications. This was out of order. I will take the political flak but our civil servants and the integ<Col N="235"/>rity of the Civil Service should not be attacked in that way. I regret that it happened.</P>
      <P>I do not want to finish on a negative note. I thank everybody in this House for dealing with this Bill efficiently, effectively and fairly and I look forward to having it signed and, on foot of the requests that have been made, meeting the fishermen&rsquo;s organisations and the wider communities in coastal areas to plot a way forward <Col N="236"/>that will ensure sustainable communities into the future.</P>
