      <P>Sé an cuspóir atá leis an mBille seo ná ceart vótála a thabhairt do ghach saoránach a bhfuil ocht mbliana déag slán aige.  Mar is eol do Sheanadóirí, faoin mBunreacht mar atá sé faoi láthair, tig le gach saoránach a bhfuil bliain is fiche slán aige vótáil ag toghcháin don Dáil, toghcháin don Uachtarán agus ag reifrinn. Má ritheann an Seanad an Bille roimh saoire an tsamhraidh, beartaíonn an Rialtas an tairiscint a chur ós chomhair na ndaoine ag reifreann a tionólfar i rith an fhomhair.</P>
      <P>Nuair a thug an tAire an Bille seo ós chomhair na Dála, chuir teachtaí ó ghach pháirte fáilte roimhe agus tá mé lán-chinnte go bhfáilteoidh Seanadóirí roimhe freisin.  Is léir go bhfuil muid go léir ar aonghuth faoin gceist seo agus tá súil agam go mbeidh muid in ann có-oibriú le céile chun a chur ina luí ar na daoine a gcuid votaí a chaitheamh i bhfábhar an togra ar lá an reifrinn.</P>
      <P>This is a small Bill but is important and historical in the sense that it proposes to widen the parliamentary franchise which has remained unchanged since the early days of this State.  It is a very simple Bill consisting basically of a single section.  It provides for the amendment of Article 16.1.2º of the Constitution by the substitution of &ldquo;18 years&rdquo; for &ldquo;21 years&rdquo;.  This article deals with elections to Dáil Éireann but because the Constitution provides that every Dáil elector has the right to vote at an election for president and at a referendum, the amendment will reduce the age for presidential elections and referenda as well as for Dáil elections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the people at the referendum approve of the proposal in this Bill, and it is my sincere hope that they will, it will be necessary to introduce a short Bill to make the necessary consequential changes in the electoral law.  It is intended to take the opportunity of that Bill to provide for the lowering of the voting age at local <Col N="407" /> government elections to 18 years Senators will recall that an undertaking has already been given on this matter.</P>
    <P>This House passed a resolution on 22nd March last calling on the Taoiseach to take the steps necessary to allow all persons of 18 years and over the right to vote at all referenda and parliamentary and local elections.  It is clear from this action and from the views expressed on all sides of the House on the recent debate on the Local Elections Bill that all parties are fully in favour of the principle of votes at 18.  It is not necessary, therefore, for me at this stage to go into detail or to advance further arguments in favour of lowering the voting age.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a Bill which, as the Parliamentary Secretary has said, we can feel confident will be welcomed by all shades of opinion, both in this House and outside it.  It is a Bill that, in the opinion of many, is long overdue. The various reasons in favour of its introduction were enumerated here briefly some months ago, and in various other places at length over the last number of years.  It is no harm to detail briefly once again the thinking behind those who moved the motion some months ago.  As far back as 1965 the Fine Gael Party wrote into their policy documents the principle that all people of 18 years and over should have the right to cast their votes in any elections.  I should like to pay a tribute to someone who is no longer with us and who was a candidate for election to this House at the last election.  At the time he was a member of Dublin County Council and about ten years ago he persuaded that council to pass a resolution calling on the Government to introduce the type of Bill which is before us today.  Credit is due not only to him but to that local authority for their far-sighted move at that time. Following on his efforts, my party wrote into their policy documents in 1965 as one of the main principles of the Fine Gael policy at that time.  Some years later the Labour Party also <Col N="408" /> decided to adopt this idea as part of their policy.</P>
      <P>The matter lay there with various requests and moves being made.  The whole question was considered by the Committee on the Constitution in 1967, but I am afraid it has taken until now to have in legislative form what a great number of people, both inside and outside of Parliament, have been looking for for the last ten years.  A motion lay on the Order Paper of this House for almost two years in the names of Senator Mannion, Senator O'Higgins and myself, calling on the Government to take a step like this.  It was moved, as the Parliamentary Secretary has said, a few months ago, following the introduction of a Private Members' Bill in the Dáil by Deputy Coogan and Deputy Hogan, which was not agreed to by the Minister.  On its First Reading he gave an undertaking to introduce a similar type Bill.  On the same day the Seanad formally moved our motion which had lain there for so long and it was agreed to.</P>
      <P>The thinking behind those who wanted to see the franchise extended to people of 18 years and over was briefly that those of this age are entitled by the laws of this country to marry and rear a family.  They are entitled to become members of the Defence Forces and of the Garda Síochána.  In that context they may be asked to put their lives at risk on behalf of the State.  Yet they were not allowed to cast their vote as to who should become a member of the Parliament of the State.  Under the Intoxicating Liquor Acts they are entitled to take drink.  They are entitled to drive a motor-car.  They are obliged, if wage-earners, to pay taxes or social insurance.  If they are the rated occupiers of property, they must pay rates. In other words, they have all the obligations of any other adult member of the State, but they have not the very important advantage and right of having a say in deciding who should be a member of the national parliament, or who should be a member of the local authority in the administrative area in which they live.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to think that the introduction of this Bill today is a mark of the increasing maturity of Irish society. <Col N="409" /> It has been said that its introduction is a mark of an earlier maturity.  I think it is rather an indication of an awareness generally on the part of all shades of opinion and of people of all ages, whether young or old, that young people have a part to play.  Their contribution towards the development of a better society and, indeed, of a society that cares more for the underprivileged members of our society, is a role that they are playing increasingly.  They have been showing that, through their efforts, they can bring real help and real compassion to bear in a way that, perhaps, their elders have not done quite so well in the past.  That maturity is also evident in their elders in the fact that they are now prepared to allow young people to play a role such as this, and in the fact that, if even at a later stage than we might have had hoped, this Bill is before us today.</P>
    <P>Those people who were Members of the first Dáil and who helped to found this State and keep it in existence were almost invariably men and women who entered the political arena at an age earlier than 21 years.  Very many of them, when they became Members of the First Dáil, had barely reached the age of 21 themselves.  At that stage they had been actively engaged in politics, some of them for as long as eight or ten years.  When one realises that, it is rather surprising that it should have taken us over 50 years to get around to introducing a Bill which would recognise the fact that young people have a part to play.</P>
    <P>There is a strange type of anomaly that while this Bill, if passed, and if the referendum is agreed to, will allow people of 18 years and over the right to vote, nonetheless one will still have to be 21 years or older to stand for election as a member of either the Dáil or the Seanad.  It seems strange that the Government did not, at the same time, take the opportunity of introducing a second Amendment of the Constitution Bill which would have allowed those of 18 years and over the right to stand for election as candidates.  There have been various reasons advanced as to why this should not be so.  I do not consider them to be reasons with any great <Col N="410" /> foundation because they are mainly based on the fact that no other country happens to allow young people of 18 or over the right to stand as candidates for elections.  Far too often our yardstick is whether or not a precedent exists in other countries, usually in the western hemisphere and usually countries which are our neighbours.  The Government should have taken a braver approach towards this, so that perhaps if at some time in the future a similar type of discussion was being held in the national parliaments of other countries, the precedent of Ireland allowing young people of 18 years the right to stand as candidates in elections could be held up as an example for those other countries to follow.  This poor little country, as always, waits until the last moment and until there is a very definite and safe precedent to go by, so that our national parliament and our Government will not be embarrassed.</P>
    <P>I hope that in his reply the Parliamentary Secretary may give some better reasons than have been given so far as to why young people of 18 to 21 years are not being allowed to stand as candidates.</P>
    <P>On behalf of my party I welcome this Bill, as someone who has had a motion on the Order Paper for a long time and as someone who happens to be the youngest Member of this House.  On behalf of the young people generally I should like to welcome it and to urge my colleagues on both sides to ensure when the referendum is held that there is an active interest taken by the electorate in it and that there is a large and positive response to this appeal to the Irish people to change the Constitution and afford what is a basic civil right to people who have all the other obligations as members of the community.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">
      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill and note the fact that the motion which was before the Seanad until recently seems to have something to do with the speeding up of the introduction of this legislation.  It would be extremely dangerous to withhold the franchise any longer from people between the ages of 18 to 21.  They are politically mature and they often see things more clearly and decisively than older people do.  The younger people will see clearly what is good and what is bad in our political institutions and the changes that the extension of the franchise will make will be beneficial.</P>
      <P>It is most important that younger people play a fuller role in our electoral procedures.  I cannot see why the Government have not gone further and given to people between the ages of 18 and 21 an opportunity to stand for election to both Houses of the Oireachtas. If the people between 18 and 21 years can vote in these elections then there it no valid argument why they should not play the fullest part possible and become eligible to stand for election and take seats in both Houses of the Oireachtas.  I should like to hear from the Parliamentary Secretary, when he is replying, whether the Government are considering extending the legislation in this direction and whether they intend to make this move in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome this Bill.  As has been pointed out by Senator Boland, as far back as 1965 there was a resolution passed at a Fine Gael Árd Fheis requesting the Government to give the vote at 18.  That was also contained in the Labour Party's policy in the last general election.  We have now reached the situation where the Parliamentary Secretary is here today introducing this Bill and certainly we all welcome it.  Many people at 18 play their part in all the affairs of the country.  They can be enlisted into the Army at 18.  There are people between 18 and 21 who are mothers and fathers rearing children.  These people are entitled to a vote.  They pay <Col N="412" /> taxes at 18 and can get a driver's licence.  They can purchase alcoholic drink and have to pay their full share of social insurance.  For that and many other reasons it is only right that we should give them the vote at 18 years.</P>
      <P>In recent years the voting age has been reduced in America, Great Britain, Norway and many other countries.  If this proposal is carried it will mean that a person who has reached the age of 18 years of age will be entitled to vote but will not be in a position to offer himself or herself as a candidate for this House.  I do not think that it is fair.  We are looking to see if any other country has done this.  It is time we started to give the lead here ourselves.  One would be tempted to suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that, even at this late stage, there should be two amendments in this.  We could call the other one the Fifth Amendment&mdash;to amend paragraphs 1 and 2 of Article 16 of the Constitution.  The answer offered, I am sure, would be that the electorate might get mixed up.  I do not think they would.  We are dealing with an intelligent, sensible electorate.  I am satisfied that they would be capable of voting on the two amendments on the one day.</P>
      <P>I wonder how sincere the Government are in relation to the vote at 18 years of age.  They had the opportunity when introducing a Bill in this House to give the vote at 18 years in local elections.  They failed to do so. The answer of the Parliamentary Secretary who dealt with the Bill was that he felt that this should be decided by an amendment to the Constitution and that the decision should be given by the people of the country.  I cannot go the whole way with that because there was an obligation on us in this House and the other House to give the lead to the people. That did not happen but I am sure that everybody in the House and people who are interested in the youth will do everything they can to see that this amendment to the Constitution is carried.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelGallanagh" hpid="Mr. Gallanagh Mr. Gallanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill as it gives an opportunity to the <Col N="413" /> people to exercise their constitutional rights.  It is not a foregone conclusion that a decision will be given in favour of votes at 18.  I do not agree that the age of those standing for election to the Dáil or Seanad should be reduced to 18.  A person who wishes to stand for election to either House should have contributed in some way to the economy of the country.  In modern times people attend schools and universities to a later age and the age for sitting for Parliament should be raised from 21 to 25.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other Senators I welcome this Bill, but in my case it is a qualified welcome.  The Bill does so little it is hardly worth the trouble and expense of a referendum.  We are told these referenda are very costly.</P>
      <P>I am in favour of giving votes to persons of 18 and over and of allowing them to stand for election.  I agree with Senator Boland's points about the way in which they otherwise play a part in the country by fighting and dying; they can marry and take part as full citizens.  This applies equally forcefully to allowing them to stand for election.</P>
      <P>Young people are becoming very disillusioned and finding it increasingly difficult to play a constructive part in the country and need to be involved more directly in our democratic process. It is a sham to allow them to vote for others and not to be allowed to vote for those of their own age group and be allowed to participate actively in the various levels of democratic structures, both at parliamentary level and local government level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is incredible that we have a second Bill this year to amend the Constitution on such a minor matter. We are asking people again to change the 1937 Constitution but we are not asking them to face any of the real problems of this year.  There are real problems to be faced such as minority rights in the South and of making the southern Constitution more acceptable to those living in Northern Ireland.  It is either an incredible cynicism or else we are living in cloud-cuckoo land.  I should like to disassociate myself from this sort of <Col N="414" /> thinking and, on the Second Reading of a Bill to amend the Constitution, to put forward what I should like to see as a Bill to amend the Constitution in 1972 in the serious political and social climate which faces us.</P>
    <P>The sort of change I should like to see and the matter I should like the people to be asked to vote on involves the removal of various elements in the 1937 Constitution which are divisive on religious and social grounds.  I should like to refer briefly to a report of a working-party set up by the Irish Theological Association which is reported in the June issue of <i>The Furrow</i> and which makes unanimous recommendations for changes in the Constitution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the Cathaoirleach.  That is my reading of it.  If we are discussing a Bill to amend the Constitution we should discuss it in terms of what amendments would be appropriate to it.  The point I am trying to make is that this is an incredibly petty point to put before the people as an amendment to the Constitution in isolation from all the other much more important and necessary amendments to the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Turning to this report of the working party set up by the Irish Theological <Col N="415" /> Association, its merit, if it has any merit, is that it was set up by an interdenominational body representing the various churches in Ireland.  This report which is set out in the June issue of <i>The Furrow</i> at page 370 goes through various articles of the Constitution and makes recommendations. First of all, in relation to the preamble, it states:</P>
    <P>It is a customary for a Constitution to have a preamble.  Whatever its interpretative value or legal significance, it creates a certain social and psychological climate.  The working-party recognised that the present preamble reflects the predominant religious strand in the Irish tradition but it is not satisfied that this is necessary or appropriate in such a legal document.</P>
    <P>It goes on to recommend a simpler, more pluralist, more acceptable preamble to other minority religious, which embodies the idea of the Irish people giving to themselves a Constitution representative of all our citizens.</P>
    <P>The next article to which it refers is Article 44, which recognises the special position of the Catholic Church and the position of other named churches and, as has been pointed out on many occasions, this is not a comprehensive list.  It is a selective list and dates from 1937.  The report states:</P>
    <P>On the basis of these considerations the working-party is agreed that the Constitution as basic law of the land should omit all references to specific religions and Churches, and that its provisions should be confined to securing the free profession and practice of all religions and beliefs subject to the recognised limitations referred to above.</P>
    <P>It would confine Article 44 to the protection of freedom to practise religion, freedom of opinion and the guarantee of not favouring any particular religion.</P>
    <P>The report next deals with Article 41 which prohibits the granting of a dissolution of marriage and divorce. The working-party recommends and I quote:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="416" /> The prohibition in the present Constitution on the introduction of any law &ldquo;providing for the grant of a dissolution of marriage&rdquo; did not exist in the 1922 Constitution but was introduced for the first time in 1937.  So there is no long Irish tradition behind it.</P>
    <P>It is very difficult to find any other Constitution in which such a provision exists.</P>
    <P>Although the various Christian Churches in Ireland are opposed to dissolution of marriage in general, certain exceptions are recognised.  In fact however the existing provisions have been interpreted as representing the Roman Catholic position and have in that way been religiously divisive.  Yet the effect of 3.2º and 3º is to deny in law the right of Roman Catholics to remarry who have received an ecclesiastical decree of dissolution or nullity.</P>
    <P>The working-party recommends that 3.2º and 3º be omitted.  In this way the religiously divisive element will be removed and the social implications of change can be examined on their merits.</P>
    <P>The working-party points out clearly that in actual wording Article 41 goes further than the Roman Catholic Church in preventing even the recognition of a nullity granted by the Catholic Church.  Under the terms of our Constitution this is not a valid dissolution of a marriage in our law.  This is both illogical in the terms in which it was intended as well as divisive in that it is representative of only one strain of religion in the country.</P>
    <P>These are the subjects which ought to be considered as a matter of urgency both for the citizens living here and also for those living in the North in this year of tragedy.  The Leader of the House will probably point out that there is a Dáil Committee sitting on the Constitution.  I should like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary in the context of the Second Reading of the Bill when this Dáil Committee will report its findings.  What has it been discussing up to date?  What attempt has been made to speed up the report so that it can make a positive contribution where <Col N="417" /> there is such a need for this type of response and where there is a need for change.  Could it not have reported back in time for its recommendations to have been incorporated in this Amendment to the Constitution Bill? It seems unbelievable that it took so many weeks for its terms of reference to be decided, and further weeks elapsed before the first meeting.  Since then it has gone underground.  Of all the committees one hears about which have attempted to shelve a problem this must be the greatest.</P>

      <P>Like the other Senators who have spoken, I welcome this Bill.  We must agree with Senator Robinson's comments in connection with this referendum.  This referendum is quite likely to become the nonevent of 1972.  Here we have an issue where we have a referendum to give votes at 18 years.  All the political parties are claiming credit as being the pioneers of this idea.  It is their particular policy and nobody will take any interest in trying to ensure that the people go to the polling booths to cast their votes for or against this proposal. Senator Gallanagh mentioned that it was quite likely that adults might vote against the proposal to give votes at 18 years.  It behoves all the political parties to ensure that not alone should we be claiming credit in this House and in Dáil Éireann for being the pioneers of this idea of votes at 18 years but that we should ensure that we can conduct a campaign to make certain that the public will vote.</P>

    <P>Disappointment has been expressed <Col N="418" /> at the fact that, while we are prepared to give votes at 18 years, we are not prepared to permit those between the ages of 18 and 21 years to stand as candidates for elections to the Dáil, Seanad or local authorities.  In reading through the report of the debates in the Dáil, I formed the impression that those who spoke were unable to give an indication of any other country where people could stand as candidates for an election at 18 years of age.  Switzerland was cited as a country where a person of 20 years of age could stand for election.  Can we not make up our minds here whether or not to give people the right to stand for election at 18 years rather than look around the globe to see if Switzerland, Belgium or America conceded this right to the youth of their countries?</P>
    <P>Nobody will be standing for Parliament under 19 years of age.  Under our present system a person must be 21 years of age before his name appears on the register.  Two, three or four years may elapse before that person will cast his first vote at an election. This means if the referendum is successful that he will be 19, 20 or 21 years of age before he votes.  At that age a person has a right to stand as a candidate for an election.</P>
    <P>It is a bit cynical when people in the 18 to 21 age group can go to the polling booth to vote for A, B, or C but they are denied the right to vote for a person of their particular age group. This offers no encouragement to youth who are rather cynical of people in the older age bracket.  It will not encourage them to vote for somebody who, they feel, may be out of sympathy with their modern thinking.</P>
    <P>This may appear to be a revolutionary request, because no other country has had the courage to give the right to stand for election to all those who have the right to vote in a parliamentary election.  We should display some courage and initiative in this issue and give to anybody whose name appears on the register the right to stand in Dáil, Seanad or local government elections.</P>
    <P>Many of us in this House will remember the time when only a ratepayer <Col N="419" /> or householder had the privilege to vote in local authority elections. I am sure Senator Ó Maoláin, who raised this matter quite recently, will correct me if I am wrong: the last local elections contested on that basis was in 1934.  The then Fianna Fáil Government introduced legislation after 1934 and changed the system and everyone whose name was on the register and had the right to vote in a parliamentary election was given the right to vote in a local authority election.  That was a wise and prudent decision.  At that time only the privileged people who were property owners could vote.  The rest of the community had no such privilege. That change did an immense amount of good.</P>
    <P>I should like to know had anybody whose name was on the register prior to 1934 and who was not a ratepayer or householder the right to stand as a candidate for a local election or was that privilege given only to property owners?</P>
    <P>Rather than looking around the globe in connection with this Bill and saying that because some other country has not given the votes at 18 that we should wait until someone else pioneers it.  We should make this Bill a better one by having a bit of courage and not alone giving the vote at 18, but giving the right to stand in all elections to anybody who is on the register of electors.</P>

      <P>I am glad Senator Fitzgerald referred to the 1934 legislation.  I think he is wrong. I happen to remember that very well. It was 1933 that the Government introduced the Bill to give the right to vote in local government elections to all citizens irrespective of property qualification.  It came into operation in time for the local government elections of 1934.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Fitzgerald expressed the belief that it did no harm.  It did, in fact, do a tremendous amount of good because it brought an amount of fresh thinking, fresh faces and bright young men into local administration and incidently in 99 per cent of the councils it wiped out the Fine Gael majority <Col N="420" /> on that occasion and gave Fianna Fáil control of practically every local council in the country.  That was very good.</P>

      <P>I am a bit puzzled by the desire of people to have young people entitled to sit in the Dáil and go up for President and have all the right and responsibilities at the age of 18.  I could make an equally good case for a young fellow of 14 having the right to stand for the Dáil on the basis of the claims that were made here by speakers in regard to the qualifications of people of 18.  I remember seeing young fellows in the Fianna at the time, carrying rifles, revolvers and ammunition, helping to put barricades on roads, helping to build ambush positions and going back to school.  Surely a child of 14 who took part in activities of that nature and who was prepared to get shot in the process would be as much entitled to stand for President or to be a Member of the Dáil or Seanad as anybody of 18 who just has normal educational qualifications.</P>
      <P>I could equally make a case for people of 16, 15 or 14. Why the emphasis on 18?  What is so different about the age of 18?  It is merely a gimmick and I do not think it should be taken seriously. There is a vast difference between giving the vote at 18 to the young people and give them the responsibility of administering the affairs of the country and particularly the affairs of country with problems such as we have.  They have not fully matured with regard to experience of life and of its problems.  Even the couple of years between 18 and 21, and the fact that they mix with other people and read more and travel possibly, gives them the opportunity of learning a little more than they would have known at the age of 18, or 16 or 14.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would be completely against any idea of allowing responsibility of that nature to devolve on the shoulders of anyone of 18.  With regard to the vote at 18.  I have no objection to that.  The <Col N="421" /> first departure in regard to the amendment of elected law was made in 1933 by the Fianna Fáil Government and we have no reason to be ashamed of the attitude that was adopted by the Government in regard to giving democratic rights to all citizens at all times since.  When the need and the possibility arose, the Government acted according to the principles of democratic rights and freedom.  So it has in this case.</P>
    <P>While I have no objection to Senator Boland patting himself on the back in respect of his party's advocacy of the right to vote at 18, I would remind him that other parties also have the same belief.  The main thing is that everybody now accepts the principle that votes should be given at 18, and the referendum is the opportunity to enable that principle to be put into practical effect.</P>
    <P>Senator Fitzgerald seems to have some doubts about whether everybody is going to vote or not.  With all the interests which the parties have shown on this matter, there should be no doubt whatever that every effort will be made to persuade the people that it is their duty to take part in this referendum and to express their opinion so that the Government and the people generally will know what is thought of the proposition to give the responsibility of voting and electing representatives to the young people of 18.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that there will be a big poll and, as Senator Fitzgerald and Senator Boland have said, we hope that every effort will be made by all Members of this House to assist in bringing about that desirable result.</P>
    <P>With regard to Senator Robinson's remarks on the Constitution, I do not see this great demand she speaks of. I do not know from what source comes this terrific need and urgency for referenda to deal with the denial of minority rights to people down here.  I was very interested to look at a documentary film on the British Broadcasting Corporation network about a week ago entitled &ldquo;I am a Protestant and Proud of It&rdquo;.  I do not know if Senator Robinson takes time off to look at these things, but I <Col N="422" /> would advise her to do so.  They are very educational, very informative.</P>
    <P>In this case the BBC sent a camera crew to Ireland with instructions, apparently, to find Protestants with grievances, Protestants who could claim to be persecuted.  This cameraman and his interviewer travelled all round these Twenty-Six Counties&mdash; from the North down to West Cork. They interviewed all types of people and spoke quite freely to them.  They only interviewed Protestants, of course.  Yet they could not find a single Protestant who expressed any desire that the Constitution was in urgent need of amendment.  Neither could they locate a single Protestant who claimed that this question of divorce facilities and contraceptives was an urgent pressing problem which was upsetting their sleep and their digestion and denying them an appetite. In fact, according to this documentary, life was quite congenial for these people.  The only complaint he could find throughout the Twenty-Six Counties during the course of that survey concerned that old hobby horse of the <i>Ne Temere</i> decree.  They produced that in a few places as the reason for the social segregation existing still in parts of rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>This is a matter over which the Government have no control&mdash;it is a matter for the ecclesiastical authorities. It is a matter on which people have a right to hold their own opinions.  I personally should like to see the end of that decree.  I do not see any sense in maintaining it.  If there is any way in which public opinion can persuade the church authorities to abolish it, it would be better not alone for the church and the harmony of life among the people but also for the interests of the whole country in the future.</P>
    <P>I do not understand where this great surge of demand is coming from for the urgent amendment of the Constitution by a series of referenda on all the matters about which Senator Robinson spoke.  There is a committee representative of all the parties considering this matter at present.  In due course we will have their findings put before us for our consideration and decision.</P>
    <P>With the existence of so many small <Col N="423" /> societies with quaint left-wing names borrowed from other countries, such as Citizens for Civil Rights, Citizens for Social Justice and so on, I am surprised that in opposition to those societies some liberal society has not been formed among liberal-minded people who would answer the correspondence one sees in the newspapers from such organised groups who deliberately misrepresent the position, in respect to the Constitution of 1937 particularly.  I often have been tempted to organise a society for the defence of the Constitution of 1937.  There is not that much wrong with it.</P>

      <P>There is not that much wrong with it despite the apparent ignorance of Senator Robinson.  The few articles which require amendment can be amended without unduly upsetting anybody.  I would suggest to Senator Robinson and anyone else with similar ideas that nothing is gained by exaggeration, that nothing is gained by portraying a situation which does not exist.  If people believe that articles of the Constitution should be amended, a reasonable case should be made which does not need to be bolstered up by the type of argument heard against, for example, the continuance of Article 44.  There is no need for any campaign against Article 44. Everybody knows that Artcle 44, so far as conferring any special benefits on the Catholic Church is concerned, means nothing.  Nobody will lose any sleep if it is abolished.</P>

      <P>But apparently people like Senator Robinson wish to make Article 44 an example of the domineering control of the Catholic Church in this part of Ireland.  This is nonsense.  If a case requires such bolstering up to persuade people to support it, it must be a very poor case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill which Senators have welcomed is a further step on the road to ensuring that our democracy will be as progressive as any in the rest <Col N="424" /> of the world.  When enacted in legislation after the referendum, it will enable young people to take seriously their responsibilities as citizens and make them realise that running up and down the streets in parades, throwing things at the police and other citizens who do not share the same beliefs, is not the proper way to conduct themselves in a free democracy.</P>
    <P>We hope it will have a good effect on youthful enthusiasm, particularly of some young university students.  We hope it will help them to appreciate that this is their country, of which they should be proud and which they should endeavour to improve in every way possible.  They will have the responsibility of electing representatives to local and national bodies.  They should elect representatives who will take their duties seriously and so ensure that the freedom we have in this part of the island will be maintained and handed down to the next generation. I think the country as a whole will approve the idea of a referendum. I am convinced that the country will vote in favour of giving the vote at 18 when they get the opportunity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AndyOBrien" hpid="Mr. A. O'Brien Mr. A. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>When the referendum is being held on the question of extending the franchise to people of 18 a second question should also be asked of the electorate: &ldquo;Do they approve of people of 18 years and older having the right to stand for parliamentary and local elections?&rdquo; The whole question of rights of citizens at 18 years should be put to the people and let them make their decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people should also be afforded the opportunity to express their views on whatever other matters are causing concern in connection with the Constitution on the same day.  They should not be considered so immature that they would be incapable of answering several questions at the one time.  This referendum could have been held earlier, on the occasion of the Common Market referendum.  If the leader of the House concedes that there are some sections of the Constitution in need of amendment, this is the opportunity to amend them.  With <Col N="425" /> due deference to his wisdom and experience, I do not think that any BBC documentary is an adequate substitute for a referendum.  If those questions are being asked and if it has been found necessary to set up a commission to examine them and to find out whether they should be amended or deleted from the Constitution altogether, a referendum should be held with a view to giving the people an opportunity of expressing their views on them.</P>
    <P>If Article 44 of the Constitution confers no right whatever on one particular church compared with other churches &mdash;I am convinced that it does not&mdash; that is all the more reason why it should not be there.  If it causes any annoyance, or any excuse for annoyance, it should be done away with.  If our people in the North draw our attention to that Article, in their efforts to whip up antagonism in this community, now is the time to make a gesture of goodwill towards them by removing that Article.  If it confers no benefit on any church it should not be there as it is offered as an excuse by those people to attack this part of the country as Catholic Church dominated. That excuse should be done away with by asking the people to decide it by referendum.</P>
    <P>I believe this referendum will be regarded by a large number of people as an opportunity missed.  Young people who will be given the right to vote at 18 years will want to know why the people were not asked to adjudicate on whether they should be allowed to stand for parliamentary elections at 18 years.  It will cause a lot of dissatisfaction among our young people.  They will not be satisfied by being told &ldquo;We will extend the full rights of citizenship to you in a niggardly way.  We will give you a little now and, if you behave yourselves properly, we will give you a little more in three, four or five years time.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The youth of today will not be prepared to settle for that.  Other people will see it as an opportunity missed of removing causes for grievances among various minorities and, particularly, as an opportunity missed of removing causes for grievances among our people <Col N="426" /> in Northern Ireland.  For that reason the referendum will be regarded as a great mistake because it seems to do so little at a time when it would appear to be very, very necessary to do a great deal more.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCrinion" hpid="Mr. Crinion Mr. Crinion">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears to be acceptable to all sides that we should allow people to vote at 18 years.  A number of Senators have asked why not introduce further amendments to the Constitution and why not have a package deal?  The changing of the Constitution is a very serious matter and our record of changes in the Constitution has not been too successful, the last referendum having been the first successful change. The Constitution is the safeguard of every individual that Parliament will not change the laws by a simple majority as appertains in the Communist States.</P>
      <P>Senator Fitzgerald suggested that we should take a bold step and become the first country in the world to allow people to stand for Parliament at 18 years.  I recall an old proverb which says: &ldquo;Never be the first to accept a new idea and never be the last to shed an old idea&rdquo;.  That proverb should be borne in mind.  I should not like to be the first to undertake any change. In America a candidate cannot go forward for presidential election unless he is older than 35 years and a Senator must be older than 30 years.  We had the famous case of the Kennedys, where they wanted a Kennedy brother to succeed the President when he left office as Senator, when a Kennedy brother had to wait until he was 30 years to go forward for election as a Senator.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendments to the Constitution should be seriously considered.  They must be taken piecemeal and every amendment should be voted on separately. Regarding amendment of Article 44, and other amendments that have been mentioned by Senators, they are only excuses that have been formulated in the present climate.  Nobody is prevented from getting from abroad anything which they cannot purchase here.  If that excuse was removed tomorrow some other excuse would be thought up.  If we wish to pick holes <Col N="427" /> in any written matter we will find plenty.  I should like to recommend this Bill to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government (Mr. Cunningham)</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the wide welcome this Bill has been given by all speakers.  I do not want to follow up the discussion regarding further and wider amendments of the Constitution. A study of the Constitution and decisions recommending changes to it are matters that have been entrusted to a Committee of the Dáil.  This Committee is not a Government Committee&mdash;it is a Committee of the Dáil. The Government cannot say at this stage what recommendations will be made by the Committee or what decisions regarding legislation will be undertaken as a result of their deliberations.</P>
      <P>Senator West asked if it is the Government's intention to bring in legislation which would enable a referendum to be held to allow people to go forward for elections at 18 years. The answer to that question is no. Further amendments to the Constitution are being considered by the Dáil Committee and their recommendations will eventually come before the Government.  I wish to welcome the statement made by Senator Reynolds where he indicated the support of his party and the assistance of himself and his colleagues to ensure that the referendum on this would be carried.  I am sure the same goes for other parties.  The general tone of the debate was that it was something that all parties should get down to&mdash;the winning of the referendum on votes at 18 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another matter which kept traversing the debate was who thought of it first.  It does not really matter.  I certainly do not want to spend the next half-hour trying to prove that at some past date we thought of this.  No party thought of it first.  This is a development in the maturity of our younger people.  It represents a change of attitude again due to a welcome development among older people.  No government or party can move faster <Col N="428" /> than the people want them to do.  It is a reflection of what the people want and it is clear that all parties have read the signs and that it was the lot of the Government to introduce this legislation.</P>
    <P>We are glad to do it.  We know that it is welcome not alone by all parties but by the people, because it represents a development of the minds of our people and a development in the national attitudes and outlooks of our people.  That spells votes at 18 and the Government are giving an opportunity to the people to say clearly what they want, how many of them want it, and how many do not want it.</P>
    <P>This is not a late effort : it is an effort which coincides with the will of the people and we are not at the end of the international table.  There are many other countries who have not yet done what this Bill proposes to do and what the amendment of the Constitution will do.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to another matter raised here and in the Dáil, which is the introduction of seats at 18 years.  There has been a suggestion that the Constitution should also be amended to allow those of 18 to 21 years to take seats in both Houses of the Oireachtas, in local authorities, and presumably to become candidates for the Presidency.  The Government have not taken a decision on that and again, judging the will of the people and their views, I think that there would not be the same demand for this.  However, it is something that the Dáil Committee on the Constitution will have under consideration and we shall wait for that opportunity.</P>
    <P>Somebody mentioned that there is no country where seats at 18 years were available in either parliament or local authorities.  There are a number where it exists, one being Canada where it is possible to become a member of parliament or of a local authority at 18.  There are a few at 19, some at 20, some at 21 and some up to 25 years.  Some very progressive countries do not allow their citizens to become members of parliament until 25 years, such as the United States.  In France the age is 23.  Arising out of that, the only point I want <Col N="429" /> to make is that people in many countries&mdash;and this is the pattern running through a number of western European and other countries&mdash;agree that there should be a difference between giving the franchise and giving legislative powers to people of 18 years.</P>
    <P>Finally, I hope that the referendum will have overwhelming support.  In anticipation of its result, when the registers are being compiled towards the end of the year instructions are being given and provision is being made for the inclusion of the names of all those over 18 years in the draft registers which will be displayed in the usual centres.  If the referendum is successful, that draft register will be the register which will come into operation on 15th April, 1973.</P>

    <P>With regard to this section I should like to repeat a question which I raised yesterday.  Perhaps it is appropriate to <Col N="430" /> raise it on this particular section of the Bill.  It may have been dealt with because unfortunately I did not realise that the Parliamentary Secretary was going to reply so soon and I was not present to hear his reply.  Why is it that we have to enact the Finance Bill in this pace?  What is the legal reason? What happens?  If the Fianna Fáil party all went to bed and we declined to enact the Bill, what would happen to the institutions of the State?  What is the legal background to the proposition that this Bill has got to be enacted within a particular time?  What procedures are then open to be followed? What power is taken for the Revenue Commissioners which we must give to them, through the enactment of this Bill?  It may be constitutional, in which case we can do nothing about it.  If it is not constitutional, as I said yesterday, if it is some existing statute provision which I doubt, then the sooner we change it the better.  This is an appropriate section on which to raise that point.</P>

      <P>While I appreciate the compliment, I doubt if I will be in a position to teach Senator FitzGerald anything about the Finance Bill.</P>
      <P>The answer to his question is that under The Provisional Collection of Taxes Act, 1927, it is provided that the financial resolutions which are passed on budget day lapse by the 5th of August, that is four months from the commencement of the financial year, unless they are accepted and passed by the Oireachtas.  I am giving the gist of it rather than the actual words as the Senator will appreciate. If we did not enact the Finance Bill before that date, the effect would be that in particular the charging resolutions, charging income tax and surtax for the current year, would lapse and in those circumstances there would be serious problems for the Exchequer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>When operating PAYE reductions an employer must have regard to the certificate of tax free allowances issued in respect of the employee concerned.  The total amount of the employee's allowances as shown in his certificate of allowances, includes any allowable superannuation contributions he may be making to his firm's superannuation fund.  At present, when calculating the amount of income tax to be deducted under PAYE the employer subtracts the amount of tax free allowances, including any allowances for superannuation contributions, from the gross emoluments of such employee.  In many instances the amount of the superannuation contributions are calculated as a percentage of earnings and because of the frequency with which earnings increase, the amount of superannuation contribution often varies in the course of the tax year.  This leads to numerous claims from taxpayers for increased tax free allowances during the course of a given year.  The purpose of this section is to ensure that an employer, when calculating the income tax deductible under PAYE, will first take off the amount of superannuation contributions from the emoluments and then subtract the other tax free allowances.  In this way any variation in an employee's allowable superannuation contributions will be reflected automatically at the time he is being paid and it will mean that many thousands of taxpayers will not be in a position of having to make claims during the course of the year to get a refund of tax.</P>

      <P>It is worth looking at the situation of a company taxpayer who is in arrears, particularly in the context of the Value-Added Tax Bill which would have a certain effect on the liquidity of companies at a particular point in the distribution chain, and who may be pressed for money. In these cases the charge of 9 per cent will effectively be 18 per cent.  With the corporation profits tax and income tax combined, company taxation, when you get over the minimum profit figure, is at 50 per cent.  Because the interest charge is not allowable against their trading the cost to them of being in arrears with tax if they are in a pressed situation, as they may be, not having foreseen the particular tax that is coming along, which in itself I am not opposing, is going to be a very heavy burden.  Is there any method by which in the context of a particular case the 9 per cent rate could not be charged? The 9 per cent rate in the case of a top surtax payer who improvidently <Col N="436" /> goes off to the Riveria is 45 per cent. Let him pay it is my answer to that.  I am thinking of the business which is concerned as to where it is going to get the money to pay all its commitments.</P>

This is one of the problems. One cannot devise a method which would give relief in a genuine case and not have it abused.  On the other hand, it is only fair to say that companies in general will, in this financial year, have less tax to pay than they had anticipated because of the reduction in tax provided for in this Bill. For this reason the kind of situation described by Senator FitzGerald should not arise.</P>

      <P>So far as the amendments specified in the Third Schedule are concerned, and which are consequential <Col N="438" /> on the charging of income tax and sur-tax on a permanent basis, they will take effect in relation to tax for 1973-74 and subsequent years.

      <P>I did mention in the budget that we have been each year applying income tax and sur-tax as though it were a temporary tax.  By now we can all accept that these taxes are no longer temporary and, therefore, I am proposing here in section 1 to make them permanent taxes as from 1973-74.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to contribute very much to this Chapter which contains sections 13 to 25.  The object of all this kind of legislation is to prevent pension schemes which are operating through reliefs from the Exchequer being abused, so that people are, in effect, taking advantage of tax relief provisions in an undesirable way.  I ask the Minister to repeat a general account which he has already given of the effect of this Chapter.  Then we could get through all these sections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The first thing I should like to say is that the purpose of this <Col N="439" /> Chapter is much more than simply to prevent the abuse of these schemes. In fact, it introduces a code of tax provisions in relation to superannuation schemes which is far more liberal than we have at the moment.  There are quite a number of important reliefs in that regard.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Chapter, together with the First Schedule, is to provide a new comprehensive code of tax provisions to replace the existing body of tax law which deals with superannuation schemes for employed persons.  The new code will be more liberal.  It will also be simpler and it will remove certain anomalies.</P>
      <P>The existing law in this matter was enacted in 1921, 1922 and 1958 and for varying purposes on each occasion. The provisions of 1921 and 1922 were relieving measures which were enacted solely to provide tax reliefs.  The 1958 legislation, however, was introduced primarily to deal with certain tax avoidance abuses associated with retirement benefits, but it included machinary for the approval of schemes which contained no element of tax avoidance, that is, schemes approved by the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
      <P>The existing law is to be repealed as from April 6th, 1980, and after that date the new proposals will have universal application to all superannuation schemes for employees.  In the meantime, new schemes established after 6th April, 1974, or existing schemes materially altered after that date will be required to comply with the new code.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other hand, an existing scheme will have the option of adopting the new code as from April 6th, 1972, or remaining under the present code so long as the scheme is not materially altered until April 6th, 1980. We are really providing as wide an option as possible for existing schemes or, in the event of existing schemes being materially altered, they are in effect completed as new schemes.  The object is to give as much freedom to the present schemes to opt in or out, depending on what suits the people concerned but that eventually, this <Col N="440" /> code will apply to all superannuation schemes.</P>
    <P>I do not know if the Senator would like me to go into more detail about the provisions.  That, perhaps might be better on the sections.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>May be I could give some details of the changes as between the existing code and what is proposed here, which might be of assistance. While the basic maximum for pensions is forty-sixtieths of final remuneration after 40 years service, the Revenue Commissioners are given power, in subsection 4 of section 15, to approve schemes where the rules may allow pensions to be paid at a higher rate than a flat one-sixtieth for each year of service, where the total service is less than 40 years.  In practice, schemes are at present permitted to provide a full pension of two-thirds of the final remuneration in the case of an employee who may have only 20 years' pensionable service.  It will now be permissible on a more regular basis.</P>
      <P>With regard to the limit for the maximum pension for a widow whose husband dies in service, the position is that, under the present law, the maximum widow's pension in such circumstances may not be greater than the amount of the annuity that could be purchased by a sum equal to the capital value of her late husband's potential pension, that is, the pension he would have obtained if he had served at his final remuneration until his normal retirement date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of young widows such a pension could be quite inadequate. Consequently, we are now substituting a new maximum in such cases, that is, a pension of two-thirds of her husband's potential pension.  We are also <Col N="441" /> providing that the lump sum payable to a widow or to children dependants or personal representatives of an employee who dies in service may be up to four times the employee's final remuneration. The existing limit is one-and-a-half. The limit of four times the final remuneration is a maximum. There are many schemes where the lump sum payable, if any, is much less than this.</P>
    <P>We are also providing that the upper limit for a widow's pension at two-thirds of her husband's pension, when he dies after retirement, which under present law is one-half, be raised to two-thirds.  It would apply in respect of children or other dependants.</P>
    <P>These are the main liberalising aspects of the Bill.  There is also a simplification involved and, in effect, a consolation of the tax law in relation to superannuation schemes.  We are repealing the previous provisions, which I have mentioned, of 1921-22 and 1958 and substituting this chapter for them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>From a professional point of view, the advantage of what is proposed is that we have to look now at only one document.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The anti-avoidance element is clear.  Where you draw the line is a matter of judgment.  Would it not be a desirable thing if, in grant-aided industries, there were conditions imposed on industrialists or hoteliers or whoever are receiving the grants, requiring them to adopt approved schemes for their employees.  We ought to pursue our social policy further and attach to it as much of the public money available as we can afford.  I would <Col N="442" /> have thought that we were in the position now of being able to impose that type of social condition, due to getting these sections operated by the industrialists or hoteliers concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I was glad Senator FitzGerald said that it was a question of judgment.  It could well be that the effect of doing this would be simply, in the case of industrial grants, that one might have to step up the rate of grant in certain cases.  Obviously this is not what is intended.  There is a very big practical difficulty involved. The number of variations of possible schemes which might be applied is such that it would not be possible officially to specify that any particular one should be adopted.  One could say that some scheme ought to be in operation which would conform to the provisions of this chapter.  That could be quite a variation from a very elaborate and relatively generous scheme to one which was hardly worth having.  That would not achieve the Senator's objective.</P>

      <P>With regard to section 26, there is an important point here.  Bearing in mind the appalling tragedy which has been experienced by a number of families in the country generally, is it necessary that this amelioration in the rates should be limited to persons dying after the passing of this Act?  Certain changes in this Bill take effect from a date preceding the passing of this Bill.  People heard the Minister in his Budget statement say that particular rates of duty would be applicable.  Certain deaths have now taken place but the earlier rates of duty which were to be repealed are nonethless going to apply to these estates.  These deaths occurred before we were able to give effect to the Minister's wish.</P>

      <P>It has been the practice in the case of incumbents of this kind that they operated from the date of the passing of the Act and, indeed, the budgetary calculations and so on are made on that basis.  However, I feel, and not just in the special circumstances mentioned by Senator FitzGerald, that there is something to be said for operating such measures from the date of their announcement.  I think there is a case to be made for this.</P>
      <P>There are certain anti-avoidance measures in this Bill and it is provided that they will operate as from the date of the passing of the Bill.  Ideally, we would like to have the two operate together, but if we do that it could be said to involve retrospective legislation. Therefore, I have to live with this problem. If I do anything about having the anti-avoidance measures operating from the date of the passing of the Act and the liberalisation measures operating from the date of the announcement it should not present undue difficulties.  For that reason, I propose, between now and the next Stage, to find out what kind of recommendation could be introduced.  It would still be in a position to go back to Dáil Éireann.  If I think it feasible I will certainly take this course.</P>

      <P>The section is agreed to, subject to my repeating an invitation to the Minister, who did not hear me yesterday due to his obvious obligation to be elsewhere, that he might consider the <i>rationalé</i> behind section 24 of the Finance Act, 1965, between now and the next budget.  I do not understand why it <Col N="444" /> sought to charge to duty income which is, in fact, provided by virtue of a scheme which has been approved by the Revenue Commissioners and therefore, not subject to abuse.</P>
      <P>I should like the Minister to think of the proposition that it is extremely important that we have measures here which will encourage the managerial class&mdash;I am using that word even though I do not like it&mdash;to stay here or come back here.  It is through their encouragement that we will achieve the expansion and growth we all wish to see and which I believe we will get.  I share the Minister's optimism with regard to the attainment of full employment.  I believe we will have full employment in this country.</P>
      <P>I hope I am not going away from the section, but I think this is directly related to section 24 of the Finance Act, 1965, which we are proposing to amend.  I believe that the greater danger of the EEC is the prices/wages complex.  Employment will grow at a staggering rate.  I would think that we cannot fail to take the necessary steps to encourage management.  Managers are the kind of people who will inquire into this sort of situation and if they find it discouraging it will be decisive against their coming back.  We do not just want quantities of money coming in here, we want intelligence to use it.</P>

It is clearly an anomaly that the Circuit Court should be limited to £500 jurisdiction in the case of an appeal from the property arbitrator.

    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a number of points to make on this section.  The first is that anti-avoidance operations&mdash;this is one of them &mdash;will be effective only against those who are not rich or very rich during a time like the present when we have not a gift tax as part of our structure. You will not get a desirable state until there is a gift tax.  Apart from the injustice this does to the people of moderate resources, after all public policy is directed to encourage all people to save without having a degree of injustice perpetrated on them. We who are, as the Minister is, practised in law, have a duty to our clients to extract the maximum possible benefit that we can out of legislation as it exists.</P>
      <P>There is a well recognised distinction between avoidance and evasion. That, in a sense, is a professional matter. It is important to get laws which accord with what seems to people to be just.  This is an unfortunate fact and I know the history of it goes back to medieval times when the terrible misfortune of death should have attended this tax gathering operation.</P>
      <P>A formal parliamentary draftsman told me a very good story about a medieval monk who was surveying a scene of carnage.  I want to remind you that at that time the Church was entitled to get rewards out of the existence of wills, but if somebody died intestate there were no rewards for the Church.  The monk surveying this scene of carnage said: &ldquo;And there they all were, dead, stinking and intestate.&rdquo;  So the fact of death having effects on living persons' receipts is not new.  I imagine it is worth a psychological analysis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Anything which shifts over the rate of taxation from this unhappy and inevitable experience is worthy of <Col N="447" /> careful consideration.  Here I want to warn the Minister against his advisers &mdash;the more intelligent the more terrible they are&mdash;because of the old business of getting fond of the &ldquo;old Dutch&rdquo;.  You engage in a practice throughout your life and the more you engage in that practice the more accustomed you are to it, and the more curious psychological compensations come to you from your increasing expertise in it the more uninterested you become in its ultimate social significance.  It has been recognised that we have an open economy, more open than the British one, and therefore we cannot be thinking in a vacuum: we have got to think in terms of the international significance of what we do.</P>
    <P>I know something about the weight of tax duties between Britain and Ireland and the limitations upon our actions there.  We may be getting some degree of freedom here and we ought to examine the whole structure of our estate duty, legacy duty, succession duty and death duty codes in terms of benefits for our society&mdash; both in terms of productivity and just distribution.</P>
    <P>That brings me back to section 32. It is right that I should say that as one seated at a desk I am concerned to take advantage of anything I find in section 32, or section 21 of the Finance Act, 1965, which it replaces. Standing here, I do not find myself so free.  It is useful to take a look at the section to see whether what is designed to be a tax anti-avoidance section effectively achieves what it sets out to achieve.</P>
    <P>This is the first time it has become necessary for living persons to define what is a deceased person.  If the Minister's public relations officers are not fully employed they should direct the Guinness Book of Records to this.  We are here anxiously wondering are we dead or not.  We can be told we are dead under the definition in subsection (1) of section 32 and be assured we are not if we do not fall within the definition of the subsection. Subsection (3) deals with a distinction between capital and income.  The object <Col N="448" /> of the subsection is to determine what is to be sliced for the purposes of determining what is to be the chargeable interest.  It includes in income, and excludes from capital, that which is accumulated.</P>
    <P>If I were a trustee who wanted to accumulate income which was not to be available for slicing and which would be turned into capital for the purposes of the section, I would form a company which would accumulate the income, the shares which I would hold as a trustee, and the benefit from which I would get simply through capital redemption of the shares which I would hold as trustee.  The income which had been accumulated would be excluded from being treated for the purposes of the annuity and the slicing provisions of this subsection.</P>
    <P>There is here a provision whereby you seek to capture for the purposes of duty people who are members, directors or employees of a body corporate which is a beneficiary under the trust; but it does not capture persons who are members, directors or employees of a body which is a holding company or a subsidiary company or an associated company or a company which contracts with the company to get the entire profit of certain specified transactions with the company which are the object of the trust.  So having closed off 17 taps you are left with the 18th still open, through which pushes an immense amount of water.</P>
    <P>The only effect of this type of legislation is to wake up some people to possibilities of which they were unaware before it was introduced.  We have talent, but it is not all that thick on the ground and it is wrong to have it diverted to an unsatisfying operation of tax avoidance.  Suntans on foreign beaches can be frightfully boring when the midges bite.  It is much more satisfying to be engaged in an operation which is essentially productive.  It is better for society that people's talents should be diverted to productive operations.  We must endeavour to get a system of taxation which does not present problems requiring people to get this type of advice.</P>
    <P>As I read the section, we could have <Col N="449" /> somebody who was not an object of the trust at all seated in this castle, permitted to do so by his trustee which could be a limited company created by himself, without any assets, and being rendered liable in the event of his being found to be in breach of trust in occupying the property in question. Not even a liability for duty will arise where somebody occupies, or forcibly enters the property in question.  There seems to be no charge for duty arising in that case.</P>
    <P>Regarding subsection (6) and the definition of &ldquo;market value&rdquo;, what is the position if the property to be valued by the Revenue Commissioners does not exist at the time of death but has been replaced by something else?  If a man is seated for five years in 22 Nutley Road and in the sixth year moves to 20 Nutley Road with the co-operation of the occupier of No. 20. Which property is valued if that man drops dead?  Is it 22 or 20?</P>
    <P>I know the disappearing tricks were thought to have been cut off by an earlier provision of the code, but is the disappearing trick not here remaining as a possibility in relation to this particular benefit under a discretionary trust?  I have no confident answer to the question.</P>
    <P>What is the position if the trust is terminated?  Is the position such that the trustee cannot safely terminate a trust without getting a discharge from the Revenue Commissioners in respect of a possible future liability in relation to a distribution made during his term as a trustee?  What is the position regarding duty if the trust company is a shell&mdash;if the property has been sold in circumstances not rendering the purchaser liable?  I do not wish to be difficult.  I am just referring to matters which seem to arise.</P>
    <P>Subsection (7), dealing with estate duty payable on the death of the deceased, casts enormous burdens on a trustee.  If he is in an avoidance situation it is up to him to protect himself. If a body corporate has been included as the object of the discretionary trust and then some member of that body corporate dies unknown to the trustee, he could find <Col N="450" /> himself in a very difficult situation. The logic of this is that he cannot make a distribution to a body corporate unless he gets complete security for any liability that may arise from a future death of an employee member of the company in question. Does it read &ldquo;member when&rdquo; because it does not appear to me to do so?  What if you are a past member? What if you cease to be a member before the company get the distribution, having made a contract with the company that you will sell your shares on the basis that any profits arising from a particular distribution are to go to you?  You are no longer a member, director or employee. What happens in that case?</P>
    <P>On the question of the first charge on the property I genuinely desire information.  In the case of a person buying a house in Artane, Ballymun, Ballybricken, or Donnybrook does this mean that, if he is buying from trustees who have this property and which property is subject to a first charge, he can be pursued?  What is the position, firstly, if the death occurs before, secondly, if the death occurs after?  This is not just nuisance-making. It is seeking genuine information. I know the Estate Duty Office will not do wrong but let us assume that they did.  What would be the position technically in terms of liability of a purchaser for value?  I presume if he is without notice in the vendor and purchaser sense he is all right.  How much notice does this piece of legislation give him?</P>
    <P>In subsection (8) there is a marvellous new phrase which has come for the first time into legislation and which departs in a striking way from the language which has been used in previous legislation.  I find this very interesting.  We all know what difficulties were attendant on the previous language used.  Here it states:</P>
    <P>The settlor or the person who was the financial source of the property the subject of the trust shall be deemed, for the purposes of section 24 of the Finance Act, 1940, to be the disponer in relation to the trust.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="451" /> The Minister has taken time to define a deceased for us but has not chosen to define who is the financial source of the property.  The previous language used in this sort of thing, as the Minister well knows, is &ldquo;associated operations&rdquo;.  That is like a ship that has been going through the seas all too long and is a bit clogged with botherment, living, and fish grazing against it.  Now we have a new one, the person who is &ldquo;the financial source of the property&rdquo;.  Who in God's name may that include?  If Mr. X's father gave him money, is Mr. X's father the source of money which Mr. X then gave on ten years later to his son-in-law?  How far reaching may this be?  McLysaght's history of families would be nothing compared to the business that is going to develop about who is the financial source of certain people's property.  If I am a millionaire, have a chap who is my bully boy and pay him £50,000 a year for writing my name in the papers, am I the financial source of his property? Where does this begin and where does it end?  If we are going to introduce a phrase like &ldquo;the financial source of the property&rdquo; we do need a definition whether in this or some future Bill limiting this in some fashion?  That is all I wish to say on that section.</P>

      <P>Senator FitzGerald has raised some rather interesting questions &mdash;some rather difficult to answer.  I cannot guarantee that I will be able to provide all of the answers that he might seek.  He will appreciate that in some instances it may be a question that could only be satisfactorily answered by a court.  The Senator envisages a case where a company is the object of a trust.  The trustee pays income into the company.  The company accumulates the income and later disperses it by way of bonus to its members who would themselves be objects of the trust.  If that is what the Senator has in mind&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I help the Minister?  I do not think I expressed myself well with regard to the accumulation.  I was not thinking of a situation where the trust was paying <Col N="452" /> money out to a company but of another situation where, instead of holding shares directly, the trustees would form a company to hold the shares to trap the income and accumulate it within the company whose shares the trustees hold, and when accumulated, to pay off the capital which is held by the trustees so that the money is received by the trustees as capital and not as income.  There is no accumulation within the trust but an accumulation outside the trust or within the categories of investment by the trustees.  I am making the general observation that, once you start anti-avoidance, it is jolly hard to throw the net so extensively and have its web so close as to catch all the fish.  If there is a situation of excitement where the fish want to go through, what you should try to do is deal with the situation of excitement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly accept that the question of devising these anti-avoidance provisions is not alone a difficult one but also a continuing one, no matter how well the provisions are drafted.  What normally happens is that certain loopholes appear in Britain. Legislation is enacted in Britain to close those loopholes and the enactment of that legislation draws the attention of certain people here to them and they then proceed to exploit the loopholes.  We, then close off the loopholes, but very often in the same way as the British have done.  There are exceptions to this, but this is a fairly normal pattern.</P>
      <P>I am certainly reconciled to the fact that it is more than likely that every Finance Bill that comes in here will have some anti-avoidance provisions, many of which will be to tighten up anti-avoidance provisions in which loopholes have been discovered and opened and that no matter how well we close them the same thing will happen the next year.  I am reconciled to that fact.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is.  I agree with what Senator FitzGerald said at the beginning <Col N="453" /> that one might perhaps reduce the necessity for this by another approach.  I certainly do not rule out the possibility of that approach.  The House will appreciate that it would be inappropriate for me to go any further than that at this stage.  I simply want to record the fact that I am not unaware of the value of the approach touched on by Senator FitzGerald.  I was about to tell the Senator that that situation is covered in subsection 2 (b) (2).  I am sure it covers the situation which, I understood, from what the Senator said afterwards, to be in his mind.</P>
      <P>I do not think that I can give a reply off the cuff to that question.  The Senator is drawing attention to the possibilities of further loopholes which may not be covered in this.  I could not say whether the positive loophole mentioned is not closed in this.  I would need to examine it more closely.</P>
      <P>As far as the position of a trustee is concerned, the trustee of a discretionary trust will be in the same position as the trustee of a mandatory trust if the trust is wound up within five years of the relevant death.  He must retain sufficient funds to meet the prospective claim for duty.  We have provision in regard to his liability and his determination of that liability, obtaining a certificate from the Revenue Commissioners in subsection 10, which is a new provision and which will operate to give claims for duty if a discretionary trust is wound up within five years preceding the death of the deceased.</P>
      <P>In these circumstances it is reasonable that the trustee be given the same protection as the trustee of a mandatory trust which is wound up within five years preceding the death of a life tenant or annuatant.  So that in subsection (10), we are giving this same protection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 11 of the Finance Act, 1955, provides that where the property ceases to be comprised in the settlement, the trustee may obtain from the Revenue Commissioners a certificate of the prospective amount of duty.  His liability as a trustee will not exceed the amount certified and, under subsection (10), we are proposing to extend <Col N="454" /> that provision to the trustee of a discretionary trust in the circumstances I have described.  If the amount certified by the Revenue Commissioners turns out to have been underestimated, the excess over the amount certified may be claimed from the beneficiary, but not from the trustee.</P>
    <P>On the question of notice to a purchaser raised by Senator FitzGerald, subsection (7) does not create a new situation except where discretionary trusts are concerned.  The problem to which the Senator referred was already there in relation to mandatory trusts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not disappear by being already there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>No but it is not a newly created one either.  Whatever the position of the purchaser would be in relation to a mandatory trust or gift, his position would be the same now in relation to a discretionary trust.  I am speaking solely in the context of what constitutes notice for him.  I cannot purport to define what would or would not be notice.  All I can say is that his position in the case of a discretionary trust under this Bill would be the same as his position would be in similar circumstances if it were a mandatory trust or gift.</P>
      <P>In relation to companies in the context envisaged here, the members, <i>et cetera</i>, of the company will themselves be objects of the trust.  The company will not have any function other than to be a channel through which the trust income will flow to an individual object of the trust.  Some of the situations envisaged by Senator FitzGerald will go beyond that situation and envisage the company as being other than merely a channel through which the income would flow.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It would have to be more than a channel to achieve that situation.  One possible case&mdash;I have not been able to pronounce on it off-hand&mdash;is the one the Senator mentioned, the example he gave by which <Col N="455" /> the income might be accumulated as capital; but in that instance, I do not think it would be accurate to describe the company as merely the channel.</P>
      <P>In general, some of the points which were raised by the Senator&mdash;if I should have answered others perhaps the Senator will draw my attention to them&mdash; would require close examination of the section to know whether the particular loopholes he mentioned are covered. Even then, the reason I would give might not be of tremendous value.  It would finally be a question of decision by the courts.  I appreciate the fact that the Senator has drawn my attention to these possibilities and they will be borne in mind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Senator will give me a moment I might be able to throw some further light on something he said earlier and I might save him having to make another point.</P>
      <P>I want to revert for a moment to the example which Senator FitzGerald gave of the company which is accumulating income as capital.  It may well be that under the definition of trustee in subsection (i) that company would come within the definition of a trustee. Having regard to that definition and also what it does with the money accumulated&mdash;in regard to the definition of payment in subsection (1)&mdash;it might well be caught within the terms of this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>If the company in question is so organised that it does not have any assets then it does not matter.  It would be the liable person under the definition of trustee, to which the Minister has correctly drawn my attention, and as such would not have any assets to bring it within the ambit of the section.</P>
      <P>I am concerned with the lack of definition of the financial source of the property because I do not know where it will lead us.  I do not mind legislation to deal with estate duty avoidance, income tax avoidance or so on, until the day it prevents some commercial deal from going through, until outsiders to the whole affair say: &ldquo;we cannot take the risk,&rdquo; until insurers are not prepared to insure.  This is why I am worried about language of this kind.  Who is the financial source of the property?  That could bring my great grandmother's aunt into it.  Where does it begin?  One has to look at the section to see what is the point of saying that somebody is a disponer.  I presume it is to determine the relationship and to charge tax in terms of the relationship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said, and properly met my point, about <i>bona fide</i> purchasers <Col N="457" /> for value, that they would be in no worse a situation than they are at the moment where the trusts are mandatory and not discretionary.  There ought to be an obligation on the Revenue Commissioners on being furnished with all the information to give, on the payment of the appropriate duty or provision of equivalent security, a certificate.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the time when, because there is some fatality, or somebody raises the question, a certificate must be had.  There is no obligation on the Revenue Commissioners to give it, with the result that the whole development could be held up.  There are all sorts of consequences in terms of large sums of money which had been committed in relation to this matter.  There ought to be an obligation to provide a certificate if the equivalent liability is properly provided for.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it the Senator's contention that the wording of subsection (1) does not place an obligation on the Revenue Commissioners to give such a certificate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not think it did but if the Minister thinks it does&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I take this to be the same position as exists in transferring this provision from the mandatory trust to the discretionary trust.  I did not think that was a matter of obligation and I think it ought to be.</P>
      <P>In the definition of payment&mdash;forgive me for not having made this point when I spoke on the section originally &mdash;we read &ldquo;payment includes in relation to a deceased any disposition of property in favour of the deceased&rdquo;. Is it possible that we have got the situation here where the acquisition of property subsequently from the settler by the trustee would amount to a payment which would give rise to the effects of the section?  I have not got anything against it but I should like to know whether it is intended or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="458" /> The other point is a generalised point about the section.  If I understand the law correctly, as it stands before we enact this section, if I own a house and transfer it to a trust for myself and my family I have retained a benefit under that trust and on my death there is full accountability for estate duty in relation to the entire estate.  If that is the position, what are we doing in this section except telling my grandfather&mdash;if I may lightly consider him in that context&mdash;to transfer to me a house in which I would be a beneficiary.  At the moment, my entire property if I put it into a discretionary trust is liable to the full amount of the duties because I have retained an interest.  Therefore, what is the point of section 6 where it is to be divided by six?</P>
    <P>Apart from that, I should like to ask why my infant children are excluded from the divisor whereas my adult children, simply because they have reached that miraculous state, are given this extended power of dividing my property?  What is the point of such an exclusion?  I am sure there is some anti-avoidance item here.  If there is an anti-avoidance item in it I am for it, but if we could put in some proviso that would save the genuine case I would be happy.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Minister dealt with my point about how you value what is not there.  Perhaps he might look at it.  In relation to a trustee the definition states &ldquo;exercises or has a discretion to exercise&rdquo; or abstains from exercising&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I omitted on the last occasion to refer to the point raised by Senator FitzGerald about the definition of the financial source of property. This, as the Senator realises, means the persons, company or whatever other definition one would like to use, who puts up the money.  That is its intention in simple terms.  I do not think we ought to try to define it any further unless it emerges, as a result of experience and in particular of possible court decisions, that the wording is presenting problems which were not envisaged.  On the face of it, in the absence of any such problems I do not think it necessary to define the term.  The object of this whole section is to prevent persons of Irish domicile setting up foreign trusts.  I do not know if that has been clear but that is the object of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Further, in regard to this question of the certificate under subsection (10), I cannot define or give a binding legal definition on this, but I can say that if the Revenue Commissioners refused or omitted to give a certificate in circumstances where otherwise the subsection is complied with the court could order the Revenue Commissioners to do so. I understand that is the Revenue Commissioner's impression and practice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is subject to the qualification that I have mentioned. All of the other requirements of the subsection are divided and there may be room for argument in that regard.</P>
      <P>I think the Senator also asked if subsequent to the setting up of the discretionary trust further property goes from the settlor to the trustees whether that is caught by the section and the answer is &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of why infant children are excluded, this is an anti-avoidance <Col N="460" /> measure.  The Senator will appreciate that without the provision here it would be open by way of having a very large number of objects&mdash;this could of course include a number of companies&mdash;to reduce the proportion which becomes liable by dividing the number of objects into the six.  The effect of this provision is to provide that the number of individuals to be used as the divisor is the number of adult persons.  Without that provision there could be quite a wide loophole to avoid&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to interrupt the Minister, but I just want to point out that anything which encouraged large families is a good thing because there are enough discouragements.  If there is an estate duty advantage to be got from having it shared between your wife and ten children, good.  It is a reward and some alleviation.  Why this should be something that is to be worked for during 21 years after the birth of each child I cannot see&mdash;just because somebody gets some benefit which he would not otherwise get.</P>
      <P>I should like to refer to the Minister's point, which I take, about including companies.  He is right, of course, to limit it to individuals&mdash;I accept that&mdash;and to have the number of individuals the divisors.  However, I think it should not be limited to divisors who are of full age.  It should include even infant children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding this question of infant children, there are two aspects. First, the ordinary case of a man with ten children and if he dies&mdash; they have all been living in the house&mdash; the value of the house is taken in for duty purposes.  It does not matter how many children you have.  If you had no children or if you had ten, the value taken for duty purposes is the same. As the Senator knows, there is an abatement provision in regard to infant children, which is the right way to approach it.  For the purpose of valuing <Col N="461" /> property the number of children is irrelevant.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, when one approaches it from the point of view of avoidance or anti-avoidance, the number of infant children need not be confined to the number of children of the settlor.  He may take in any children who are strangers in blood altogether as possible beneficiaries but not as actual beneficiaries.  Therefore, you have such a number in that you would reduce the liability to practically nothing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>But qualify them by being children of the settlor and exclude those who are not.  Let it be adults or children of the settler, whichever is the greatest.  I agree that one must exclude a spurious class.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to refer to one other point the Senator raised about the question of valuing something that is not there.  If we take his example of No. 20 in a certain street being disposed of, and then No. 22 becoming the property in the trust, No. 20 was part of the trust property. If it is disposed of, then the proceeds of sale are part of the trust property in whatever form they may now be. They can be followed through, I think, within the trust property.  I am told that it is not anticipated that any problem should arise in this regard.</P>

      <P>In fact, the purpose of the section is to extend for a further period of one year the exemption from corporation profits tax which hitherto has been afforded to certain public utility companies, building societies and the Agricultural Credit Corporation Limited.  Normally we extended this by three year periods, but in the budget last year I indicated that, pending receipt of a report on the operations of building societies from an inter-departmental group which is investigating the subject, I decided to extend the exemption for one year only.  The report from the investigating group has not yet been completed and accordingly I am proposing to extend the exemption just for one more year.  We are waiting for that report before we make a final decision on whether we should continue on the lines we have been going on up to now.</P>

      <P>This was a device which was used and I cannot say that it is wrong to stop it.  It was a gap whereby companies in trade effectively avoided C.P.T. by providing in their constitution against a distribution of profits, which they proceeded to distribute in due course by liquidation.  Of course it is right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps it is right that the Minister should consider the case to which my attention has been drawn by a professional firm that I was not conscious of myself.  We have in our legislation a specific exemption for sporting organisations, but apparently companies now whose objects are the promotion of sports will be required to amend their Memorandum of Articles of Association and rely on a non-distribution clause for C.P.T. exemption. I should be very frank about this because I am relaying a view on this of <Col N="464" /> which I am not conscious.  I just want to direct the Minister's attention to it. The matter could be dealt with by exempting sporting organisations from C.P.T. if it is desired to give them this type of favourable tax treatment in relation to income tax.</P>

      <P>I knew the Senator would ask that.  The capital fund was set up under section 4 of the Central Fund Act, 1956, the transfer of sums equivalent to the Exchequer receipts of the special import levy.  This fund was authorised by section 4 of that Act. It was provided in the Act that the fund could be applied for any purpose for which or towards the cost of which public moneys are provided and which are conducive to the development or improvement of capital resources.  The Act also provided that any repayment of capital or payment of interest on <Col N="465" /> advances made from the fund, should be credited to the fund.  As from the 1st April, 1959 the special import levy was abolished.  As and from that date the income of the fund has been quite small.

      <P>I was just about to say that this section removes an anomaly and extends free depreciation in particular circumstances.  This is very desirable and will benefit taxpayers. It will not benefit those who are not paying taxpayers.  I earnestly urge the Minister to recollect by reference to his five year diaries, which he no doubt has near him, his observations on the 13th September, 1968, when Minister for Industry and Commerce, and he announced that provision would be introduced which would enable firms in the export business to roll up capital allowances.  The Minister could fault me as I have not got the reference.  The recommended provision would have enabled export companies to defer their tax claim through depreciation on plant and machinery for such number of years as would enable them to maximise the tax benefits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="466" /> I am not quite clear as to what extent we have surrendered our freedom, what transfer we have made to Brussels, how much freedom we have in this field.  I have gathered from my reading of the Protocol and my understanding of the situation that we have still got a good deal of freedom to assist our companies engaged in exports. The existing law means that the depreciation for plant and machinery which, in the case of buildings has a 40 year run, have got to be taken up in the years in which the profits in question arise.  If there is no taxation payable in respect of these profits because it is wholly export turnover, then there is the situation in which they are paying gross, as it were, for the plant machinery and getting no benefit and there is no financial incentive to get in more plant and machinery as there would be no tax benefit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a certain tax inducement apart from any grants if the products of the new plant and equipment are entirely tax-free.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is not a very logical man, if the Cathaoirleach will allow me tell him, and he knows very well that if there is that tax benefit, it flows from the export tax relief.  That is one consequence, so isolate it.  We are now talking about another tax incentive from having depreciation of plant and machinery.</P>
      <P>We cannot afford to go into this mêlée with anything other than all the arms and muscle we can get.  I do not mind who gets rich as a result.  Take the money from them when they have got it would be my attitude but in terms of the immediate beneficiary it is irrelevant to me.  We must strengthen our Irish industries to engage in the most strenuous competition with our opponents.  If you give this depreciation so that it is available on a roll-on basis, people will be encouraged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many firms are tapering-off from export relief.  Some of them have gone. There is an extension for new industries up to 1990.  It was an extension of ten years from what was in existence when the Minister made that statement. <Col N="467" /> I am anticipating anything he might feel like stating about that point.</P>
    <P>I have had an appointment made on the basis that they had to have it on a Monday rather than a Tuesday.  It was a very urgent matter to deal with a company's affairs in 1986.  It was so urgent I had to disorganise myself to meet their wishes.  The point I am making is that large companies like governments must think well ahead and they do.  It will affect the computer's response to the question as to whether or not they put in the plant and machinery and as to whether it is allowed against their tax in 1975, 1980, 1985, 1990 or whatever year they come into full tax charge.  It may be too much to expect the Minister to introduce this in July of this year but there is an important point here.  The Minister was correct in stating that in 1968.  I am not throwing this at him in any political way whatever.  I think in viewing it from his particular aspect at that time he saw the matter as I see it now and as he, too, should see it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to deal with a number of points raised by Senator FitzGerald.  He appeared to be arguing that for firms which are engaged 100 per cent in the export market and, therefore, are not subject at least for a long period, to any tax on their profits, should be given some special arrangement, whereby they can obtain the benefit of free depreciation, which they cannot claim at the moment if they are not liable for tax.  If this is what he meant, I would have grave doubts about that proposition.  Firms in that position are doing very well and are aware of the attractive nature of the proposition available to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I rather suspect he was more concerned with Irish firms who are engaged on the export market but also have a home market.  Some of them are coming to the end of their benefiting under the exports tax relief. Those firms have a sufficiently large operation on the home market to be able to benefit from whatever provisions we have in regard to free depreciation. I am mystified by the reference the Senator made to a statement <Col N="468" /> which he stated I made on the 13th September, 1968.</P>

      <P>As Minister for Industry and Commerce I would not have made any statement in regard to taxation matters unless it had been agreed and approved by the Government.  If I made such a statement it would be in operation but as the Senator seems to think it is not in operation, then he will find that the particular statement was not what it is alleged to be.  I will go back on the records and find just what I did say on the 13th September, 1968.</P>

      <P>I should be much obliged if the Minister does that. I only mentioned it because I was informed of it and as a reminder to the Minister of his previous thinking.  I would not tie him to it if he does not think the same way now.  We are all sensible men and we change our minds every day.  It is irrelevant if companies are doing well enough if they are exporting <Col N="469" /> all their turnover and getting tax-free.  We are not concerned to make them better off in that sense, we are simply concerned to get high exports.</P>
      <P>The individuals concerned can get taxed otherwise and I would be all for that.  The Minister was alert on the point.  It is not merely export industries which will be affected.  Some industries have got into a period of difficulty. Some industries may be in a loss-making situation for some years.  That loss-making situation may be the very one in which there should be a stimulus for investment in plant and machinery which, if I understand our law with regard to this, would not be tax-wise a benefit to them.  They may not get the depreciation available to them because it was not free.  I may be wrong but I should just like to direct the Minister's attention to this point.  The same thing arises with regard to industrial buildings.</P>

      <P>Purely for enlightenment, with particular reference to section 32, there has been a lot of chat about the repeal of section 21 of the Finance Act, 1965.  I have not followed the chat and do not know what it is about.  The position is that section 21 dealing with discretionary trusts continues right up to the point of the enactment of this Bill as an Act and catches the death of all persons whose death gives rise to a claim for duty.  It is then <i>instanter</i>, repealed so as to apply in relation to deaths immediately occurring after that instant in section 32 of this Bill when enacted. All the provisions which involve an extension of the tentacles of the Revenue which are contained in this Bill only affect deaths which occur after the enactment of this Bill, but do affect all instances which came into existence before it, or after it.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lalor) Patrick J. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lalor)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to confirm an order which I have made under the Restrictive Trade Practices Act, 1953, on the recommendation of the Fair Trade Commission relating to the supply and distribution of motor spirit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The commission's recommendation is contained in their report of a public inquiry which my predecessor requested following representations made to him by the Irish Motor Traders' Association (now the Society of the Irish Motor Industry) who wished to have restrictions applied to <Col N="476" /> growth in numbers of motor spirit retail outlets.</P>
    <P>A previous inquiry relating to motor spirit was carried out by the commission in 1961.  That inquiry was mainly concerned with the solus system&mdash;the system under which a retailer undertakes to handle one brand of motor spirit exclusively.  It was found that the system had certain advantages but that it should be subject to regulation because it encouraged an excessive increase in the number of outlets.  The then Minister for Industry and Commerce made an order in 1961 designed to regulate the system and the following year the commission agreed certain guiding principles with the petrol companies with the object of limiting the increase in number of retail outlets.</P>
    <P>The report of the recent inquiry states that the pattern of supply and distribution of motor spirit has not changed significantly since 1961. There are at present six companies supplying the market; only one of these is wholly in Irish control.  The three largest companies&mdash;Esso, Shell and Texaco&mdash;are subsidiaries of the companies which formed the consortium operating the Whitegate refinery; two others buy their requirements from these three and the sixth imports motor spirit.</P>
    <P>One trade association&mdash;The Society of the Irish Motor Industry&mdash;caters <i>inter alia</i> for the retail motor trade, including petrol retailing.  The society has two classes of members&mdash;wholesalers and retailers.  Distribution of motor spirit has become more efficient since 1961 by reason of such developments as increased tanker sizes, reduction of number of depots, round-the-clock operation of road tanker fleets and assistance to dealers to enable them to increase storage capacity, with the result that prices, exclusive of duty, are virtually unchanged.</P>
    <P>Altogether 25 witnesses were examined in the course of the inquiry. They included representatives of the Society of the Irish Motor Industry, the petrol companies, motor spirit retailers, the Private Motorists Protection Association, various public bodies and the Department of Local Government. <Col N="477" /> Growing control by the petrol companies of the retail trade through ownership of outlets is the salient fact to emerge from the inquiry.  While the total number of dealer outlets seemed to have stabilised itself between 1962 and the time of the inquiry in 1970, and to that extent the guiding principles which had been agreed with the petrol companies had been successful, the number of company-owned retail outlets had been increasing unduly and the proportion of total sales of motor spirit through these outlets had increased from 16 per cent to 31.1 per cent.</P>
    <P>The commission felt that if this trend were to continue unchecked the petrol companies would be likely to secure substantial control over retail distribution in the foreseeable future. Such control would introduce a degree of rigidity into the market which would be likely progressively to reduce competitive pressures and which would lend itself more readily to restrictive practices such as market sharing and pricing arrangements.  They considered, therefore, that the exigencies of the common good demanded that for a limited period these companies should neither purchase nor construct additional company-owned outlets.  They recommended that all the petrol companies be invited to observer this pause on a voluntary basis on the understanding that it would apply to newcomers as well as to existing companies but if they were not prepared to do this the pause should be statutorily imposed.  They also recommended that the maximum period of five years allowed for solus agreements under the 1961 Order should be increased to ten years because the five year limitation had proved self defeating in shifting the interest of the petrol companies away from dealers to the development of company-owned outlets.</P>
    <P>Additional recommendations were that the 1961 Order should be amended to prohibit any differentiation in the terms and conditions of supply of motor spirit between company-owned outlets and independent retailers; to extend the present obligation on the petrol companies to furnish <Col N="478" /> information in respect of their own outlets to include information on facilities afforded to independent retailers; and to modify the existing prohibition on price discrimination to allow a surcharge to be made by petrol companies to retailers in respect of deliveries below a specified minimum size.</P>
    <P>I accepted the recommendations of the commission and invited the petrol companies to observe a voluntary pause in the construction and acquisition of company-owned stations.  Some of the companies were not prepared to do this, however, as they felt that statutory control would be more effective and more equitable.  I, therefore, decided to make an order to give effect to the commission's recommendations and I informed the petrol companies accordingly.</P>
    <P>Subsequently these companies made representations to me about certain provisions of the proposed order. They asked for exemption from the prohibition on the construction or acquisition of new company-owned stations in certain cases where their arrangements had reached such an advanced stage that withdrawal would result in severe financial loss not only for them but also for independent dealers and other private interests who were involved.  I felt that in cases involving the construction of new stations the companies should be given a reasonable opportunity of completing their arrangements and I decided, therefore, that in such cases the order should not come into operation for four weeks after it was made.</P>
    <P>I was also asked to provide exemption where a company might dispose of a station and open up one in its place in another location, on the grounds that arrangements of this kind would not result in any increase in the overall number of company stations.  I was not disposed to accede to this request but I decided that exemption would be justified in any case where a station was opened up in place of one which had been compulsorily acquired by a local authority or bypassed by a new road, provided the new station was in the same locality. Objections were also made to the proposal <Col N="479" /> to allow petrol companies to levy a surcharge on deliveries below a specified minimum size on the grounds that such a surcharge would bear unfairly on remote areas of the country where the majority of dealers who take only small deliveries at a time are located.  I mentioned earlier in my speech that distribution of motor spirit had become more efficient in the last ten years.  One of the measures adopted by some of the companies in their efforts to achieve this efficiency was the withdrawal of supplies from retail outlets in certain cases where orders were so small as to make delivery uneconomic.</P>
    <P>I felt that while the sale of motor spirit might not provide any substantial income to operators of small outlets, particularly in remote areas, nevertheless, an outlet attached to a shop, hotel or public house, was a convenience for customers and it would be a good thing if the petrol companies could be induced to continue or to recommence supplying such outlets. The surcharge recommended by the commission would, it seemed to me, provide such an inducement and I decided, therefore, that it would, on balance, be unjustifiable that distributors should be prohibited by law from applying it, and the order provides accordingly.</P>
    <P>Representations were also made to me that newcomers to the petrol distributing trade would have no chance of getting a share of the market if they were precluded from constructing or otherwise acquiring company-owned outlets.  While I was not too happy with the situation where the scope for newcomers to enter the market was restricted I felt, nevertheless, that to allow them to develop company-owned outlets while prohibiting existing companies from doing likewise might constitute discrimination.  I also felt that newcomers could obtain a foothold in the market without necessarily constructing company stations or acquiring existing dealer stations.  For instance, a new company could buy sites for sale to dealers and could finance the construction of stations on those sites by dealers in return for <Col N="480" /> ten-year solus agreements, or dealers could be induced to sign solus agreements with a new company when their existing solus agreements with other companies came to an end.  In any event, if it were found at a later stage that a new company could not enter the market because of the order the position could be reviewed.</P>
    <P>In all the circumstances, I decided that the order should apply both to existing companies and any new companies that might enter the market.  On 15th June, 1972.  I made the Restrictive Trade Practices (Motor Spirit) Order, 1972, giving effect to the Fair Trade Commission's recommendations with the modifications I have already mentioned.  The prohibition under the order of the opening of new company-owned stations will remain in force for a period of three years and it is my intention to ask the commission to review the position before the end of that period.</P>
    <P>Orders of this kind do not have the force of law unless they are confirmed by Act of the Oireachtas.  The Bill now before the Dáil is the confirming Bill which is necessary to give the force of law to the order concerned.  With a Bill of this kind, the order which it is proposed to confirm may not be amended by the Oireachtas but must be accepted or rejected as it stands. The matters with which the order deals have been the subject of a detailed public inquiry by the Fair Trade Commission, and their report which was presented to this House sets out the arguments in favour of adopting the provisions embodied in the order.</P>
    <P>The Bill has already been welcomed in the Dáil and I can recommend it to the Seanad without reservation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I have very little to say on this Bill.  I take the opportunity to pay tribute to the very distinguished public servant, Mr. John Walsh, who was Chairman of the Fair Trade Commission and who addressed the Minister with this report.  The public really do not know how much they owe him and his like, who think in terms of the country's good, without regard to party or any other favour. In saying that I think I am echoing the views of others in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="481" /> I have read this report and, along with earlier reports of the commission, it has the mark of quality which particularly distinguishes it.  It gives me hope that, in so far as this field will be left to the Fair Trade Commission in the European Economic Community, it will be a well-conducted and administered field.  It is a matter that ought to have been dealt with earlier, and it should not have taken 13 months to get to this House.  The Minister made his order 12 months later.  I do not think that private citizens would have been allowed such a long time in which to do their business. This is a very comprehensive and excellent report on a very important matter and it is agreed that it must be considered, but should it need such consideration?  If injustice was being done, if inefficiency was there, it has been corrected&mdash;but it has been tolerated for longer than it ought to have been.</P>
    <P>Taking any view of modern life, the whole operation of the sale of motor spirits is important.  In Irish circumstances, apart from the convenience of life for all of us, our second biggest industry&mdash;the tourist industry&mdash;is involved and one cannot overrate its importance. I think that the Minister's recommendations are good and it is right that he should make this order. The object here is clearly to maintain the advantage which the Minister in his speech has properly drawn attention to.  It is to be recognised as a point in favour of what has been going on without control.  Petrol prices, exclusive of tax, have remained unchanged since 1962.  This is a remarkable thing and is a sign that the system is working very well.  It is running against the whole trend of petrol prices.</P>
    <P>While what the Minister's order proposes to enact is right, we ought to look at one aspect that did not appear to be covered by the commission's report. Through recognising the works of the company-operated stations, are we creating something similar to a publican's licence?  Are we conferring a value on the interests of the half-dozen companies mentioned in the Minister's speech?  Through time, these interests will be there to their advantage and <Col N="482" /> will be paid for effectively, as the price of a pub is paid for by the people who drink in it.  The price of the petrol station will be paid for in the price of the petrol.  I raise that question in a rather uninformed way.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to one or two other points.  One related to the order itself.  I think this is a wholly admirable procedure which we have under the Restrictive Trade Practices Act, 1953, whereby we have the report of the commission, and then an order. The order does not take the form of law until it is enacted.  I should like to ask the Minister if there is any precedent for it in Irish legislation.  There may be an answer that occurs immediately. If it does not, that is all right.</P>
    <P>Before I make my point on the order, I would be personally interested to know so that my file entitled &ldquo;Fair Trade Commission&rdquo; containing all the reports would be brought up to date. Is it possible for somebody to tell me how many reports have been published and how many orders have been made? I notice that this one is not numbered: it is just given the ordinary Statutory Instrument number, but it is not numbered as a series under the Act itself.</P>
    <P>I think I shall shortly shut up and end with this point, which worries me a little, regarding the intention of the order.  The definition of a company station will be very easy to get out of. A company station means a motor spirits station that is wholly or partly occupied by, or on behalf of, or by a person holding it, or the site upon which it is built, as tenant, lessee, licensee or in any other capacity, from a supplier, and so on.  I agree that we have a special definition for a holding company and a subsidiary, so that they take in cases where they are only one-fifth shareholders.  You could have a supplier, the shares in which were not held at all by the petrol company, but which were beneficially held by someone who was given a straight salary, being a preference dividend for holding them, and whose profits were under a contract to another company siphoned off to the real supplier, who would not be a supplier for the purposes of the company operating definition. The shares of the company would <Col N="483" /> be subject to a voting contract which would require the shareholder to vote in accordance with and subject to the bidding of the ultimate petrol company. We are baring our teeth and we do not have enough teeth.  If we know what we are talking about when we speak of these whales, we really must have a lot of teeth.  If you really want to control the petrol companies, you have got to get very precise and exacting legislation to deal with them.  We are talking about some of the most powerful capitalist operators in the whole business.  In the definitions here, I am assuming that the intention is desirable to realise and achieve this and to put these controls on.  You have got to go further if you are definitely going to make them effective.</P>

      <P>I would like to welcome the order and refer to one particular aspect of it.  The Minister referred to deliveries to rural areas which would not be economic.  It is important from a social and tourist point of view in the outline areas where there are small outlets.  Perhaps those attached, as the Minister has said, to shops, hotels or public houses, should be supplied.  I would be interested to learn from the Minister whether the surcharge, to which he refers, can be determined by him or by the suppliers. This would be an important aspect. Occasionally one comes across a situation in a rural area where you stop for petrol and are told: &ldquo;The tanker did not arrive yet.&rdquo;  It is important from that aspect that the Minister should be satisfied that these outlets will be supplied. The Minister should be the decider with regard to the level of a surcharge in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. J. Fitzgerald Mr. J. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to welcome this Bill.  Between 1962 and the time of the inquiry in 1970, the companies increased their ownership of the retail outlets from 16 per cent to 31.1 per cent, which means that the six companies which are referred to in the Minister's introductory speech, control practically one-third of the petrol retail outlets in this country.  Are we reaching the stage where it will be almost impossible for a private individual <Col N="484" /> to be allowed open a filling station in any part of the country.  I know that the Department of Local Government enter into this because you have to get planning permission.  We know that for a number of years big deals were done in areas where petrol companies came to people who had suitable sites to open up filling stations.  They were given big prices for sites and big concessions to get in on that particular location and open filling stations.  There is great difficulty in getting planning permission to open filling stations especially on arterial roads.  In my county it is an impossibility.  We could agree that the main roads are self-sufficient as far as retail filling stations are concerned.</P>
      <P>It appears that if there is to be any increase in the number of filling stations they will only be on county roads.  I cannot see any great rush by the petrol companies or private individuals to open up retail outlets on county roads because there is neither the traffic nor the demand for petrol on those roads that you are likely to get on the arterial roads.</P>
      <P>Senator Brugha mentioned the surcharge. While none of us like discrimination, the Minister was wise in acceding to that request to ensure that retailers in uneconomic parts of the country could be assured of having their demands for petrol catered for. I do not know if it is in operation yet, but in the past if you went outside the Dublin zone you paid 1d per gallon more for petrol.  I presume that they were operating the surcharge at that time and it might be no harm if the Minister kept an eye on what the surcharge was likely to be.  The retailer was then passing it on to the motorist. I presume that this surcharge may be passed on in the same way.  I welcome the Bill.  The fact that we will have to stabilise the retail outlets at their present number, means they will become, like the public house licences, very valuable indeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCrinion" hpid="Mr. Crinion Mr. Crinion">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, would like to welcome this Bill.  With this sudden increase over a few years from 16 per cent to 31 per cent, where companies controlled the outlets, it was significant that they would take complete <Col N="485" /> control of them.  I would like the Minister to keep an eye on it because at present if a person wants to open a filling station the company comes completely behind him.  They make out the drawing, tell him the amount of money he can have and the facilities they will give him.  It would not take much more for them to actually take control of it, possibly under a different name than the wholly-owned ones.  In that respect I would like to see a certain check being kept on the private sites.  The Department of Local Government will have a certain amount of control, with regard to the opening up of new filling stations, because planning permission is very hard to get. With so many different variations of petrol, the companies should put up the octane rating on each pump.  I feel that there is often a little bit of blending by the man who wants to keep his price 1p per gallon lower than the fellow at the other end of the town.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">
      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this order. It is doing some important things, but I feel it should have gone further. Before I discuss the extensions which I feel should have been made, I would like, with Senator FitzGerald, to compliment the people who produced the Fair Trade Commission reports. As a public representative, I get numerous reports through the post.  I do not read all of them but those I do read impress me very much. Public servants, not necessarily civil servants, are putting in a great deal of time and are doing a most important job in producing these reports.  It is well worth implementing as it is implemented in the order before us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are at present six companies supplying the market.  Only one of these is wholly in Irish control.  This is a natural situation in that there is no petrol to be found in this country as a mineral, so we must buy our petrol from overseas.  As the Minister has stated, the large companies are subsidiaries of companies which are part of international companies.  The refining for Esso, Shell and Texaco is done in Whitegate so some of the operation of bringing the petrol into a form in which it can be supplied to <Col N="486" /> the motorist is carried out in this country.</P>
    <P>It is a worrying feature in a situation like this that the companies outside Irish control during a crisis or an international situation in which the Middle East is closed down as far as petrol supplies are concerned, or if we do not get petrol from America, Ireland will come off worst of all the countries who are being supplied by such international consortia.</P>
    <P>The number of company-owned retail outlets has been increasing and the proportion has gone from 16 per cent to 31 per cent.  This does not deal with the wholesale outlets but these petrol companies would not be in the business unless it was paying them and clearly they are making more money by increasing the retail outlets and they are getting more control over the trade in this country. This is a bad thing and I, therefore, support the broad principle outlined in this order.</P>
    <P>When a company of the size of those mentioned here is in the business which we are discussing, they are in it to make money.  We must apply controls before we let a company, especially one which is foreign-based, make considerable sums of money at our expense.  We must apply the controls which are necessary to make this country one which we can live in.  The extent to which the motorcar is dominating the human being worries me.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated in his speech that the companies were recommended to observe a pause on a voluntary basis.  The capitalist system being what it is, the chances of companies observing pauses on a voluntary basis is fairly small and the Minister states that some of the companies were not prepared to do this as they felt that statutory control would be more effective and equitable.</P>
    <P>I wonder what is behind a statement such as this.  There must be a fair amount of bargaining and discussion but in many of these cases, statutory control will be required before commercial enterprises conform to the standards which we require and which we will continue to require.  It is one <Col N="487" /> of the sad but salutary facts of life. We should not be slow in making orders such as this to control commercial enterprises which are there with one aim in view and which do not take any of the other facts into consideration which the average citizen might take.</P>
    <P>One of these facts is the contribution to pollution which motor spirit makes through exhaust fumes.  I spent a year in Los Angeles, California, and one of the sad things about society there was that whenever you came over the hill into the city of Los Angeles, it was covered by a black-brown cloud which was pollution, a great deal of which came from motor fumes.  I noticed coming into Dublin Bay recently, a similar black cloud hanging over the city.  Much of this pollution can be avoided if control of the quality and type of spirits supplied is exercised rigorously.  This control should be statutory.  We must face this as we become more mechanised and more industrialised.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>May I interrupt the Senator for a moment.  I do not think that controls of this kind could be brought in under the Restrictive Trade Practices Acts.  We are dealing with trade practices and not with the quality of petrol and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>No, that could relate to a variety of other Acts but this Bill is severely limited to restrictive trade practices.  Practices, not quality.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">
      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>I can see that restrictive trade practices is a narrow subject but restrictive trade practices could take into account the actual quality.  Senator Crinion mentioned the octane of the petrol supply.  This is following the same sort of line.  The quality of the petrol is very important.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>There are many things the Chair would agree with, but that does not make them relevant under this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">
      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>I will move from this point.  Senator Fitzgerald mentioned the situation regarding the setting up of petrol pumps.  This is becoming similar to that requiring a licence to sell alcohol.  The quality there is tightly controlled and the Minister should do whatever he can to control the quality of the petrol we buy.  The number of outlets which belong to the large wholesale companies should be restricted.  It is not a good thing if they obtain control of all the outlets.  The number they have is too high at the moment.</P>
      <P>I agree with other Senators in their support of the Minister to disallow levies on petrol supplied in remote areas.  The petrol companies are making large profits.  A great deal of the money is going abroad and the least we can do in setting our standards and putting on our controls is to ensure that petrol is supplied to the retailers and to the public at a uniform price no matter what the size of the outlet or in what part of the country it is situated.  That is tremendously important. It is another step in ensuring that the remote areas in the south, west or north-west are not discriminated against by commercial enterprises whose sole aim is to make a profit.</P>
      <P>If we have a system in which we are dealing with such commercial enterprises we have got to be prepared to put statutory controls on them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome this order.  The Minister could have gone further.  We will need to face up to the fact that if we are to construct a reasonable society for the majority of the citizens we will need controls of this nature.  We will need to examine very carefully the recommendations of the Fair Trade Commission.  I welcome this effort which the Minister has made to get some uniformity and to enforce some semblance of order and fairness into <Col N="489" /> the situation as far as petrol outlets are concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Very briefly I should like to welcome the Bill and the aim behind it in preventing this extension of the danger of monopoly. The fact that the growth has doubled from 16 to 30 per cent in eight years is highly significant.  I am not happy about the position of levy.  The Minister has made the case that firms have cut off supplies to those areas on the grounds that they were uneconomic. I hope that the Minister will aid the development of co-operative buying between private retailers.  This could give them a buying power that would be helpful.  I hope none of the restrictions imposed on take-overs or the erection of new stations will in any way inhibit the co-operative development or running of retail outlets such as has been done by the grocery and allied trades as their answer to the influx of monopolies.</P>
      <P>It is very opportune to restrict the development of new stations.  This has to be paid for in the long-term by the community largely by forcing some of their competitors to close or reducing their sales in the neighbouring areas.  I hope this principle can be applied in other fields by the Minister.  Large stores can only prosper and make money if they succeed in putting many existing establishments, that are doing a good job but cannot withstand the competition of the modern chain store, out of business. The chain store wins and eventually the consumer has to pay for it.</P>
      <P>We should keep a close look at motor spirits.  The rate of increase there must average at least 7 or 8 per cent per annum which means a doubling over ten years.  It is a region where a detailed cost benefit analysis on a regional basis can be done.  The Minister could invoke his powers here.  The 30 per cent monopoly is held by the three large companies who are themselves subsidiaries of the consortium. In the days ahead with so many amalgamations taking place are we going to find that those three companies have amalgamated into one company?  Then we would have one company controlling the total.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="490" /> Under EEC conditions I understand that importers of motor spirits will be allowed equal competition facilities with those produced at home.  I hope that the home-produced petrol will keep its hold on the market.  The Whitegate refinery is making a significant contribution in giving employment. While we want to keep monopolies in their place, on the other hand, we also want to get the benefits which such large-scale operations can confer. We cannot afford two oil refineries. With these reservations I welcome the order and hope the Minister will implement it to ensure that co-operation between those outside the group that he seeks to control is encouraged.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister if there is anything in this order which will restrict a private individual from applying for an agency and setting up a petrol filling station. There would seem to be a sufficient number of stations throughout the country.  Where there are too many of them, the tendency is that they are reluctant to give service late at night.  I would like to see the Minister taking a special interest in the other kinds of propellants such as gas or electricity in an effort to encourage clean air and a clean environment.  While it does not come under this Bill it is something we should strive for.  With those few words, I welcome the order.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lalor)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill was welcomed in the Dáil and in general it has been welcomed in the Seanad.  Some questions were raised with which I am quite happy to deal.  There may have been some misconceptions and I should like to start with those.  Senator Jack Fitzgerald and Senator McDonald raised the question as to whether or not this prevented private filling stations from being created.  It does not.  It specifically spells out and prevents, for a three year period, the erection of company-owned filling stations and the taking over of a privately-owned filling station by a company.  As I said in my opening remarks, the report forwarded to me by the Fair Trade Commission indicated that there had been an increase from 16 to 31.1 per cent in <Col N="491" /> the through-put of petrol in private-owned filling stations and that this had arisen possibly on the one hand by reason of the fact that it was more attractive from the company's point of view and on the other hand that the five-year Solus term was not adequate. That is why it is extended from five to ten years.</P>
      <P>Senator West, unfortunately, complimented me on bringing in an order to do something which is the opposite of the intention of the order.  There were a few remarks on this and it might be as well for me to clear these up.</P>
      <P>Senator Alexis FitzGerald noted that I had said in my opening remarks that, arising from the more efficient distribution methods operated by the petrol distributors which in its own way cut down overheads to a great extent, the wholesale price of motor spirit in December, 1970, was virtually at the same level as that which obtained in 1962.  This has been brought about by more efficient distribution.  Part and parcel of this distribution operation was a decision by the companies to limit the drop.  I do not know what the figure is, but I think it is 1,000 gallons.  This brought about the type of situation of the small operator anywhere&mdash;with a capacity, maybe, for only 500 gallons in his tank&mdash;being told by the company, &ldquo;I am afraid we cannot supply you with petrol unless you put in a 1,000-gallon tank.&rdquo; In order to enable that type of person to be supplied now, or to enable the companies to go back to him again and say &ldquo;Now we can give you 500 gallons, but you must pay an extra ½p per gallon,&rdquo; the order provides for an additional exception which permits wholesalers to make a surcharge to retailers in the case of any single delivery.</P>
      <P>The manner in which I have presented it may have given the impression that it was a straightforward single price; and, with this exception, it is a single price throughout the country. The price of petrol from wholesaler to dealer is the same price across the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Quinlan asked could we get <Col N="492" /> over this by allowing a sort of a co-operative movement.  I am thinking of the danger we had in the retail distribution field where the big fellow moves in and pushes out the small fellow.  It would be ideal if in the normal run of consumer items we could have the type of arrangement where there is a straightforward flat price across the country, where the wholesaler and supplier can sell everything at one price, and then we would not have this divergence of prices achieved through the bulk purchasing the big fellow is able to do as against the small fellow.  I do not think that would work in the normal run of manufacturing industry.</P>
    <P>In this petrol field we have the situation whereby the man in the far end of Donegal or in Kerry can buy his petrol at exactly the same price as the man in Dublin.  This is an ideal arrangement and it is operated in the most efficient manner by the much maligned wholesaler or distributor at a more economic level than he was doing it way back in 1962.  This is a tribute to the overall general efficiency of this company.</P>
    <P>Senator Jack Fitzgerald and Senator McDonald made a few remarks which I would like to comment on.  It would be very wrong if the impression were created through publicity given to this Bill that as from today no further petrol filling stations can be erected. This is not so.  Certainly no more petrol filling stations for the next three years can be erected or taken over by companies.</P>
    <P>Senator Alexis FitzGerald was rather worried about the definition of a company station.  He mentioned that, if he had a criticism to make on the Bill, it was the fact of its being so late in being introduced.  One of the contributing factors to this was my endeavour to ensure that the parliamentary draftsmen would try to make as wide as possible a definition of a company station in order to avoid the loopholes the Senator mentioned.</P>
    <P>The delay in introducing legislation was anticipated by the chairman so justifiably complimented by the Senator.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="493" /> The report, at paragraph 158, page 56, says:</P>
    <P>In the event that the pause is a voluntary one, we recommend that it should apply for a term of two years from the date of publication and the report of the inquiry.  If the pause has to be imposed on a statutory basis, this would involve a certain delay in its implementation which would afford an opportunity to petrol companies to purchase or build additional outlets.</P>
    <P>This was anticipated by them, and it goes on to recommend a voluntary basis of two years, a statutory basis of three years, in order to make up for any damage that would be done arising from the negotiations that would have had to be put in train.</P>
    <P>In the Dáil allegations were made about some companies that had &ldquo;jumped the gun&rdquo; in this regard and seemed to have got some inside information that this order was going to be made.  All the petrol companies would have had the fullest information about this because the report was placed before the House and became general property.</P>
    <P>The officials of my Department and myself made the effort to try and arrange this voluntary standstill. Somebody questioned the reasons why the petrol companies were not willing to enter the voluntary agreement. They were fearful of the fact that any new company would not feel tied to the voluntary arrangement to which they would not have to subscribe. They would be more certain of success if it became a statutory restraint.</P>
    <P>Senator Alexis FitzGerald wanted to know if we were applying a value on a company-owned station and the possibility of it becoming as valuable as a licensed premises.  If there is no restriction against the private individual, apart from the planning restrictions, from within my Department to erecting a petrol filling station, the question of the company-owned station becoming valuable does not arise.  We have not had any occasions yet where the companies have been endeavouring to sell their sites.  They need somebody to operate their <Col N="494" /> station and, depending on their turnover, the manager is paid a figure based on that amount.</P>
    <P>Senator Alexis FitzGerald also wanted to know how many orders there had been.  There have been 15 orders.  Two of these 15 orders were amendment orders.  It is quite possible something may have been wrong with the original order and an amendment order was introduced subsequently. Effectively then, there would have been 13 orders arising from a fair trade investigation.</P>
    <P>Senator Alexis FitzGerald wanted to know&mdash;in relation to Article 4&mdash; if we were baring our teeth and it might transpire that we had not enough teeth.  My understanding of the definition of company station is such that I feel we have teeth to bare in this regard.</P>
    <P>Senator Ruairí Brugha realised that the surcharge on petrol in isolated areas might have the effect of people not getting petrol.  He quoted the case of calling to the petrol station in the country and being told that the tanker did not arrive.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiBrugha" hpid="Ruairí Brugha Ruairí Brugha">

      <P>I did not mean that. I meant that it was justifying the surcharge so that there would be petrol.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>There is the problem where, if the tank holds only 1,000 gallons and the minimum drop is 1,000 gallons, there will be a gap between the time when the person empties the tank and the refill arrives. The only solution to that is to get planning permission to put in another tank.</P>

      <P>As set out in the order, it must be reasonable&mdash;provided that the surcharge is reasonable and justifiable, having regard to the cost of such deliveries.  Under the Prices Bill, which I hope to get through the House next week, I would have the power arising from any recommendations made to me by the National Prices Commission in this regard.</P>

      <P>One gets it one way or the other.  Senator Crinion mentioned the point&mdash;also referred to by Senator West&mdash;of the obligation of indicating the octane value on each pump.  I have not power at the present time to enforce this requirement.  I hope to have the power in the future for this type of requirement under the consumer protection legislation which I am preparing at the moment.  The problem of pollution might be a matter for another Minister.</P>
