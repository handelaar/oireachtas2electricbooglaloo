      <P>I thought that accidentally it was fixed for the Thursday. It would seem more suitable to be taken on the Wednesday.  That is the reason I raised the point.  The Chair says I am right that it was ordered for Thursday.  I wonder if we could rearrange that by agreement now?</P>

      <P>If the Leader of the House considers that we should meet next week it is open to us to discharge the order taking the Marriages Bill, 1972, next Thursday and fixing it instead for next Wednesday.  If the Seanad decides not to meet next Wednesday there is no harm done.  We can carry it over to the following week.</P>

      <P>It is certainly not intended that the Seanad should meet next Thursday.  I doubt if it will be feasible to meet next Wednesday. Therefore I suggested that the Marriages Bill, 1972, need not be taken next week.  It could be taken on the next sitting day.</P>

    <P>Section 1 agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 2</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 2 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to repeat what I said on the Second Reading of the Bill with regard to the manner in which this new system of law is being received into our legal system here without any attempt being made in the instrument enacting it to harmonise the existing provisions of the domestic law, where they have to be harmonised, with the new code of law.  The United Kingdom, when enacting similar legislation, set out the whole schedule of enactments which were amended by the Act receiving into British law the Community law. The Act itself contains a number of sections, one at least of which should be repeated by a similar type of section in this Bill.  That section clearly sets out in relation to companies the means by which the first directive on <Col N="1001" /> company law is to be complied with and amends British legislation to the extent required for compliance with that directive.  That is section 9 of the European Communities Act.</P>
      <P>Section 10 makes a similar amendment to the Restrictive Trade Practices Act.  I presume an examination has been made with regard to the Restrictive Trade Practices Act and a series of Acts which were enacted pursuant to the principal Act, to see to what extent, if any, it is necessary to have a formal amendment.  All that has happened is that Senators have been circulated with a memorandum setting out, in a way which is declared to be not exhaustive, the legislation which it is thought will be affected by the reception into our system of this new law.  Why has it not been possible for our Government to provide us with the legislation with which the British Parliament has been provided, showing the actual effect on existing legislation of the law which we are now receiving into our system?  Why do we not have this for the assistance of the countless business enterprises which will be affected in their obligations as of and from 1st January next?  Why are we not told, today, and not by virtue of some ministerial order to be made before the 1st January next, what precise means it has been decided should be adopted to achieve the objective of the first directive?</P>
      <P>It is not necessary to follow the same means which the British have followed. Maybe it would be easier, if we wanted to take an easy way out, to draft, for the Report Stage, a parallel to what the British have done.  They need not have followed the course they did.  There has been debate within the profession in England as to whether they have been unwise in what they have done and in adopting the precise method they have adopted.  It is important, in regard to such a matter which affects the competitive position of Irish business enterprises that they should know what is the Government's view and that we should have an opportunity of saying whether we think the Government's view is right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suspect that the reason why we have been merely told of the legislation <Col N="1002" /> which it is thought is affected and have not been provided with a schedule of the actual nature of the amendments is that there was a possibility of an omission.  But can we not have a catch-all subsection to deal with any omission?  Let the omission be dealt with by ministerial regulation and the known affected amendments be dealt with in a schedule to this Bill.</P>
    <P>It will be extremely difficult for people to know what their rights and obligations are.  It will be extremely difficult for people trained in one legal system to advise us as to the meaning and significance of language coming from the minds of people trained in another legal system.  It will be very difficult to harmonise these two groups.  We ought to have a decision by the Government presented to the Legislature, a debate on that decision and a measure adopted. I understand that there will be regulations and then we will have Acts enacting these regulations.  I presume we will be able to table amendments to the regulations which will be the matter of enactment at that time.</P>
    <P>I should like to know if I am correct in understanding that that is the position. It is a less desirable position than the one we would be in today if we had before us all the proposed amendments, because, as and from the 1st January, we will be able to see if they are in the form we think best.  Whereas the regulation which the Minister will make under the appropriate section of this Bill will have force and effect from the time of his making it and will not depend during its lifetime, prior to the enactment, for its validity during that time, we may have a curious situation in which a ministerial regulation under this Bill will be operative for a time and then may be amended by virtue of a debate in this House or in Dáil Éireann. I know someone objected to some other Senator saying that the Minister's Department had not done their homework. I do not wish to use any particular phrase with regard to this matter. The amount of homework they have chosen to publish is before us.  It is patent to me that, with the 1st January coming so quickly, they must have done a great deal more homework than that and that there must be a set <Col N="1003" /> of regulations being drafted in a whole series of Departments.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate for Irish business houses and Irish lawyers that they are not given the same assistance here by this administration and through the processes of this Parliament as their British counterparts are given by the decision of the British Government and administration and the debates which took place on these very amendments in the European Communities Bill.  I should like to repeat in this way what I have already said on Second Reading.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The kind of ideal which Senator Alexis FitzGerald has in mind might be possible in some of the European countries where they rely almost entirely on statute law, and where that statute law is consolidated regularly.  It would be impossible to achieve a situation in this country where any law passed by the Government at the pesent time would show exactly what the law of this country was as affected by the regulations and so on of the EEC.  Even at the present time laws passed here, although they usually attempt to show how they affect previous legislation, do not always do so.  We are never quite sure what the law is on any particular subject because the laws do not relate back with complete efficiency and because previous Acts are very often affected by decisions of the courts.  Consequently, there is no certainty about the law in this country, which is why lawyers make a living to a great extent.  It would be quite unrealistic to expect anything to be done at the present time which would show us exactly how we will be affected by the regulations and directives which have been passed by the European Community since its inception.  I agree with Senator Alexis FitzGerald that this would be a desirable situation.  I hope that the laws of this country which are affected by EEC directives and regulations will be amended and brought up-to-date in the light of these directives as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When that is being done we should <Col N="1004" /> also make an attempt, which I have on many previous occasions asked Ministers to do, to consolidate the law on a particular subject, to bring all the previous law up-to-date and incorporate it in one consolidated Act.  This has been done on a few occasions only.  It is practised very widely in some European countries and goes a long way to enable both the lawyer and the citizen to know what the law is on a particular point. Having regard to the present situation in this country and to the fact that the law is not certain in most cases, having regard to the fact that even statute law is very often affected by decisions of the courts and amended or qualified in that way, it would be impossible to bring in any Act at present which would give any certainty.</P>
    <P>Having spelled out those difficulties and the physical difficulties of bringing in the type of Act which Senator FitzGerald suggests, I would not wish to be taken as saying that I would not like the Minister and the Government to do everything possible to bring laws up to date and to enact or amend laws so as to take cognisance of the directives of the EEC.  I hope this will be done as soon as possible but, from a realistic point of view, I feel it will take some time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to make a song and dance about this, but the reason I think it important is that we are setting the pattern for our future operations with regard to the reception of European Community law.  I cannot agree with Senator Ryan, despite his eminence and his membership of a superior body to my own in this field, that the law is not certain.  It is ascertainable.  You cannot regard a court as doing anything more than determining what is the meaning of what we enact.  I agree with him that the procedures we have allowed develop over the years are not good and are capable of being changed.  I agree with him completely with regard to the importance of codifying to the extent that is possible, because one knows that the Minister's adviser will have a file with the original Bill amended to take account <Col N="1005" /> of what subsequent legislation has done.  We know there is and must be a document on which the advice the Minister is getting can be drawn out without having documents placed all over the floor, which is the ludicrous position at present.  In fact, in one of the Rent Restriction Acts they did something which was most helpful. They put into a schedule the effect on the Principal Act of the amendment effected by that Act.  As a result, unfortunate solicitors can begin to think about it because they are actually looking at the effect of the amendment and can read it in one piece. They do not have to go from one document to another fearing that, with the intervening telephone calls, they may have missed something.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is one of the rare ones.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and we should have much more of it.  I think it important that the Legislature speak out on this.  I should like Senator Ryan to tell us why we could not have had a measure such as the one I am going to read out.</P>
      <P>The enactments mentioned in Schedule 3 to this Act, being enactments that are superseded, or to be superseded, by reason of Community obligations and the provisions made by this Act in relation thereto, or are not compatible with Community obligations are hereby repealed to the extent specified in column 3 of the Schedule with effect from the entry date or other date mentioned in the Schedule.</P>
      <P>Why could we not have something along those lines?  If it was possible for the British Ministry why has it not been possible for the Irish Ministry? If you are a British lawyer you just have to turn to the schedule.  You can take the original in pieces and you can, and are told to, amend it by reference to the schedule.  There will have to be a series of orders and regulations in relation to future directives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not quite clear on one point and perhaps the Minister could help me.  With regard to the whole existing code of law, is it proposed to make <Col N="1006" /> ministerial orders which will spell out the effects of the reception of regulations, directives and decisions on our law?  When the Minister is dealing with the section perhaps he could clarify that point.  I do not know whether existing laws are to be dealt with in that way or whether that is to be left in limbo.  If that is the position we are going to find ourselves in a worse situation than British people, who have had it done for them.</P>
    <P>With regard to the European directive on company law, there will be an obligation on this country from 1st January next.  In Britain the means by which the objective of the directive was to be attained has already been enacted and will take effect on 1st January.  Are we to have an order on this and, if we are to have an order, could it not be a section in this Bill instead of being an order to be made in the future?  It is a very important matter and affects the vast majority of our business enterprises.  The case is similar in the restrictive practices code which I would find very difficult to adapt to this new code.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr. Hillery) Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr. Hillery)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr. Hillery)</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a Bill of principle.  In relation to the two matters raised by Senator FitzGerald with regard to company law and restrictive practices, there will be amending legislation, probably by delegated legislation, which will spell out what the Senator has in mind.  It will be done by ministerial regulation and not in this Bill of principle.  Ministerial regulations will be drawn up to implement directives of the Community.  Each ministerial regulation will make it quite clear what legislation is being amended by it, and to what extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where we differ from what was done in Britain is in terms of European Community regulations which are directly applicable.  Being directly applicable and bringing them into our law the principle or practice of implied repeal functions and the Community legislation would be binding and have precedence over any legislation in our own law before that.  The repeal is implied.  The point at issue then is: why did we not spell this out? <Col N="1007" /> It is a matter on which we differ, whether it is desirable or not.  Both in Britain and here a list was compiled and it is quite clear to all Departments who had to work on the list that they could not say that the list is complete.  All they could say is that this list is a list of the legislation affected.  After that, research by the people concerned will find out in what way it is affected.</P>
    <P>It was thought undesirable to repeal a list which was incomplete.  People may feel that what is not repealed specifically and in statute form is not affected by Community legislation. This would be misleading, so it was decided to present the list.  The point also arose that the extent of the conflict, and therefore of the implied repeal, would not always be clear and would be a matter for definition by the European courts.</P>
    <P>It was therefore thought desirable to indicate to those who will be concerned the legislation which we know will be affected, and to let those who are interested in specific areas find the extent to which it is repealed.  It may not be possible to determine that without going to the courts, but certainly we felt it undesirable to present a list of repealed legislation because it would be incomplete and misleading.  From listening to the people who have much more acquaintance with the law than I have, a good case has been made for changing our code.  A case has been made for frequent statutory revision and the Taoiseach promised this when he was speaking in the Dáil.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is stated in the memorandum that the list is comprehensive but not exhaustive.  This suggests that the various Departments within the next few months may come across further instances where laws are affected by EEC regulations, even up-to-date regulations.  Is there any provision being made whereby the Houses of the Oireachtas and the public generally could be informed of subsequent effects on legislation which may be discovered within the next year or so?</P>

      <P>Any time anybody explains anything at length it confuses matters by use of the wrong word in the wrong case.  As we discover what is affected it will be our duty to make it clear.  In the Dáil I said that the State Departments would help people to find their way through the mass of documents at the beginning. After that I will see what can be done by the Government to publish a further list.</P>

It is entirely unsatisfactory that we find ourselves in this position.</P>

      <P>In reply to the Senator's point, there was a certain delay due to a problem with the printers in getting out the debates for the two days last week.  They are now available.

      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 3.</P>
      <P>Government amendment No. a.1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 3, after subsection (2), to insert the following subsection:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1009" />&ldquo;(3)  Regulations under this section shall not create an indictable offence&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>Suggestions were made on Second Stage and in the Dáil that there should be certain limitations on the power to make regulations.  Even though it is quite illogical to adopt any of them because the principle of the Bill is that a regulation has to be confirmed by legislation, that is, by both Houses of the Oireachtas&mdash;it will lapse if this is not done&mdash;at the same time, the power of making a new criminal offence should be limited; and this in relation to the penalty that it should be possible to impose by regulation.  I therefore put to the House this amendment confining the offences which may be created in the first instance by ministerial regulation to those that cannot be tried on indictment&mdash;in other words, to confine it to summary offences dealt with by the District Court and excluding offences tried by judge and jury, so that the offence created by regulation could not carry any greater penalty than could be imposed by the District Court.</P>
      <P>This amendment does no more than to make it necessary for indictable offences to have legislation in the first instance.  If we did not have the amendment you would have to have legislation anyway, which would be after a lapse of up to six months after the regulation was made.  Having heard the debate in both Houses I became convinced that it was desirable to have it there and I recommended this amendment to the House, although it may appear illogical.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Even with the ministerial amendment, I do not feel happy about section 3, for the reasons I gave on the Second Stage.  I do not feel happy that the two Houses of Parliament should, in the manner in which it is proposed in this Bill, hand over virtually complete power to members of the Government to legislate by ministerial order.  There is some semblance of protection or some modification in the position arising now out of the amendment which the Minister is proposing in that it is now being spelled <Col N="1010" /> out that regulations to be made under this section shall not create an indictable offence.</P>
      <P>At the same time, we should consider what we are doing in this section. We are vesting in Government Ministers the power to make regulations which will have the force and effect of law by giving them power to make regulations which may contain incidental supplementary and consequential provisions as appear necessary to the Minister making the regulations.  Without any check, let or hindrance whatever, it depends entirely on the mind of the Minister for the time being and possibly on the mood of the Minister for the time being as to whether a matter is to be regarded as necessary.</P>
      <P>I would feel happier if there was some adequate safeguard in this Bill which&mdash;to use an expression that I think was used by the Minister on the Second Reading&mdash;would involve the Dáil and the Seanad in legislation which, by the conduit pipe of ministerial regulations, would have the force of law in this country.  As it stands, I do not think the Bill involves either the Dáil or the Seanad sufficiently.  It does not provide reasonable safeguards or checks on the mind or mood of the Minister for the time being in relation to regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NevilleKeery" hpid="Mr. Keery Mr. Keery">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keery</NameTxt>
      <P>I mentioned on Second Stage that I did not see the weight of Senator O'Higgins's argument and I felt it had been adequately dealt with in the debate in another place.  I should like to reiterate one of the points made there which seems to me to be extremely important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The impression given was that the making of regulations arising under this legislation would not be subject to the normal procedures of the Oireachtas and would not be subject to questions and possible motions.  It goes without saying that the conventional use of the Houses of the Oireachtas as a means of scrutinising delegated legislation made under this section is there, and of itself is an adequate safeguard. This section has been mentioned in a debate and in a newsletter published by the Irish Council of the European <Col N="1011" /> Movement.  The type of criticism made by Senator O'Higgins is repeated in this newsletter.  It was also stated in a newspaper article and it was implied that because someone, like myself, for example, was a member of this council therefore we stood over the type of criticism found in this newsletter, issued by the Irish Council of the European Movement, dated Friday, 17th November, In other words, it was implied there that I would stand over the type of criticism made by Senator O'Higgins.  That is not the case.  I should like to make that clear for the reasons I have given in this debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to be able to follow Senator Keery's reasoning on this.  It does not seem to me that he is correct, but I should like to follow him on this if he is correct.</P>
      <P>He said it is wrong to argue that regulations made under this section would not be subject to the conventional procedures in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Did I understand him correctly? It appears to me that the making of regulations under this subsection is not subject to what I would regard as the conventional procedures. The whole concept of the Government choosing to act by means of ministerial edict rather than by ordinary legislation seems to me to run entirely counter to conventional procedure.  Surely the conventional procedure in any parliamentary democracy is that, where it is feasible to do so and where there is no particularly pressing reason against doing so, any act which is to have the force of legislation should be introduced in the ordinary way as legislation introduced as a Bill initiated either in this House or the other House of the Oireachtas.  That is the conventional procedure.</P>

    <P>When we were discussing the terms of the Referendum Bill I said that my quarrel was that the Government had deliberately chosen, by means of section 3, to give pre-eminence to the question of ministerial order.  The Minister made the point on Second Reading that the Government are not stopped from this section from proceeding by means of the conventional procedure initiating a Bill in the Dáil <Col N="1012" /> or Seanad.  They have not given up their right, entitlement and power to do that.  They are giving more than a broad him that they have not the slightest intention of introducing legislation in the ordinary way.  They are taking power under section 3 to bring in any of these bits of law which are to operate here and which are necessitated by the obligations of EEC membership.  They are to do that by means of ministerial order.</P>
    <P>If it were done by the conventional procedure of legislation in this House or in the Dáil the position would be that Senators and Deputies would have an opportunity of examining as to whether the legislation was necessitated by the obligations of membership of the Communities.  When it is done by ministerial order Deputies and Senators have no opportunity of examining that aspect of the matter.  Under section 4, the regulations will have statutory effect and, unless they are confirmed, they are spent after a particular time.  When they are made they have statutory effect without any Member of this House or the Dáil, apart from the Minister making the regulation, having had an opportunity of forming a view as to whether what is being done is necessitated by the obligations of membership.  If it is not necessitated by the obligations of membership it may well be unconstitutional.  It could have had its effects and been spent before there could be any question of challenging it on the grounds of constitutionality.</P>
    <P>If it were done by the conventional procedure of legislation then every Member of the Houses of the Oireachtas would be able to examine the situation and form their own opinions on it.</P>

      <P>There is no such thing as a single conventional way.  Some measures are passed by Bills and some others by regulations.  If the Senator read the debate in the other House he <Col N="1013" /> will know that approximately 350 regulations were passed last year.  It cannot be said that the conventional way is to pass everything by a Bill.  The contrary is true because up to now many Bills and regulations passed through these Houses by way of regulation whereas under the procedure provided in this Bill all regulations implementing directives will have to be passed by a Bill because a Bill will have to be passed approximately three times every year incorporating the regulations that are made.  Because of that Bill these regulations will become enacted by an Act. In fact the position is the reverse of what Senator O'Higgins has said as far as Community legislation is concerned. We are ensuring by this Bill that it will all go through the House by way of a Bill and not merely by regulation.  The difference between having to lay it before both Houses and having 21 days to consider it and on the other hand making it necessary to put it through these Houses every four months, approximately, is very little.  This gives a better opportunity to examine the regulations, and to put them through as a proper Bill.</P>
      <P>If an occasional regulation comes through the Houses, the ordinary processes of examination are still available and either House may put down a motion or ask a question at any time. By the provision in regard to every four months, a much better system is provided for examining the regulations than the system which is suggested of laying them before each House to annual them if necessary.</P>

      <P>I am a little confused by Senator Ryan's remarks.  I should like to quote from the Minister's speech:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Article 189 of the EEC Treaty and Article 161 of the Euratom Treaty provides that &ldquo;In order to carry out the task the Council and the Commission shall in accordance with the provisions of this Treaty make regulations, issue directives, take decisions, make recommendations or deliver opinions.  Regulations have general application, are binding in their entirety and take direct legal effect in the Member States without <Col N="1014" /> the intervention of National Parliaments.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Where does the question of a Bill arise here?  The Minister continued:</P>
    <P>However, some regulations have provisions which clearly are not directly applicable.</P>
    <P>If I understand it correctly these are the ones which require ministerial intervention.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>A Community regulation is directly applicable in all the countries without any action by our Government.  A Community directive is binding in its aim but the national Government can decide how this is done.  In this case we are speaking about ministerial regulation.  The word &ldquo;regulation&rdquo; has two different meanings&mdash;a Community regulation which is directly applicable; a ministerial regulation which would apply Community directives.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To add to the section a new subsection as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4) Every regulation under this Act shall be laid before Seanad Éireann as soon as may be after it is made and Seanad Éireann may, within the next twenty-one days on which it has sat after the regulation is laid before it, amend the regulation in a way which, in the opinion of any Joint Committee of Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann set up for this purpose, is consistent with the provision of the original Community instrument which the regulation seeks to implement.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I tabled this amendment because I feel that this House can play a more effective role than the one which the Government appear to be setting.  This amendment is for the purpose of dealing with specific regulations of major importance which may come up from time to time.  A Senator who might wish to do so could table a motion that Seanad Éireann takes note of a particular regulation, and it would then fall into the category of our normal <Col N="1015" /> motions and would have to be taken within 21 sitting days after being tabled.</P>
    <P>If every six months we have a Bill which will embody a large number of regulations or directives it will be difficult for the House to come to grips with a specific subject.  If within a short period after the tabling by any two Senators of a motion such as I envisage, the Bill is introduced then there is nothing wrong with taking the motion along with the Bill.  That would give this House an opportunity to deal with important regulations as they arise in the period between the half-yearly Bills which the Minister has promised to introduce.  The machinery should be used for this purpose.</P>
    <P>The more discussion there is in this House and in the Dáil the better will the people be briefed to deal with the problems arising from the EEC.  There should be a free flow of information and the people with responsibility for acting on the directives or regulations should have the advice of the Members of the Oireachtas.  It need not be mandatory to take that advice but there would be great benefits from the wide cross-section of views brought to bear on any problem discussed in this Chamber.  This amendment should not conflict with the Government's amendments or agreement to have discussions twice yearly in this House.  I ask the House seriously to consider this amendment.  This House is capable of dealing with technical matters which may arise occasionally and it would be a pity not to utilise the resources available.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Ryan dealt with this in his speech.  It raises the question of how Senators and Deputies will know what is going on in regard to Community legislation and what is projected in ministerial implementation of Community directives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The vast bulk of Community legislation will consist of regulations directly applicable over which the Houses of the Oireachtas will not have a direct say.  At the same time, it would be desirable for Members of <Col N="1016" /> the Seanad and the Dáil to know so far as possible what is developing in Europe and what may be decided by the Council of Ministers, on which we will have a representative.  For this reason we have taken the decision to have all except the confidential documents of projected European secondary legislation or regulations placed in the Library where they will be available to anyone who needs them.</P>
    <P>I personally felt, because of the mass of documentation, that if Senators and Deputies were to deal with this individually they could not deal with anything else and could not deal adequately with the amount of legislation going through.  There were approximately 2,900 regulations last year, 90 per cent of which were on the common agricultural policy.  It is just the same as if a Member of the Seanad or Dáil now wanted to know every decision going on at every level in every Department in the State.  It is quite unnecessary; but it would be necessary for Members of the Oireachtas to know that a matter of principle is being raised.</P>
    <P>A Senator mentioned on Second Stage the question of the right of establishment on land.  There is a draft there.  If there are drafts which have political consequences, there should be a system of finding these. My own suggestion was that there should be a secretariat to a committee. The committee will be very much part of the overall picture, but at the moment we have not got very far.  We have agreed to have a committee and we want to have adequate servicing of that committee.  It will be a joint committee, but the parties have to agree on some matters on which they are not agreed at the moment.  This committee would make it possible for Senators and Deputies to examine what is developing in Europe and perhaps also brief the members of the European Parliament coming from this Oireachtas on how they would deal with it in the European Parliament.</P>
    <P>In terms of the application of directives, I should like the Bill to be looked at in its entirety because we <Col N="1017" /> are inclined to think of ministerial regulations instead of legislation.  As Senator E. Ryan pointed out, what we are concerned with in this Bill is not an alternative to legislation.  It is ahead of but in addition to and would lapse in the absence of legislation. But this is a much more powerful safeguard than the laying of a regulation before the House for information. It has the safeguard of having to pass through every process of legislation through Dáil and Seanad or else it lapses as distinct from laying it before the Houses and waiting for somebody to put down a motion to deal with it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>What happens in the case of a regulation, the effect of which is in itself to be spent inside six months?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to that is that it will be necessary for Ministers to have the power to make regulations. As has been pointed out, there were 350 such regulations last year and nobody questioned the constitutionality of them.  It is only in terms of Europe that somebody has raised the question of constitutionality, which is not logical.  If delegated legislation is unconstitutional in relation to the European Bill it is unconstitutional in relation to the rest of our legislation; but we will need it to be able to fulfill our obligations.</P>
      <P>There is no onus on a Minister to provide by regulation for something which may appear to him to be more desirable to have legislation for in the first instance.  From my experience as a Minister, I think any sensible person envisaging legislation to be confirmed within a maximum of six months would have to take into account the attitude of the Dáil and Seanad and certainly would have to take into account the effect of any such regulation, even though it might not be allowed to lapse or its being allowed to lapse would not have an effect.  The effects of treating legislation in such a manner can be seen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is desirable that Ministers should have the power.  There is no onus on them to use it rather than going for legislation in the first instance.  The <Col N="1018" /> pressure will be on Ministers to make regulations which will stand up to scrutiny and which it will be possible to get through the Oireachtas easily. The Oireachtas could have a great deal to say to a Minister who makes a regulation unnecessarily.  Another safeguard is private legislation.  Legislation could be brought in to the Dáil or Seanad to annual a regulation.</P>

Every regulation made by a Minister will have to be notified in <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i> There was a suggestion here on Second Stage that this should be circulated to the Seanad and Dáil and I think this should be done.  I should have done it before now but I will have to find out if there is any reason why it should not be done.  I have asked that it be done.</P>

      <P>I am glad to hear the Minister confirm that it is the intention to set up a joint committee of both Houses.  Together with the provisions of the Bill, if this committee have an adequate secretariat and if they are in a position to examine draft EEC regulations, directives and decisions and to sift out the important ones &mdash; those containing matters of policy, those that are important even if they are not matters of policy&mdash;from the ones that are purely routine, they will have an opportunity of seeing these before they are actually directives and regulations of the Community.  They will be in a position to exercise some influence on the Minister, on the Council of Ministers and on the European Parliament to amend these regulations or in some cases to stop them.  This is certainly the very best way we can ensure that no regulations will come before the Houses of the Oireachtas which are objectionable in any way.  If this committee are set up and has the secretariat, has the ability to influence the legislation <Col N="1019" /> of the Community, that together with the power provided by this Bill is the very best way to ensure, as far as this is possible, that no regulation will be passed in the Houses of the Oireachtas which will be harmful to this country.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2.</P>
      <P>In subsection (2), line 35, to delete &ldquo;a majority&rdquo; and substitute therefor &ldquo;at least one-third&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment deals with subsection (2) of section 4.  Subsection (1) of this section provides that regulations under the Act are to have statutory effect and, unless they are confirmed by an Act of the Oireachtas passed within six months, they will cease to have statutory effect.  Subsection (2) of this section is the one which provides that if the Dáil is adjourned for a period of more than ten days when the regulations are made, it will be open to a majority of the Members of the Dáil, by notice in writing to the Ceann Comhairle, to require Dáil Éireann to be summoned.  In his introductory speech on the Second Reading the Minister referred to this and directed specific attention to the right of the majority of the Members to have the Dáil summoned in such circumstances. I do not wish to misrepresent the Minister's attitude in any way but he seemed to regard section 4, as it stood, as being the safeguarding mechanism involving the Dáil and Seanad in this matter of regulations. The point I wish to make in this amendment is a net one.  If it is necessary to get a majority of the Members of the Dáil to sign a notice calling on the Ceann Comhairle to summon the Dáil, in practice that involves getting the permission of the Government to do so.  Without the permission of the Government or their Chief Whip there will not be a snowball's chance in hell of getting a majority of the Members of the Dáil to sign such a notice.  The safeguard <Col N="1021" /> which the Minister seems to regard as having been written into this Bill is a puff of smoke.  It is a paper bulwark and nothing else.</P>
    <P>The suggestion made in this amendment is a realistic one and I would strongly urge the Minister to accept it. If not less than one-third of the Members of the Dáil in the circumstances set out in subsection (2) of section 4 request the Ceann Comhairle to summon the Dáil there should be the statutory obligation on the Ceann Comhairle to do so.  I am not trying to be obstructive or controversial.  This legislation will apply whether the present Government or another one are in office.</P>
    <P>When I talk about subsection (2), as it stands, in practice involving the permission of the Government Chief Whip, that applies no matter what party or combination of parties are in Government.  The position would be better safeguarded if the Minister accepted this amendment, If the Minister does not like the particular fraction I have chosen, that is one-third, I would have no objection to any other reasonable proportion being inserted. It is unreasonable to insist that in such circumstances the Dáil can be summoned only at the request of a majority of the Members.  My suggestion of one-third could be changed to 40 per cent if preferred.  If there is a substantial minority, which by its very size would represent a considerable Opposition voice in the Dáil, who request that the Dáil should be summoned, in these circumstances, having regard to the nature of this legislation and the expressed intention of the Minister of writing into the Bill a mechanism for involving the Dáil in these procedures, this would compel the Ceann Comhairle to reconvene the Dáil.</P>

      <P>I wish to support Senator O'Higgins in his remarks. They are in line with some remarks I made on the Second Stage of the Bill. It is a well-established practice, if not in the Houses of the Oireachtas, in the local authorities that a minority of any county council or other body can request the chairman to convene that <Col N="1022" /> body.  It gives due regard to the right of a reasonable minority.  It would be an added safeguard in this Bill if the Minister accepted the amendment put down by Senator O'Higgins or a similar amendment signifying a bigger minority. It might not be practicable for the Government party if they so wished to command a majority.  Therefore, the House could not be recalled.  It would be realistic in current and future circumstances if we could agree on a substantial minority for the reconvening of the House.  I support Senator O'Higgins' amendment.</P>

      <P>It is a funny kind of section.  Quite clearly, as the Senator has said, to get a majority you would want to be in Government.  Then the Opposition would not have the majority to set aside a Government regulation. On the other hand, if only one-third of the Members of the Dáil were in favour of recall they would not be in a position to change the regulation not having a majority.  I do not feel very strongly about it.  If the House feels happy with Senator O'Higgins's amendment then I will accept it.  Does the Senator understand what I mean?</P>

      <P>I certainly accept this amendment.  There is no point in unnecessary repetition but the point cannot be made too often of the importance of getting ordinary people's views on and reactions to proposed legislation before the member of the Council makes up his mind as to what would be acceptable to him.  Procedures which exist with regard to draft regulations and directives which affect persons, professional bodies and so on are likely to be the kind as standing out of the ordinary procedures of government.  These will be affected interests, specialised views, not necessarily a popular reaction.  It is very important that a popular reaction against a particular proposal be discovered by a debate in this or the other House.  It is very useful that this Bill should contain a sanction which will ensure that such debates take place.  It would be relevant to any report to deal with omissions from the report, if such there were, and to deal with the whole range of the developing European policy.  This question of participation is of vital importance to getting the laws acceptable to our people.  If they think they are being imposed upon without their views and reactions being canvassed very unhappy reactions can follow.  I and the other members of my party welcome this amendment.</P>

These were very full reports on the progress of the negotiations and they were extremely valuable as they were presented from time to time.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1025" /> Under other legislation and in other matters there is provision for annual reports of various kinds.  Often, for one reason or another, these reports can run maybe 12 months behind schedule; you might get two reports in the one month, or something of that kind.  I should like to appeal that the reports be issued regularly.  It is explicitly stated in the Ministers and Secretaries Bill, which has been circulated, that the report of the Public Service Council should be published promptly.  This amendment, as it stands, is quite adequate but I would make the plea that the reports appear promptly during each year.</P>

      <P>I should like to make a brief comment.  In regard to most of the legislation which will be coming from the EEC institutions, it will be mandatory on our Government to incorporate it into the laws of this State. Is there any method by which the Houses of the Oireachtas could have an opportunity of discussing the draft legislation before it is discussed in the institutions of the European Economic Community?  Could we have an opportunity of seeing these laws in draft form before they are enacted by the Council?  I think the procedure is that they come from the Commission to the Council.  Could we be afforded an opportunity of discussing them and possibly suggesting improvements or amendments before they become the laws of the European Economic Community?</P>

      <P>Most of the material coming through would have to do with the common agricultural policy.  A proposal having been initiated, it would be sent to the Council.  The Council would then make a decision.  The Council decision-making at present, <Col N="1026" /> even though there is theoretically weighted voting, holds to an agreement that nothing is done against the vital interests of any country.  This strengthens the position of small countries such as ours.  There would be one representative from each country on the Council of Ministers.</P>
      <P>The scrutiny of the draft would be done by the European Parliament.  It would appear in the <i>Journal Officiel</i> and would go on to the Social and Economic Committee.  We have decided to have it available in the Library here.  I hope the committee we are trying to establish will see clearly where they can be useful and not proceed on things which they will not be empowered to do.  Such a committee could very easily single out significant draft legislation and bring it to the attention of both Houses so that there would be awareness of and discussion on it.  In that way the Minister making the decision, the members of the European Parliament and the members of the Social and Economic Council of Europe, would know what would be desirable from the country's point of view.  It could be effected in this way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Charities Act, 1961, in certain respects, to allow for the incorporation of charity trustees and to make special provision in relation to certain charities that are governed by Acts of Parliament or by Charters.  The Bill includes provisions enabling the Commissioners of Charitable Donations and Bequests&mdash;referred to in the Bill as the board&mdash;to retransfer to the appropriate dioceses a number of charities which were vested in the board under the Charitable Donations and Bequests (Ireland) Act, 1844; enlarging the <i>cy-près</i> jurisdiction of the board; enabling the owner of land out of which a periodical payment is payable to a charity or applicable to charitable purposes to redeem such periodical payment; <Col N="1027" /> extending the board's powers in relation to the disposition and the granting of leases of land belonging to a charity; enlarging the powers of the board to appoint new trustees of a charity and to vest the property of the charity in the new trustees; regulating a solicitor's entitlement to costs in respect of business transacted by him on behalf of a charity or the trustees thereof; and reversing the present rule which requires personal representatives to publish advertisements of charitable devises and bequests contained in the wills of deceased persons unless exemption is granted by the board.  I wish to add that all these proposals are being made in agreement with the Charity Commissioners.</P>
      <P>The Charities Act, 1961, consolidated and amended the statutory provisions, dating back over 100 years, that governed the powers and functions of the Commissioners of Charitable Donations and Bequests.  It also made substantial amendments in the general law of charities.  The Commissioners have brought to attention certain difficulties that have arisen in the administration of the 1961 Act and in the administration of charities themselves, and they made a number of recommendations for dealing with these difficulties.  These recommendations were accepted by the Government. Before getting down to the provisions of the Bill, perhaps I should explain that the legal meaning of &ldquo;charity&rdquo; in law is not the same as the ordinary meaning.  A charity in law may be said broadly to mean a gift of land, property or money for the advancement of religion, the advancement of education, the relief of poverty, or other public purposes such as paintings to the National Gallery or historical objects to the National Museum.</P>
      <P>A charitable gift has certain advantages over an ordinary gift.  Firstly, a gift in perpetuity for a charitable object does not fail, and secondly, property given or donated is not subject to income tax, legacy duty or succession duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Commissioners of Charitable Donations and Bequests are a statutory body originally incorporated in 1844. <Col N="1028" /> Their main functions, which are derived from the Charities Act, 1961, are of an administrative character. They have power to advise charity trustees, power to institute legal proceedings and to certify cases to the Attorney General with a view to his instituting such proceedings, power to frame <i>cy-près</i> schemes, power to accept gifts for charitable purposes, and power to dispense with the publication of advertisements of charitable devices and bequests.</P>
    <P>The Commissioners have a long and distinguished record of public service. They give their services free and they are unstinting in the time and effort they devote to their very important public functions and duties.  The Commissioners are all men of ability who work quietly and unobtrusively, and I should like to avail myself of this opportunity to express appreciation of and gratitude for their valuable work for the community.</P>
    <P>I now come to the actual provisions in the Bill.  The Commissioners have drawn attention to the inconvenience and expense occasioned by the necessity of vesting property belonging to a charity in new trustees on the death or retirement of existing trustees; and they have represented that these difficulties would be mitigated if charity trustees could be incorporated. They have recommended that provision be made so that the trustees of a charity may, on application made to the board, be incorporated by means of a scheme vesting the trust property in the body corporate.  The incorporation of charity trustees was provided for in England in the Charitable Trustees Incorporation Act, 1872, and, in the North, in the Charities Act (Northern Ireland), 1964. Sections 2 and 3 of the Bill propose to allow for incorporation in the State and for the vesting of charity property in the bodies corporate.</P>
    <P>The board have power, under section 34 of the Charities Act, 1961, to authorise the trustees of any charity to sell, exchange or surrender a lease of charity land and to invest the proceeds for the benefit of the charity. However, this section does not, in terms, allow the board to exercise <Col N="1029" /> their powers where the sale, <i>et cetera</i>, or investment might be in contravention of an Act of Parliament or a Charter governing the particular charity.  The board have recommended that provision should be made to allow a charitable trust, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any Act of Parliament or Charter governing the particular trust, to sell, lease, mortgage, charge, exchange or surrender a lease of any of the trust property.  At present four charitable trusts are anxious to avail themselves of such a provision.  These trusts are the King's Hospital&mdash;governed by Charter and by section 113 of the Municipal Corporations (Ireland) Act, 1840&mdash;Waterford and Bishop Foy Endowed Schools, governed by statute; Wilson's Hospital, Multyfarnham, governed by Charter; and the Iveagh Trust, governed by statute. The Iveagh Trust is an endowment for homeless men and all the other trusts are educational trusts.</P>
    <P>Section 4 of the Bill will enable the board to authorise the trustees of these charities to sell, lease or otherwise dispose of their property, and to apply the proceeds for the benefit of the charities.  In the case of a charity for the furtherance of education, the proceeds may not be applied by the trustees for any purposes other than such as are, in the opinion of the board, for the furtherance of education.</P>
    <P>Section 4 of the Bill also makes special provision for the merger of two or more charities for a common charitable purpose and for the appointment of trustees in the case of a charity the trustees of which are required to be members of a particular religious denomination.</P>
    <P>Under section 15 of the Charitable Donations and Bequests (Ireland) Act, 1844, which was repealed in full by the Charities Act, 1961, a number of Catholic churches were vested in the Commissioners of Charitable Donations and Bequests.  The board now wish to transfer these churches back to the appropriate dioceses, but they have no power to do so.  Section 5 of <Col N="1030" /> the Bill enables the board to make the transfers.</P>
    <P>The board, under section 29 (2) and 29 (4) of the Charities Act, 1961, may frame schemes for the application <i>cy-prés</i> of the property comprised in a charitable gift where, <i>inter alia</i>, the charitable gift does not exceed £5,000 in value.  If the value of the gift exceeds £5,000, the charity has to bear the cost of having a <i>cy-prés</i> scheme framed by the High Court. The Commissioners have represented that, having regard to the continuing decline in the value of money and the increase in High Court legal costs, the figure of £5,000 should be increased substantially.  The figure was originally £300 under the Charitable Donations and Bequests Act (Ireland), 1871; it was increased to £2,000 under an amending Act of 1955; and it was further increased to £5,000 in the 1961 Act.  Section 6 of the Bill proposes to increase the limit to £25,000 &mdash;the figure that has been agreed with the board.</P>
    <P>Application <i>cy-prés</i> arises where the charitable objects for which property is given cannot be achieved because, for instance, the mode of achievement is unlawful or impractical. To take a simple example, if a person leaves money for the building of a church in a particular district and, if on his death such a church has already been built, the money will be applied <i>cy-prés</i> for the repair and upkeep of that church.  The expression <i>cy-prés</i> comes from the Norman French and, although its exact original meaning is doubtful, it has now, by professional usage, come to mean &ldquo;as near&rdquo; (as possible).</P>
    <P>The occasions for applying property <i>cy-prés</i> were considerably extended and the <i>cy-prés</i> doctrine itself significantly liberalised by sections 47 and 48 of the Charities Act, 1961.  The English Charity Commissioners have no pecuniary limit to the exercise of their <i>cy-prés</i> powers.  In Northern Ireland the Newark Committee (1959) recommended that the pecuniary limits should be removed and that power be given to make schemes in all cases. This recommendation was not accepted <Col N="1031" /> and the pecuniary limit in the North was set at £5,000 in the Charities Act (Northern Ireland), 1964.  I should mention that the exercise of the <i>cyprés</i> jurisdiction constitutes one of the most important functions of the Charity Commissioners.</P>
    <P>At present the Commissioners may, under section 29 (4) of the Charities Act, 1961, revoke a scheme that has been framed by order of the High Court for the application of a charitable gift and frame a new scheme for the application <i>cy-prés</i> of that property. The board have no power to revoke part only of a scheme or to amend it.  They have pointed out that instances arise in which it would be much less troublesome and far more convenient to revoke the court scheme partially or to amend it.  Section 6 of the Bill extends the board's power under section 29 (4) to include power to revoke a court scheme in part or to amend it.</P>
    <P>Section 34 of the Charities Act, 1961, enables the board to authorise the trustees of any charity comprising land to make a disposition of the land.  The section also enables the board to make a disposition of land where they themselves are the trustees of a charity comprising land.  Under the section a disposition of land is defined as, and is confined to, selling it, exchanging it for other land, or surrendering a lease of it.  In the opinion of the board, their powers under the 1961 Act section should be extended to cover dispositions of land by (1) surrendering a tenancy of it, (2) accepting a surrender of a lease or tenancy of it, or (3) mortgaging or charging it.  The power to mortgage charity land is, under section 37 of the Charities Act, 1961, at present confined to purposes connected with improvements to the land, for example, erection of new buildings, repair of existing buildings and so on. The board consider that there should be a general power to mortgage charity land where that would be advantageous to the charity.  However, they have represented that the present requirements prescribed in section 37 (4) of the 1961 Act in regard to the payment of the principal money by annual <Col N="1032" /> instalments and the redemption and reconveyance of the mortgaged land within a period of not more than 30 years are unduly restrictive inasmuch as the board may not vary the conditions in any particular case.  They have recommended that the law be amended so that mortgages may be in such form as they shall approve.  The board's proposals in regard to the disposition of land and in regard to mortgages are reasonable and provision is made in section 7 of the Bill for the implementation of the proposals.</P>
    <P>Under section 34 of the Charities Act, 1961, the board may authorise dispositions of charity land only where they are satisfied that the dispositions would be advantageous to the charities concerned.  In practice, the board act on the basis that this section requires that property be sold at full market value.  They are anxious that they should be given power to authorise the trustees of a charity to make a disposition of charity property at less than market value if the property sold is to be used for a public charitable purpose. This is reasonable, and an appropriate provision is contained in section 7 of the Bill to allow one charity to benefit another by disposing of some of its property for a small consideration.</P>
    <P>Section 35 (1) of the Charities Act, 1961, gives the board power, on an application to them by the trustees of a charity, to authorise the sale to the owner of land of a periodical payment payable out of the land for the benefit of a charity or applicable to charitable purposes.  These periodical payments are somewhat analogous to ground rents, the owner of the land being in much the same position as a lessee or tenant.  The Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) Act, 1967, confers the right on lessees and tenants to buy out ground rents and acquire the full fee simple of their property.  Furthermore, the board have power under section 36 (1) of the Charities Act, 1961, to authorise the purchase by a charity of a periodical payment payable by the charity out of land owned by the charity.  Section 8 of the Bill empowers the board, on an application to them by the owner of land out of which a <Col N="1033" /> periodical payment is payable to a charity or applicable to charitable purposes, to authorise such owner to redeem the periodical payment.  The section also enables the board to act in cases where there are no trustees of the charity or the trustees are unknown.</P>
    <P>Under section 37 of the Charities Act, 1961, the board may authorise the trustees of a charity comprising land to grant certain leases of the land and, where the board are the trustees of a charity comprising land, the board may themselves grant such leases.  The section restricts the letting of land to lettings &ldquo;on building, repairing, improving or other leases, or on leases for working any mine&rdquo;.  The board have represented that this restriction is obsolete and that, in any event, as far as the board is aware, no leases of the nature mentioned have ever been granted. They have asked that the provisions of the section should be extended to any letting of land belonging to a charity.  The Government are satisfied that the board's request should be granted and section 9 of the Bill provides accordingly.  The new power of the board will, of course, be subject to the existing condition in section 37 of the 1961 Act that the board are satisfied that the letting will be beneficial to the charity.</P>
    <P>Section 43 of the Charities Act, 1961, gives the board power to appoint new trustees of a charity and to vest the property of the charity in the new trustees.  However, the board's power is confined to charity property comprising land.  There is no reason why this should be so and, it is proposed under section 10 of the Bill to extend the power of the boards to allow for the vesting of any property.</P>
    <P>Section 43 (4) of the 1961 Act obliges the board (a) to give not less than one month's public notice of their intention to make an order appointing new trustees of a charity and (b) to give public notice of the making of such order on the day immediately following the date of the making.  The purpose of the notices is to enable interested persons to lodge objections with the board to the making of an order or, in the case of an order made, <Col N="1034" /> to appeal to the High Court against the making of the order.  The board have made over 190 orders and in only two cases have they received objections. No appeal has been taken against the making of any order.  The board consider that a period of one month's notice of intention to make an order is too long and involves unnecessary delay in making the order. Moreover, it is extremely difficult in practice to comply with the requirement to give notice of the making of an order on the day immediately following the date on which it is made. Paragraph (b) of section 10 of the Bill reduces the period of one month to 14 days and paragraph (c) of the section gives the board ten days in which to publish notice of the making of an order.</P>
    <P>Under section 43 (5) of the 1961 Act, any person having an interest may, within 21 days of the date of the making of an order appointing new trustees, appeal to the High Court against the making of the order.  It is not proposed to alter the period of 21 days but it is proposed to allow it to run from the date of the notice of the making of the order.  It is normal practice to allow the court discretion to extend the time for appeal and provision is being made accordingly in paragraph (d) of section 10 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The board have power under section 44 of the Charities Act, 1961, to order the bill of costs claimed by a solicitor on account of business transacted by him on behalf of a charity to be taxed and ascertained by a taxing master.  The board have represented that the section is not fully effective because there is no means of ensuring that a solicitor will comply with the board's order and he will receive no more than the taxed costs.  The board have suggested that the section should be amended to provide that, where the board orders a bill of costs to be taxed and ascertained by a taxing master, the solicitor concerned will not be entitled to any costs other than those so taxed and ascertained.  Section 11 of the Bill provides accordingly.</P>
    <P>Section 52 of the Charities Act, 1961, imposes on personal representatives the duty to publish advertisements of <Col N="1035" /> charitable devises and bequests contained in wills of deceased persons, unless exemption is granted by the board under the powers conferred on them by section 20 of the Act.  The board have discretion under section 20 to exempt any person from the obligation imposed on him under section 52 either wholly or to such extent and on such terms as they think fit.  The board, in arriving at their decision, must have regard to the amount of the charitable devise or bequest or other special circumstances. In practice, on receipt of evidence of payment, exemption is granted in all cases where the aggregate value of the devise or bequest does not exceed £2,500.</P>
    <P>The board feel that the rule which requires notice of devises and bequests to be published, unless the board grants exemption, should be reversed to give a general exemption from publication of notices except where the board require notice to be published.  In Northern Ireland, this has been the position since 1964 under section 4 of the Charities Act (Northern Ireland), 1964, which implemented the recommendation in the Charity Committee Report (1959) that the rule be reversed. There is no requirement for publication in England, Wales, or Scotland.  If the rule in the 1961 Act were reversed, there would be a considerable saving to charities as well as a significant reduction in the work in the board's office. At present, the staff have to deal with about 1,200 applications for exemption annually.  A reminder of the duty to publish the notice has to be issued from the office to solicitors or personal representatives where notice is not published and exemption has not been applied for.  In all the circumstances, it seems clear that the statutory rule relating to publication of notice of devises and bequests contained in wills should, as the board recommended, be reversed. Section 12 of the Bill provides accordingly. The board will, under the section, be able, as an alternative to publication, to require the personal representatives to produce evidence to show that the property comprised in a charitable devise or bequest has been transferred to the charity specified in the will or that the trustees of the charity are <Col N="1036" /> aware of the devise or bequest.</P>
    <P>This Bill makes valuable changes in our system of administration of charities. The law of charities is of a rather specialised character and, for that reason, a Charities Bill requires more detailed elucidation than would otherwise be necessary.  I trust that the explanatory memorandum that has been circulated will be of some assistance to Senators in making their way through the various provisions in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude, I should like to mention that the board have drawn to attention a problem in relation to disused national schools and teachers' residences held under leases granted under the Leases for Schools (Ireland) Act, 1881.  There are some 500 such schools and some 200 teachers' residences that the board are anxious to have sold.  In a large number of cases it has proved impossible to ascertain the successors in title to the original grantors or to trace the whereabouts of the successors.  The legal difficulties involved have necessitated detailed investigation and it is only now that an amendment of the law has been finalised in consultation with the commissioners. It is hoped to introduce this amendment on the Committee Stage in agreement with the Minister for Education. There may also be some other amendments as a result of suggestions that have been made by the commissioners on further examination of the text of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill which the Parliamentary Secretary has well described as making valuable changes in our system of administration of charities.  The House will be comforted to hear that I will probably make the shortest speech I have ever made on a Second Reading. Having regard to the nature of this Bill it is, in fact, a Committee Stage Bill.  If I say little on this stage it does not necessarily mean that I will say little on the Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the enlargement of the <i>cy-prés</i> jurisdiction of the board and regret that there is any pecuniary limit left on that jurisdiction, which I note has gone elsewhere, particularly having regard to what the Parliamentary <Col N="1037" /> Secretary said about the constant decline in the value of money and the undesirability of having to come back to the Houses of the Oireachtas to get an increase in the jurisdiction to maintain its real value within what may be an all too short period of time.</P>
    <P>I see no objection in principle.  I should like to hear what objection in principle there is to removing the pecuniary limitation.  I agree with the Parliamentary Secretary when he complimented the Charity Commissioners who have given such distinguished public service.  Perhaps it is worth noting that sometimes the quality of performance is in inverse ratio to the reward gained and is sometimes the greater if it is entirely sacrifice, as in this case.  It would not be proper if one did not add a compliment to the distinguished public servants who serve and advise these Commissioners and who help people who have no practice in this field.</P>
    <P>I have some reservations about the section which provides for the merger of charities and also for the section which entitles the Commissioners to approve of the giving away from one charity to another.  In most of these cases we are endeavouring to realise the clearly thought-out wishes of men &mdash;in many cases long dead&mdash;expressed after a lifetime of thought as to what they wished to be done with their accumulations.</P>
    <P>Private trusts should not be interfered with, though it is not necessarily outside the competence of the Oireachtas to do so by a proper statute.  I dealt with a case of a merger of charities.  When making a particular charitable arrangement which was to have a particular name, the testator was very concerned that it could not in any circumstances become merged with any other charity or that its name could not be changed. It may be necessary to suggest some amendments to cope with this kind of situation where there is an expressed wish which should be respected and not be prevented from being realised by a current view of even the very enlightened Commissioners.</P>
    <P>The proposal to reverse provisions <Col N="1038" /> with regard to the publication of charitable notices is very welcome. Not merely does it save money for the charities and save administration costs and time to the Commissioners but it is one step which would be taken by legislation to accelerate rather than to slow down the administration of estates.  Most other pieces of legislation have that effect by reason of the administrative consequences. This combined with the slowing down of the administration of the estates, means a loss to all the beneficiaries.</P>
    <P>It might not be appropriate to consider in relation to this Bill the question of the treatment of charities for taxation.  I might put forward an amendment on this on Committee or Report Stages.  Income tax and valuation tax, and the different schedules of the tax code represent an extremely complex field.  If these provisions could be simplified by legislation by putting them together in one section where they could be read by practitioners and understood, or if they were codified under one section, it would be very helpful.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that charities, together with widows and orphans and all those beneficiaries of unintelligently drawn legal instruments, by virtue of our legislation should be denied access to the opportunities for enrichment of the objects of the charities by wide investing powers.  An intelligently drawn charitable instrument will give these powers.  We are now speaking about the situation where we have a defective instrument or no instrument at all.</P>
    <P>The law relative to the investment of charitable sums is very restrictive. I should like to see some of the investment provisions being considered. This is provided for in a Bill which was given its First Reading in this House a long time ago&mdash;the Trustee (Authorised Investment) Bill, 1970. There are other interests involved here but we should be clear as to who are the losers.  Where there are restrictions, the losers are the charitable objects if as a result of these restrictions the fund does not maintain itself and participate in a growth <Col N="1039" /> which comes from a well-managed portfolio.  I was greatly assisted in my understanding of this Bill by the memorandum accompanying it and my enlightenment was increased by the Parliamentary Secretary's speech, for which I am grateful.</P>

      <P>I might have had some reservations about this Bill because of the legal complexities involved but I welcome it without hesitation having heard the expert opinion of Senator FitzGerald.  I have a particular interest in section 4 of the Bill which covers the case of charitable trusts wishing to sell land or property which at present they are unable to do so.  I am pleased the legislation has been amended so that the trusts in question and other trusts in the same position can now benefit from a sale of land or transfers of property, as has been pointed out by the Parliamentary Secretary.  He mentioned the trusts of the Waterford and Bishop Foy Endowed School, Wilson's Hospital, Multifarnham, and Iveagh Trust.  I regret that Waterford and Bishop Foy School is now closed.  The provisions in section 4 will benefit the other two schools.  A happy situation is attained regarding King's Hospital. The famous building in Blackhall Place, formerly occupied by the school, may now be transferred to and taken over by the Incorporated Law Society, thus preserving this distinguished Dublin building.  The provision of section 4 of the Bill allows two important aims to be achieved&mdash;the school has obtained modern premises and the Incorporated Law Society have taken over the building in Blackhall Place.  I welcome this section and the flexibility which the Bill gives to trusts in their management and investment.</P>

      <P>First of all I wish to thank Senator FitzGerald for the welcome which he gave to the Bill in general and in particular for the acknowledgment which he expressed of the very valuable work being done by the Commissioners.  As he and members of the legal profession are well aware, the Commissioners are distinguished lawyers, members of the <Col N="1040" /> Bench, economists and clergymen who not only give their time but the benefit of their considerable professional experience and knowledge in the advice which they apply through their membership of the board.  We are indeed very fortunate to have the benefit of their advice not just in the day-to-day matters&mdash;indeed it is almost a matter of day-to-day concern for them because they meet very regularly&mdash;but also in relation to the proposals to amend what would be, without their advice, a very difficult area of law.</P>
      <P>As I said in my opening address in the House, the proposals which are incorporated in this Bill are those recommended by the Commissioners.  To that extent, though we might even be reluctant in view of lack of time, capacity or otherwise to go into detail on this Bill, I trust that on Committee Stage we will have such an opportunity. We can feel reasonably confident that what it endeavours to do and what it represents is in many ways the consequence of expert and dedicated advice.</P>
      <P>I also welcome Senator West's acknowledgment of the significance of the Bill in relation to King's Hospital. As he has stated, it is an indication of the obvious need&mdash;which the Commissioners feel and which the Government have accepted&mdash;to update the law in relation to particular charities to ensure that no frustration can occur in the application of the fundamental objects of a charity.</P>
      <P>Senator FitzGerald had one or two questions, one in particular relating to reservations with regard to the limit on the <i>cy-prés</i> administration of the board.  May I be allowed to refer to some information here?  He will have noticed from my opening speech that there is still in the North of Ireland the limit of £5,000, although the committee to which I refer recommended that the pecuniary limit be removed.  It is felt that where the amount is very large the directions of the court would not only be helpful but desirable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is simply with that concern that the Commissioners have suggested that their own powers be limited or <Col N="1041" /> qualified to that extent.  One can nonetheless acknowledge the relevance of what Senator FitzGerald said having regard to the fact that money values are changing and decreasing so rapidly that it may well be necessary in time&mdash;one hopes not too soon&mdash;to come back to the House to further amend that provision.  In so far as the Commissioners themselves are anxious in cases where there are very large bequests to have the guidance and direction of the court, we would do well to meet their wishes.</P>
    <P>Senator FitzGerald expressed some reservation, although I did not interpret it as being anything in the nature of active concern, about cases where there may be sales by one charity to another for less than market value. Usually what is envisaged is that the charity would be selling to another charity with almost similar objects.  If one needs to quote an example, the St. Vincent de Paul Society might sell portion of their property to an old folk's society or some such charity. The discretion which will reside in the board in this case would ensure that there will not be an application of these provisions outside of what we would all regard as being reasonable and desirable in the interests of the charities concerned.</P>
    <P>Senator FitzGerald recognised that the other matter that he referred to, the powers of investment, would have repercussions or significance beyond the particular significance of this Bill. One recognises the concern he has in so far as he pointed out that the objects of the charities may not have the benefits of investment in the most appropriate portfolio.  One nonetheless has to recognise, particularly in the case of charities, that one has to be if anything conservative in dealing with the investment of charitable funds.</P>
    <P>The Commission find that their present powers under the 1961 Act are proving very satisfactory in practice. They have a schedule of investments which they revise from time to time and they have also drawn up a comprehensive portfolio of securities.  So here again one must temper the case by saying that one has to be, if anything, conservative.  At the same time <Col N="1042" /> the Commissioners have power to revise their schemes.  One can only say that what Senator FitzGerald said on this Stage, and of course what may be said in the course of the Committee Stage, will be brought to their attention.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is anything further I can say at this stage.  I indicated that it is hoped to introduce at least one other amending measure, and it may be necessary, as a result of a revision of the Bill suggested by the Commissioners, to introduce further amendments. Of course Members of the House will want an opportunity also to consider the Bill in further detail. I would hope we will have an early opportunity of considering the Bill on Committee Stage and I thank the House for the reception they have given to the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. B. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to raise the statutory limits on the aggregate amounts of money which may be paid to Bord Fáilte for the giving of grants for holiday accommodation and the development of resorts under the Major Resort Development Scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Major Resort Development Scheme was inaugurated under the Tourist Traffic Act, 1959, which provided for the payment to Bord Fáilte of sums not exceeding in the aggregate £1 million for the giving of grants for the development of major tourist resorts.  Under the scheme the board provides grants to enable such essential work as basic site development, the provision of facilities such as toilets, shelters, car parks, promenades, parks and other recreational activities to be undertaken in places designated for development by the board.  One of the conditions of the Scheme is that there <Col N="1043" /> must be a minimum local contribution of 20 per cent towards the cost of the development works.</P>
    <P>Initially 12 centres and four areas were designated for development but subsequently one resort area and two resorts were added to the programme. The scheme, which aimed at developing resort amenities on the basis of joint action by the board and local interests involved the selection of areas for development and the formation of acceptable proposals.  The scheme necessitated negotiations with many interests and the planning and execution of substantial programmes of capital works involving financial commitments spread over several years.  These features and the level of funds which could be made available for this work tended to prolong the carrying out of the various development plans and brought the costs of the scheme well beyond the costs first visualised.  In some cases adaptation of planned works to changing patterns and tastes was also a factor.</P>
    <P>By the Tourist Traffic Act, 1966, the financial provision for the resort scheme was increased from the initial £1 million to £3.25 million.  It was intended to allocate £0.75 million of this sum for the initiation of a second major resort scheme but this did not prove possible because of escalation in costs and changes in development commitments under the first scheme.</P>
    <P>The total amount issued to Bord Fáilte for resort development at the 31st March, 1972, amounted to £3,202,717 and this left a balance of only £47,283 under the limit prescribed for the fund.  A new statutory limit of £4 million is necessary to enable Bord Fáilte to meet its total outstanding commitments in relation to works already commissioned.  The disbursement of the additional £0.75 million over the next few years will bring the first major resort development scheme to a conclusion.</P>
    <P>Before the resort scheme was introduced, public and private investment in the amenity and recreation infrastructure was minimal.  The scheme stimulated the provision of worthwhile <Col N="1044" /> tourist facilities in the places designated, that is, Galway&mdash;Salthill, Killarney, Bray, Dún Laoghaire, Tramore, Skerries, Kilkee, Youghal, Ballybunion, Lahinch, Arklow, Lisdoonvarna, Westport and Greystones as well as in the resort areas of West Cork, County Donegal, Achill Island, the Dingle Peninsula and the River Shannon and its lakes.</P>
    <P>The grants scheme for the development of holiday accommodation was also introduced under the Tourist Traffic Act, 1959.  Provision was made in that Act for giving £500,000 to Bord Fáilte for that purpose.  As a result of the provision of these funds, Bord Fáilte operated a scheme of grants with the approval of the Ministers for Transport and Power and Finance.  As the tourist industry developed and accommodation needs expanded, the scheme was appraised and adopted, including the improvement in 1967 of the scale of incentives.  The Tourist Traffic Acts, 1963, 1966, 1968 and 1970 permitted a series of increases in the aggregate amounts provided for accommodation development which brought the initial provision from £500,000 to £11 million.  The total amount issued to Bord Fáilte for accommodation development grants to 31st March, 1972, was £9.23 million, which leaves a balance of £1.77 million before the statutory limit of £11 million is exhausted.</P>
    <P>Bord Fáilte have not been taking on new grant commitments in respect of hotel and guesthouse development since mid-1969.  In the meantime, the moneys voted for holiday accommodation grants have been used by the board to reduce the backlog of grants due to developers and a considerable reduction on outstanding commitments has been effected.  Since mid-1969 the board has paid £5.63 million in reduction of the backlog.  No developer at present is being held up because of shortage of grant funds and this has been the situation since 1971.  Outstanding commitments now relate only to projects on which payments have not yet matured.  These commitments will be cleared over the next few years but this necessitates an increase in the statutory limit on funds for the development <Col N="1045" /> of holiday accommodation.  The Bill proposes to increase the statutory limit from £11 million to £13 million to enable Bord Fáilte to meet outstanding commitments.</P>
    <P>Expenditure to date by Bord Fáilte amounting to almost £10 million on accommodation grants has generated a total investment of over £60 million on hotels, guesthouses, caravan and camping sites and holiday cottages. The number of bedrooms in hotels and guesthouses has increased from 17,800 in 1960 to 28,885 in 1972 and the existing volume of accommodation is considered to be adequate for the industry's needs for the years immediately ahead.</P>
    <P>Since the introduction of the major resort development and accommodation development schemes 13 years ago, increasing material prosperity has stimulated new consumer demands in all fields of activity including holiday making.  For example, distance limits on holiday travel have practically ceased to exist even for people of quite moderate means.  In addition to general change, changes in detail which have had a pronounced effect on Irish tourism include:</P>
    <P>(a)  Serious damage to our markets in Britain and Northern Ireland attributable to events in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>(b)  The increasing proportion of Continental visitors and the need to cater for this new type of customer.</P>
    <P>(c)  The ending of our &ldquo;island&rdquo; status with the introduction of vehicle ferry services.</P>
    <P>(d)  The greater wish for holiday mobility and the consequent popularity of the independent touring holiday.</P>
    <P>(e)  The recession in coach tour business.</P>
    <P>(f)  The increasing popularity of do-it-yourself holidays whether camping, caravanning or in purpose-built rented accommodation, and</P>
    <P>(g)  The demand for more varied entertainment.</P>
    <P>In view of these influential factors <Col N="1046" /> and with the discharge of all outstanding commitments in relation to major resorts and accommodation development in sight, I consider it both opportune and desirable that a comprehensive review of progress to date should be carried out with a view to developing, if necessary, a completely fresh approach to accommodation and resort infrastructural needs for the future.  Bord Fáilte are at present carrying out this study and in the course of it they are taking account of their own experience and of a number of studies and consultancy research reports on physical planning, accommodation development and tourists' needs.</P>
    <P>The provisions of this Bill will enable Bord Fáilte to complete major resort and accommodation development projects.  The limits of £4 million for resort development and £13 million for accommodation development proposed in the Bill do not include any funds for new schemes.  By the time the limits included in the Bill have been reached, Bord Fáilte will have to come to firm conclusions on the direction which further development should take.  Proposals for continuing assistance in some form for accommodation and resort development are likely to emerge from the board's studies.  The implementation of any such proposals will, of course, need further legislation and Senators will get an opportunity to debate in full any proposals for further financial provision for accommodation and resort development.</P>
    <P>I consider it appropriate at this stage, to say something about the present tourism situation.  Senators are aware of the difficulties confronting the industry since 1969 when the unrest in Northern Ireland became aggravated.  Tourism revenue in that year was £98.7 million and represented an increase of £5.7 million on the 1968 figure.  Tourism revenue fell in 1970 to £96 million and rose in 1971 to £100.8 million.  On the basis of constant 1970 prices the 1971 figure represents a fall of close on 4 per cent on the 1970 figure.  Bord Fáilte have forecast a revenue of £87.9 million for 1972.</P>
    <P>These figures were only achieved <Col N="1047" /> through the massive amount of development, promotional and marketing work, undertaken by all the interests concerned.  Full credit is due to Bord Fáilte, the regional tourism organisations and all other interests in the industry for their performance over the past few years in very difficult conditions.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately there are yet no strong indications of a very early return to stable conditions in Northern Ireland.  Bord Fáilte are, however, optimistic about a resumption of tourism growth and they have set a target of an increase of £6.9 million for 1973 to bring tourism revenue exclusive of carrier receipts in that year to £69.2 million at constant 1972 prices.  The board are undertaking an ambitious promotional programme for 1973.  Their programme involves advertising in Britain, North America and the Continent.  New marketing literature for their overseas markets is being prepared.  Promotional work in the new Continental market areas is being extended.  The board are guaranteeing the quality of a programme of holidays offered in Britain and they have appointed public relations consultants for that market area.  The board are trying to increase significantly, in co-operation with carriers and other sectors, the number of travel writers, radio and television units and travel agents to sample the holidays to be offered to tourists here in 1973.  The convention bureau is endeavouring to increase the number of conferences and incentive travel visits.</P>
    <P>Every possible effort is being made to improve the Irish tourist product and the flow of visitors to Ireland.  I hope that it will not be long before the industry again enjoys the growth trends of the early sixties.  The industry is sound and I am convinced that it will emerge much stronger from the difficulties it had to face in the past few years.</P>
    <P>I should like to take this opportunity to thank the very many Irish people who spent their holidays at home in Ireland in 1972.  Bord Fáilte estimate that tourism revenue from this source in 1972 will be about £18.7 million. <Col N="1048" /> On this basis, the &ldquo;Discover Ireland&rdquo; programme was a success and it is the board's intention to develop strongly this section of the tourist industry.</P>
    <P>The Bill will facilitate the provision of important tourism facilities and I, therefore, confidently recommend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there is any question of not accepting the Bill. There are debts to be paid and the State must honour its obligations.  The Minister has given us a factual and fair account of the current tourism situation in so far as this Bill is concerned. He could probably have said a lot more.  I have no doubt the Members of this House would like to say a lot more and venture into wider fields covering tourism generally.</P>
      <P>The Minister is unfortunate that he is introducing this Bill at a rather inopportune time in the tourist industry. Some of the difficulties are certainly outside the control of either the Government or the various bodies charged with the promotion of tourism. For that reason we must have sympathy not alone with the Minister but also with those who have suffered due to difficulties completely outside their control.  One wonders if the present difficulties and depression in the tourist industry can be blamed completely on the situation in the North of Ireland, or on other factors outside the control of the Government or the industry itself.  I do not share this view. The Minister indicated in his address that the tourist industry had reached a critical stage.  It is encouraging to note that Bord Fáilte are aware of this and have started an investigation into the results of their activities over past years and into what new forms tourism might take in the years ahead; if it will resume, as the Minister said, the encouraging trend of the 1960s.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Certainly in the initial years the people in charge of the tourist industry set their sights at the wrong market. In the late 1950s and early 1960s there was only one market which appealed to the people here and that was the luxury dollar market of the United States of America.  In order to <Col N="1049" /> cater for that market we encouraged the building of what has been termed luxury-type hotels.  We now have a number of these hotels around the country, some of which can be procured at bargain prices, if anybody is interested, at the present time.  It is an indication of the critical condition of the industry that not so many months ago a headline appeared in one or more of our national papers stating that upwards of 100 hotels were for sale in this country.  Allowing for a certain amount of exaggeration in this statement, there are some sectors of the hotel industry which are in a perilous position at the present time.  Some of their difficulties may have been brought on for the very reason that we are introducing this Bill, because some of Bord Fáilte's bills have not been paid to the tourist industry.  If this is a fact, the sooner we get this Bill through the two Houses of the Oireachtas the better.</P>
    <P>In more recent years the tourist industry and Bord Fáilte have tended to concentrate on what I would have thought to be the obvious market for this small country, that is, the middle class and working class market, people who do not require luxury-type hotels at luxury-type prices.  There is a limited market for this type of hotel.  The general type of tourist, whether British or continental, requires reasonable accommodation at reasonable prices including food and drink.  We were quite famous for the low price of our drink in the years immediately following the war, but lamentably this has changed.  Finally, they require courtesy, co-operation and a friendliness which does not cost anything.  These are the qualities which draw tourists to a country.</P>
    <P>We have a good reputation for these qualities but unfortunately we are tending to lose them in some areas.  They still hold true in rural areas but certainly in the larger urban areas there is well-founded criticism both of the slipshod and indifferent service given in hotels, the general manner in which guests are received and the over-expeditious way in which they are despatched when it comes to paying their bill.  I should be very <Col N="1050" /> sorry to see friendliness and courtesy being lost in this country.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that a greater effort was being made to bring continental tourists to this country. There is tremendous scope in this field and particularly with our entry into the EEC.  Any money that can be expended on promoting tourism from the Continent is money well spent. Notwithstanding the political events in this country, the English tourist can be induced to come here if a proper selling job is done.</P>
    <P>The Minister and Members of this House will recall letters appearing in our national papers from English visitors who had taken their courage in their hands and come over here for their holidays and had written to compliment the Irish people on the wonderful holiday they had.  They would tell their friends, notwithstanding the lurid stories which were being painted about us outside the country, that we were still a warm, friendly people, that there was no place in the world where one could spend a nicer holiday.  If we could get more of this type of recommendation it would have a far greater effect on our tourist industry than the millions of pounds which have been spent over the years.  This does not mean that I am against spending money on the development of tourism but it is essential that the money is spent wisely.</P>
    <P>A lot of money has been spent on hotels and some money has been spent on guesthouses.  The money spent on guesthouses and on the farmhouse scheme is money very well spent.  One of the most encouraging features in recent years is the rent-a-cottage scheme.  There is room for further expansion in this type of accommodation.  It is almost impossible to get one of these cottages.  Certainly, anywhere in the south-west, with which I am familiar, you must book one at least 12 months ahead. Families, when they have one, book it again for the following year.  This scheme reflects the greatest possible credit by the Shannonside or MidWestern Tourism Organisation, which initiated it.</P>
    <P>We have recently seen very cheap <Col N="1051" /> weekend air fares advertised between Dublin and London but not between Cork and London or Shannon and London.  Shannon, as anybody who has been there or lives in the area knows, is possibly the most accessible tourist centre in these islands and offers an enormous field for development through air traffic.</P>
    <P>It is very shortsighted policy by the national airline to introduce a cheap fare on the busiest route in these islands, that between Dublin and London, and not introduce similar or better facilities between Shannon and London or other British cities and Cork and other British cities.  I believe we have a tremendous opportunity of increasing our tourist potential here.  The numbers of people who would come home for long weekends would increase enormously if the same facilities were offered by our national airline to the north-west and southern areas.  If Aer Lingus cannot financially afford to do this&mdash;it is difficult to understand why because they can afford to operate cheap fares out of Dublin&mdash;they could put up a very good case for assistance. It would be money very well spent. Most business people would agree that, if you can increase your turnover, even at a lower <i>per capita</i> rate, your costs would come down dramatically and I am sure the same would apply to Aer Lingus.</P>
    <P>The regional tourist boards, which were set up some years ago, have done a very good job of work.  They deserve more encouragement than they get.  I would like to pay a tribute to the dedication which the members of those boards apply to their work.  As far as I know they are unpaid for their efforts but, if they are paid, they certainly receive a very modest stipend for their efforts.  This is certainly true of the organisation called Shannonside who have done remarkable work indeed. They deserve every possible encouragement from the Minister's Department.</P>
    <P>There is a great deal of stocktaking going on in the tourist trade at the present time.  At least Bord Fáilte are alive to the situation that the methods adopted with success in the 1960's are not applicable in the 1970's.  I hope <Col N="1052" /> Bord Fáilte realise that we have entered in the 1970s an expanding leisure market.  The five-day working week will extend to all sections of workers inevitably and already people are talking about a four-day working week.  People will wish to travel for two or three leisure days and we have a wonderful opportunity in this country of cashing in on that market. However, we will only succeed in cashing in on it if we realise the potential of the market.</P>
    <P>Our next door neighbour has 60 million people and it always has been, and will be, our best market for tourism. When we are undertaking our tourist promotion scheme we should slant it towards the British market. Although we have taken advantage of that potential the numbers are still quite small in comparison with the total amount of British tourists who travel to Europe each year.  Many more British tourists, particularly young people, will be travelling abroad in the years ahead and we can cash in on the market if we evaluate the situation properly.  I do not believe that sufficient inducement is given to the younger people to spend their holidays in Ireland.</P>
    <P>When we started on our tourist promotion schemes we thought only of the million dollar American market.  After that we began to set our sights a little lower to the middle class English tourist, but the biggest market in any country is the younger generation. They are the people with the money and if we can encourage them to come here for the type of holiday they want &mdash;that would have to include amusements in various centres throughout the country&mdash;we shall be able to cash in on an expanding market.  No matter how beautiful a holiday centre may be, if we have not got amusements and entertainment in the evenings we will not be able to encourage tourists to go there.</P>
    <P>We should try to ensure that British families spend their holidays here. They are possibly the best spenders of all.  They come over here and rent a house or bring their caravans and they spend an enormous amount of money. Although we have considerably improved <Col N="1053" /> the ferry transport arrangements to this country I believe there is room for far greater development.  We must look and plan ahead in this regard and if we do so we should be able to encourage five or ten times the present number of British tourists to spend their holidays here.</P>
    <P>I have made those few points in the context of this Bill.  I intended them to be constructive and I hope they will be of some help to the Minister.  I am optimistic enough to believe that we can and will expand our tourist industry in the years ahead and I should like to see the Minister returning to us next year seeking a substantially increased amount of money for worthwhile tourist promotion and giving to us a factual and encouraging account of what has happened in the intervening period.  This House, or the other House, has never refused adequate capital to any Minister who sought it for worthwhile projects.  That would certainly include our tourist industry, which is of enormous importance to a small country such as ours.  It is next in importance to our agricultural industry and offers tremendous potential for development.</P>
    <P>I should like to repeat that we must become more alive to the needs of the seventies and the eighties.  We should not hesitate to send our emissaries to the Continent or to Russia, Turkey and Iron Curtain countries. The Iron Curtain is dissolving, particularly in regard to tourism and trade, and that region offers tremendous potential.  I believe we have only touched the fringe of the tourist potential for this country.  I, and my party, give the Bill our full support.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiBrugha" hpid="Ruairí Brugha Ruairí Brugha">
      <NameTxt>Ruairí Brugha</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the objects of this Bill and I do not think anyone would be reluctant to do so.  I should like to take this opportunity of commenting on our tourist situation.  I should like to welcome Bord Fáilte's decision to arrange a comprehensive review of progress to date and, if necessary, to make a completely fresh approach to accommodation needs for the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Infrastructure needs cover an important aspect of tourism.  Good hotels by <Col N="1054" /> themselves are not sufficient; facilities for leisure and for pastimes are also a &ldquo;must&rdquo;.  If we can generate in our whole community, on a community basis in different areas, an enthusiasm for providing the sort of amenities that people enjoy, I believe that people will visit those areas.  This applies particularly to the efforts that are being made and to future efforts by the different regional bodies.  If people will visit an area because of something they like there and if the facilities are there that will attract them, then the guesthouses and hotels in that area will be full.</P>
    <P>I should like to compliment Bord Fáilte on the efforts they have been making this year, by inviting overseas journalists, writers, and others, in order to try to convey to them a picture of a normal situation in this part of Ireland.  Senator Russell does not think that the situation in the North has affected the issue so much.  How ever, on the basis of information available to me as chairman of one of the regional organisations, I am quite satisfied that, despite what Senator Russell has said, what we have been suffering from over the past few years in relation to world headlines has affected significantly our tourist trade.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>What I said was that it was not the only issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiBrugha" hpid="Ruairí Brugha Ruairí Brugha">
      <NameTxt>Ruairí Brugha</NameTxt>
      <P>In that case I shall correct myself.  It certainly is not the only issue, but it is a very serious one. While I am loath to give any details of the effects, I feel bound to emphasise the results of adverse publicity abroad.  One is also bound to emphasise the loss in employment and in revenue to the economy following adverse headlines in newspapers and on television right across the world.  I should also like to mention the adverse effects, whoever may have been responsible, of the efforts a few weeks ago to set three or four hotels in Dublin on fire.  Fortunately these attempts did not prove to be serious but they could have been.  I should like to stress that this sort of activity puts people out of work and deprives this particular industry of the potential increase in employment that can come from <Col N="1055" /> strengthening our tourist industry.</P>
      <P>I should now like to refer to foreign students.  The tourist regions have built up a very good and profitable business for ordinary people in many parts of the country, and particularly in the Dublin area, who accommodate visiting students in the summer season.  There have been a couple of unfortunate cases of foreign students being attacked.  Again, one must point out the damaging effects of this kind of totally irresponsible activity.</P>
      <P>I should very much like to compliment Bord Fáilte and the Dublin tourist region for the great effort they made in the holidays at home campaign.  The Minister has mentioned that the value of home holidays this year is likely to be about £18½ million; perhaps it may turn out to be a little more than that.  The estimated increase in the home holidays is in the order of £2 million over the previous year.  It is an encouraging sign that people were willing to stay at home.  It is something that might, perhaps, be pursued a bit further by Bord Fáilte, in the sense that Dublin is not the only sizeable industrial area.  There are other cities which have expanded; and the home holidays campaign, which was mainly centred on Dublin outwards, could be applied the other way round so as to encourage people in other parts of the country to spend holidays in or around Dublin.</P>
      <P>I should also like to say a word of appreciation in respect of the Irish Rugby Union for the efforts they made earlier in the year to try to resolve one of the unfortunate consequences of the cancellation of matches.  I should like to point out the very interesting fact that a few weeks ago in Belfast 10,000 people attended a rugby match&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is interesting to <Col N="1056" /> reflect on the reasons why people were afraid to come to Dublin to play football if others were prepared to go to Belfast.  I am referring to our friends across the water.  I should like to thank the Royal Dublin Society for their determination to go ahead and make a success of the Spring Show this year despite similar prejudicial efforts by people whose motives are not easy to interpret.</P>
      <P>The price of food and drink has been mentioned and this touches on an area which is very important in relation to tourism.  It is not possible to survive in any economy in which there are rising wages and costs if prices are not increased.  This does not mean that there should not be price discipline and as much competition as possible.</P>

      <P>I was speaking on the question of prices and the costs that must be absorbed in them.  There must be discipline in prices.  The competitiveness of tourism during the coming 12 months will depend on adherence to the wages agreement. There is a tendency to exaggerate the difference between prices here and those in other countries.  Although there is a serious situation regarding inflation it can, to some extent, be matched up with inflation in other countries.</P>
      <P>Senator Russell referred to the question of two many luxury hotels.  It is not possible to cater for conferences unless one is prepared to provide the type of accommodation required.  Some of the luxury hotels have been hit because the type of visitor who can afford them has been put off by the Northern troubles.  Mention was made of courtesy to visitors.  It is important that airline and shipping staffs should show every possible courtesy to visitors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister to keep a close eye on developments of all kinds which can have a bad environmental affect.  One of the great attractions of our country is the amenity aspect and, unless there is strict control of certain developments, the visitor <Col N="1057" /> will feel the ill-effects and will not continue to come here.</P>
    <P>I should like to compliment Bord Fáilte on their efforts abroad in these difficult times.  I urge those engaged in tourism to stick it out, as the opportunity will come to expand and provide a much wider area of employment.</P>

      <P>I welcome this Bill as a measure to give financial help to semi-State bodies doing an important job.  I have evidence of the work Bord Fáilte are doing and there is no doubt about its importance to the tourist trade.  This has resulted in an increase in our income from tourism. I should like to join with Senator Brugha and Senator Russell in complimenting the board on the job they are doing&mdash;a job made difficult by our political situation.  This is likely to remain for some time to come and, as Senator Brugha stated in his reference to the people in the tourist industry, we must stick it out and the people in the North must do likewise. It pleases me that the two tourist industries, North and South of the border, work together so well.  This should be encouraged in all regions of governmental activity, especially in regard to the semi-State bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am happy to join with Senator Brugha in complimenting the Irish Rugby Football Union on their efforts to get the visiting teams to play in Ireland last year.  I should like to point out also that the deputation which the IRFU sent to Scotland and Wales consisted of two Northerners.  That was a tremendously important point. It shows that in this area the Irish people as a whole were working together.  This is something which we should record.  Also I should like to join with Senator Brugha in complimenting the New Zealand Rugby touring team, the All Blacks, for playing in Dublin and Belfast.  I was happy to be present on both occasions and it is a real credit mark for New Zealand that they were able to come and get through all this bad publicity and play the game for what it was worth.  The reception they have received and will receive when they come back again to Dublin in January <Col N="1058" /> and when they play Munster is a tribute to their courage and to their sporting prowess.  I am very happy to put this on record and I think it should be done.</P>
    <P>There are a few points which I should like to take up in relation to Bord Fáilte's activities.  As I said at the beginning, Bord Fáilte play a very important role.  If I make some criticisms they are criticisms of a minor nature.  They are not always criticisms of Bord Fáilte either, but I fear that a body such as Bord Fáilte is indispensable.  As Senator Russell said earlier, I should be quite happy if the Minister came back and asked for more money for this enterprise in a year's time.  I am very impressed with their work and I think this sort of money is a really worthwhile investment.</P>
    <P>As Senator Russell also said, the efforts by Bord Fáilte to promote farmhouse holidays to get money into those areas of the country where it is badly needed&mdash;I am referring to the farm guesthouse scheme&mdash;are worth while.  The registers which Bord Fáilte put out are excellent.  The help they give to the people involved, the controls which they put in terms of cleanliness standards, the quality of meals provided, are excellent and they have paid off handsomely.  Here is money from tourists going where it is most needed, right into the pockets of the country people, the farmer's wife, the people who most need another interest, who most need a supplementary income. I am very pleased to compliment the board on their efforts in those directions.  I hope they will press on with this sort of scheme.  Not every scheme of this nature will automatically come off.  Some money must be put at risk, but if Bord Fáilte do this then the majority of these schemes will pay off.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the remarks which the Minister made in his address on the ending of our island status with the introduction of vehicle ferry services. I would particularly like him in his reply to say something about the position of the Continental ferry from Rosslare because I know that is something which has worried people and I <Col N="1059" /> know the Minister has been involved in the negotiations to ensure a service from Ireland to the Continent.  It goes direct and is tremendously important. I am one of those people who feel that there is terrific potential for development of our market with continental people.  Many of the attractions which this country holds would be of particular interest to people in Europe. They like our life-style, our casual approach to things, not in terms of service but in terms of life in general, perhaps.  They would greatly appreciate such a service and such a service would do a great deal to develop our links with the European countries.  It is particularly important now that we are embarking on entry to the European Economic Community.  In the European countries there is a great deal of interest in Ireland, its history and its present troubles, but I do not think that is going to dissuade people from coming.  They are interested in coming here and we can do a tremendous amount to increase our tourist trade to the Continent.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to the problem of Aer Lingus fares.  Senator Russell has already alluded to this and as a Corkman I must say that it is disgraceful there should be cheap fares between Dublin and London and that this facility should not be extended to Shannon and Cork.  I feel&mdash;and perhaps this is an area in which the Minister has some control&mdash;that the air fares between this country and Britain are ridiculously high.  I am not sure how these fares are fixed.  I am not sure if it is a ready-up between Aer Lingus and BEA but to me they are ridiculous and have driven me back to the boat.  The Minister probably never goes by boat.</P>
    <P>While we are on the subject of the boat let me refer to another area in which the Minister might have some control.  I can give him current prices because I bought tickets this morning for a journey from Dublin to Liverpool by my favourite shipping company, B &amp; I, and I bought a return ticket on a longer journey from Heysham to Belfast <i>via</i> British Rail. They are both one class boats, so there <Col N="1060" /> is no distinction; if anything the Heysham boat is better.  The B &amp; I fare from Dublin to Liverpool this morning was £4.50.  The Heysham to Belfast fare was £3.30.  That again seems to me to be an example of our attempts to price ourselves out of the market.  I do not see why B &amp; I, which is a company which is owned by this country, should charge fares which are higher for a shorter journey than the British Rail boat from Heysham to Belfast.  They are both car ferries. They are both roll-on/roll-off, both one class boats.  As I pointed out in another debate in this House, the B &amp; I boats are not all that marvellous. They may think they are, but I can assure them they are not.  There are a great many drawbacks.  They are not one bit better than the Heysham boat.  Why should they charge £1.20 more?  This is an area in which we have got to be very careful.  Our prices have rocketed.  I presume there are some reasons for these increases. Increases in prices should only be allowed where there is a very good reason.  The Minister cannot control the prices but he can exert pressure. This is the sort of pressure that a Minister for Transport and Power should be exerting on an Irish-owned company.</P>
    <P>The air fares have increased to such an extent that many people will find themselves in my position.  They will be driven back to travelling by boat. Are they going to travel by the Irish shipping company?  The answer is no. The other fare is £1.20 less.  Here is something the Minister could do.</P>
    <P>There is another point I should like to raise in connection with Bord Fáilte and that is their arrangement of conferences. In my pay packet 18 months or two years ago I got a little slip which said that anybody who was responsible for arranging conferences in Ireland should contact Bord Fáilte. They would help to send them abroad to arrange a further conference in Ireland and give them financial support. I have been responsible for arranging three conferences.  They have all been under the auspices of the Royal Irish Academy.  They have all been of the order of a couple of hundred <Col N="1061" /> people.  They have all been academic. In the line I am in I could not arrange a conference of horse breeders. I am not a horse breeder.  I have got to stick to mathematicians.  However, these conferences have done two things. They have helped the mathematical community in this country by bringing in a lot of outsiders to see what we were doing and tell us what they were doing.  They have given us a boost. They have also brought in a not inconsiderable amount of foreign currency. In all cases in which I have been involved the people said they would like to come back here for their holidays. We gave them a good time and some of them stayed on for their holidays. That is what a conference is about.  Many of them have come back as ordinary tourists.  So we have done something for the tourist trade.</P>
    <P>When I went along to Bord Fáilte and showed them their little slip&mdash;I was not a public representative at the time so I did not have much leverage &mdash;their conference by definition had to exceed 3,000 people.  It had to be a world conference.  They had to come over in ships of the size of the <i>Universe Ireland</i>.  They were not interested in the sort of conferences I was running. They would only give me funds to go to a conference if I could guarantee to bring back the International Union of Mathematicians, something of the order of 2,500 or 3,000.  My reaction to this was that, if this was the case, then they should make their information absolutely clear on the slips we get with our pay cheques.  If I had been a public representative at the time I got these slips and went to Bord Fáilte I would have kicked up a bit of a stink and would have seen the Minister about this.  Here information was being handed out which was not absolutely correct.  I went away a bit disgruntled.</P>
    <P>There is tremendous scope here for the running of conferences of all sizes. I hope Bord Fáilte will not turn up their noses at a conference of the order of 100 or 200 people which I might bring over here or which I might be responsible for organising. They very graciously give us these little satchels which, I suppose, cost them about 10p each.  It was not really <Col N="1062" /> a help.  They should make some effort to deal with the smaller groups of people who do wish to come over and who do make a real contribution. These are some criticisms, but not all of Bord Fáilte.  I am fully convinced they do a very important job.  I am very happy to support this Bill which in essence gives Bord Fáilte a subvention and I feel that their activities could be extended with greater benefit to the country.  I compliment them on their efforts.  I am happy that they work in conjunction with the Northern Ireland Tourist Board.  I hope that they and the other regional tourist organisations will stick at it in these troubled times.  I have no doubt our tourist industry will benefit from the work they are doing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeggyFarrell" hpid="Mrs. Farrell Mrs. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome this Bill.  I am happy to know that Bord Fáilte are to be in a position to pay their debts.  It would not be a good thing if a State body could be accused of getting business people into trouble because they had not given them the money they should.  I listened with interest when Senator West complimented Bord Fáilte on the farm guesthouse scheme.  This is one of the best schemes that has been launched here.  A lot of people seem to have forgotten that the original idea for farm guesthouse holidays came not from Bord Fáilte but from the Irish Countrywomen's Association in 1954. In the initial stages, but for the support given to Bord Fáilte by this association this scheme would not have been the success it is today.  It was largely through the Irish Countrywomen's Association that Bord Fáilte started giving the courses to the farmhouse guest keepers.  It was they originally, in conjunction with Bord Fáilte, started fáilte tuaithe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When semi-State bodies are involved with voluntary organisations they should give these voluntary organisations the credit due to them.  This has been overlooked down through the years by Bord Fáilte.  It is now a very successful scheme but they should remember where that scheme started. They should remember that their first farmhouse guest keepers were all members of the Irish Countrywomen's <Col N="1063" /> Association.  I am not in any way denigrating the part played by Bord Fáilte.  They have given subventions for courses.  They have been very good about the back-up given to the women involved in the scheme.  They have arranged courses for them, free of charge, where they were instructed in the best methods of keeping their houses.  This scheme has given not alone visitors from outside the country but people who are now living in large urban areas and have lost contact with the rural communities a chance to go back to the roots from where all urban society started.  It is a scheme to be encouraged.  I hope it will continue to prosper.</P>
    <P>Senator Russell mentioned that Bord Fáilte when they started out on the luxury hotel scheme aimed at the wrong sector of the market, which was the American one.  Perhaps that was a mistake but it was one that is now paying dividends.  According to the figures issued this year the American tourists supported us and spent the most money here.  We would all like to see the ordinary English people coming here.  They do not know a great deal about this country and, certainly in former days before the trouble in the North started, more emphasis should have been placed on the English market.</P>
    <P>In connection with English visitors, one of the ideas which must be sold &mdash;I am glad to see it is now being done&mdash;is a package holiday.  For too long, people coming here did not know what their holiday would cost them. They came with the idea that it was a land flowing with milk and honey, almost free of charge.  They were sold the idea of a cheap holiday.  Anybody who has gone on a package tour to other countries, if they stick strictly to the arrangements made will not, perhaps spend much money but if they buy a cup of coffee away from their hotel, they will soon find that their holiday is quite expensive.</P>
    <P>If one goes abroad without going on a package holiday it can prove quite expensive in many of the best tourist countries.  The Netherlands is a great tourist country, but it is quite <Col N="1064" /> an expensive one; yet nobody seems to mind.  It is good to see a value for money holiday but the time has gone when this country and most other countries can sell cheap holidays, except that by having a package tour one can get reductions.  People must be prepared to give the best value for money rather than trying to give a cheap holiday.</P>
    <P>I read with some alarm letters in the newspapers from people complaining that when they went to book for package holidays in Irish hotels they were told either that the season for package holidays was over or that for some other reason they could not avail of this scheme.  If the hoteliers and Bord Fáilte are in earnest about holidays at home they must give a better deal to those people they wish to keep at home.</P>
    <P>When we campaign to sell our country abroad we try to compete with the sunny countries&mdash;Italy, Spain and Portugal.  We cannot compete with them.  We had an American Ambassador who said: &ldquo;The Irish are very foolish that they do not sell their country as the land of eternal spring.&rdquo; This is what we have and it is on this aspect we should place our emphasis. When I visited the Netherlands this year I went to see the tulip fields and they were worth seeing.  There were many nationalities there looking at the acres of tulips and I thought that there was nothing to stop us doing the same here.  We have better land that the Netherlands, even though we are a long way behind them in development.  It is something constructive which could be done, certainly down in the South of Ireland. I read with interest of one scheme which has been started in Upton this year where they hope to have some acreage of bulbs.  This is something in which Bord Fáilte could interest themselves.  They could have a festival of flowers, the rudiments of which are well established in the south, and it could be well developed.  Our climate would be ideal for such a festival.</P>
    <P>We are inclined to be very apologetic about our climate.  If I am basing much of what I am saying on a recent visit to the Netherlands it is because I was struck by the similarity <Col N="1065" /> in the climate between our two countries. I saw what the Dutch were able to do with their country.  They have outdoor cafés but they are enclosed in glass and are heated.  At times I felt like a chicken in a brooder house with all the heaters.  It was the kind of atmosphere which lent gaiety to the scene.  It rained during two days but they just covered the tables on the pavement until the next fine day. Then the tables were out again.  This is something which our restaurants and hotels could copy.  A little originality on our part could go a long way towards helping the tourist trade and, at the same time, making the scene a bit gayer.</P>
    <P>We now have a very good standard in our hotels generally.  Looking back over the last ten or 12 years, the improvements made have been enormous. People are availing more and more of the facilities.  As men will not mention it, I must draw attention to the fact that the cleanliness of some of the hotels, even the AA and RIAC graded hotels, have a lot to be desired especially in the washrooms and toilets. Some of the toilets are absolutely revolting. It would be no harm if Bord Fáilte were to promote a &ldquo;bathroom and toilet cleaning year&rdquo;, a &ldquo;Tidy Toilet&rdquo; competition as well as a &ldquo;Tidy Town&rdquo; competition.  They should not give Grade A stars to hotels where the washing-up facilities are not in immaculate condition.  The cleaning of toilets and bathrooms is much too slipshod.  It does not give a good impression.  The lack of cleanliness was one of the major complaints made by visitors.  Nowadays it is a bad reflection on us as a nation.  The hotel inspectors should be more vigilant in this regard and they should see to it that we have the standard of cleanliness which is expected in a civilised country at the present day.</P>
    <P>Somebody spoke of the selling of Ireland.  We do not sell our country properly.  The BBC made a film of people disembarking from the Fish-guard ferry and a BBC reporter asked them their impressions of their holiday if they were frightened of being here and how they got on and so on. That one programme did more for <Col N="1066" /> Irish tourism than Bord Fáilte's marketing people did in England for the last 12 months.  Why do Bord Fáilte not obtain those films and have them shown?</P>
    <P>I have a pet hobby horse which I mention from time to time and it is this.  A number of our people living in America are retiring on fairly large social security pensions and with a little encouragement we could get them to settle back here.  We would then have permanent tourists, if you like to call them that, who would provide a good dollar income every year and we would be helping to bring people back to their own country.  A number of them are coming back each year and settling down here but Bord Fáilte could do more to encourage them to come for a holiday and observe how the country has improved in their absence.  Having seen how the country has progressed they could be encouraged to settle down here again. They have good pensions which are paid in dollars, and we need dollars. If Bord Fáilte could include such dollar revenue in our tourist earnings it would prove to be an enormous boost.</P>
    <P>In the tourist amenity scheme, I am glad to see that playgrounds are being provided for children.  I should like to see more playgrounds provided.  I have not seen the Tramore scheme but I have heard that it is very good indeed. However, such facilities should not be confined to seaside resorts only.  They should be provided in inland towns and areas with good fishing lakes where tourists interested in fishing spend their holidays.  The fisherman's wife and children have very little to occupy their time.  If playgrounds were provided for the children it would be a step in the right direction.  While their children are in the playgrounds the mothers could relax and read a book knowing that their children are being well looked after.  The wives of men who come here on fishing holidays find it a problem to keep the children entertained while their menfolk are fishing.</P>
    <P>I wish Bord Fáilte continued success. They are doing a good job of work although they are a much criticised <Col N="1067" /> body.  It may be said that they have made mistakes in the past but it is easy for us to criticise.  I hope that more financial help will be forthcoming for them and that, when the time is ripe, they will be able to increase the tourist trade to a far greater degree.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill gives us an opportunity of taking a brief look at the activities of one of our semi-State bodies.  We frequently have such Bills before us.  Recently we had a Bill in connection with the Electricity Supply Board and there are other Bills pertaining to semi-State bodies to come before us shortly.  I cannot but comment on the lack of interest which those boards take in the proceedings of this House.  Some ten or 12 years ago it would be quite common to have some of the chief executives of those bodies present in the Visitors' Gallery listening to the praise, blame and suggestions made.  I would draw the Minister's attention to this apparent lack of interest on their part.</P>
      <P>The Houses of the Oireachtas are, in a sense, the board of directors of those bodies.  We are in a position to make useful suggestions to them and I believe the Minister should see to it, when a Bill is introduced in the House relating to a semi-State body, that a special invitation is issued from his office asking them to ensure that as many of their executives as possible be present during the passage of the Bill.</P>
      <P>This Bill is to provide more money for the tourist trade.  As the Minister remarked in his introductory speech, there are no new schemes advocated in it.  The money is required to tide Bord Fáilte over the next couple of years until they have had an opportunity of completing their general review of prospects for the years ahead. When that time comes we hope they will be able to produce some new scheme and if it is worth while the Oireachtas will have no hesitation in funding it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill marks the end of the sixties. The progress reported in that decade shows that we had an increase of 5 per cent per annum in the number of beds available in hotels and guesthouses. It is a very modest increase <Col N="1068" /> but the Minister has quite rightly pointed out that we seem to have enough accommodation available for the next few years.  Our aim now should be to make better use and increase the standard of the accommodation available.  Bord Fáilte should be forced to adopt this policy.</P>
    <P>The type of tourist accommodation provided in the sixties led to a deterioration in standards and service. While the drop in the numbers of tourists this year may have been disheartening for many hotel owners it may yet prove to have been of advantage in the long run because it will afford us an opportunity of planning and redeveloping for the coming years on a much higher level.  The lesson was brought home very forcibly to hotel owners this year that service and accommodation must be good if they are to compete successfully for trade. Only those hotels who provided good facilities and services had a moderately good year.</P>
    <P>I would like to see a go-slow policy in development which would enable us to concentrate more on quality than on quantity.  We should not be alarmed about the importance of the tourist trade to our economy.  While it is of considerable importance&mdash;the total earnings this year is estimated at £88 million; the top was £100 million &mdash;the output from agriculture this year will probably be of the order of £500 million.  Therefore, tourism is still a minor industry compared to our major industry, agriculture.  Consequently we should see it in that perspective and should try to develop what we have that is unique, such as the farm holiday scheme, as mentioned by Senator Farrell.  That undoubtedly has been a tremendous success and it seems a basis on which we can really expand in the future.</P>
    <P>I have not figures available but I would hazard a guess that there cannot be more than about 3,000 registered under that scheme at present. Yet the potential should be in the region of 200,000 farm holdings.  I do not see why the scheme should stop at farm holdings.  In other words, any house in the country is in a position to avail of this type of farm holiday <Col N="1069" /> scheme and I would suggest that in the review being made by Bord Fáilte special attention be paid to this.  It also helps to make up for poor ulitisation of labour on some farms.  With the advent of labour-saving devices the amount of work to be done on small and medium farms is decreasing every year.  Consequently, the owners are of necessity looking for some means of diversification of their activities and of a way of supplementing their incomes. The type of genuine entertainment that farm owners would get from participating in such a scheme would be a tremendous advantage and would be a means of brightening country life.</P>
    <P>Many of our country people have a great facility for story-telling and for striking up genuine friendships with their visitors.  Through meeting people from so many different backgrounds, there is a foundation for a very happy partnership in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>The summer period is now tending to be less demanding in regard to farm work.  The heaviest work period occurs in spring.  Summer activities, such as the conservation of food, is now reduced to a telephone call to the silage operator to come and put the silage in the pit.  There is therefore more time available in summer and it relates particularly to the small farms in the west where the farm holiday scheme would be a genuine boost to income.  If we intend to develop it we should insist very rigidly on training and on setting high standards.  We could do a great deal more in that regard.</P>
    <P>Other facilities that may be available on a farm are pony-riding and the hiring of the family car, the latter being usually underutilised.  Our tourist trade, which provides short-term employment&mdash;usually not more than four or five months&mdash;should be looked on as a type of vacation employment for groups seeking such employment. People from our various educational levels could supply the main work force.</P>
    <P>We should make better use of our hotels and guesthouses by lengthening <Col N="1070" /> the tourist season.  Although there has been much emphasis on this during the past ten years, I have not seen much action taken to encourage it.  The key to lengthening the season beyond the standard July-August pattern to a June-September one must begin with the school year.  With holidays concentrated in July and August it means that the parents of children attending primary schools are forced to take holidays during that period.  I do not see why the primary school attendance could not be rearranged so as to permit of a June or September holiday pattern. This would not apply so much to secondary schools or universities because such students provide a fair measure of the labour force during the peak period of July and August.  However, anything that can diversify the holiday season is worth examining.</P>
    <P>Most factories close down for the first two weeks of August and it would be worth while in regard to increasing the holiday period, if it could be shifted from the main July-August period, or any extra days granted should be given at a time that would encourage people to take holidays during the off-peak season.</P>
    <P>There is much retraining needed at all levels, especially to meet the demands and tasks of Common Market membership, and retraining could very well be interwoven with partial holidays. In this way use could be made of unused holiday facilities in holiday resorts, such as Kilkee, where there is a great waste of resources at the end of the holiday season.  Why not open these and utilise them for training groups, at the same time allowing them free time, so as to encourage the combination of holidays with work?  I suggest the months of May and October for the carrying out of such schemes.</P>

      <P>Senator Farrell touched on something which I stressed many times in the House, that is, the potential for permanent tourists.  It is up to us, through retirement schemes and other methods to encourage people with or without Irish connections from abroad to spend their declining years here.  The late Fr. Coyne of the Irish Agricultural Organisation Society had a scheme in which he envisaged that an area of Cork and Kerry would be constituted a death <Col N="1072" /> duty free area to attract people with reasonable means from abroad to spend their retirement there.  Considerable thought should be given to this in the planned review.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be infinitely better than the temporary tourist who stays for two or three weeks, even though we need him so badly.  Bord Fáilte have instituted many good schemes, including the Tidy Towns Competition, which have done excellent work.  At present they could institute some kind of scheme for value for money in hotels.  I know one hotel where the finest facilities are available for £20 per week in the best scenic location I have seen in this country.  I can give the name of that hotel to the Minister.  They seem to make an excellent success of it and prosper on it.  There are other hotels charging anything from £35 to £40 per week and they are not in the same class as this one.  Is there any means of encouraging a scheme by which hotels could be selected by a panel of judges as hotels giving excellent value for money?  We could go further than that and investigate how these hotels can do it.  Perhaps there would be a great deal to be learned from their methods and these lessons could be passed on to the trainers of future hotel staff and hotel managers.  That is the type of value for money we want to get and which tourists, whether at home or abroad, will appreciate.</P>
      <P>I want to join with Senator West in condemning as strongly as possible the arrogant suggestion by Aer Lingus that there was only one airport in the country and that they were going to introduce special week-end fares valid only from Dublin to London, completely ignoring the claims of Cork and Shannon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I know it is, but I cannot understand the thinking that would for one moment allow any national body to come forward with <Col N="1073" /> such a biased scheme.  I hope the Minister has taken the opportunity of pointing out how biased this was.</P>
      <P>In general, air fares are much too high.  The distance between Los Angeles and San Francisco is about the same&mdash;a one hour jet flight&mdash;as from Cork to London, yet the fare there is less than half the Cork to London fare.  I cannot understand the high air fares between here and the United Kingdom.  It is not right or proper that Aer Lingus should be operating some routes at an artificially high charge so as to provide subsidies for other routes. They must be making a handsome profit on the Cork&mdash;London and the Dublin&mdash;London flights.  From the economic standpoint all flights should be self-sufficient.  If subsidies are to be provided for groups that have to be helped along for some time, that should be done through government aid.</P>
      <P>I accept the Minister's proposal to continue what we have for another two years.  I hope he will press on strongly with the review and that the House will have sufficient information. I suggest that the Minister should issue a White Paper on tourism in the seventies and eighties so that we will have an opportunity of studying that before we are faced with other short Bills like this which cost many millions.</P>

      <P>I welcome this Bill which proposes to raise the statutory limits on the aggregate amounts of money which may be paid to Bord Fáilte for the giving of grants for holiday accommodation and the development of resorts under the major resort development scheme.  I want to congratulate Bord Fáilte on the original idea of selecting specific areas.  Originally there were 12 areas and now I understand that there are 14 major resorts in five areas.  It was wiser to select those for major development rather than go piecemeal which would never give the same effect or result.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Killarney, Ballybunion and the <Col N="1074" /> Dingle peninsula were selected in Kerry.  Nobody was surprised that Killarney was selected because it is known world wide as a tourist resort, but we were all delighted when Ballybunion was selected.  It was a shot in the arm for a small resort and we have reaped great benefits from its being placed in one of the major areas. Unfortunately, it was one of the resorts that had not the job finished.  I hope that this &ldquo;unfinished symphony&rdquo; that we have in Ballybunion will be finished now that Bord Fáilte are getting this extra money.  It was not altogether Bord Fáilte's fault, I would say, but all the obstacles have now gone by the wayside and I hope that one side of our beach will not from now on be laughing at the other.</P>
    <P>The selection of Ballybunion for major development has increased its popularity.  Major resorts do not deserve to be classified as such unless they have recreational facilities and the board should ensure that these are provided.  These major resorts should also have a cultural centre.  Many of the minor resorts have done trojan work through voluntary organisations with the help of relief schemes and county councils.  They will soon be classified as major resorts.  One of these is Ballyheigue.</P>
    <P>I was pleased to hear the Minister state that we should sell &ldquo;quality holidays&rdquo; as we sell &ldquo;quality Irish&rdquo;. Copying other countries will not help and this is being done in the area of food, architecture and recreation.  Our own cultural heritage and way of life should prove more attractive.  Some people decry names of villages in Irish on signposts, but this makes them attractive to the tourist.</P>
    <P>Some of the major hotels, especially those opened three years ago, have taken a great hammering because of the tourist slump.  They should get concessions to tide them over a difficult period.  When a major hotel falls by the wayside, the whole resort suffers.</P>
    <P>It is not true that directors of the regional boards receive payment.  They are voluntary workers.  I join with Senator Mrs. Farrell in complimenting the farm guesthouse owners and <Col N="1075" /> the role the ICA played in encouraging them.  If we had cheap weekend rates in hotels during the off-season it would attract tourists from England, especially Irish people living there who would be glad to take the opportunity of spending a few days visiting relatives.</P>
    <P>Public houses do a lot for tourism and they get no appreciation.  In many areas where there are no recreational facilities there is nowhere else for tourists to go.  Some publicans have modernised their premises at great expense.  These premises do not qualify for a grant for major improvements and, not only that, but they are penalised by having their valuations doubled and trebled.  Bord Fáilte should take a look at this situation.  I should like to ask the Minister to ensure that resorts which have not had their major developments completed will benefit from the extra money received by Bord Fáilte.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support this Bill.  Bord Fáilte and all semi-State organisations should, in these difficult years from a tourist point of view, continue not only to provide as much money as possible for building up our resorts but to realise it is imperative to keep pressure up on the advertising side.  We should have an &ldquo;Ireland House&rdquo; in all the cities from which we get good tourist support, so that not only can Bord Fáilte be seen to be adequately represented and have a shop window but also Aer Lingus and other semi-State organisations should be able to provide as comprehensive a service as possible in as economic a way as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad this extra money is being sought by Bord Fáilte.  It is to be hoped there will be more equitable distribution of these funds.  The Midland Regional Tourism organisation cater for seven Midland counties, and since these regional boards have been set up we have been looked upon as the cinderella region.  We have many national assets and, even if the board are not prepared to adequately develop them, they should provide sufficient money to ensure that they will be <Col N="1076" /> conserved.  From an ecology point of view it is very important that the River Shannon and the lake district in the Midland region be developed.  The same applies to mountainous areas such as the Slieve Bloom range, which is virtually uninhabited.  Within ten miles of that mountain mass there are 70,000 people living in the catchment areas; yet there are only about three roads going through this large area of mountain.  It is exactly the same as when Finn Mac Cool left it many years ago.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that this year Bord Fáilte allocated only £3,000 to County Laois out of £40,000 allocated for the seven counties in the region, as a contribution to tourism.  It was spent on amenity schemes in the Slieve Bloom area.  If the midland region is the poor relation, County Laois in the southern part of the area is surely the odd man out.  If one presses the case too strongly at board meetings one is accused of having a parochial outlook.  There is a limit to what a county can accept.</P>
    <P>The Minister has done much for tourism in this area, which up to this has not been regarded as a tourist area. Nevertheless it has amenities and a potential that the seaside resorts cannot offer.  There is pollution all over Europe, especially in the thickly populated areas.  People from these centres of population and the bigger cities of Britain can find here peace, seclusion and happiness in a friendly setting. Indeed, the fact that one can have long stretches of road to oneself is something which we should endeavour to sell.</P>
    <P>I was interested in Senator Farrell's account of her Dutch holiday. I know that Lakeland have organised for the coming season packaged holidays at an inclusive rate of £31 for eight days for visitors from Holland. This is a tremendous package holiday. Great credit is due to the hotels and administration in the midland region for organising it.  It is a start and should prove successful.  They have the cooperation of the various transport facilities also.  We look forward to development on those lines.</P>
    <P>It is quite obvious, looking at the <Col N="1077" /> season that has gone by and perhaps reading the too frequent reports and letters from dissatisfied holidaymakers in the national papers, that the wellrun family hotels in this country gave the best service mainly because they were able to give that personal service to ensure personal satisfaction.  I had American visitors in the House this year&mdash;a parliamentarian on his honey-moon&mdash;who stayed in grade A hotels all over the country.  The first morning he was here he came down for breakfast shortly after 10 a.m. to be told that breakfast was off and that he could have his lunch at 1.30 p.m.  I know they must have rules and must have hours, but when they are not that rushed, as they certainly were not this year, there could be a little more of the personal element and there should be a little more understanding.  They should endeavour to see that their patrons are that little bit happier.</P>
    <P>I am not sorry for the hotels if they have a bad season for the simple reason that they are not even civil in most of them at the present time.  There is a degree of indifference and intolerance and I am surprised that people bother to stay in them at all.  The type of people who stay in guest houses are not from the lower or the middle income groups but are invariably professional people and people from the higher income group.  They stay in guest houses because they can enjoy there an easy, unorganised, carefree holiday. their time is very much their own and their is the very minimum of regimentation. This is the kind of holiday that we should endeavour to sell.  People from outside the country think that time does not matter here.  If we can get back to that kind of personal service, people who are used to the hurly burly of urban living, where time is so important, could completely unwind on a nice carefree holiday where clock watching might be forgotten. They could certainly enjoy a different way of life a way of life still very much the tradition in rural Ireland.  Bord Fáilte should take more cognisance of the many complaints passed on to them.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister would let us know if the ferry service to the Continent will be in operation this coming <Col N="1078" /> year.  In the Midlands we find the one great advantage the continental motorist has here is that the roads are relatively free of traffic.  They have a tremendous amount of freedom here and greater emphasis should be placed on this.</P>
    <P>Some months ago I asked Aer Lingus about a copy of a film which was made by Emerald Starline, a company operating cruises on the Shannon.  The Irish Society in Vienna were anxious to have travel films and literature on Ireland.  I saw this excellent film about the waterways and canals of this country.  I was told there was a German copy of this film in Frankfurt and that Aer Lingus would send it on.  Several months later I discovered the film had not been sent. If an organisation such as Aer Lingus promise to do a simple job like that, it is bad form if they just forget or fail to do it.  There is not much point in a private firm like Emerald Starline going to the trouble of making a travel documentary and allowing the finished product to remain in cans in Aer Lingus offices or in Bord Fáilte offices. Films like this should be utilised to the very fullest, more especially when people are looking for this kind of feature film.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to a problem we have in the Midland region, which as I said, comprises seven counties. Four of these counties are roughly west of the Shannon and are designated. The larger grants are available for these four counties invariably are not fully taken up.  It is very difficult to get sufficient finance to meet the demands from the other counties not designated.  Can we take it that in the case of Clara in County Offaly, which was declared a designated area for industrial grants purposes last year, the same designation will apply in that area for the grants scheme operated by Bord Fáilte through the Midland Regional Tourism Board?  This should be the case and would certainly be a help to the people in the area.</P>
    <P>I should like to compliment the many people in Bord Fáilte who through difficult seasons gone by have endeavoured to keep the flag <Col N="1079" /> flying and do the best they could.  They are doing a fair job but they have got more than their share of adverse publicity in the last year.  I regret to say there is seldom smoke without fire. Not too long ago a high official from Bord Fáilte came to one of the midland regional meetings with a document he wished to put through in a very hamfisted way.  When members of the board found fault with the document this gentleman took umbrage and said it was a reflection on his integrity because he was the author of the document.  If we are to have amateurs in high places in semi-State bodies like Bord Fáilte trying to pull fast ones in these unorthodox ways it is bad.  I do not care how senior people in semi-State bodies are appointed as long as they have sufficient experience to be able to impress the people they are paid to serve.  We have had people like Tom O'Gorman who have done a tremendous job in getting the regions going&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I welcome this Bill to increase the moneys to enable Bord Fáilte to carry out their commitments. <Col N="1080" /> I should like to take this opportunity to congratulate Bord Fáilte on the manner in which they are promoting tourism.  The past few years have been very difficult in view of the trouble which has taken place in the Northern part of our country.  The board are to be complimented on the manner in which they have counteracted the propaganda used by the English, in particular, in relation to holidaying in Ireland.</P>
      <P>Having congratulated them in that respect, I regret they cannot be complimented on the manner in which they distribute the moneys at their disposal. Too much of that money is being channelled into major resorts such as Tramore, Salthill and Killarney, to mention but a few.  These areas are already very well developed.  The trend among holiday-makers today is to get away from crowded areas.  They prefer quieter places where they are guaranteed open spaces and free access.  In West Cork there is a stretch of coastline from Kinsale almost to the Kerry boundary which is very beautiful from a scenic point of view.  It is to be regretted that the amount of money put at our disposal by Bord Fáilte for grants for the development of that area is negligible.  Along that stretch of coastline there are many sandy beaches and harbours where people can enjoy their holiday in perfect safety.</P>
      <P>One finds that in the majority of those resorts there are not the required facilities in relation to toilets or bathing boxes.  It is a pity Bord Fáilte have not taken a greater interest in areas such as this and made money available for the provision of the necessary amenities there.  I am a member of the local authority.  It is quite a usual practice at our meetings to have deputations from the residents of these resorts requesting financial assistance to improve the existing facilities.  This has happened year in year out without any great development in west Cork as a result.  I would ask the Minister to bear this in mind and ensure that west Cork gets its fair share of the cake.  The majority of tourists do not wish to spend their holidays in overcrowded areas.  They want the peace and quiet of the countryside.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1081" /> I should like to congratulate the regional tourist bodies on the wonderful work they are doing.  They have done a tremendous job in promoting tourism and in co-ordinating an excellent service to ensure that our tourists are catered for in every way possible.  I served on the southern regional board for a number of years. I have a good idea of what is involved and the great work they have done. If a tourist flies over from England to Cork city and wishes to visit Castle-townbere he can go into a tourist office in the city and have his accommodation reserved before he leaves.  In addition, the regional tourist boards have done a considerable amount in promoting farm guesthouse holidays.  They must take the major part of the credit for this development in so far as a number of managers and assistant managers who had specific areas to deal with were able to give the information required in relation to standards laid down by Bord Fáilte <i>et cetera</i> to farm guesthouse owners.</P>
    <P>We all realise that the family type guesthouse and hotel are very much in demand for many reasons.  Their price is right and they can give good accommodation and service.  They make a holiday very pleasant for those who visit them.  I agree entirely with the policy of Bord Fáilte in relation to the standards required to ensure that accommodation is satisfactory.  I hope the board will continue to ensure that there is constant review to see that these standards are maintained.  It is of the utmost importance that our accommodation be of the very best standard to ensure that our tourists will be satisfied in every respect.  Bord Fáilte should continue to keep a close check on the industry and investigate any complaints made.</P>
    <P>The Minister will be able to help in this regard.  There are still many areas, in West Cork especially and in other parts of the country, where the ESB has not provided a service.  If the service was provided it would ensure that more accommodation would become available.  Every incentive should be given to small farmers to improve their homes and so offer more accommodation. These incentives would result <Col N="1082" /> in the people meeting more tourists, thus making their lives more interesting as well as supplementing their incomes. Therefore, I would ask the Minister to ensure that the ESB will provide electricity for farm guest houses in areas where it is not available at present, along our coastline in particular.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister to increase the grants for farm guest houses.  The costs of materials have increased and the grants should be reviewed to ensure that the standard is maintained.  I congratulate the Minister on this Bill and wish Bord Fáilte every success.</P>

      <P>At this stage of the debate there is relatively little left to say which has not already been covered.  I hope not to be unduly repetitious of what other Members have said, but there are a few points I should like to mention in debating this Bill in which we are granting a large sum for the promotion of the tourist industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The last few years hold lessons for us in regard to the tourist industry. There is a danger that we will not learn the right lessons from what has happened.  In some of the discussion in regard to the tourist industry one finds a tendency to blame all the present difficulties of the tourist industry on the existing situation in Northern Ireland.  While this is undoubtedly a large factor in the situation, to take such a simplistic view of the present difficulties of the tourist industry is very dangerous for our future planning. The tourist industry was showing signs of faltering growth even before the publicity in regard to Northern Ireland was of such a nature in the world press as to create difficulties for Irish tourism. If we look back to what now appears as almost a fairy tale time of long ago when this country had a Third Programme for Economic Expansion and Social Development, at that stage our tourist industry was blooming to the extent that the tourist target, which was a high one, was the only target of that programme to be achieved in the first few years of its existence.  From those days of a high target achieved and sometimes exceeded, <Col N="1083" /> we have come now to a stage over the past few years of stagnation, even in money terms, and in fact regression, if the change in the value of money is allowed for.</P>
    <P>It is completely insufficient for us in tourist planning to think of our situation as being one of living through the difficulties created by the Northern situation and of then being able to resume the tourist boom days which we had some time ago.  We were already showing signs of strain before that time. There were already signs that we were making the mistake of riding the boom without thinking of what was going to come.  This is a natural tendency, not to change the tactics of a winning game.  This appeared to be a winning game in the business of competing against other countries in the attraction of tourists.  Where we made the mistake was in not having a tourist policy which was at once flexible and rugged; flexible, in that it did not go for certain well-defined lines and ignore other approaches, and rugged in the sense that it would be able to stand up against difficulties either expected or unexpected.  I do not want to discuss this matter at length, but I think it is a most important factor which should be taken into account in our planning.</P>
    <P>There was also a deterioration in service and in many of the elements of our tourist industry.  There was a failure, as Senator Farrell has indicated already, to meet this problem of cleanliness in regard to much of our accommodation and in particular of the toilet accommodation, not only in our hotels but in places of public resort as well.  During this boom period we failed to tackle and surmount those problems.</P>
    <P>We must look in future to a much more diverse policy of tourism.  In these days of intense competition our tourist performance is still a good one.  I am not attempting to deny that.  If we are to continue taking advantage of the natural resources available we must do a great deal of hard thinking.  One of the mistakes we made was not to distinguish enough between the visitor who would come once and the visitor who would return and therefore be of <Col N="1084" /> definite value to us.  This is one of the troubles about pouring money into the promotion of the American market, that a high proportion of them are once-only tourists.  A trip to Ireland is struck off their list of things to be done. In the future we will have to set our sights towards tourists who are liable to come back again.</P>
    <P>In the course of my work I have occasion to visit many European countries and it is always interesting to get the reaction of people there who have visited Ireland.  I find it interesting, in view of what Senator Farrell said about the Netherlands, and it has been my experience, that by far the most favourable remarks about holidays in this country come from people in the Netherlands.  It is only in the Netherlands that one comes across many people who have taken repeated holidays here.</P>
    <P>There may be something here on which we could mount a special policy. There may be some type of exchange tourism scheme feasible.  It has been my experience, and the experience of many of my friends&mdash;apparently it has also been the experience of Senator Farrell&mdash;that we, as Irish people, feel at home on holidays in the Netherlands.  It is one of the European countries in which we can have a really pleasant holiday.  I do not believe this is due entirely to the similarity of our climates.  I have found that the people one talks to in the Netherlands, some of them in the hotel business itself, who take their holidays from the hotels in this country, are inclined to come back but among those who are inclined to come back there seems to be a common element in that they did not take an ordinary holiday here.  They tended to take what one might call an activity holiday.  They tended to be either Dutch people who are completely sold on our caravan holidays&mdash;this is true also of people from some parts of Germany&mdash;or people who are keen on fishing holidays or other types of holidays which are essentially based on an activity.</P>
    <P>My limited experience of talking to those people leads me to the view that one of the directions in which we will have to move most forcibly is towards <Col N="1085" /> holidays for people who are not just coming to see Ireland, sample our roads, see our scenery and who having seen it once would not be tempted to come again, but rather holidays for people who are coming here to indulge in the Irish environment and in an activity in which they are extremely interested.  We should ensure that they come back again to indulge in the same activity and in the same environment which they find so pleasant.  We can rely too much on our scenery. We can rely too much on our open roads.  We can rely too much on our half-empty beaches.  Any planning which will be undertaken in the future will have to be highly diversified so that any factor which tends to interfere with one activity will have only a minor effect on the general level of our tourist business.  Among those diverse activities we cannot be content with just the charm of Ireland or the charm of the Irish people.  Holidays will have to be more highly designed.</P>
    <P>I bring those few thoughts to the notice of the House and the Minister because I feel it would be fatal for us, and fatal for the future of our tourist industry, to think that everything will be grand in our tourist industry when matters settle down again in the North. They will not.  Tourism has become a highly competitive business and in that business we will have to have a well-designed product.  This does not just mean good marketing.  We know, in regard to our industrial goods, that we cannot market an industrial product unless it is well-designed and well-packaged. That is true also of our holidays. We did make an initial impact on the market because what we sold was different but we will not be able to continue to sell it in the future unless it is well presented, well-designed and, above all, not deceptive.  Once we have surmounted our temporary difficulties we can go forward to another tourist boom.  However, we can do this only if we plan for that future without complacency in regard to our past and present performance.</P>

      <P>I welcome this Bill and I welcome it particularly as a member of the Eastern Regional <Col N="1086" /> Tourism Board, on which I represent the now defunct Bray UDC.  I welcome it because of the great things the scheme provides.  There is provision for seaside development, provision for toilet facilities, shelters, car parks, promenades, parks and other amenities. They are the fundamentals necessary in any seaside resort for the attraction of tourists.  The Minister has referred to the provision of facilities in many parts of my area, in Bray, Dún Laoghaire, Skerries, Arklow and Greystones.  I should like to thank him and Bord Fáilte for the improvements they have carried out in those areas.  We appreciate those improvements enormously but there are still many things which are a cause of annoyance to me and to the members of my board.</P>
      <P>I have in my hand a receipt for a drink in the Intercontinental Hotel, Dublin, where a beer cost 17p, a vodka and white lemonade cost 31p and a &ldquo;Bloody Mary&rdquo; cost 41p, making a total cost of 89p.  In addition, there was a service charge of 16p added because those drinks were taken in the foyer of the hotel.  A tourist who enters that hotel for a drink and is presented with a bill which includes a service charge of 16p for the service of drinks costing 89p is not likely to return here.  This is the type of thing that puts off our tourists and I am very concerned about it.  We are pricing ourselves out of the tourist market.</P>
      <P>We had a leaflet distributed to all Senators and Deputies the other day which showed that in 1965 the difference in the price of a drink here and in Edinburgh was approximately three old pence.  While the Edinburgh price was then three old pence dearer than ours today our price is seven old pence dearer than theirs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is something wrong here.  I think we are allowing things to get out of perspective because of a tie-up in the licensed trade which, being a closed one, is being allowed to get away with murder.  At present we have a lot of madmen like Pat Quinn&mdash;Moore v. Quinn&mdash;mad to buy Mooney's public-houses at any price.  They are the people who in a few years time will produce figures as to why there should be an increase in drink prices because <Col N="1087" /> of what they had to pay out to obtain their premises.</P>

      <P>As Senator Boland, who like me is a member of a regional tourist board, knows, we welcome this Bill wholeheartedly because it provides grants for the basic things.  You cannot have development without basic things and the Minister, in his wisdom, has provided those things, site development, <i>et cetera.</i></P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I will endeavour to be as brief as possible, because I know the Minister wishes to go immediately and examine the price structures that Senator Gallanagh has been talking about.  I am glad the Senator spoke before me because it has given me an opportunity to avoid the contentious subject of drink prices.  He made an excellent case exemplifying how the Government, through consistent imposition of extra duties on the price of drink, have put the price of drink beyond the reach of tourists.  They have made this country a less attractive tourist place&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelGallanagh" hpid="Mr. Gallanagh Mr. Gallanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, I did not say it was the Government's impositions: I said it was overcharging by certain hotels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;because of their consistent decisions to continue to increase the price of drink.  I am not competent to comment on the subject of whether certain low-price retailers should be called &ldquo;madmen&rdquo; in this House.  However, I particularly want to comment on the resorts which are mentioned in the Minister's speech in introducing this Bill.  Senator Gallanagh detailed them so there is no point in my reading them all out. <Col N="1088" /> He pointed out that both he and I are members of the Eastern Regional Tourism Board and consequently the places that would concern us most of all would be resorts such as Skerries and Greystones, both of which come within the bailiwick of the Eastern Regional Tourism Organisation.</P>
      <P>It is a pity that the Minister did not point out the full implications for the designated resort known as Skerries. Unfortunately I did not anticipate that this Bill would come before the House today and consequently I have not the exact amount by which Bord Fáilte reneged on their promise to the County Dublin resort of Skerries. However, I shall give the approximate figures.  I know them to my own bitter cost and to that of the Eastern Regional Tourism Organisation and Dublin County Council.</P>
      <P>A considerable number of years ago Bord Fáilte induced various other organisations to join with them in the development of a major promenade and tourist area in the popular holiday resort of Skerries.  They made various commitments, long-term promises, and produced various plans. Through a combination of procrastination and what I can only describe as ineptitude, they managed to allow the whole project to fall through in a most disgraceful and upsetting way. Having given a promise of grants towards this resort development of something in the region of £120,000, they eventually discovered that through their ineptitude and internal wrangling with Bord Iascaigh Mhara and the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries they were no longer able to carry on with the development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was at a time when, because of their promises, they had induced a local non-profit-making club not to spend money on their premises because of Bord Fáilte's commitment to give them a grant to re-locate.  This seriously dislocated the ordinary development of the tourist trade in Skerries.  To get out of their difficulty the board recently promised to give a modest grant towards that club, the grant being to persuade the club to stay in the premises and the location where it was before Bord Fáilte came <Col N="1089" /> boring and blundering in on the scene in the first place.</P>
    <P>The net result is that many people have been discommoded, the tourist interest in Skerries has been injured and Bord Fáilte have to pay £20,000 to persuade somebody to stay where they have been during the last 40 years so that Bord Fáilte can extricate themselves with the least possible embarrassment from the dreadful mess into which they and their fellow semi-State body managed to get themselves.</P>
    <P>Perhaps it is just as well that I cannot speak for the development which took place in any other of the ten or 12 designated areas.  I can only hope to God, for their sakes, that the projects undertaken by the board in those areas were done in a somewhat more efficient fashion than was done in County Dublin.</P>
    <P>This is not a Bill that can be welcomed in any particular way by people involved in the tourist trade.  As far as I understand it, all it is seeking to do is to make available money to finance promises and grants by Bord Fáilte which they have given in the recent or not so recent past.  Every Member of this House and the general public should realise that this Bill is not making available one single penny of additional money to finance further tourist development.  All it is doing is making available, somewhat belatedly, an amount of money to finance promises made by Bord Fáilte which they were unable to honour at some stage throughout the past years.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister could say in his opening speech that no development is being held up through lack of finance.  Part of the reason for that is that this Bill will obviously be passed by this House, as it has been by the other House.  What we are discussing is the funding of grants and promises that have already been made. We are not talking about making any real positive contribution towards any further development of the tourist industry.</P>
    <P>While I am on that theme, it is appropriate that we should remind the Minister of the various suggestions that were made here before, and I know that Senator Gallanagh would join with <Col N="1090" /> me in this.  Bearing in mind that this money is to be made available for resort development, or new hotel development, or local development of some type, there is a very worthy case being made for that money being allocated by the regional tourist organisations rather than by the central body, which is Bord Fáilte.</P>
    <P>I have made various suggestions in this House to the Minister which he has never taken up or gone into in great detail; but in his effective fashion he has always promised that he would look into them because they were points worth looking into.  He has been looking into this bush for so long now that I am sure he must be able to see the light at the far side of it.  Perhaps he might shine that light around the dreary corridors of the Seanad Chamber tonight and tell us whether he feels the system of allowing the regional tourist boards to allocate the money for development in their areas is a worthwhile one or whether it could be operated in any other way?</P>
    <P>I suggest that the trend must now be, as it appears to be, away from the idea of giving grants towards the development of new hotels <i>per se</i> and more towards the idea of making money available for the development of tourist resorts and the provision of ancillary facilities in those resorts and adjacent to them, so that we will no longer have a situation where people will come to stay in an admirable hotel and discover if the weather is bad that there is nowhere for them to go or no facilities for them to enjoy.  Our difficulty is that the weather in this country is not as good as it is in many other countries where a substantial tourist trade is enjoyed.  If we want to continue to get foreign visitors in large numbers we must be able to attract them by the unique nature of our scenery and our friendliness.  I am inclined to think from time to time that the latter is becoming one of the fairy tales of Ireland.  We should provide our major tourist resorts with facilities to entertain visitors at all times irrespective of weather conditions.  The board should be engaged actively in doing this.</P>
    <P>Senator Gallanagh was probably <Col N="1091" /> going to develop his point in relation to the price of drink into the important fact that if we want to encourage foreign visitors to come here we must have a serious rethink about our licensing laws.  We will have to realise that if we want to encourage visitors to come here we will have to make our licensing laws as attractive to those visitors as the laws of other countries which enjoy a considerable tourist trade.  Allied with that, we will have to look at the idea of providing duty free liquor and other goods to passengers in transit from abroad.</P>
    <P>I should like some information in relation to hotel grants which were made available and which are being recouped through this Bill.  Can the Minister tell us what was the basis and criteria on which grants were given?  I assume that grants will be made available according to the cost of the hotel, the facilities made available and the number of bedrooms in the hotel.  I assume that bedrooms is the single most important thing in the making available of grants.</P>

      <P>Good.  Now, can we establish, in relation to a certain hotel which shall be nameless but which the Minister is aware of, whether it received grants in relation to the bedrooms in it, and if it did, whether it received a grant in relation to the bedroom in it which is currently being used by a Member of this House who is a member of the Fianna Fáil Party to operate a fund-raising operation on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party?  Was that bedroom, in the hotel which we all know about, given a grant by Bord Fáilte for the purpose of operating as a bedroom?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his speech the Minister mentioned that Bord Fáilte are carrying out a study into the changes in the pattern of the tourist industry. Before the troubles in the North it was obvious that a certain amount of difficulty was arising in the tourist industry.  Yet now, at the end of 1972 it has got to the stage that Bord Fáilte are still engaged in carrying <Col N="1092" /> out a study into the emerging pattern of the tourist industry.  That is indicative of the fact that Bord Fáilte are falling behind the international rate of tourist promotion.  By now they should not only have their study completed but should have a policy ready and be actively involved in implementing that policy.  We all appreciate that tourism is a rapidly changing industry, but to think that after all the words that have been spoken here, in the Dáil and elsewhere, Bord Fáilte are still involved actively in looking at the situation is just not good enough.  I should like the Minister to comment on this in his reply.  Perhaps he might tell us&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I have been here many mornings at 10.30 when there were few Members of the House here, and those of us who were here might not have felt the best.  If this necessitates my coming back tomorrow morning, and Senator Honan coming with me, I will facilitate him by speaking for another 11 minutes to ensure that we both will come back.  If he allows me.  I could finish in about two minutes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has explained that the number of hotel bedrooms has risen from 17,800 in 1960 to 28,885 in 1972. That is an interesting and useful figure. Would he give us the equivalent figure for the number of bed-nights in 1960 as against the number of bed-nights in 1972 and the average cost of a bed in 1960 as against the average cost of a bed in 1972?  I will accept only real figures.  We are given the details of revenue during the last number of years, showing the figures for the last year and the forecast for the current year which obviously would show a <Col N="1093" /> drop in view of current circumstances. The Minister and I conducted a long discussion here as to whether the figures for tourist revenue in 1971 would reach the figure of £100 million.  The Minister categorically stated that they would and I categorically stated that they would not.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It is 1971.  The Minister was right.  The figure came to £100.8 million.  In the course of his contribution the Minister categorically stated that this would represent a rise in tourist revenue and I stated that it would not.  I am glad that the Minister has confirmed that I was right in the second aspect of it.  In real money terms it represented a decrease of four per cent.</P>
      <P>The Minister is in a unique role here today.  When speaking on tourist development we have often spoken of the great contribution which Irish people abroad can make in helping to encourage tourists from Europe and other parts of the world to come to this country on holidays.  I should like to point out to the Minister that he has a great opportunity, in view of his practical involvement with the tourist industry to assist in developing this industry when he takes up his new portfolio and begins to trek around the capitals of the world.  I hope he will not forget his previous brief and his involvement with the tourist industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. B. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad I have got a job from Senator Boland.  Seriously, we have had a very constructive debate. It arose out of, what Senator Boland has rightly stated, the decision to raise the financial limits in regard to major resort development expenditure from £3¼ million to £4 million and in regard to holiday accommodation from £11 million to £13 million to ensure that commitments that have been entered into by Bord Fáilte will be met.  That is the purpose of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I emphasised in my opening speech that we are now having a look at the whole accommodation grant scheme with a view to deciding on the type of help we should give the hotel, the guesthouse and the farmhouse accommodation <Col N="1094" /> industry in the years ahead. Between 1960 and 1972 the number of bedrooms in hotels and guesthouses increased from 17,800 to 28,885.  There are about 9,600 bedrooms available in farmhouse and supplementary accommodation.</P>
    <P>The emphasis now should be on the improvement of amenities on which we will base the type of activity holiday which is indicated will be the holiday of the future.  There is a growing interest in urbanised western Europe in seeking an environment such as ours for an activity holiday in a moderate climate.  We must encourage facilities for caravanning holidays, both motor and horse drawn, camping, mountaineering, walking, cruising, shooting, angling, <i>et cetera</i>.  In these areas one can get visitors who are willing to pay if the facilities and amenities are good.</P>
    <P>There is an example of that type of holiday in my own part of the country, on the Shannon, where due to the investment by Bord Fáilte in our inland waterways, boating is one of the real growth areas in tourism at present.  In the last report issued by Bord Fáilte the increase in the number of people who had a cruising holiday last year was 16 per cent, the total number being 11,600.  I know the numbers will be of that order again this year.  This is a typical type of activity holiday and represents an increase in visitors from Germany, France, the Netherlands and other parts of continental Europe.</P>
    <P>In his opening remarks, Senator Russell mentioned the importance of developing our tourism promotion in Europe.  Bord Fáilte have already taken steps in this direction by opening offices in major European capitals and by increasing their personnel and their contacts with the travel and tourist trade.  In the last Bord Fáilte report, it is estimated that the increase in German visitors was 24 per cent and the increase in French visitors was 13 per cent, with a 20 per cent annual growth rate since 1966.  There is not a big volume of business here, but the scope is there to build it up. The primary reasons for our bad <Col N="1095" /> tourist season this year came from the North of Ireland market, which is almost down to zero, and the British market which is being bombarded every day by the British media with scare stories.</P>
    <P>At the peak of 1965, 21 per cent of visitors spending came from Northern Ireland and 52 per cent came from Britain.  We must look forward to political solutions from the political initiatives being taken now because hot on the heels of a political solution will come a tourist boom from these two markets.  This has been the experience in Israel after wars, when tourism expansion resumed very quickly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>All the adverse publicity generates equally good publicity when a settlement has been reached.  Senator Russell mentioned the importance of stocktaking.  That is precisely what Bord Fáilte are doing at the moment.  This is a period of maintaining the tourist product, maintaining the amount of bedroom accommodation, providing the facilities and amenities and making plans for action when the troubles we are now experiencing are over.  Bord Fáilte took practical action last year in two areas where the troubles in the North did not affect the issue.  One was the Irish ethnic market in Britain where people would know the score here and were induced to come over in great numbers by an intensive campaign directed at them.  Also, the home holidays campaign had a very practical result in that £18.7 million was spent by Irish people who took their holidays at home this year.  That represents an increase of more than £2 million on the previous year.  This is another example of being adaptable and resilient in adversity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Russell mentioned the point I have already referred to concerning continental business.  He also mentioned the point that English visitors can be recaptured.  I feel they can be recaptured once the politics of <Col N="1096" /> the situation settle down.  He also mentioned about the air fare from London to Dublin, the week-end fare rate being reduced <i>vis-à-vis</i> Shannon and Cork.  That was a proposal from BEA which Aer Lingus have now rejected and the rates will continue to be on the same basis from London to Cork, Shannon and Dublin.</P>
    <P>Senator Brugha mentioned the point I have referred to just now, the need for more facilities.  I fully agree with him here.  Bord Fáilte got an extra half million pounds last year over and above the major resort development scheme as part of the Minister for Finance's special allocation of money last autumn.  These moneys are being spent this year on improving amenities and facilities.</P>
    <P>Senator Brugha made a very important point in regard to conferences.  If we want conferences we must have hotels to cater for conferences.  This point came up during the debate on hotels, whether we should concentrate on one type of hotel or the other type of hotel.  In my view we must have a balanced attitude towards this.  We need hotels that can cater for conferences. We need the farmhouse accommodation, we need the gusthouse accommodation, we need the small family type hotels and we need luxury hotels also to cater for visitors.  I think we have enough of the latter category at the present time.  The thing about a hotel, guesthouse or farmhouse is that there is no compulsion on anyone to go into any particular one and if he goes into one where the rates are such as Senator Gallanagh mentioned that is his business.  He need not go there but can go somewhere else if he wishes.  In regard to the tourism industry, all over the world the countries that apply themselves intelligently to tourism have the whole range of facilities so that they can offer a full range to the customer. It is up to the customer to decide which particular way he wishes to go.</P>
    <P>Senator West and a number of Senators referred to the continental ferry from Rosslare to Le Havre and of course from Le Havre to Rosslare. Unfortunately, owing to the fact that newspapers were not published today there was no word about it but there <Col N="1097" /> was a very full conference held yesterday here in Dublin in which the Norwegian and Swedish interests, who are participating with Irish Shipping in this development, were present.  The conference had been arranged before the newspaper strike and there was a full announcement made yesterday about this.  I trust the newspapers will carry the news about this tomorrow.</P>
    <P>This service is resuming on a different basis from 1st June next.  A new company has been formed, Norweigan and Swedish interests holding 50 per cnent with Irish Shipping holding the other 50 per cent.  It will be an all-the-year round service which will be an improvement on the previous service of Normandy Ferries.  Furthermore, instead of having a 25 per cent interest, which is all Irish Shipping had in the previous services, Irish Shipping have a 50 per cent interest in this service.  That means they cannot be treated in an arbitrary manner, which is the only description of the manner in which they were treated with regard to the Normandy Ferries.  They got no notice or anything of it and were just left with a situation where the service was cut almost overnight.</P>
    <P>This will not happen now.  They will have a 50 per cent stake in the new ferry service starting 1st June next.  It will be all the year round whereas the previous service was only during the summer months.  Lastly, and probably most importantly of all, it will be a roll-on roll-off freight service as well as serving the tourist car ferry business. It will have more car ferry space than the previous ship and will maintain a direct link between Rosslare and Le Havre.</P>
    <P>Senator West also mentioned conferences.  This is very important business.  We had in 1971-72 113 international confeerences bringing 25,000 visitors here and the revenue form this is between £2 million and £2½ million.</P>
    <P>Senator Farrell rightly and mentioned the importance of farmhouse holidays.  Our stock of rooms is 9,600 under this heading at the moment between farmhouse holidays and supplementary accommodation.  This type of holiday is one of the type which was in a growth area this year.  There were <Col N="1098" /> increased numbers going to farmhouse holidays primarily because of the drive of the home holidays campaign which catered for domestic holidays.  I agree that the voluntary effort put into it, first of all, by the ICA and then by Fáilte Tuaithe, has helped enormously. There is a tremendous reservoir of voluntary help in that particular area and this is a big load off Bord Fáilte's back.  Through Fáilte Tuaithe they do group marketing and promotion.</P>
    <P>Apart from the dometic holidays they get a lot of business from abroad as well.  It is the type of holiday which is going to stay and expand because again it is linked to what I was speaking about earlier on, the activity type holiday.  You go to a farmhouse and from there you can engage in all sorts of activities in a natural environment, which again will suit the types of holiday maker of the future.  You are not just cooped up in a hotel or a particular environment.  We want in the future the open air holidaymaker who wants to be in a natural environment away from the urbanisation and pressures of modern life.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinlan made a number of points.  I want to emphasise to him that Bord Fáilte and any of the semi-State bodies whose Bills are debated here get full copies of all Dáil and Seanad debates.  There is no doubt about that. Indeed, I know full attention is paid to them.  The importance of a debate here lies in the full reportage and in the fact that the reports, when published, are immedicately sent on to the bodies concerned for their examination.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinlan also mentioned the importance of the farmhouse holiday scheme.  Senator Aherne went on to talk about minor resort development.  I will look into her suggestion in regard to the Ballyheigue area which she suggested could be a minor resort development.</P>
    <P>Senator McDonald spoke about the midland region.  I have already referred to that.  The outstanding new activity holiday development associated with that region is in the form of a Shannon cruiser development.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Sullivan mentioned the question of resort development in the area from Kinsale to the Kerry <Col N="1099" /> boundary and was generally critical of the facillities in west Cork.  I will have that taken up also.  However, west Cork got £172,800 under major resort schemes.  I know that is over a period of years, but id shows that they got something.</P>
    <P>Senator Dooge talked about what I have been referring to as regards keeping the standards right and also the activity holiday.  He talked about the need to plan the tourist product in the future.  Again I see it lying in the direction I have talked about&mdash;having a co-ordinated approach towards providing the facilities and amenities for activity holidays.  I have referred to Senator Gallanagh's point already.</P>
    <P>Senator Boland talked about the allocation of funds in consultation with the regional development organisations This is done in regard to the amenity funds.  This is precisely the area in which the regional tourism organisations can help best because of their knowledge of what amenities are required locally.  I do not think it would be desirable to have major funds such as those for hotelaccommodation disbursed through regional tourism organisations.  I could foresee trouble arising there.  In the matter of disbursement of amenity funds it is better to do it by way of consulation.  As the Senator is aware, the actual local fund raising by the regional tourism organisations is not very large to put it mildly.</P>

      <P>This is a very important business as far as Ireland is concerned.  There is nothing basically worng with the industry which cannot be remedied. The difficulties are primarily due to the troubles in Northern Ireland. There are other factors involved to which senator Dooge referred.  Emphasis will have to be switched towards certain types of holidays.  More investment will be needed.</P>
      <P>We have a good tourist plant.  Due to the development which took place in the 1960s, we have built up the accommodation requied.  It is easy to criricise the accommodation grants system that operated until we suspended the grants in mid-1969.  If that effort has not been put in in the decade from 1960 to 1970 we would not have the accommodation we now have available.  Every period brings forward a new need.  The need in 1960 was to generate bedrooms to cater for visitors.  We did not then have the bedroom accommodation.  We have done that dramatically in ten years through an open-ended grants scheme, which many critics would say was too open-ended.  I would agree to some extent with that statement but at least something was achieved.</P>
      <P>In the future we will need to look at whatever sort of scheme of assistance is required with a much closer eye.  We have to look at the very sensitive tourism business in a sophisticated way and devise a financial assistance scheme for the future that will benefit the tourist plant which will be needed by visitors.  The old straight-forward open-ended grants system that we adopted in regard to the bedroom accommodation will not do in the future.  That is another day's work.  Even thought we many be critical of the way in which moneys have been spent, we have now reached the end of that situation.  We are now paying all the bills.  The final commitments are being met.  Having developed the product to this level we should now devise our future plans.  Bord Fáilte are doing this in a very positive way.</P>

      <P>I asked the Minister if he had comparative figures for the rise in overnight costs from 1960 to 1972.  Are those figures available?</P>

      <P>There is no question of anything definite in that respect. The licensed restaurant people have approached me with proposals of this nature but there is no proposal that there but there is no proposal that public house licences.</P>

      <P>I assumed that, if there was a change in the licensing procedure, there might be a relaxation in the licensing laws generally.  If you are proposing to give licences to restaurants there would obviously have to be such a relaxation.</P>
