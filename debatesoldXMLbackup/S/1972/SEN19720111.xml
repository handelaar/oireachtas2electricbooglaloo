      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In subsection (2) (a) (ii), page 2, line 28 before &ldquo;secured&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;subject to such conditions as the Company may require&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This follows on some comments I made on the Second Stage of the Bill in which I made the case to the Minister that, in addition to being a lender of last resort, this Bill should provide that the new company, Fóir Teoranta, would also insist on certain very clear conditions that would have to be agreed to before any capital was made available to an ailing industry. In other <Col N="2" /> words, notwithstanding the Minister's assurance in his Second Stage speech, it should be written into the Bill that the board of Fóir Teoranta might require certain conditions to be fulfilled before advancing capital to an industry in danger of closing down.</P>
    <P>What I had in mind is what was referred to by the Minister and other speakers on Second Stage, that is, the possible resignation of directors, the possible resignation or discharge of the management and certain other provisions that would need to be complied with before any capital was advanced to the industry or industries concerned.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the Minister's assurance on this but I feel that in a Bill as important as this one, setting up a company which can be a very useful agency for preserving ailing industries, we should have regard to the fact that scarce capital will be made available to an ailing industry. It may not necessarily be the lack of capital which would be the cause of the industry's difficulties. It may very well be mismanagement or lack of management or wrong policy on the part of the board which would have put the industry into jeopardy. I should like to see more emphasis in the Bill laid on that factor.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="3" /> For that reason I have introduced an amendment which puts into the Bill only what the Minister himself said in the course of his Second Stage speech. I quote:</P>
    <P>These arrangements, which include the applicants for financial assistance, require applicants to employ consultants and implement their recommendations, including changes in the board of directors and management.</P>
    <P>The Minister went on to say:</P>
    <P>These arrangements can be made administratively and it is not necessary to cater for them in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I submit to the Minister that it is necessary and I think the House would feel happier if it were specifically written into the Bill that the board would require certain conditions to be complied with before advancing capital to enable the affected industry to survive. I feel very strongly on this point and I hope the Minister will agree to accept the amendment. I feel that it will improve the Bill and will certainly lay it on the line that, as the Minister himself said, this is not just a &ldquo;fire brigade&rdquo; operation to industries that have no hope of surviving in any event, but that it will be an instrument to preserve industry that can reasonably be preserved provided certain conditions are complied with.</P>
    <P>One of these conditions could very well be the resignation of the directors concerned who got the industry into trouble, or a change of management, or possibly an association with another similar type industry, or a merger or some other form of rationalisation or reorganisation. I would stress to the Minister that there is a strong case for including this amendment in section 4 and I hope the Minister will accept it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">
      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support this amendment. I feel that Senator Russell is quite right in what he says and that it would be quite appropriate to include a phrase such as he has put down in this amendment because, as was pointed out in the Second Stage debate by Senator Russell and, I think, Senator Nash in particular, the <Col N="4" /> companies that are to come before Fóir Teoranta to apply for aid or the companies that will be under consideration for aid of this nature will be companies in trouble and of course there will have been reasons for them having got into trouble. Many of the reasons may be reasons which could have been righted had problems among the directors been sorted out or, in particular, if problems of accountancy had been sorted out.</P>
      <P>I think it was Senator Nash who said on Second Stage that in his experience of firms getting into trouble &mdash;and I believe he has had very wide experience of this nature&mdash;in virtually every case you could bet all the money you had that a company in severe difficulty would not have properly kept accounts. I should like to see Fóir Teoranta recognising this and I should like to see it recognised in the regulations. I should like to see it made one of the conditions by Fóir Teoranta that a properly accredited accountant be put forward immediately to look into the accounts of such a company before any decision is made on whether to give them State aid.</P>
      <P>I think this is very important, because I feel that this point was made so strongly, that in the case of virtually every firm that get into difficulties of this nature it will be found when investigations are made that the accounts are just completely missing or they have been made up by an accountant who has not been scrupulous in his duty. One of the most important things is that Fóir Teoranta be empowered to impose conditions of this nature, the conditions needed to rectify the situation, certainly the conditions needed to produce accurate accounts.</P>
      <P>For those reasons I should like to support this amendment because I think it gives the board of Fóir Teoranta the power to do this and I think this should be included in the present legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Colley) George Colley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite clearly common ground that that there could be cases coming before the board of Fóir Teoranta <Col N="5" /> which would require the imposition of certain conditions such as have been mentioned in relation to accounts, in relation to management, change of management, directors and such things. Indeed, it was dealt with, as has been pointed out, in some detail on the Second Stage. That, as I say, is common ground.</P>
      <P>I submit that the proposed amendment does nothing to improve this situation. It does not specify any such conditions: all it provides is that &ldquo;subject to such conditions as the Company may require&rdquo;, that is that Fóir Teoranta may require. The board of Fóir Teoranta will, of course, have the discretion to decide in each case what conditions should be applied to the advancing of money. In the case of Taiscí Stáit, which to some extent Fóir Teoranta are replacing, there is no such condition as is proposed in this amendment, but this has not prevented Taiscí Stáit from applying these very kinds of conditions in various cases, in insisting on changes in management, in insisting on nominees on the board and so on.</P>
      <P>In other words, the Bill already provides the power which is proposed to be given in this amendment. I would urge the House to consider that there is more to it than a merely negative approach. There may well be a danger, if one were to introduce such a condition&mdash;and the danger I think is reinforced by the arguments made by Senator Russell&mdash;that it could be interpreted as meaning that the board of Fóir Teoranta would have to have a standard set of conditions which would be complied with in any case which came before them. I would think this would be dangerous and would lead to a degree of inflexibility which could mean that certain cases which would properly be dealt with by Fóir Teoranta would not be dealt with because they did not come within the specific conditions laid down. Therefore, because on the one hand the power proposed for the board by this amendment is already there, and on the other hand because the spelling out in this way could lead to a rigidity that would be undesirable, I do not think this amendment should be accepted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not quite follow the Minister's argument on this. On the one hand he says that Senator Russell's amendment would seem to tie down Fóir Teoranta by almost specifying conditions. Indeed, I considered putting down an amendment to try to do something similar. The reason I did not do it is that I wished to make the specific point which Senator Nash made on the Second Stage debate about the necessity for producing accurate accounts and books or for having them produced after Fóir Teoranta started to look into the affairs of the company and I felt that one could hardly be as specific as this and give the board of Fóir Teoranta the required flexibility. I do not see that Senator Russell's amendment ties the board of Fóir Teoranta in any way; I think it just makes the point more strongly in the legislation before us. I cannot see the Minister's argument for not accepting this amendment because it does not tie the board's hands in any way, but it makes the statement in this part of the Bill stronger. Therefore, I still feel that this amendment should be accepted.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned Taiscí Stáit. From my knowledge of Taiscí Stáit I do not think they always operated too efficiently, conditions or no conditions. I do not want to go into specific cases but in some of the cases in which Taiscí Stáit gave money I believe that money should not have been given and that there were cases more deserving of it. In some instances in which money was given a pretty flimsy case was put forward for a grant of the size that was given. Apart from that, I still cannot see the Minister's argument that this amendment ties the board's hands in any way. The amendment would make the present legislation stronger and better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>We are dealing with section 4 of the Bill which outlines in the broadest possible sense what the memorandum of the proposed company should contain. The amendment I have suggested is not restrictive. The Minister said it is restrictive but he has not elaborated on it in any way which would convince any Member of the House that the amendment is restrictive. It is as broad as any of the subheads <Col N="7" /> under section 4. The House, presumably, will not see the memorandum and articles until they have been printed. The memorandum and articles must be approved by the Minister, not by the Dáil or the Seanad, therefore, this Bill should contain in reasonable outline an explanation as to what the memorandum and articles will contain when approved by the Minister.</P>
      <P>This Bill as it stands contains nothing that suggests that any condition need be, or can be, imposed by the board of the new company. In my opinion this section would be sensibly and properly tightened up if some suggestion were included that conditions could, if necessary, be made by the board of the company. As the Bill reads now, it is purely a lending agency. The clauses in section 4 merely suggest the various ways in which the company can lend money by taking up debentures, by advancing money, by guaranteeing loans and, further on, state the type of companies that can be assisted. Nowhere is it suggested that on receiving this money certain conditions may have to be complied with.</P>
      <P>I am merely suggesting to the Minister, without restriction&mdash;I still cannot understand the Minister's reference to the word &ldquo;restriction&rdquo;&mdash;that this Bill should contain a reference to conditions as a reasonable amendment to the ability to lend money. I cannot see how this could restrict the board or how it could detract from the clause covering the memorandum. It would be proper and prudent procedure to put in something that suggests that conditions may be required to be met where scarce capital is to be lent to a company. I should like the Minister to reconsider this matter. I do not think it would detract from the Bill in any way and it would be a sensible precaution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an enabling Bill which will enable Fóir Teoranta to advance money in certain conditions to certain companies. It is quite clear, since it is an enabling Bill, that the board are not obliged to advance money in any particular case and, <Col N="8" /> therefore, they may impose such conditions as they wish. I have mentioned Taiscí Stáit which have imposed conditions operating under the same kind of legislation without a provision such as that contained in this amendment.</P>
      <P>Senator West referred to certain cases of Taiscí Stáit where he did not agree money should have been advanced but, with all due respect to him, I would suggest that is irrelevant. There have been cases dealt with by Taiscí Stáit in which conditions such as those mentioned here were imposed. I do not think that Senators would seriously contest that statement. Under the Bill as it stands the board of Fóir Teoranta would be entitled to impose conditions before making an advance to a company. I do not think that can be seriously contested both on a reasonable interpretation of the Bill and on the basis of the precedent, that I have mentioned, of Taiscí Stáit.</P>
      <P>We then come to the other side of the question as to whether or not it is necessary. We put it in anyway and it will do no harm. I did not say, as Senator Russell seemed to think I said, that this would introduce a restriction. What I said was that there was a danger that such an amendment might be interpreted as meaning that there should be a standard set of conditions applied to all cases. Indeed, the case originally made by Senator Russell would support that interpretation. I am not saying it will be so interpreted but it could be. I am suggesting that it is not necessary to do this. Such conditions as Fóir Teoranta consider necessary can be imposed in any case under the Bill as it stands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator West made it clear that he accepts the argument I made that it is necessary to have flexibility. There will be different circumstances in different cases and, in effect, one has to depend on the board of Fóir Teoranta in each case to use their discretion and to apply such conditions as are appropriate to that particular case. The Bill enables the board of Fóir Teoranta to do so. They are not restricted in any way as to their ability to apply conditions or they are not forced to apply conditions which they would not think appropriate. The Bill <Col N="9" /> as it stands does exactly what we would wish the board of Fóir Teoranta to do. It gives them the powers they should have. I suggest the amendment does not add to their powers and it involves a slight danger of introducing a degree of inflexibility which would be undesirable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">
      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot agree with the Minister on that. It does not give even the appearance of restricting Fóir Teoranta. Let us look at section 4 (2) (b) (vi) which reads:</P>
      <P>its failure to receive financial assistance would have serious repercussions either nationally or locally.</P>
      <P>As the Minister knows when a firm or an industry of this type get into difficulties he has local representatives available. If it were in my area I would be on to it as soon as I could because it is a local problem. There would be discussion of it in the Press and the trade unions would quite rightly take up the struggle because the people who would suffer most would be employees rather than the directors or the higher grades of staff. The lower grade members of the firm are the people who might have difficulty in finding alternative employment and who would receive smaller benefits than the people in managerial positions. Therefore, the trade unions will be involved very crucially in closures or possible closures of firms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One can easily envisage a firm which ran into difficulties but which fell under subsection (2) (b) (vi) of section 4. I would argue that if Senator Russell's amendment were accepted it would strengthen the Minister's hand, and the board's hand, in dealing with such a situation. In such cases there will often be considerable public pressure. The case will be discussed nationally&mdash;and quite rightly so&mdash;in the Press and in the other media. If at this stage the amendment&mdash;&ldquo;subject to such conditions as the Company may require&rdquo;&mdash;is put into the Bill, it will strengthen the hands of the members of the board of Fóir Teoranta in saying that in a case in which money was not to be granted the firm involved had not fulfilled the conditions <Col N="10" /> that it imposed. It makes the position of both the Minister and Fóir Teoranta stronger, rather than weaker, in a situation such as this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I ask the Senator whether he suggests that the Bill does not allow the board to impose conditions?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">
      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a good thing to make this stronger and clearer. As the Minister knows, we are facing a time in which there will have to be considerable reorganisation in industry. There will be a number of firms facing crisis situations, and I am of the opinion that a considerable number of organisations will come under the scrutiny of Fóir Teoranta in this way. There will be a great deal of public discussion about the way the money is spent, which is proper. After all, these are public funds. The Minister said that my reference to Taiscí Stáit was irrelevant. It is only irrelevant if one is not interested in the general situation of how public money is spent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>No. The Senator cannot get away with that. It is relevant to imposing conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">
      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me remark on one condition which was mentioned, I think, by Senator Kennedy in the Second Stage debate. The Senator said that he felt that money should not be given to foreign companies in this country which got into difficulty. He was referring to companies which happen to be subsidiaries of overseas companies that have plenty of capital to back them up.</P>
      <P>There was a case in which money was given to such a company by Taiscí Stáit. What I am trying to say is that there will be a lot of public debate about this. It would strengthen the hands of the Minister and of Fóir Teoranta if Senator Russell's amendment was accepted. I do not see that it puts any restrictions, or semblance of restrictions, on the board of Fóir Teoranta. In fact, it makes their position stronger.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me to be a pity that this discussion should be decided by a count of heads. Obviously, there is not very much between the points of view that have been expressed by the Minister on the one hand and Senator Russell on the other. The Minister himself has referred to the fact that there is a great deal of common ground. The strength of the Minister's argument&mdash; or whatever strength may be in it&mdash;is in the case he made that the inclusion of the words suggested in the amendment might possibly&mdash;and I think he only puts it as far as that&mdash;be interpreted as requiring a set form of requirements to be drawn up and, presumably, to be applicable in all cases. If that danger exists, it is very, very slight indeed. When the Minister was making the argument I was trying to picture the scene which one might expect in this House if the phrase which Senator Russell wants to have included were, in fact, included in the Bill at the start. If a Senator on this side of the House said that that was a dangerous phrase to have included, because it could be interpreted as requiring a set form of requirements to be drawn up and to be applied, I could well imagine the Minister, in all good faith and in perfect honesty, scorning that argument and saying that there was not the slightest danger of that being the position. I could imagine the Minister challenging Senators on this side of the House by asking: &ldquo;Will you tell me one case where the fact that permission was given to impose requirements was interpreted as being mandatory that a particular stereotyped set of requirements would have to be drawn up and be applied?&rdquo; I could see the Minister, in all good faith and in perfect honesty, making that argument. If roles were reversed I would find it very hard to resist the Minister if he made that argument.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a pity that a little bit more common ground could not be found. There is not a great deal of difference, but perfectly sincere conviction has been expressed from this side of the House that the Bill would be strengthened. It certainly would not be damaged. On the contrary it would be <Col N="12" /> strengthened if this amendment were accepted. The only fear the Minister has is that, if he accepts it, it might be interpreted as bringing about a set of circumstances which would require routine set conditions to be drawn up. I should like to suggest to the Minister and to Senator Russell that the problem the Minister foresees might easily be overcome. At the same time, Senator Russell's point of view might be met if there was a slight alteration in the amendment. If the amendment were to read as follows:</P>
    <P>subject to such conditions, if any, as the Company may require.</P>
    <P>I think that the Minister would agree with me that it would completely remove the difficulty which he sees. I hope that Senator Russell will agree that an amendment on those lines would not weaken his amendment, because it expresses the intention that he has been expressing. If the Minister would indicate that he would accept an amendment on those lines, it might be dealt with now. Otherwise, we might possibly consider it further on Report Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am perfectly agreeable. One of the reasons why I do not want to flog this thing to death, but that I would be concerned about inserting it, is that this Bill will ultimately become an Act, a public document. This is what the public will see: they will not see the Minister's speech or any of the contributions made in this House or in the other House; neither will they see the memorandum. The public are entitled to feel that in certain circumstances the directors of this company will have powers to distribute substantial sums and that they will do so possibly after requiring certain conditions to be met. That is all I ask for and I agree with Senator O'Higgins. I thank the Minister.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In subsection (2) (b) (ii), page 3, line 1, before &ldquo;and&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;involved&rdquo; and before &ldquo;capital&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;total&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Apart from a small piece of redrafting, which I think improves this subsection, I am anxious that the word &ldquo;capital&rdquo; should be qualified by the word &ldquo;total&rdquo;. &ldquo;Capital&rdquo; can have a very wide meaning. There are all types of capital: equity capital, known capital and so on, and it would be possible to have a company with a very small equity capital and a very large loan capital. The directors of Fóir Teoranta would wish that a company's total capital would be substantial. The word &ldquo;capital&rdquo; in this subsection as it stands does not give a clear meaning and for that reason I am inserting the qualification.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of employment, the word &ldquo;involved&rdquo; improves the subsection. <Col N="14" /> As it reads at present, employment and capital are tied together. It reads: &ldquo;the employment and capital employed...&rdquo; The subsection would give a more precise definition of what I hope is in the Minister's mind. It would read: &ldquo;The employment involved and total capital employed in it are significant.&rdquo; I suggest that the Minister might accept the amendment with that intention.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two aspects of this amendment. First, it is a matter of opinion as to whether the insertion of the word &ldquo;involved&rdquo; improves the section. It does not make a great difference but I would not argue against it. The more important aspect of this amendment is the insertion of the word &ldquo;total&rdquo; before &ldquo;capital&rdquo;. It is true that the phrase &ldquo;capital employed&rdquo; is sometimes defined as covering longterm capital only and it is desirable in the context of this Bill and this section that the phrase &ldquo;capital employed&rdquo; should be taken to cover short-term borrowing as well as permanent capital. The insertion of the word &ldquo;total&rdquo; as suggested by Senator Russell does help to clarify the position as to what is intended here.</P>
      <P>The word &ldquo;total&rdquo; is used in the following paragraph and, if only in the interests of consistency, it should be accepted. For the other reasons I have mentioned I consider it a useful amendment and I am prepared to accept it.</P>

      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to make it clear beyond any doubt that, irrespective of the size of the business, it will be eligible for assistance where its closure would significantly affect the employment situation in a local area. In the discussion on the Committee Stage in Dáil Éireann a Deputy suggested that the criterion of significance in relation to employment and capital employed might be interpreted as excluding the small business. The Deputy added that an amendment which would ensure <Col N="15" /> that locally significant concerns would be eligible might be appropriate. There is substance in this and for that reason I am suggesting to the House that they accept this amendment which makes it clear beyond doubt that small concerns as well as large concerns may be eligible.</P>

      <P>This amendment arises out of a point raised on the Second Stage by Senator Alexis FitzGerald. In referring to the word &ldquo;promoter&rdquo;, he suggested that this was the incorrect term as this is normally applied to persons who establish a concern and who may not necessarily be associated with it after its establishment or may hold only a minority interest. I undertook at that time to look into this matter. I have done so and I am satisfied that the term &ldquo;owner&rdquo; would be more appropriate than the term &ldquo;promoter&rdquo;. I am suggesting that the House accept this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Alexis FitzGerald made that point and I also made the same point on the Second Stage. The word &ldquo;promoter&rdquo; has several connotations. I should like the Minister to explain what he means by &ldquo;owners&rdquo;. If you have a company with, say, 1,000 shareholders, legally they are the owners, but in fact two or three people with sufficient capital, say, 20 per cent or 25 per cent, could control the company and they could decide its fate. It is possibly too late to do anything about this now but perhaps the Minister would think it over. I should like to see the words &ldquo;controlling owners&rdquo; or &ldquo;controlling proprietors&rdquo; inserted there. The word &ldquo;owners&rdquo; is very wide.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>If one put in a phrase such as the &ldquo;controlling proprietor&rdquo; one might well exclude a public company which would otherwise be eligible. I am advised that the word &ldquo;owner&rdquo; covers as adequately as we can what is intended here without unduly <Col N="16" /> restricting the operation of the board of Fóir Teoranta.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In subsection (2) (b) (iii), line 4 to delete &ldquo;total&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;equity&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>After the Minister's amendment the subsection will read&mdash;&ldquo;the proportion of the owner's contribution to its total capital is reasonable&rdquo;. This is one of the conditions. I do not consider &ldquo;total capital&rdquo; a correct term in this sense. If the equity capital states only £100 and there is a lot of loan stock or debentures in this company's capital structure, it would mean that the owners had made a very small contribution out of their own pockets, so to speak, to the capital of the company. The words &ldquo;equity capital&rdquo; are necessary to ensure that the owners are the owners of the company. It is their contribution to this that counts in the long run. They might have made a very small contribution to the equity capital and at the same time burden the company with a lot of loan capital or debenture stock. For that reason some qualification is required and I suggest the word &ldquo;equity&rdquo; is necessary as the owners of the equity capital are in fact the owners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am unable to accept this amendment for the reason that it could prove unduly restrictive. It can happen frequently that a limited company may have a very small equity in proportion to the total capital employed. It is important that the assessment of the owner's contribution should be in relation to the total capital and not merely the equity capital. If I might take an example, it is conceivable that there could be a case where there was a small amount of equity capital and a fairly substantial loan, say, by the owners in the sense in which I have used that phrase previously. In the normal way if such an application came before the board of Fóir Teoranta I would expect they would say one of the conditions would be that any money due to be repaid to Fóir Teoranta would have to be repaid before any of <Col N="17" /> the loan due to the owners was repaid. This would be a fairly normal condition. It would be unduly restrictive, and perhaps unfair, to relate the assessment of the owners' contribution solely to the equity and not to the total capital employed. The point the Senator has in mind can be covered under the Bill, as it stands, but to accept this amendment could be unduly restrictive and perhaps in some cases unfair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder is the Minister arguing against himself. Perhaps he and I are not quite on the same plane. Perhaps I have misunderstood the subsection. My interpretation is that if an application comes from a company with a very small equity capital and very large loan capital, not necessarily from the owners but from an outside source&mdash;to take an extreme example, if the equity capital is £100 and the company has valuable assets in regard to buildings and machinery, and has managed to raise a very substantial loan, say, £50,000&mdash;the owner's share of the total capital would be infinitesimal if related to the total capital. Therefore, he will not be entitled to get a loan, whereas if his contribution was related to the equity capital&mdash;say it was 50 per cent or 75 per cent&mdash;he would be entitled to be considered for a loan. What I am trying to do is to cover the very point the Minister has made in regard to companies with quite small capital but who, for some reason or another, have raised a lot of loan capital and as a result the owner's contribution to the total capital is perhaps only 5 per cent whereas his contribution to the equity capital could be all the equity capital or a very large proportion of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that the Senator and I are slightly at cross-purposes there. Nevertheless, I would suggest that in the subsection as it reads the proportion of the owners' contribution to the total capital is reasonable. We come back to the situation we have mentioned in discussing many sections of this Bill where we have to depend on the common sense of the board of Fóir Teoranta in dealing with each particular case. It seems to me conceivable that even in the case mentioned by <Col N="18" /> Senator Russell, where taking the proportion of the owners' contribution in relation to the total capital you get 5 per cent, the board might well decide that in a particular case that was reasonable. You could have the reverse situation, too, where the amount of contribution to the equity could be very substantial but could be unreasonable in relation to the total capital. You can have both kinds of situation. The board of Fóir Teoranta must be left to decide in each particular case. The Bill, as it stands, allows that to happen. The introduction of the amendment proposed by Senator Russell could operate in an unduly restrictive way in some cases. The situation the Senator wishes to bring about is not precluded by the wording of the Bill. Ultimately the decision in this matter has to rest with the board of Fóir Teoranta.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">
      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I correct in thinking that if there was a dispute about this, if this was challenged in some way and a legal argument was being conducted and it hinged on a phrase like this phrase in section 4, subsection (2), (b), (iii)</P>
      <P>the proportion of the promoters' contribution to its total capital is reasonable,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>this phrase would not have any legal meaning? I am not expert enough to know anything about this, but it strikes me that there is so much latitude for a subjective view of what is reasonable and what is not, that considerable proportions of this section of the Bill really have little legal meaning because one could argue that in one situation something was reasonable and in another was not. As the Minister has said, in the end we will be depending on the good sense, honesty and ability of the board of Fóir Teoranta to resist the various pressures and to take a very objective view of the firm involved. I am asking for guidance here. I feel that some of these sections would not have much force in a law court if one could conceive of an action being taken or some sort of a legal discussion going on. They are in a sense guidelines to Fóir Teoranta. While from this point of view it is extremely important to get the guidelines <Col N="19" /> set down as well and as fully as possible and to get the feelings of the House expressed as accurately as we can, a section such as this one would not stand up to any argument in a law court.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would just make a further point. It goes back to the Minister's argument on an earlier amendment put forward by me. Is there any danger, however remote, that this subsection would be restrictive? If the word &ldquo;total&rdquo; were not inserted it would leave the board completely free to decide whether the owners' contribution to its capital is reasonable. Once the word &ldquo;total&rdquo; is mentioned you take in all kinds of capital, unless I am misreading the subsection.</P>
      <P>Equity capital, loan capital, possible debentures are taken in and lumped together and the owners' contribution to that total must be reasonable as this Bill and as the Act will read. Any owners in trouble, or likely to get into trouble, reading the Act could say there is no use in our applying to Fóir Teoranta. They could say that their contribution to the equity is undoubtedly reasonable because they put everything they had into it. They might feel that their contribution to the total capital employed in the concern is so small that they obviously would not be considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister mentioned in the course of his speech on Second Reading that he was anxious to encourage firms to go to Fóir Teoranta before they got into such a powerless condition that the industry might close up and a large number of workers might be out of employment. Anybody reading the Bill as it stands, and the Act as it will be in due course, might be put off seeking assistance by the words &ldquo;total qualifying capital&rdquo;. I am sure the Minister would agree that we should do everything possible to encourage firms, particularly conservative family firms, and I speak as one of them myself, who are often very slow to seek outside assistance for various possibly personal reasons. But every encouragement should be given to this type of people to get assistance in time <Col N="20" /> before their industry gets into a hopeless condition.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot purport to give the legal interpretation of this subsection; that is a matter for the courts. For what it is worth, my view would be somewhat similar to that expressed by Senator West, that is that, strictly speaking, this is a guideline from the Oireachtas to the board of Fóir Teoranta and the correct interpretation of this would be what is reasonable in the opinion of the board of Fóir Teoranta. On that basis we get back to what I said before, that one is depending on the common sense of the board.</P>
      <P>To return to the amendment, there could be a case in which the owners would have a high proportion of the equity and a very low proportion of the total capital because of borrowings and so on from sources other than the owners and that under this provision it would be open to the board of Fóir Teoranta in such circumstances to say the contribution of the owners to the total capital is not reasonable. On the other hand, one could, as I have indicated earlier, have a situation in which the contribution to the equity capital was small but the contribution to the total capital, allowing for loans and so on, would be quite reasonable. There are both kinds of situations. The introduction of the word &ldquo;equity&rdquo;, as suggested by the amendment, would remove the flexibility which is in the Bill as it stands. Not alone would it not add to the Bill but it could create difficulties by introducing inflexibility. Therefore, I could not accept that amendment.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the point the Senator is making, but I think there is an aspect of it that he may not have considered. Let me give him an example. One might have the case of a firm employing, say, 20 to 30 people. If that firm closed down those 20 or 30 people might be absorbed relatively easily into another local industry. If we accept the Senator's amendment, in such a case that firm would not be eligible for assistance from Fóir Teoranta. It is conceivable that in such a case the industry concerned might be such that it could affect, say, a considerable number of local farmers who were providing the raw material for that company's operations. Such a situation would have serious repercussions locally but not serious repercussions on employment. Nevertheless, I would think it is the kind of case&mdash;I am sure the Senator would agree&mdash; which should be eligible.</P>

      <P>I should like to support what the Minister has said because it seems to me the insertion of these two words restricts this section entirely to considerations of employment and does not leave latitude which would be required to consider other possibilities. The Minister has mentioned one such possibility. I think there are quite a few others which could arise. Supposing a small firm producing a certain specialised piece of equipment was to go under in an area in which there was fairly high employment and the employees could find other work relatively easily; even so, it could have a holding up effect on other parts of <Col N="23" /> the industrial scene; it might not necessarily cause unemployment directly but it could however cause considerable problems. The amendment here rather restricts things because my interpretation of the amended phrase would be that this paragraph (vi) would be dealing with employment and no other problems. I should like to see other problems being considered. However, I think this phrase is a guideline and not a very tight legal phrase. It is such a subjective phrase that it may not have any legal meaning, and therefore would be open to interpretation in many different ways. I should like to see this section made capable of a wide interpretation.</P>

      <P>That is the point I wanted to make. With regard to &ldquo;ancillary,&rdquo; that is a very wide term. Senator Fintan Kennedy on the last occasion talked about the catering industry and all its ramifications. I do not think the Minister adverted to that. I adverted to the transport industry&mdash;road transport, rail transport, water transport&mdash;which are all ancillary to industry. At the moment transport is a vital factor in industry, as the Minister himself will appreciate, particularly industries in the western part of the country. In that regard I think I am correct in saying that a commission has been sitting for the past four years or more to look into the question of transport costs of industries in the West of Ireland.</P>
      <P>It has not yet reported and I do not know when it will report. The only reason I mentioned it in this context is that transport is of vital importance to an industry, particularly one that is a good distance from either its raw material or its customers. That applies to a number of industries in the West of Ireland, as the Minister will agree. For this reason transport would appear to be an ancillary industry and a vital factor in the cost of an industry or a concern of almost any kind on the west coast of Ireland.</P>

As the Minister has just said, there is considerable room for argument and, as I have said, for subjective opinion on which firms come under some of the subsections of this section and which do not. What is envisaged? <Col N="25" /> Is the Minister going to lay down further guidelines to the board of Fóir Teoranta about the type of company which is to come under consideration, or is the board of Fóir Teoranta going to be entirely independent and make up its own mind? I do think that is one of the things which come strongly from this section: there could be considerable disagreement, or the board of Fóir Teoranta could consider that industries came under scrutiny with which the Minister would not agree. Is there any provision anywhere in the Bill in which the Minister can either enforce his will on the board in this matter or will the board be given a free rein and will they be completely free to decide which industries come under their ken and which do not?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>This problem arises occasionally in relation to the Industrial Development Authority. The precedent there is that the board of the IDA themselves consider whether a particular industry comes within the legal terms of reference which they have. I have known of cases in which they have excluded certain categories and some years later on reconsideration and on examining changes of circumstances in a particular industry have included them or <i>vice versa.</i> On that basis I would expect that the board of Fóir Teoranta would operate in the beginning on the clear-cut basis where there is no question of argument, and then, as doubtful cases came up, would consider the matter and would decide whether that particular category was in or out. I would expect that this will be the way the board will operate. This is the way in which the board of the IDA has operated. The circumstances would be very similar, but I do not think I am in a position to give any clear-cut definition at this stage. Indeed the phrase in the Bill is deliberately wide and broad in order to try to ensure that we do not have narrow definitions excluding cases which most Members of both Houses would feel should be covered. Like many of the other matters to which we have referred, when it comes to the difficult, marginal cases the final decision will have to be made by the board of Fóir Teoranta.</P>

Supposing the board of Fóir Teoranta changes its personnel over a period of time.

It has been improved by amendments but the real point which we should be trying to establish is that there will be as little unfairness as possible. It hinges on the personnel, and this is the crucial thing about the whole of Fóir Teoranta operations. It is the personnel who are going to be involved and who are going to be making these decisions. They are, as we see from this section, going to have a fair amount of latitude.</P>
      <P>I am glad that the Minister says that at first they are going to take the cases which clearly come, without argument or discussion, within the provisions of this section. No doubt there are going to be cases in which there will be a fair amount of argument, some of it in public. I presume that in this sort of case the board will consult with the Minister and maybe with some other Government Department on the problems involved.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In subsection (2) (b), lines 18 and <Col N="27" /> 19 to delete &ldquo;, and may be removed from office,&rdquo; and in line 20 after &ldquo;Commerce&rdquo; to add &ldquo;for a period of five years and shall be eligible for reappointment&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This is the most important amendment I have put down and one to which I attach great significance. The Minister has. I think, confirmed in several statements made in the House this afternoon that a tremendous responsibility will rest with the board of Fóir Teoranta, and their success as an instrument of reorganisation and in the saving of industries throughout the country will depend on the ability and integrity of the men who guide the company at board level. It would be a great mistake to allow this section, as set out at present, to stand whereby, as stated in subsection (b) of the section:</P>
    <P>...the chairman and other directors shall be appointed, and may be removed from office, by the Minister with the consent of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>You will not get the type of personnel that I imagine the Minister wants to get for this new board if they are going to be appointed at the whim of a Minister&mdash;I say &ldquo;a Minister&rdquo; specifically&mdash; to be hired or fired at his or his successor's will. Any man of any stature, particularly the chairman, will require, first of all, an adequate salary to go with the position of responsibility; he will want a degree of permanence&mdash; that is why I suggest a period of five years&mdash;and he will want a free hand, which in fact he gets under this Bill. However we might argue about minor sections of the Bill by and large I would agree with the Minister that there is a great deal of flexibility in the Bill. For this reason you must have men of integrity and ability on the board, men who are assured of appointment for a reasonable period of years and are suitably rewarded for their work.</P>
    <P>I think there are great possibilities in regard to Fóir Teoranta. I did not think this at the outset; to be quite frank I thought that they would be just another useful political agency for <Col N="28" /> lending money to firms in what I might call sensitive political areas. Having studied it in greater depth now I believe this could be a great instrument for saving industries in danger of collapse and bringing about very necessary changes in the set-up of industries, particularly in areas where there would be very serious repercussions if a major industry were to collapse, such as in the south and in the west. To do that effectively you must have a proper board, a board who will know what they are doing and be sufficiently independent to take unpopular steps if these have to be taken. If you have that type of board with the degree of independence to which they are entitled if they are going to work effectively, this could be a very useful instrument indeed.</P>
    <P>If it is to be the case that a man does not know how long his period of office will be, that possibly he is under some pressure of one kind or another, it will not be a success. The whole success or failure of this Bill depends on the personnel, and their degree of success, in turn, depends on the conditions they enjoy. Two essential conditions, I think, are independence and security of tenure. A third one is proper remuneration for the responsibilities they have to undertake. I feel very strongly about this and I know that Senator Alexis FitzGerald, who unfortunately cannot be here today, spoke at some length and with purpose on this particular point. He is a man who has had considerable experience of industry and industrial development, as have had other Senators, such as Senator Nash.</P>
    <P>I hope the House will agree with me that if you want an effective board you must have certain conditions. If we do not want that, if we want a hire-and-fire type of board, if we want to appoint a few civil servants&mdash;and I do not say that in any derogatory sense&mdash; just to put them on for a few years and then change them again, this board is not going to be an effective instrument for saving industry or for developing industry or for bringing about much needed changes in industry. Let us be frank about it, there are industries just struggling on, through no fault of the people employed in them, but due to <Col N="29" /> rank bad management and possibly rank bad decisions of policy by the board of directors.</P>
    <P>If this board are going to do their job properly they will possibly have to make unpopular decisions from time to time. The least we can do for the board is to give them the independence and the strength and backing to make these decisions in the interest of employment and in the interest of the country generally. I feel very strongly about this; I am sure other Senators have strong views on it too, though they may not be exactly in line with my own. I speak with experience in the field of industry over quite a long number of years and I would strongly urge the Minister to accept my amendment, or one similar to it, if he can find a better way of phrasing it. Provided he is agreeable to give the board the conditions and the independence to which they are entitled, I am quite prepared to agree to any changes in my amendment, or to an equivalent amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I should tell the House what the intention is, because it is not in the Bill. It is intended to provide in the articles of association that the directors would retire by rotation, the first one to retire by lot and then thereafter on seniority. I am just giving a rough outline of the procedure, which it one followed in a number of State companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are certain advantages in this procedure. It makes the removal of people who have proved to be unsuitable as directors relatively easy and gives an opportunity of introducing new blood on to the board without there being any break in continuity. It is important in a board like this to establish a certain expertise and ensure that there should be no major break in continuity. I think that Senator Russell is mistaken to some extent in his approach to this in so far as he seems to be thinking in particular of the chairman being somewhat on the lines of a chief executive. In fact the members of the board, including the chairman, will be part-time. The question of permanence&mdash;that is permanence <i>qua</i> permanence&mdash;will not be <Col N="30" /> a matter of any considerable concern to them. Any member of a State board, I believe, would be concerned to ensure that his services would not be dispensed with at least before his term of office was up. One will find few, if any, precedents for a situation in which a member of a State board had his services dispensed with before his normal term of office was up. There may have been some but it certainly is not a frequent occurrence and there is no reason to believe that it would be a frequent occurrence in relation to the board of Fóir Teoranta.</P>
    <P>I agree entirely with Senator Russell that this will be an important board and will require people of a particularly high calibre. Not everybody of high calibre will be suitable for appointment to this board. There are certain qualities of mind that will be required and a certain balance of different kinds of minds will be required. In my opinion, the board will not easily be filled with suitable people because of the nature and importance of the work they will have to do but I think difficulties will arise in the selection and persuading of suitable people to accept appointment. I do not think the difficulty will arise in relation to any lack of permanence or any feeling that they will be appointed, or maintain office, at the whim&mdash;as Senator Russell said&mdash;of a Minister. This is true of all appointments to State boards. It has not operated as a problem and, as I have indicated, there are few if any precedents for a situation in which such people have had their services dispensed with at the whim of a Minister.</P>
    <P>On the basis of the experience we have of State boards, while there will be problems about this board they are not the kind of problems Senator Russell anticipates. I do not think the question of laying down a fixed term of office is by any means essential and, as I have indicated, the intention is to do so on a different basis, on the basis of rotation to preserve continuity. I think Senator Russell's fears in this regard are misdirected. In so far as fears should be expressed here they should be in relation to the calibre of the people who will be appointed rather than to their terms of appointment.</P>
    <Col N="31" />
    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">
      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>I share some of the fears of Senator Russell and also some of those expressed by Senator Alexis FitzGerald. I am not convinced that what the Minister has said allays them. It is clear from the discussion now, and the discussion on the Second Stage of the Bill, that this is the real crunch section. The whole performance of Fóir Teoranta and the way in which they fulfil what will be a very important national function will depend on the composition of the board.</P>
      <P>When this Bill becomes an Act and when Fóir Teoranta are established they may find themselves carrying out their operations under considerable public scrutiny. This is generally a good thing. People should know how public money is being spent. Because many of the cases with which Fóir Teoranta will have to deal will have already received a fair amount of publicity, any decision they will arrive at will consequently receive considerable publicity. Therefore, it is most important that the board&mdash;and I am sure Senator Russell will agree with me here&mdash;which the Minister will appoint will not only be of high calibre but will be seen by the public to be a board of high calibre, that they will be seen by the public to be a board consisting of men of integrity, that they will be seen by the public to be a board consisting of people who will be able to resist political pressures from whatever quarter.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt that political pressure will be put on members of the board by various people, by the Government in office, by the Opposition, or by a political party to which people may belong. It must be absolutely clear to the public, if they are to have confidence in the operations which Fóir Teoranta will carry out, that the men on the board are capable of resisting such political pressures, are capable of taking unpleasant or unpopular steps if they feel they are necessary and that they will be seen to do what is right in the national interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the Minister that it will be difficult to find people of the right <Col N="32" /> calibre, experience and expertise to fill the posts. I believe that there are Members of this House who would make excellent directors of Fóir Teoranta and I am sorry that the amendment in section 18 did not go further than it has. It is essential that the board of Fóir Teoranta obtain the confidence of the public and that we do everything in our power to ensure this. I support Senator Russell on this amendment because we cannot have a situation in which members of the board can be appointed and removed from office and even though the Minister has said this very rarely happened in the boards of State bodies in the past I would still like to see Senator Russell's amendment, or some version of it, accepted. I would not be too worried about the actual wording of the amendment but I am worried about the spirit of it. It is important that this should be incorporated in the Bill. I hope we have not moved away from the idea of the concept of service being connected with a post like this. People who accept directorships should be accepting them with the idea that they are carrying out a public service. They should not be people who would accept such directorships because of the salary involved, or because of the political power it might give them. Since this is so important I feel strongly that some amendment of this type should be inserted.</P>
    <P>I was very interested to hear Senator Russell say that when he looked at this Bill for the first time, he was not very optimistic: in fact, he was rather pessimistic and felt that the Fóir Teoranta operation might fall into the category of some of our previous Government operations, which have not been tremendously successful because people were unable to resist political pressures. I believe like Senator Russell that everything hinges on this section and I should like the Minister to reconsider the amendment.</P>
    <P>I should also like to ask him, when he says that in the articles of association the directors are to retire by rotatiton, when does he intend that the first director should retire? How long a period after the board have been set up? In addition. I should like to say <Col N="33" /> that it is understood that the directors will not be full-time but will be part-time directors. Of necessity, we shall have to look for experts from the industrial area to take this sort of post. This is not the same as permanence. Of course, some people would be very happy to take a part-time post of this nature because of the political power it would give them, to put it quite crudely and straightforwardly.</P>
    <P>It is essential that nobody is given any of these posts on political grounds. From the discussion we had in this House, it would be Members of this House, from either side, who would fill this sort of post. They would be excellent members of the board precisely because they have not forgotten the concept of service to the public, which will be the crucial thing here. At times the board of An Fóir Teoranta may be operating under the public eye and the media will probably pay considerable attention to the decisions they take. Therefore, it is essential that the board of An Fóir Teoranta be seen to be independent of the pressures that will be put on them.</P>
    <P>I should like to support the spirit of this amendment. I do not like this phrase that people can be removed from office at the whim of a Minister for Industry and Commerce. It could mean that in a political crisis situation they could be removed by a political party. I think that they should be independent of this and I support the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Minister replies I wish to say that I agree completely with one statement he made, that it may be difficult to get persons of the right calibre to serve on this board. People of such calibre are generally very busy people and, as Senator West said, they are not prepared to give some of their time in the interests of the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that the inclusion of what I call &ldquo;the hire and fire&rdquo; section in this sub-clause will make greater the difficulty of getting suitable people to serve on this board. There will be a better chance, particularly in the case of the chairman, of getting a man of ability and integrity <Col N="34" /> to serve if he knows he is going to serve for a stated number of years, say for three or five years, or longer. If he is the right type of man and is prepared to give a proportion of his time in the interests of the community and, in this case, of saving a section of industry from collapse, he will risk a reasonable period. He may have no doubts whatever about the intention of the present Minister but he may have some qualms about possible future Ministers, or change in Ministries. For that reason it will be harder to do what the Minister admits is a hard task, that is to get people of the right calibre to serve on boards of this type.</P>
    <P>As Senator West pointed out, the people who serve on this board should be free, not only from day-to-day pressures, political and otherwise, but also from ministerial pressures. That is vitally important if they are to be independent and take decisions that may be unpopular. I should like to see this board&mdash;even if they are to be a part-time board only&mdash;given the opportunity over a stated number of years of seeing what they can do. If they are found to be unsuitable at the end of that time obviously they need not be reappointed. However, if they are suitable and with three or five years experience behind them I should like to see them being automatically considered for reappointment.</P>
    <P>There is a lot to be said for continuity in boards of this kind. Experience is a very valuable asset in any business. As the Minister knows, it is also very valuable in most aspects of industrial, commercial and political life. It is something that should be preserved wherever possible and wherever desirable. I do not know the position with regard to all State companies. I was under the impression that in most State companies directors were appointed for a stated period. I should certainly like to see written into this section a stated number of years and the exclusion of the right of the Minister to remove a director from office.</P>
    <P>In the case of the chairman it is primarily important that the right man be appointed. Even if he is only part-time he must be completely independent in <Col N="35" /> every sense of the word, including independence from ministerial or political pressures. I do not think that such will be the case in this set-up. The Minister may disagree with me on that point. Perhaps we can only agree to disagree. I know that I should like to see a change and I think that it would certainly improve the Bill and would improve the working of the Act and the company.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to refer to Senator West's query. The first retirement from the board by lot would be envisaged to take place at the first annual general meeting of the company which would be within 15 months of their formation. Secondly, we should distinguish between State companies on the one hand and statutory boards on the other. In the case of statutory boards it is normal that the directors are appointed for fixed periods, but the procedure I have outlined is the one that was followed in relation to several State companies. These include the Agricultural Credit Corporation, the Industrial Credit Company, the air companies, Nítrigin Éireann Teoranta, Irish Steel Holdings Limited, Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann Teoranta and Irish Shipping Limited. All of those have the procedure I outlined of retirement of directors by rotation and that procedure is envisaged for Fóir Teoranta.</P>
      <P>There is no point in repeating what I have already stated. The arguments advanced by Senator Russell and Senator West are academic in the light of the practical experience we have. Being academic they will not get to the root of the real problem; they are based on fears which could be expressed for political reasons but cannot be expressed on the basis of experience of the operation of State companies. Nobody can show that there has been a practice by Ministers of any Government whereby they use their powers of removal of directors of State companies from office to ensure that they get their own way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I, in my experience, have not come across this, nor have I heard of this happening in previous Governments of <Col N="36" /> any political view. This is an academic point. All our experience shows that this is not a practical difficulty and that the practical difficulties involved in getting the right people for this board do not relate to the terms of appointment to the board. They relate to the calibre of the people and with people of the right calibre being persuaded to take on this work. If people with the right calibre take on membership of this board they will only do so out of a sense of public service. It will be a thankless task and I do not wish to put off people who might be asked to become members of this board but I do not think that the problems relate to the terms of appointment as suggested in the arguments for this amendment. They relate to different matters which cannot be covered in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">

      <P>Regarding the rotational system does it mean that the chairman is subject to resignation?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>It sounds to me more like a voluntary committee. It is an appalling set-up. Notwithstanding the Minister's comments about academic points made by Senator West and myself, there is nothing very academic about saying that a system like this, whereby each director in turn has to rotate in a year or 15 months, will not make for continuity of effort or for independence of the members of the board and will certainly not develop the dedication the Minister spoke about. You will not get men of calibre, integrity and ability to give their service to the community knowing that if their name comes out of a hat in 15 months they are off the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Senator misunderstood me. What I meant was that the first and maybe the first two or three, until you have an order of seniority of appointment, would be determined by lot. That would simply mean that if they had to retire from the board there would be vacancies, but they would be eligible for reappointment. This practice is followed in the various companies I have mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>That does not dispel <Col N="37" /> my doubts. Although the Minister has clarified the position it does not get away from the basic objection I have. You are trying to do two completely incompatible things&mdash;get the right people who are prepared to give their time and services to the community for what the Minister has described&mdash;I agree with him&mdash;as a largely thankless task and at the same time put them on a sort of draw-by-lot basis of resignation.</P>
      <P>I am convinced that the proper way is to set up the board and give them a fixed term of office and an opportunity to try themselves. The Minister has more information in this regard than I have and this may have worked in other companies. This is the first time, so far as I am aware, that we have set up a company of this particular type to do the things envisaged under this Bill and for that reason we should not look backwards to what succeeded or appeared to succeed in the case of other companies. This is unique in the history of the State and this company are being asked to perform an important and very unpopular and distasteful task. I wish to emphasise that the board must have independence and some degree of continuity in office. Notwithstanding the Minister's remarks in that regard, I am convinced he is going the wrong way about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">
      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to back Senator Russell in what he has said. During the discussion on section 4 it became quite clear that there was considerable latitude of interpretation open to board members of the type of firm that could be helped by Fóir Teoranta; we should also remember the extent of the help, up to a certain fairly high limit, which will be decided by the board members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Russell said this State company would be doing a job which is essentially quite different from any of the companies mentioned by the Minister. This is a very important point and we should not neglect it. As Senator Russell stated, the board of Fóir Teoranta will undoubtedly operate in some extremely politically sensitive areas and it is essential that we have a board which will not <Col N="38" /> respond to any political sensations whatever but will only look at things from the industrial, financial, social and employment points of view. The parallel the Minister has drawn with the other organisations, such as Irish Steel Holdings, has no comparison in the latitude allowed to members of the board to spend public money. Some of the decisions they will have to take will be very unpopular and may be unpopular with the Government of the day. We want to make them as independent of the Government of the day, or of any other party, as is humanly possible.</P>
    <P>The parallel is not a good one and therefore we should not be swayed by that particular argument. I presume that if the members of the board whom the Minister judges to be successful and competent come up for retirement by rotation and offer their retirement they will be reappointed. I do not see anything wrong with that but I think it would be much more in the public interest if we took the retirement of board members out of the hands of the Minister and made it automatic.</P>
    <P>Finally, the Minister said, and I am quite sure he is right, he does not want to put off prospective board members or directors. There are enough people who will take on a task of this nature and magnitude. It is going to be a pretty tough business. I am quite sure they are not going to get a remuneration which would be equated financially with a job of this nature. I am quite sure that is correct; I do not think they should be paid as if they were directors of a big international company, despite the fact they will be doing just as important a job. The one thing that would encourage an unscrupulous person to try to get on a board of this nature is the prospect of the political power it could give him and, in fact, would give him. In the past we have had the appointment of unscrupulous people, quite unwittingly, and it has caused considerable problems. I am sure the Minister would not dream of doing this but these things sometimes happen. As we say, when a piece of legislation like this comes up <Col N="39" /> Ministers change and a different Minister could take a completely different point of view.</P>
    <P>I think Senator Russell is right. His arguments bear more weight than the Minister's because of the very special nature of the task, its tremendous importance and the amount of public money that will be spent by Fóir Teoranta. If we look at the record of Taiscí Stáit a great deal of it, I am afraid, will go down the drain. That is unavoidable. The less the better, but some certainly will. The public will know about this. Bearing those points in mind the independence of the board from political and Government pressures is absolutely essential and I would like to see the Minister reconsidering his attitude to this amendment.</P>

      <P>The Senator may take it it would not get that kind of money from the Minister for Finance unless it needed it. There may be a slight misunderstanding. What is involved here is a guarantee by the Minister for Finance of money borrowed by Fóir Teoranta. I do not know if that was quite clear to the Senator? That is what is covered in this section. Instead of getting the money direct from the Minister Fóir Teoranta might borrow with a guarantee from the Minister but its total borrowings, whichever way it gets the money, must come within the overall limit prescribed in the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes. I think there is an actuarial method of calculating the liability on foot of a guarantee of that nature. Presumably that would be applied but the overall limit would still apply, that is, the £7½ million.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>We have been talking here, under section 14, about the amounts which Fóir Teoranta may borrow. There is no limit on the <Col N="42" /> amount which Fóir Teoranta may turnover by way of advance to companies, getting repayments, and then money paid to other companies, so that, if they guarantee money borrowed by company X, that will be part of what I might call their turnover. There is no limit on that.</P>
      <P>We are talking about two different things. Section 14 relates to money being borrowed by Fóir Teoranta. I think Senator Russell's question was related to moneys which would be advanced by Fóir Teoranta, whether by way of direct advance or by guarantee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I think one more or less hinges on the other. If the company under guarantee from the Minister can borrow only up to £7½ million, in addition to relending that, or taking up shares from companies, can they guarantee the repayment of loans to companies?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, there is no limit in the Bill on the amount they can deal with in that way. There is of course, as the Senator will appreciate, a practical limit, in the sense that if, say, they had borrowed to the limit of their statutory ability, and they were offering a guarantee to a bank the bank might well refuse to accept the guarantee as being one with which they could not comply. This is a practical difficulty; it is not a legal one. As far as the Bill is concerned, there is no limit laid down on the amount of what I call turnover, the amount that the company may advance by way of direct loan or guarantee. There is a practical limit, but not a legal limit.</P>

      <P>Government amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>In page 5, between lines 44 and 45, to insert the following new subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) Where a person who is either an officer or a servant in the employment of the Company becomes a member of either House of the Oireachtas&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="43" /> (a) he shall, during the period commencing upon his becoming entitled under the Standing Orders of that House to sit therein and ending either when he ceases to be a member of that House or, if it should sooner happen, upon his resignation or retirement from such employment or upon the termination of such employment by the Company, stand seconded from such employment,</P>
    <P>(b) he shall not be paid by, or entitled to receive from, the Company any salary or wages, as the case may be, in respect of that period.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to extend to officers and servants the usual provision relating to Oireachtas membership included in legislation governing State-sponsored bodies. I indicated on the Second Stage that it will be a matter for the board of Fóir Teoranta to decide whether the company should have their own staff or whether they will operate through the staff of the Industrial Credit Company, in other words, to have the ICC act as managers in the way they do to Taiscí Stáit. This will be a decision for the board of Fóir Teoranta. However, it did seem to me that by the omission of this provision it appeared to some extent that a decision was being made or that an option was being exercised and I would, therefore, recommend to the House the acceptance of this amendment which does not commit the board of Fóir Teoranta to either course but leaves both courses open without any complications. By either course, I mean either employing their own staff or using the ICC as managers for their operations.</P>

      <P>I want to raise an objection to this section. It is a section which occurs in a great deal of legislation of this type. It is a hangover <Col N="44" /> from pretty archaic British legislation. It is a section we have inherited and it should not become a blanket clause in all legislation of this type. There is a very good case for the Government considering whether this is necessary in legislation of this type, whether or not Members of either House of the Oireachtas should be eligible for posts of this nature. The point at issue in this legislation is really going to be the establishment of a board of people of the highest calibre and integrity. I do not think Members of the Oireachtas should be debarred. If we are going to choose people of the highest calibre it may happen that there are qualified people in the Oireachtas, people who are known to be of the highest integrity and there is a good argument for cutting out this section altogether.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>I would reply to Senator Ó Maoláin that surely he is not going to rule out members of political parties altogether from this because this is what his argument implies. That is the logic of it. It is not just Members of the Oireachtas; any member of a political party is subject to some pressure in that he will have to agree, at least to a certain extent, with the aims, objectives and methods used by his party. If Senator Ó Maoláin's argument were pursued to its logical conclusion one would have to have Independents only as directors. This might be a very desirable situation. However, I do not think it would, so I would just like to hear what the Minister has to say about this provision as a blanket provision always occurring in this sort of legislation.</P>

      <P>I ought to point out to him that I am neither a member of any political party or the possessor of a telephone. It is not a case of people not being subject to political pressures. The point that I made earlier, and I think Senator Ó Maoláin was here at the time, was that the members of this board are going to be subject to political pressures. It does not matter what their political views are. The point is, are they people who will be able to withstand these pressures? That is the crucial point, and I think there would be Members of the Oireachtas who would be able to withstand political pressures while doing a job of this nature. That is the point I am trying to make, not that they should not have political affiliations but that they are people who would be able to withstand them and some people can and some people obviously cannot.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>This argument is one that comes up every time a Bill of this nature comes before either House of the Oireachtas. It will be known to Senators that this kind of provision is inserted in all these Bill; in other words, it has been accepted as a general proposition that Members of the Oireachtas should not be either directors or employees of State companies. In so far as employees are concerned they should not continue as employees while Members of the Oireachtas though provision is made for them to resume their employment if they cease to be Members of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would agree entirely with Senator West when he says that there are Members of the Oireachtas who are of first-class calibre and first-class integrity and who would, perhaps, make excellent members of the board of Fóir Teoranta or of any other State <Col N="46" /> board. I certainly would agree with that proposition. But that is not the end of the story. The fact is that it is important in a democracy that not only must it be seen that there is no undue political interference or appointment for political reasons, not only must that not happen, but it must be seen that it is not happening. To illustrate the point I am trying to make, let me follow up what Senator West said in response to the question from the leader of the House. He said that, if one were to follow the point to its logical conclusion, one would come to the opinion that the only Members of the Oireachtas who would be eligible would be Independent Members.</P>

      <P>In response to a question from Senator Ó Maoláin Senator West said: &ldquo;If you follow that to its logical conclusion you come to the opinion that only the Independent Members of the Oireachtas would be eligible.&rdquo; Let us take it that the Senator meant Independent Members of the Oireachtas. I want to say to Senator West, that, although he may describe himself as an Independent and other Members of the Oireachtas may so describe themselves, if he thinks he is going to convince any member of any political party to regard him or any other Independent Member as being either non-political or not subject to political pressure he had better think again. I am saying this not in any spirit of criticism of Senator West or any of his Independent colleagues but merely to illustrate the reasoning behind this section. It is impossible to take any Member of the Oireachtas, whether he is a member of a political party or not, and to appoint him to a State board and not to have problems arising which far outweigh from the point of view of the public interest the maintenance of the right of a Member of the Oireachtas otherwise qualified to be appointed to the board. It is a sacrifice that has, I think, to be made by Members of the Oireachtas in the public interest, taking all the factors concerned into account.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not agree that subsection (1) of the clause is unfair? If he is nominated and is not elected to either House he still has to suffer the fate of being discharged from the board. I do not completely disagree with the Minister but I cannot see very much difference in appointing a politician, be it a Senator or TD, on the board or the Minister's own appointee; whether the Minister believes it or not, the public certainly will take it that he digs with the right foot politically.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I think on balance it is probably better to have this position obtain. I do not know the historical background, but I think it is a native product rather than something which was imported. I recall about 20 years ago in the other House when a provision of this sort was introduced by an inter-Party Government&mdash;I think the particular occasion was the Irish Newsagency Bill&mdash;it was regarded as something of a novelty that we should express in our legislation that Members of the Oireachtas should not be members of bodies of this sort. On balance it is probably better that that should be so, principally for the reasons that the Minister has given; but the Minister will see himself that, if he follows his own reasoning logically, there should be a great number of other people who should be ruled out on similar grounds from being members or employees of State bodies. For example, if you take the test as being that impartiality should not alone be there but should be seen to be there, which, I understand, was the argument the Minister used, then exactly the same argument would apply for example to ex-Members of either House of the Oireachtas. If you want to pursue that policy of what might be described as demonstrable impartiality then legislation of this type would require, I think, not only that you exclude people who are Members of the Oireachtas but that you exclude people who were at any time Members of the Oireachtas. That would be going altogether too far and it shows the difficulty of trying to get a provision which will meet with public approval and, at the same time, not rule out <Col N="48" /> from consideration people of the type the Minister may wish to attract into a service of this sort. The compromise that has been arrived at in this country of excluding or disqualifying Members of the Oireachtas is one which by now, at any rate, is fairly well understood and approved of by the public generally.</P>
      <P>Senator Russell has put his finger on a weakness in this particular section. I cannot remember offhand whether the same provisions apply in other Acts, but it does seem to be rather anomolous that a person merely by being nominated should be excluded from membership. It is theoretically possible under our electoral laws both in regard to the Dáil and the Seanad for a person to be nominated without his knowedge. Admittedly he has an opportunity of withdrawing his nomination but the mere nomination under this section would disqualify him. The Minister might look at that again.</P>

      <P>To the best of my knowledge the provision here is the same as in other legislation. I know positively it is similar to some other legislation with which I was personally dealing. I think it is in common form. The reasoning behind it is that a director as a policy maker and final judge on loan applications could well be considered an inappropriate person to continue in that role if he had been nominated. The same argument could be made about a member of the staff, although with less force, but there is also the factor that the director is part-time whereas the member of the staff is normally permanent and pensionable. It would, I think, be unfair to require a person in a permanent and pensionable position to interrupt his employment in advance of being assured of a seat in the Oireachtas and possibly with consequences of interruption of entitlement to superannuation. Broadly speaking, that is the kind of reasoning <Col N="49" /> behind the difference in treatment of the directors and members of the staff.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want to make a very brief comment. I have been critical of the Bill in some parts and I hope this was in a constructive vein. I should like to wish the new board every success when it is set up. I believe, and I expressed this opinion during discussion today, that it can be a very effective instrument in preventing serious deterioration in certain sensitive industries in the country, provided the personnel appointed to the board are the proper people. That is the one fear I have about the Bill and I have already expressed at considerable length my views as to why I think we may not get the people the Minister wants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I asked the Minister, when withdrawing my amendment in regard to the directors, to look at the articles of association so as to provide that the directors would get a stated period of office and that this rotation system would not apply in this case. I do not want to reiterate what I said before, but this board which we are seeking to set up now are not comparable to other boards. They are not comparable to other State boards such as the ESB, Bord na Móna, CIE or any of the rest of them, or any other statutory body. They are being called on to do a different type of duty and a lot of its success will depend completely and absolutely on its chairman and board of directors in the first place, and on executive and other staff generally in the second place. For that reason, I want to make a final appeal to the Minister to reconsider the question of retirement of the directors by a system which I think is more appropriate to a voluntary committee than anything <Col N="50" /> else, and to give them a stated period of office. I think that would help to get people of the right type and with the necessary qualifications to make a success of this board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I should like to thank the House for the fairly constructive approach to the Bill. In many instances it was quite constructive and I think the Bill certainly has improved as a result of its passage through this House. Like Senator Russell, I want to avoid going back over what I said before, but I want to say that I think he is mistaken in thinking that the terms of appointment are important. It is my experience in relation to the appointments to State boards where we had difficulty, perhaps, in getting people suitable for particular appointments, that the problem has never related to the terms of whether the Minister could remove them or how long they were appointed for. It has never related to that; it has always related to the suitability, or more important, the availability of the people who were most suitable.</P>
      <P>I want to assure the House that every effort will be made, and is being made, to ensure that we get the right calibre of people for this board. I would have regarded this Bill in the normal way as being very important, but in the context of our present economic situation and of the unemployment problem with which we are faced, I regard it as being of vital importance. I am very pleased that it has been passed today by the House. It will have to go back to Dáil Éireann but as far as I am concerned I want to have as little delay as possible in the enactment of this Bill because I regard it as being potentially of major importance in dealing with problems of redundancy which may arise, and dealing with them more effectively than they can be dealt with under existing machinery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because of that importance and the urgency in my view of passing the Bill, I have already had some preliminary consideration and consultation with my colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, in regard to possible membership of this board. The most <Col N="51" /> important thing that has emerged as far as I am concerned is the enormous difficulty with which we are faced in getting suitable people. There will, of course, be very many unsuitable people who if they hear of what I am just saying will have a letter or a phone call in to me tomorrow, or to the Minister for Industry and Commerce. We are not interested in that kind of person. I am talking about the kind who would be suitable; and the problems which emerge are enormous. I am mentioning this in order to make it clear to the House not only that I consider this Bill to be extremely important, but also to indicate some of the reasons why I say that I did not think the problems being raised in regard to the terms of the appointment of the board were the really important ones at all. That is not my impression and despite the difficulties I am satisfied that we will succeed in getting a board which will be fully competent to do the job that is envisaged in this Bill and envisaged by the Houses of the Oireachtas. It will be difficult, but I am confident that we can get a board to do what I regard as very important work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>We are in the unusual position this year of discussing the Appropriation Act rather than the Appropriation Bill. We are discussing it in the year 1972 and consequently it gives us the opportunity of looking back at a full year, 1971. I do not think it is any exaggeration to say that in 1971 we witnessed again a year of chaos, a year of crises, a year of calamity, a year where once more the hopes of the ordinary people of the country for political stability and economic progress were dashed and sacrificed at the altar of discord, dissent and division inside the ranks of the Government party, and the ordinary people of the country were the unwilling, sacrificial victims of the cleavages within the Fianna Fáil Party. In such circumstances I do not think it is any wonder that we emerge into the year 1972 with mounting unemployment, with a still soaring cost of living, with fairly general discontent, with an evident degree of lawlessness in the country, with a situation where there is questioning even of the value of our parliamentary institutions.</P>
      <P>I propose to spend some time on the various topics I have mentioned. It is difficult for anyone to take any satisfaction or solace out of the performance of the present Government party over the last 12 months. Possibly those who are prepared to view the death throes of a tottering Government as something in the nature of a spectator sport can derive some pleasure and some satisfaction from the picture that has emerged over the last 12 months. If they take some kind of sadistic pleasure in seeing a once powerful party wriggling, as the Government party are wriggling in office, possibly they would be able to look with a certain amount of complacency on the present Government remaining in office for some period. But, so far as the ordinary people are concerned, they cannot see any pleasure in such a prospect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is no harm, in looking at the Government's performance, to recall <Col N="53" /> the prospect that was held out when the present Government party were seeking the votes of the electorate approximately 2½ years ago because I think they did, in their election messages, accurately foresee what was required in this country for a period of years. They held out to the people, I think, the prospect that what was required would be supplied by the Fianna Fáil Party in Government and support was sought for the election of that party to Government on the basis that a united Government, vigorously and resolutely pursuing clearly defined policies endorsed by the people and supported by a secure majority in Dáil Éireann, was needed and that Fianna Fáil could be relied upon by the people to provide that kind of Government. There is no doubt that that message, which was included in election addresses issued by the Fianna Fáil Party, showed an understanding of the requirements of the country for the period which then lay ahead of us. We required a united Government which would vigorously and resolutely pursue clearly defined policies. How have we fared?</P>
    <P>As a result of the most recent expulsions from the Fianna Fáil Party I think I am correct in saying that no less than six of those who were elected on the slogan &ldquo;Let's back Jack.&rdquo; are now no longer members of the Fianna Fáil Party. While that slogan still appears on some of the dead walls in this country some of those who, less than 2½ years ago, subscribed to it would be quite prepared to go around now with whitewash and a brush and alter just one letter in it to make it read: &ldquo;Let's sack Jack.&rdquo; That is the degree of unity that the Fianna Fáil Party have given to the people. What has been the result of their complete lack of unity, the necessity of the Government as I feel they must see it, to look over their shoulders when they are dealing with the undoubtedly difficult problems which confront this State?</P>
    <P>We have at present an unemployment figure fairly rapidly approaching the 80,000 mark. I do not think any soothing noises made by the Taoiseach or any of his Ministers are going to <Col N="54" /> calm the real fears of the people with regard to the unemployment situation. Most of the Members opposite and the Minister will agree that not so very long ago the Fianna Fáil Party lost, tragically for them and for the country, one of the people who was an undoubted realist in politics, prepared to look at problems and set the measure and the test of political performance in a real way, the late Mr. Seán Lemass. I mean no disrespect to him when I remind the Minister and the Senators opposite that Seán Lemass in his time, when he was in Opposition, set out clearly what he regarded as the test of the success of Government policy. I quote from <i>The Irish Press</i> of 16th February, 1957, in which the late Seán Lemass was reported as saying:</P>
    <P>The measure of the worsening of the national situation is the increase in unemployment. That is the real test of the soundness of the policy of any government. Unless the policy of the Government is successful in putting people to work or giving a chance of getting work for all who are dependent on it for their livelihood, it is not good enough. The aim of any worthwhile policy must be full employment.</P>
    <P>In <i>The Irish Press,</i> about one week later, on 23rd February, 1957, the late Mr. Lemass is reported as saying, in regard to unemployment:</P>
    <P>The rise in unemployment during the past few months was indisputable evidence that things are wrong with the country. The policy of any government should be judged by its effect on employment. If it is putting more people into work, it is all right: if it is putting them out of work, it is all wrong. Fianna Fáil had never refused to accept that test.</P>
    <P>I wonder are the present Fianna Fáil Government prepared to accept that test? If they are prepared to accept it, are they prepared to accept the logical conclusion that this Government have failed; that this Government are putting people out of employment, rather than into employment?</P>

      <P>I do not know to what extent the Government are responsible for this situation. I am not going to make the mistake of trying to tag them with entire responsibility for the situation but inside the context of the test laid down by the late Seán Lemass and, indeed, in any other test, the Government must accept responsibility for dealing with this situation. The Government must also accept responsibility for their failure to read the signs that were there to be read. It is the business of the Government to be aware of trends which are developing. It is their job, on being aware of those trends, to act in time, to take steps to remedy the situation in time, to avoid wholesale unemployment.</P>
      <P>I want to put the point of view that either this Government were aware of the trends that were developing, and failed to take the necessary remedial action in time, or that they did not know what was happening and failed to read the signs that were there to be read. It is relevant in the context of the present unemployment situation to remind the House and the Minister that the <i>Second Programme for Economic Expansion</i> envisaged a rise of 81,000 people in total employment by the year 1970. By the time that that particular programme was jettisoned in the year 1967 industrial employment was about 49,000 short of the projected growth. So that even as far back as five years ago there was a warning light for the Government to see. The projected growth showed a shortfall.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="56" /> The Minister will not disagree with me when I say that there were two main reasons for that, first, because agricultural employment decreased at a rate which was approximately double the rate that had been anticipated in giving the estimates in the programme, and second, because nonagricultural employment did not expand at the anticipated rate. The complete failure to reach the projected growth figures under the Second Programme was there as a warning for the Government and their Departments to see.</P>
    <P>The Third Programme projections were also out. In 1970, in nonagricultural employment the rate of expansion slumped to a level of 5,000, from 16,000 in the year 1969; in manufacturing industries, employment dropped from a growth of 11,000 in 1969, to something like 3,500 in 1970. That was another warning light for the Government to see. There was a third, which was apparent to everyone. That was the number of business closures and consequent redundancies. In 1970 there were nearly 4,000 redundancies. In the first nine months of 1971 the figure stood at nearly 6,000, although the Industrial Development Authority estimate was something between 3,000 and 3,500.</P>
    <P>It is also relevant in this connection to see how the present situation appears to non-politicians. I should like to refer briefly to an article which was contributed by the economics correspondent of the <i>Evening Herald</i> on New Year's Day, under the heading: &ldquo;Political Folly Causes Jobs Crisis.&rdquo; I should like to give two short quotations from this. The first reads:</P>
    <P>The fall-off in tourism is partly responsible but the major share of the responsibility for our affairs must rest on the shoulders of those who have been shelving and putting off important decisions because of fear of adverse short-term political consequences...</P>
    <P>Again, later in the article, it is stated:</P>
    <P>...Economic matters are sometimes hard to grasp but what is clear is that Government action has been slow and faltering. Failure to act has <Col N="57" /> been endangering people's jobs and our general prosperity. The Government does not seem to see that popularity is not the sole test of whether a policy is good for the country.</P>

      <P>Before the tea break I dealt with the present unemployment situation as I see it. It is right to refer briefly to the views which have been expressed by the Taoiseach on the situation and which are reported in the newspapers today. According to a report in the <i>Irish Independent</i> which I have before me, the Taoiseach at a meeting of the National Executive of Fianna Fáil said that the rising level of unemployment had been the subject of considerable comment recently. He said it was right that that situation should be of concern to all and the Government fully shared that concern but it was wrong that there should be alarm or fear for the future or to feel that the Government were inactive at the present <Col N="58" /> time. I do not think that any statements of this sort by the Taoiseach are going to allay the fear of unemployment and redundancy in the minds of the people. The Taoiseach did indicate that steps would be taken by the Government and he announced that he intended to have further discussions with employer and union representatives in the coming weeks. He also dealt with certain steps the Government had taken.</P>
      <P>I believe the present situation requires something more than what people might regard as a proposal to discuss and examine the situation. I do not want to be an alarmist with regard either to the unemployment figures or the economic position in the country generally but it seems to me that when you have unemployment figures in the region of 80,000 it is not unreasonable to view the immediate future with a very large degree of concern. I know it may be suggested that it is a fairly normal pattern that you reach a peak of unemployment at the end of the year and during the first month in the New Year and gradually things sort themselves out, that coming into February or March unemployment figures start dropping and employment figures start rising. I hope that some such pattern will emerge this year but I am not entirely optimistic about it. I do not think in the present situation, having regard to free trade and the obvious build-up of competitiveness against us, that we can necessarily rely on the usual pattern being followed this year. It is necessary for the Government to take urgent and, if necessary, drastic action in the employment field.</P>
      <P>Before the tea break I indicated that I proposed to refer to the suggestions that have been made by the Fine Gael Party in this connection. I should like to do this in a non-political way. It is to the credit of the Fine Gael Party that they issued a responsible and constructive statement on this matter. The nine points in the programme they have suggested to the Government are all points to which the Government should give both serious and urgent attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been suggested by the Fine <Col N="59" /> Gael Party first of all that employer/ trade union discussions should take place at once to secure a postponement of any further redundancies that are threatened at the moment, to enable a period of time for investigating the possibility of maintaining employment or providing alternative employment in firms where the question of redundancies arises. Secondly, there should be a review with the various people concerned regarding likely future redundancies. The aim of that would be, in conjunction with the Industrial Development Authority, to secure an expansion of alternative employment in the areas likely to be affected. That obviously involves doing some arithmetic, making some explorations and investigations as to where and in what areas redundancies are likely to crop up in the fairly immediate future. We suggested that there should be provision, by means of legislation, for at least a month's notice of redundancies and dismissals. As regards the meat trade there should be a review of the subsidy arrangements in order to maintain employment in the industry, pending expansion of output and employment expected under EEC conditions. We suggested, and I think this is a point to which the Government must give urgent attention, that the relevant provisions in the Free Trade Area Agreement with Great Britain should be invoked for the purpose of imposing temporary restrictions of imports of goods where increased imports have reduced internal demand for domestic products and have brought about an appreciable rise in unemployment.</P>
    <P>We suggested a reduction in bank interest rates <i>pro rata</i> with reductions in the Central Bank discount rate and interest rates in Great Britain. We suggested also that there should be a major recruitment drive both for the Garda and the Army. I propose dealing later with the position as regards the Garda Force in this country. I simply want to refer in the context of the Fine Gael proposals to my own view that there is urgent necessity, quite apart from the impact on the question of unemployment, for a major expansion in both the Garda <Col N="60" /> Force and the Defence Forces in this country.</P>
    <P>We suggested also that the proposed reduction in company taxation should be brought forward so as to release additional funds for expansion of investment and employment and the restoration of the cuts in the programme for the construction of schools, hospitals, roads, drainage and so on.</P>
    <P>All of those are constructive proposals. All are proposals that would help in the difficult situation that exists at the moment as regards employment. I do not think that the kind of statement which the Taoiseach has made could be regarded as helpful. I have referred earlier to the tests of good government which were laid down by the father of the Parliamentary Secretary who is in attendance here at the moment. The present Government have not measured up to those tests. It is true, I suppose, to say that Fianna Fáil did make one valiant effort to reduce the numbers of registered unemployed, and as a result of it they lost a Deputy in the Dáil, when they tried to withdraw the dole from the small farmers. Other than that, I do not know that there has been any outstanding example of Fianna Fáil activity in this field.</P>
    <P>I notice that the first item in the Appropriation Bill, as it was issued, relates to the Houses of the Oireachtas. In my opening remarks I mentioned that there was a questioning of the value of our parliamentary institutions. It would be a mistake for us to blind ourselves to the fact that that position obtains and to the fact also that there is a questioning of the position not only of this House of the Oireachtas but of both Houses. It would be a mistake for us to assume that, because those who went before us established parliamentary institutions here in a sound and firmly-based manner, those institutions are safe for all time. We should face up to the fact that there may be those in this part of the country who would be quite prepared to brush our parliamentary institutions aside. There is a definite responsibility on all Members of Parliament today, and a particular responsibility on the Government, to ensure that we are not going to allow parliamentary democracy <Col N="61" /> to die in Ireland, that we are not going to allow the Parliament of this country to become, or be regarded as, irrelevant.</P>
    <P>There is a danger that Parliament is being regarded as irrelevant by a number of people in this country. The persistent attitude of Government Ministers in ignoring Parliament to a great extent in the making of important announcements and in refusing to encourage discussion of important topics in Parliament is having the effect of kindling the kind of questioning that is going on as to whether our parliamentary institutions, established with so much sacrifice in the past, are still relevant in the 1970s. Certainly, if either the Dáil or the Seanad come to be regarded merely as institutions for rubber-stamping Government decisions the people are not going to have the kind of respect for parliamentary institutions that is required in order to have proper parliamentary democracy functioning in this country. Far too often we have witnessed the spectacle of Government Ministers choosing outside functions, whether they be dinners of chambers of commerce or meetings of units of the Fianna Fáil organisation, to make important announcements that should be made in Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>We have recently come to the stage where not only have important decisions been communicated to outside bodies by Government Ministers but they are even now leaving it to their backbenchers to do it at Fianna Fáil meetings.</P>

      <P>Unless this kind of thing stops how can we expect the ordinary people of this country to have respect for Parliament when the Ministers supported by the Senator who is interrupting me show that kind of disrespect to the representatives of the Irish people assembled in Parliament? I am talking now principally with regard to the other House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as this House is concerned, it is not new that people question the value of the Seanad. I have had experience of both Houses of the Oireachtas. <Col N="62" /> It is not the first time I was a Member of this House and I have had considerable experience of the other House of the Oireachtas. I should like to say, without being patronising, and not just because I am a Member of this House at present, that the experience I have had of this House convinces me that it is well worthwhile having a second House of Parliament in this country. The standard of performance of Senators generally, certainly while I have been a Member of this House, has been exceptionally high. Notwithstanding that, the encouragement we get from the news media is minimal and the methods for election to the Seanad are farcical.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, eventually. I think the power that this House has is virtually non-existent. That may be the trouble. The way in which the Government, and let me say Senators supporting the Government, can contribute to the continued existence of this House is by not becoming what I class as &ldquo;pinafore&rdquo; politicians. You will remember the Gilbert and Sullivan lines. I have forgotten who was the character who &ldquo;always voted at his party's call and never thought of thinking for himself at all&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The only power that this House has is the power of persuasion. It has been able to do quite a good job by persuading Ministers to accept amendments where we know that even if we insisted on amendments being carried if they were rejected by the other House that the three months postponement or whatever it is does not really make any bit of difference. But if Senators &mdash; this applies particularly to Government Senators &mdash; were determined not to become pinafore politicians, not merely to vote at their party's call, we would get the kind of contributions for which the Seanad could be notable and has been notable in the past. I do not want to strain the patience of the Chair any further in that respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe there is a certain amount of danger in our own attitudes in relation to this House and in relation to <Col N="63" /> the other House. However, there is a much graver danger to the future of parliamentary democracy in this country if the laws made by the Oireachtas are flouted and if the Parliament is not prepared to insist as firmly and as forcefully as may be necessary that there will be only one law-making authority in this country, and that we will only have one Army and one Garda force. If we do not insist on that, then the flouting of the laws of the Oireachtas is likely to pose a much greater threat to the two Houses of the Oireachtas than even the kind of atmosphere which can grow up if Houses of Parliament are not treated properly by the Government or are regarded as irrelevant.</P>
    <P>I want to consider for a moment the position of the Garda force. Next month will be the 50th anniversary of the establishment of an unarmed Garda force here and after 50 years we could ask ourselves how does the force stand. It is only about three months ago that there were headlines in the newspapers referring to a Garda revolt. There certainly has been in the minds of the people a picture of very grave discontent in the force and that is a neartragic situation particularly at present. I do not talk politically when I say that now after 50 years all of us on both sides of the House can join in a tribute to those who were farseeing enough at a time of danger, at a time of civil war, nevertheless to establish our police force as an unarmed Garda force and were big enough to give as the direction to that force in their infant state the message that they were servants of the State, not servants of any political party.</P>
    <P>The then Minister for Home Affairs had to play a large part in the establishment of that force and he sent a message to that effect to the Garda force at the time they were established. That message was quoted in the <i>Evening Herald</i> of 22nd December, 1971. After 50 years it is well for us to recall the spirit in which that force was established. The message which was sent to the Garda force was:</P>
    <P>The internal politics and political controversies of the country are not <Col N="64" /> your concern. You will serve with the same imperturbable discipline and with increasing efficiency any Executive which has the support of the majority of the people's elected representatives. Party will, no doubt, succeed party in the ebb and flow of the political tide.</P>
    <P>New issues will arise to convulse the nation. The landmarks of today will disappear. You will remain steadfast and devoted in the service of the people and of any Executive which it may please the people to return to power. That is the real meaning of democracy &mdash; government of the people by the people, through their elected representatives. It is the only barrier between mankind and anarchy.</P>
    <P>I do not think any of us would say that our Garda force has ever willingly or knowingly departed from that standard. Any of us who have made any effort to familiarise ourselves with the working of the force will realise that so far as they are concerned the same kind of spirit which inspired them at the beginning, at their inception, is still there. But we cannot avoid seeing that inside the Garda force even quite recently there has been what I think to most of us would be disturbing feelings and views held in the sense that it seems to be clear that some members of the force at any event think they are not giving the kind of service to the people which they want to give but that it is not their fault that that situation exists.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to an article in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> of 10th October, 1971. Just a few months ago there was an investigation carried out, presumably for the purpose of writing this article, and the article was entitled &ldquo;Garda Revolt&rdquo;. I do not want to quote the entire article which is fairly lengthy, but the following appears in it:</P>
    <P>Another Garda, referring to the startling statement by the Dublin Area Committee of the GRB, that &ldquo;armed men are robbing at will and holding the country to ransom&rdquo; stated that many of the young members of the force had lost their pride in the service because of this sorry situation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="65" /> It goes on, presumably from the quotation from the garda referred to:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We want the public to know that they are not getting value for their money from us but equally we want them to know that it is not our fault,&rdquo; he said.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The real culprits are the people at the top &mdash; they are just not allowing us to do our duty.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then the article goes on:</P>
    <P>This raises the delicate subject of veiled political interference in Garda crime hunting, particularly in the case of the spate of armed bank robberies.</P>
    <P>Most rank-and-file gardaí are firmly convinced that such interference takes place. In fact, during our investigations we were told several times that one high-ranking officer sympathised with the activities of at least one illegal organisation.</P>
    <P>Whether such allegations are true or not is immaterial, the fact is that they are believed and are having a disastrous effect on the morale of the force.</P>
    <P>That is a tragic situation. It is particularly tragic when we have the known situation existing across the Border. I shall say a few words about that later.</P>
    <P>I feel quite sure that the Government are concerned to see that the Garda force, and indeed the whole machinery of the administration of justice, will measure up to the standards that have always marked the force as outstanding as a Garda force on the one hand, and outstanding for the administration of justice on the other. It is rather a pity that 50 years after the establishment of the Garda force that kind of article can appear in a national newspaper. Even if the Parliamentary Secretary, or the Minister, or any speakers on the opposite side of the House, were to say that all this is poppycock, that there is no foundation for the portion of that article that I have read out, the mere fact that a situation has arisen where there was known to the public generally to be discontent inside the Garda force, where a section &mdash; how representative it is I do not know &mdash; of the Garda force felt impelled to issue a statement of the kind which they did issue, and <Col N="66" /> where an article of that sort can be written, is disturbing, to say the least of it.</P>
    <P>I read in <i>The Irish Times</i> of the 28th of last month an editorial dealing with the general position. I have forgotten whether it arose out of Cardinal Conway's remarks. I thought that this leading article was one to which the attention of the Government should be directed. I am not particularly influenced by what I read in newspaper editorials but I am conscious of the fact that by and large when newspaper editors write their editorials they have probably written them from a feedback of information and of feeling which they are getting from various sources. So that when a national daily newspaper comments on a situation in a deliberate, balanced and weighty way I think it is worthwhile calling the attention of the Government to it.</P>
    <P>I just want to read a few extracts from this editorial in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 28th December. Perhaps I should read the last paragraph first. It says:</P>
    <P>The security of the State itself depends on a police and judicial machine which not only functions smoothly and swiftly, but is seen to do so. Political activists are not the only danger to the Republic. In the ordinary way of the administration of justice too many flaws have become apparent. A searching look at the whole machinery is one of the most urgent problems facing the Government and the people.</P>
    <P>I cannot but say &ldquo;hear, hear&rdquo; to that, because it corresponds very closely with the views which I hold and have been seeking to express here. This article commenced with the paragraph:</P>
    <P>Quite apart from any potential threat from illegal organisations, there is a general lack of cohesion, and in many places a definite breakdown in co-ordination, between the various parts of the justice machine in the Republic. The machine has become run down; it needs an overhaul.</P>
    <P>Then a little latter:</P>
    <P>At national Garda level there are several problems. There appears to <Col N="67" /> be an impression among the gardaí that they must observe various undefined political considerations. There is a feeling that the heads of the force have come under heavy political pressure. This not only manifests itself in political offences but also in civil and ordinary criminal cases.</P>
    <P>I have no evidence which would enable me to say that the impression referred to in that paragraph is justified or warranted, but it is up to the Government to ensure that that impression, which apparently is there, is erased and that the Garda force, which was established 50 years ago, is put in a position where it can say firmly and with conviction that each and every member of the Garda force will do and will be entitled to do his duty as a member of the Garda Síochána without the slightest fear or danger of political pressure from any side. I am certainly prepared to presume that the Government are doing their best as regards matters which are of concern to the people in connection with law breaking. It seems to me that the Government's best is simply not good enough.</P>
    <P>It is common knowledge to all of us that activities are going on in this country which the Government want to put down and which, apparently, they feel unable to put down. I want to give one slight example. I have heard the views of the Minister for Justice in connection with the difficulty of dealing with the wearing of military-type uniforms. I have heard the Minister advancing the difficulties. How do you distinguish, for example, a boy scout organisation from a paramilitary organisation in trying to frame legislation to deal with military type uniforms? The way to deal with this is for the Government to put their cards on the table and to invite, if necessary, the assistance of all parties in the Oireachtas to solving this problem.</P>
    <P>I know &mdash; and I am not above reminding the House of this &mdash; that there was a time when a Fianna Fáil Government were dealing with constitutional opposition and they were not afraid, and did not hesitate, to bring in a Uniforms Bill.</P>

      <P>I am loath to be deprived of the opportunity of reminding the House that this House stood solidly against that and, the day after they rejected the Bill, a Bill was introduced to abolish this House. However, I would make this plea to the Government. Whatever problems they have with regard to overcoming the difficulties they face, if the difficulties are administrative, if they are legislative, or whatever they are, it will help them and the country if they are prepared to put all the cards on the table. Let us see the difficulties and let us see how those difficulties can be overcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately &mdash; and I think it is necessary to say this &mdash; many of the problems which we are facing in the field of law enforcement, and in the field of orderly administration and orderly Government, have to do with the question of violence in the North and the danger of a spill-over into this part of the country. Cardinal Conway recently referred to the boiling volcano of potential violence that was contained by a thin crust. The Bishop of Raphoe in referring to the violence which had been almost entirely confined to the North said it was now overflowing into the South. He referred to callous men, and said callous men were now prepared to plunge the whole country into anarchy and strife. In that situation possibly many of us &mdash; and I am quite prepared to fault myself for this &mdash; may have been overcautious in our references to violence in the past for fear of any words we might speak accidentally making a bad situation worse, but I am not sure that the time has not come when there is a responsibility on all of us who occupy any <Col N="69" /> position in public life to make our positions absolutely clear.</P>
    <P>As far as I am concerned I unequivocably and unambiguously would stand and do stand against violence. I am prepared to condemn it North or South. I do so in the knowledge that, if the activities of men of violence were to succeed in bringing territorial unity to the country, those of us who speak as I have just spoken would be regarded as frail and broken reeds and that the men who advocated violence would be those who would be idolised and lionised in Irish history. Nevertheless, I take the view that what is important for the people of this country is not mere territorial unity. Many people would even go to the length of recording themselves as being prepared to reject mere territorial unity unless, at the same time as we get territorial unity, we get the kind of unity of hearts and minds with fellow-Irishmen in the North that has been the prayer of generations of Irishmen and Irishwomen. We should support the Taoiseach, as I do, when he spoke out and made the point quite clearly that every bomb and every bullet in the North further postpones the day of the kind of real unity that is desirable for the people of this country. All the parties in the Irish Houses of Parliament have rejected a policy of violence for the ending of Partition.</P>
    <P>It is rather tragic that this Government should feel that they have to look over their shoulders in dealing with the question of Partition and our relationship either with Great Britain or with the people in the North of Ireland. It is particularly tragic because it should be unnecessary. The party for which I speak have more than once gone on record as expressing their willingness to co-operate in trying to ensure that the Irish Parliament speaks with a united, strong voice on these matters. To the eternal credit of this House of the Oireachtas let it be said that, on a motion proposed by me on behalf of this party, we unanimously accepted the idea that there should be that kind of co-operation and that kind of meeting between the political parties here in the South. Certainly, I do not want, and no one in my party wants, to allow the situation <Col N="70" /> in the North to be used as a political football of any description here in the South.</P>
    <P>On 10th August last, in moving the motion to which I have just referred, I said &mdash; I think it is worth repeating because it expresses my own conviction and I am quite sure the conviction of my party on this matter &mdash; at column 62 of the Official Report of the Seanad Debates of 10th August, 1971:</P>
    <P>... Being an Opposition party, we are very deeply conscious of a definite sense of responsibility in this matter. We have already made it clear &mdash; and I should like to make it clear again &mdash; that in no sense should any of us, in Opposition or in Government, regard the northern situation as something which should become the plaything of southern politics. I have no wish, nor have any of my colleagues any wish, to traffic for party political purposes in the sufferings and anxieties of our fellow countrymen in the north.</P>
    <P>That certainly remains my conviction, and it remains the conviction of every member of my party.</P>
    <P>There are a couple of other topics upon which I should like to touch fairly briefly. In connection with the Common Market negotiations that have been going on, and the referendum that is to be held, I should like to say something that will provoke a certain amount of raised eyebrows in the opposite benches. I say it in all sincerity for what it is worth. A great number of people have doubts with regard to Common Market membership. A great number of people have a very firm conviction with regard to the idea of European unity. Probably an even greater number of people than either of the other classes feel that if, for no other reason, then as a matter of economic necessity, if England becomes a member of the Common Market, we also should do likewise. We are arriving at a situation now where we are within a matter of weeks of the treaty or agreement of accession being signed. We then have to submit the matter to the people on the basis of whatever Constitutional Amendment Bill is eventually passed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="71" /> I am afraid there is likely to be a very large vote against the Common Market. I want to see this country going in for particular reasons, one of which is that I believe that it would be economic insanity to stay out if Britain goes in. However, judging from current feeling, there is likely to be a large vote against going into the Common Market. This is where the raised eyebrows will come in, but I say it in absolute sincerity. If the Government have the same kind of conviction that I have about the desirability of our entry into the Common Market, the best contribution they could make towards carrying the referendum and enabling this country to become a member, would be to quit office, to get out of Government.</P>
    <P>What I am afraid of is that there will be a very large protest vote which will manifest itself in a vote against the Common Market, but which will, in fact, be a protest vote against the continuance in office of the present Government. I say that with absolute sincerity. Members opposite who know the feelings in their own parts of the country will probably, in their own hearts, agree that what I am saying is correct. There is the feeling there &mdash; I am not trying to apportion blame &mdash; that Fianna Fáil have been too long in office, and that they have lost control of the situation. There is the feeling there that Fianna Fáil have made a &ldquo;haymes&rdquo; of things since the last general election.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NevilleKeery" hpid="Mr. Keery Mr. Keery">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>A feeling of protest and resentment will manifest itself by people voting &ldquo;no&rdquo; to entry into the Common Market when, in fact, what they are voting against is the continuance of Fianna Fáil in office. I said that I would get raised eyebrows. I even got raised voices from that statement but I am making it quite sincerely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only other thing I want to mention, and I intend to mention it very, very briefly, is the appalling increase in the cost of living. A short time ago we <Col N="72" /> changed over to pounds and pence, instead of pounds, shillings and pence. The pound note is supposed to be worth 100 pence. In fact, over the past three years, in terms of new pence, the pound note is now worth 70p instead of 100p. The cost of living has gone up by about 30 per cent in the past three years. I had a look at the Government's <i>Third Programme for Economic and Social Development</i> which was to span the years 1969 to 1972. In paragraph 26, the last sentence in the introductory portion reads:</P>
    <P>The Government's aim is that the end of the programme period will see Ireland economically much stronger, socially more concerned and psychologically more prepared for membership of the European Community of Nations.</P>
    <P>Today in the situation that I have described &mdash; and I doubt if any of my friends opposite will seriously challenge anything I have said &mdash; can the Government feel in any way happy or complacent that the aims which they set out in the Third Programme have any possibility of taking concrete form or effect within the coming year?</P>

      <P>I find myself in agreement with some of the points made by Senator O'Higgins. I agree that the Seanad is an institution well worth having. Anyone who has been a Member of this body during the past couple of years will concede that much. I go along with him in the article he quoted from a newspaper counselling to the Garda many years ago that internal controversies should not be their concern. I am afraid that I do not agree with him in his references to the Common Market.</P>

      <P>I have not studied deeply the subject of the European Community but the negotiations which have been carried out to date by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Dr. Hillery, and his advisers are, in my <Col N="73" /> view, and in the view of many others somewhat better than one might have expected. Senator O'Higgins referred to people having doubts about European membership and of other people having convictions about it. I am one of those who has a conviction about membership.</P>
      <P>When we had a debate on the question of the EEC I expressed the view that the first consideration when approaching this question was what would be the best and wisest course, from a philosophical point of view, that this nation should take. I believe a sense of conviction should convince people in the forthcoming referendum on this question and it is up to those of us who have a genuine sense of conviction on this issue to pass it on to others.</P>
      <P>One of the questions around which my mind has been turning, relating to our progress over the years, is one to which I resent giving my time. This is the unfortunate situation in the North of Ireland and its affects on every aspect of life and administration in this part of the country. I resent having to speak on this as there are so many other things one could talk about constructively. But, having thought over this for a number of weeks, I find that this is probably the most important topic with which one could deal. I am very conscious of the problems which have arisen and are arising in relation to unemployment and redundancy and other aspects of our current affairs but I am more conscious of the dangers that are inherent in the present situation for our people in the North and for ourselves.</P>
      <P>Our Governments have had to carry two burdens since the establishment of this State. Ordinarily speaking the work of a Government in a State which had just achieved self-government would be the major task which is ongoing here of reconstructing the country, of developing industry and trying to bring a country which had been neglected for a long time into the mainstream of modern life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A second task was placed on the present and former Governments, the appallingly difficult task of trying to contend with a situation of disunity <Col N="74" /> and division, both geographical and human, and the responsibility of bringing about some form of political reconciliation among our people of different religions, political outlooks and traditions.</P>
    <P>Reading over the history of the past 50 years, one of my greatest regrets is the very great loss of time, energy and, indeed, life that has resulted from that disunity. Many young people have had their energies diverted and have lost their lives over this issue with no apparent benefit to the country.</P>
    <P>I am not referring only to the position which existed over the past two years. One can go back in history to the origins of division and to the pogroms in Belfast in 1922 and 1935. How much better would it have been if the lives of all these people, both north and south, and their energies had been directed towards the good of the Irish community as a whole. This is the main burden which has to be carried by any government in the Irish Republic.</P>
    <P>I do not know if the Cathaoirleach will permit me to go much deeper into this question but it is important to government and to the Oireachtas that a question of this kind should get some airing. Some of us have been reluctant to say anything about it in recent times because there was a hope that through our diplomatic services, through the ordinary channels available to a Government &mdash; which have been used, I am sure, to the fullest extent during the past 12 months &mdash; some element of commonsense in the relationships between this country as a whole and Great Britain would have been found.</P>
    <P>This question was discussed in this House some months ago and at that time we undertook not to say too much about it in case anything which might be said would in any way cause the situation to worsen or impede any negotiations which might be taking place. It seems obvious now that representations made by our Government have not made any headway with the present British Government.</P>
    <P>If the Cathaoirleach will allow me briefly to analyse the situation which I believe we face here on the national scene, it may be of value to this House and to others.</P>

      <P>It is necessary to clear the air on this problem of disunity. I will be as brief as I can. Disunity <Col N="76" /> between the Unionists of the North and ourselves developed earlier in this century when it became apparent to our Northern Irish Unionists that there was a danger that the British Government, in 1912, might allow some degree fo democracy to take root in Ireland, even the very diluted form that was embodied in the Home Rule Act. It was obvious in 1919 when Unionist representatives refused to attend Dáil Éireann that they had no intention whatsoever of accepting democratic institutions. It was obvious also that the British Government in the 1920 Act intended to support the Unionists in their attitude. This is an Act that was put through the British Parliament at a time when Britain, having refused to acknowledge Dáil Éireann, was at war with most of Ireland. Such an Act being passed during a war between most of this nation and Britain, imposing two parliaments on two different parts of this country without our free consent, can hardly be deemed to be legitimate from our point of view. Moreover, to have hived off six counties of the province of Ulster in such a way as to keep in that area almost half a million Irish people of Nationalist feeling together with upwards of a million people of Unionist outlook, giving therefore a permanent majority to the Conservative Unionist Party of that area, was, I believe, a mistake, and the cause of the troubles today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Time has proved that such an artificial set-up was simply not workable. It should be acknowledged in passing that some British and Unionist politicians of that time saw it as a temporary device which should eventually lead to a unified political structure in Ireland. Among those who believed this at the time were Winston Churchill and James Craig. Earlier on, in 1917, Lloyd George had believed also that he would have little difficulty in bringing about a settlement of the Irish question. This is the position which has brought about the problems of today because the mistakes of the past have come home to roost. The trouble is we are the ones who are bearing the brunt of those mistakes, that is we, meaning the Unionists and the Nationalists in the North of Ireland; <Col N="77" /> and possibly, as Senator O'Higgins suggested, there may be other consequences.</P>
    <P>The Unionist Party are in a position to resolve this Irish problem. The present conflict is a source of danger to the entire island and also to Britain. Conflicts that are not resolved do not simply go away. They tend to widen and, as each incident leads to another, moral standards are put aside. It does not really matter very much whether it is one of the different IRA groups, the UVF or the SAS who are responsible for the bombings of premises in which innocent Irish civilians have been killed. These things are happening because a situation exists in which they can happen.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Higgins has mentioned the question of the use of force. Many years ago I expressed the belief that force is not the means whereby unity could be brought about in this country. I do not believe one can win the loyalty and enthusiasm of Northern Unionists or Protestants by attempting to compel them. That is not to say that in certain circumstances I, like any other individual, would not engage in or support the use of force; but it would have to be a choice between two evils, the use of force being the lesser of those evils. Force, in my opinion, in the confused circumstances of the North would be a completely desperate act and could only be a disaster for Ireland and for the people of Ireland.</P>
    <P>At this stage I should like to express sympathy with the relatives of those who have died in the North of Ireland during the past 12 months. Many innocent people have died simply because they happened to be in a particular place at a particular time. There are many young men and some women who have lost their lives because they had been led to believe that their actions were the way to serve Ireland, because they had been taught that the only way to bring unity to their country was by killing and destroying.</P>
    <P>I have a great deal of sympathy also for those who are in the police force in the North of Ireland and even indeed for the relatives of members of the British Forces who have lost their <Col N="78" /> lives. Whatever the rights or wrongs of the situation as seen from any side, most of these people have been carrying out their duties as directed. They must carry out the policy of the present British Government. They have little choice or alternative to obeying orders. The situation is rather tragic in many ways so far as some of these young soldiers are concerned because, first of all, they were welcomed as protectors by people who feared, and justifiably so, sectarian and community strife which was being unleashed on them by a small number of misguided extremists. The same British troops are once again regarded and treated as the enemy simply because the politicians, who were given a breathing space in the autumn of 1969, failed to do anything about the situation because apparently they lacked the courage and the imagination to bring about a political settlement which would lead to permanent peace and a final end to the history of antagonism between Ireland and Britain.</P>
    <P>I consider it extremely foolish for Britain to believe that she can solve the present problems in the North merely by putting down militants of whatever IRA group are concerned and by suppressing national feeling. It is extraordinary that almost 50 years later one finds a British Government employing British troops &mdash; who have, you might say, been in barracks in the northern part of our country and have not been engaged with the civil population since 1923 &mdash; to take, so far as one can see, the place of the Ulster Constabulary, of which everybody, or almost everybody, in this country was glad to see the end. It may be possible for the British to do this for the time being by employing the strength of her army and perhaps to bring about a reluctant and sullen peace. I have stated that I do not support the use of force but I cannot see that the policy that is being employed at present by Britain will solve anything. No one can believe seriously that those young people who have seen their fathers, mothers, sisters and brothers go to their graves in the past year as a result of British action, will become good United Kingdom British citizens.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="79" /> However much talk there may be about solving the Irish problem by peaceful means, it is obvious that so long as there is no prospect or even a glimmer of hope of unity or a unified approach to Ireland, then those who believe that force is the only way to right national wrongs will from time to time win a measure of support for such policy. Until a political solution, however long-term, is worked out, there is every prospect that there will be a repetition of violence after each interval of uneasy peace.</P>
    <P>What the Unionists have to do is to create a situation in which the Nationalist population, for which they have responsibility at present, will not have to depend on force for their defence. I cannot see any way in which the minority in the North can have security except in the context of an agreed and acceptable political solution for Ireland. Indeed, the Unionist majority in the North of Ireland can hardly hope to have any sense of security. I understand some of the problems facing Unionists but these are problems that they must face up to. They have, for a long time now, allowed themselves to depend on fear and a false type of propaganda to retain office. Many of the less-informed in the Unionist camp have been taught that we intend, in some way or other, to dominate them. They have been persuaded into believing that our attitude towards them is the very same as the attitude that they find among extreme Republicans or extreme Catholics whom one might find in a few areas of the North. This is a type of political propaganda that has bedevilled relations between the two communities in the North. It has in many ways done considerable damage to the prospect of reconciliation between us and the majority within the Six County area.</P>
    <P>We should take every opportunity to let it be understood that we have no intention of attempting to exercise any sort of domination over the Protestants of Northern Ireland. On the contrary, our whole tradition here is the very opposite to this. Our attitude towards all minorities has always been one of fair play. I suppose that <Col N="80" /> the last thing this nation, or this part of the Irish nation, having experienced domination for so long, would wish to do would be to try to impose a similar type of domination on others. I think that the time is overdue when Unionist leaders have a responsibility to correct falsehoods of the type I have indicated, which have been part of their political propaganda machinery. There are also many Unionists who believe in the link with Britain. I do not propose to go into this question too deeply. Unionists of British descent are entitled to an appearance of sympathy towards their country of origin but having been here now for more than 300 years, their first obligation ought to be to Ireland. As I understand it, some of my ancestors came from Britain in the 17th century although I have not been able to establish the accuracy of that report. Certainly a report which appeared in many papers 50 years ago that Cathal Brugha was a York-shireman was completely mistaken.</P>
    <P>Many of us here in the Twenty-Six Counties have mixed origins and probably some in common with Protestants of the North of Ireland. I do not think, however, that we have any doubt that the country that comes first in our affections is Ireland. I would not wish to cast doubts on the motives and reasons for assumed loyalty to Britain on the part of some Unionists. I find it difficult to believe that such motives in most cases are none other than expedients to suit their own party political circumstances. It may be also that many of them are influenced by bigotry and to some degree by fear. Whatever their motives may be they have no right to allow their attitudes to stand in the way of peace and reconciliation in Ireland. This question of origins has been over-used in the Northern situation for party political purposes, in order to maintain power on a permanent basis. The same technique has been employed in the matter of religious differences. So far as origins go, Terence McSwiney wrote that if all the people on this island were descended from a neighbouring island a time would come when we would want to order our own affairs and make our own decisions without <Col N="81" /> interference from the other island; just as when a young man leaves his own home and founds his own home he will not allow his parents or his wife's parents to interfere in his home. At least he will make some fairly strong protest. I am sure the great majority of Northern Protestants do understand that their situation is merely a part of the evolution of life. They must know from our own common history here in Ireland that the Act of Union was brought in here by Britain &mdash; one might say bought in &mdash; because she feared that the members of the old Irish Parliament, who were mainly of the landowning classes, were becoming too independent. From England's point of view there was a danger that the members of the Irish Parliament might be tempted to put Ireland first. To begin thinking for themselves and for the country of their birth would be a normal and a natural thing to do. I believe that if it were not for the confused situation in the North of Ireland, the situation in which two religious groupings are locked in together, the Northern Protestants would long ago have naturally evolved towards independence of thought and action. They would want a situation in which decisions for their country would be taken in their country and not elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Great stress has been laid in recent times on the principle of democracy. Senator O'Higgins referred to this in relation to our democratic institutions and I entirely agree with him. Democracy, as we understand it, is government by the majority with the consent of the minority. Built into it is a guarantee of regular free elections so that if people want to change governments they can decide to do so. As we know, such a system can be tedious and at times frustrating, not only to the majority but more often to the minority, that is to the Opposition, particularly when there are not frequent changes in government. It may be a frustrating system for providing for the management of the affairs of the community but it is at least tolerable where all other systems can become intolerable. So far no better system has been thought up by man. I, for one, support that <Col N="82" /> system because it is the only way in which man can hope to be spared from tyranny and brutality. I am also for it because through it is built up in a rather tedious and slow way free institutions of State, developments of all kinds which endure.</P>
    <P>It has been said quite frequently of late that nothing in Northern Ireland should change without the consent of the majority. While I agree that we should seek a solution to our problems in Ireland by peaceful means, and in this context we have got to get the consent of those living in Northern Ireland, it would be hypocritical on my part to pretend that I believe Northern Ireland is a democratic entity. It is, as I have said, an artificially created area under the 1920 Act and in this context the majority is always the same. That majority is, as we know, a minority in Ireland. In the context of the geographical situation of the Six Counties, to speak of a majority within that area is to preach sectarianism because the majority in that area cannot be separated from the Orange Order and the Unionist Party. It is a political certainty for one political element and for that element alone. It is this artificial situation to which I have referred that was created by Britain as a way out of our dilemma in 1921. It has over the past 50 years slowly built up frustration and anger against injustices and political discrimination culminating in the nonsectarian civil rights movement in the North.</P>
    <P>While I am concerned to emphasise that I do not agree with and do not approve of the sort of physical force activities taking place in the North, I am bound to point out the causes of such activities. In 1969 when the Unionist administration was faced with demands for justice, being unable to concede those demands, the uncontrolled sectarian element, who were a part of the authorised security forces, attacked the virtually defenceless non-Unionist minority so as to crush and silence them. It was because the Unionist regime could not control their own extremists within and outside of the forces of law and order that Britain was forced to send in her army in 1969 <Col N="83" /> to protect the civilian population and prevent a bloodbath. It was following this that Britain's and the Unionists' major mistakes were made. As I said earlier, from September, 1969, until autumn, 1970, Britain and the Unionists were given a breathing space in which to effect a political settlement that would solve the Anglo-Irish problem and set Ireland on the path to peace and unity. Despite all the representations made from here, representations from us who sought a reasonable, peaceful settlement, no serious effort was made to come to terms.</P>
    <P>It is difficult for me to understand how any politicians in Ireland or Britain could have imagined that British troops could be expected to maintain law and order permanently in non-Unionist or nationalist areas. The non-Unionist areas are, in fact, the greater part of the geographical area of the Six Counties. How could anyone imagine that such a situation could continue? There were bound to be Irish people who had tolerated Unionist rule because of the situation in which they found themselves earlier, confronted by the special constabulary and other methods of keeping them in order. How could anyone expect any other reaction to British troops? There were bound also to be British soldiers who would taunt what they call &mdash; I quote &mdash;&ldquo;Fenian bastards&rdquo; in the non-Unionist areas in Belfast and in other parts of the Six Counties. One account which I read, given by a newspaper correspondent visiting Germany last year, is sufficient to indicate the stupidity of British policy. He related a remark made by British soldiers in Germany which said that they were looking forward to being sent to Northern Ireland where they would &ldquo;have a bash at the Paddys&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This was a situation that was wide open to exploitation by any element, idealistic or otherwise. Time and time again the Government here, the political parties and organisations political and otherwise both North and South called for political talks but nothing was done. The extreme Unionist grip was too strong and Britain was too weak and indecisive. Is it any wonder that today you have <Col N="84" /> several self-styled elements calling themselves IRA engaged in vigorous, effective and very often indisciplined action to ensure their ends? Whose responsibility is this? In 1969 there were next to no IRA, or so I am informed, in the Six Counties. There was a sort of traditional image of an IRA. Where did they all come from? Certainly not from the Republic. I believe they came into existence directly as a result of the stupid policy or lack of a far-seeing policy for solving the Irish question.</P>
    <P>Some British politicians, even in the seventies, are again proving that they have never been able to understand Ireland, or what is meant by an Irish nation. I believe they forget that we are a western European nation like themselves who are entitled to order our own affairs without British interference. It is easy to see where the IRA came from, because from the accounts I have read and what I have seen, British rule in the North of Ireland at present in fact amounts to a reign of terror in non-Unionist areas. For a considerable time now British security forces have been locking up any men that they find in non-Unionist areas and not only locking them up but roughing them up. What possible result could you get from activities of that kind by the army of another country? I wish that the Conservative politicians would realise that this is neither India, nor Africa nor Burma of a century ago, that this is Ireland, that Ireland is a nation and that all the people of Ireland, North and South, Unionist or non-Unionist, Nationalist or Republican, have one thing in common: they are Irish and their identity is Irish. To these ordinary people in the North what does the British Army do? They lock up many ordinary people because they happen to live in non-Unionist areas, with only one possible result, I would argue, that the people they lock up will then decide to join the IRA because they have no other means of expressing their feelings.</P>
    <P>I am not tilting now at British troops who are being ordered to do things; I am trying to point at the people who have political responsibility for these actions. These troops have <Col N="85" /> been sent into Catholic working-class areas at night and have been preventing women and children from sleeping. I would submit that this kind of insane policy for which Britain is directly responsible is the one certain way to ensure that violence will continue and that the self-appointed militant forces of the IRA in the North will increase.</P>
    <P>Britain and the Unionist Party by their negative, &ldquo;not-an-inch&rdquo;, unimaginative, stupid policy have opened the way to chaos and tyranny of one kind or another. I hope that those who are responsible for a policy of force, either in order to draw the British Army into conflict or to defend people against attack, are aware that this country is more valuable and the safety and future of the people of this country are more important than they are, however many of them there are. Any armed element, be it the IRA, whichever one of them it is, or the UVF, which is not responsible to an elected authority, can quickly become a menace to a community and to itself. I think it is very important that we should here in the Twenty-six Counties realise this fact. In the situation that exists at present, as a result of continuing British negligence since 1921, it is only Ireland, the Irish people and their livelihood that are suffering. Untold damage is being done, not only to prospects of employment, but also to the future happiness and peace of mind of countless thousands of innocent people, including children.</P>
    <P>This has all to come to an end sooner or later and it is the responsibility of the elected representatives North and South and of those in Britain, where the real power lies, to come together and to hammer out an honourable solution, because there will be little to boast about if what can be said about the militants, be they Republicans or Unionists or British, is that they succeeded in bringing about a peace by destroying the whole place.</P>
    <P>A great deal has been said in recent times about constitutional problems and religious forms and social service benefits. While these are important, I believe that more important still is the question of attitudes towards one <Col N="86" /> another in this country. The constitutional differences and social service disparities that exist now did not exist in 1921, but the attitude of intolerance and bigotry amongst some Protestants in the North did. If there is a willingness to change, if there is a willingness on the part of Northern Unionists to face up to the realities of life in Ireland today and to play their part with us in the future of this country, constitutional and social service problems can be resolved through mutual discussion and agreement. What is most needed is the will and courage to come to grips with the real problems of attitudes. While Unionists refuse to talk to us there is little that we can do about the attitudes of the non-Unionist minority in the North. What can we do when we are not allowed to speak for them, to influence them or to exercise any authority whatsoever over them?</P>
    <P>The Unionists and the British cannot handle this problem on their own, they need help in order to bring peace to Ireland. If Britain, like ourselves, is in earnest about her role in the future of Europe, it is imperative for her to put matters between herself and Ireland in order. The former warring nations of Europe, particularly France, Germany and Italy, despite centuries of quarrelling amongst themselves, have resolved their differences and put an end to war between one another. Britain is giving a very poor example as an aspirant to membership of the European Community at the present time, in my opinion. The example of the European nations should be a good example to us and to Britain and we ought to be able to learn from it.</P>
    <P>In the matter of relations between ourselves in the Twenty-six Counties and the people &mdash; especially the Unionists &mdash; in the Six Counties, following on the publicity the world has seen, there is throughout most countries, I believe, a general consensus in favour of the obligation on Britain and on the Unionists to meet us and to put matters in order. This should pave the way for eventual unity and so end terror and repression by anybody in Ireland. It does not matter from what quarter it comes. Terror and repression is terror and repression whether it comes from so-called authorised forces <Col N="87" /> or from self-appointed forces. I hope that I am not pessimistic in regard to the present-day Unionists. I know many of them and find it difficult to understand their attitude. It is not impossible to understand it: this is an acceptance of a theory of life that went out of date &mdash; certainly in this part of the country many, many years ago. However, I am afraid that I am not very hopeful. It does not seem to me that, in so far as I know them, they are willing to make any substantial changes. I believe that it would be better for them and for Ireland if they were able to move out of their 17th century colonial attitude towards us and towards Britain. I do not think they are capable of change so long as they have the unqualified support of Britain and of British military power. If they are unwilling or unable to face up to realities, then I believe that it is the duty, the obligation and responsibility of Britain to go back to square one and do what she has done in other colonial areas. She should announce her decision to negotiate a phased withdrawal by agreement, as she did in the case of Cyprus, Aden, Singapore and all the other vast colonial areas she at one time occupied. She has got to find a way quickly out of her untenable position in the North of Ireland. She should try to extricate herself in such a way as to make sure that she leaves goodwill behind her. As time goes on goodwill to Britain in this country is falling to the lowest level in over 50 years. If the northern Unionists are not prepared to meet us, then the matter rests with Britain. Meanwhile, I believe that it is our duty to maintain absolute national self-discipline in the interests of all our fellow countrymen &mdash; and I mean all our fellow countrymen in the North of Ireland, as well as here &mdash; for the sake of the future of our country.</P>
    <P>In the North of Ireland &mdash; and I have been there recently &mdash; the situation is one of enforced government without the consent of the governed. The whole principle of democracy is that you are prepared to accept the Government that is elected. I maintain that it is impossible for upwards of 40 per cent or <Col N="88" /> more of the community of that area to have confidence in the existing Government. This is a situation that Britain has to deal with because this is a situation that would never have developed were it not for the mistakes that were made by Britain over 50 years ago. It is possible for institutions of State to keep law and order in normal accepted democratic communities such as we have here. Any self-appointed groups claiming the right to use arms can be dealt with. This is largely because the elected authority have the support of the public. When a situation exists where the elected authority have not got the support of a large body of the community the way is open to militant elements, and this is what is taking place in the area known as Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>I do not think that we in the South have anything to apologise for in the manner in which we have conducted affairs during the last 50 years. In a situation where such a large body of citizens of a country were cut off from the main body and where discrimination has been practised continuously, and is admitted by public commissions to have been practised, the fact that we have maintained stability of government and stability of parliamentary institutions here, of free institutions, is something for which all who have been participating in politics deserve some credit. For instance, one should consider the history of Europe during this century and should note the manner in which the grievances built into the Treaty of Versailles were used by Hitler to gain power in Germany. Looking at the situation that was created here 50 years ago, it can easily be seen what might have happened if there had not been in democratic politics individuals of the calibre of those who have been in power during that period. This is the sort of situation that Britain, either through weakness, through design or through negligence, imposed on us.</P>
    <P>I should like to suggest that the fact that militant elements say that they seek unity cannot in any way invalidate the perfectly legitimate national aspirations of the people of the Twenty-six Counties, aspirations that are supported <Col N="89" /> by all political parties here in the South. I should say that if Britain continues on her present course, which is involving her in the complete alienation of hundreds of thousands of Irish people, then I would consider that somewhat more vigorous methods may be necessary in order to encourage British Ministers to change their minds. I am not referring to force. I do not want to see Irish Unionists with whom we hope to find reconciliation forced to unite with us against their will, nor do I see any value to Ireland in involving ourselves in conflict either with the Unionists or with Britain. The fact that we do not support the militant actions of both IRA groups does not mean that we should be indifferent to or ignore British military action against Irish people.</P>
    <P>We should take steps to inform Britain that in view of the fact that their case is not accepted by us &mdash; I refer to the 1920 Act which states that Northern Ireland is a part of Britain &mdash; we are not in a position to condemn outright violence in the north without taking into account their responsibility as generators of this violence. We should also draw attention to the danger of confrontation on the Border which might take place as a result of the extraordinary activities of British Forces.</P>
    <P>There are other steps which might be considered. We may be reaching a point where we as a people, the Government and the Opposition, might consider further steps to bring the situation regarding the actions of British Forces to the attention of other people and other Governments. A point may be reached where patience, perseverance and the niceties of diplomacy may be inadequate. Since we are unable to effect a change in British policy by diplomatic means and we are not prepared to deal with her by force and since we are not permitted to raise the question at the United Nations because of what is called international law, the Taoiseach and members of the Government, and perhaps Opposition leaders, might consider booking passages to every capital city in the world in order to call Press conferences and <Col N="90" /> let the world know what is going on in the North of Ireland.</P>
    <P>Even if we cannot bring Conservative leaders in Britain to their senses and remedy the wrong they are doing to us, we can make a determined effort to expose the position and, if necessary, embarrass them in every country in which they would wish to be respected. In this way we may be able to make ourselves heard and help to bring about the change needed in Britain to enable the Anglo-Irish problem to be resolved permanently.</P>

      <P>I want to speak briefly about the most serious and important problem confronting tens of thousands of the citizens of the Republic. How are they to live on a starvation income? In the Seventies we need a complete change in the whole concept of financing and organisation of our social service code. Stop-gap measures imposed at a moment's notice in critical unemployment situations or other emergencies are just not good enough. What we need is a complete review by the Government of our social service code with a view to ensuring a better and more equitable distribution of the wealth of this nation to those in dire distress and more particularly in respect of those who have become unemployed as a result of the Government's incompetence or failure to provide employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The gap between the better-off and the poor is widening every day. It is not true to imply, as so many governmental spokesmen do, that entry into <Col N="91" /> the European Economic Community will result in a sudden social welfare bonanza. In the Common Market it depends on each national government how progressive and how comprehensive their social welfare standards will be.</P>
    <P>Three years ago when this country re-activated our application for membership of the Common Market it was found that the percentage of our income devoted to social services was by far the lowest in Europe. Here are the figures in respect of the Six and in respect of the Republic:</P>

    <P>To take another comparison, three years ago the percentage of the UK GNP devoted to social services was 12.4, more than twice our figure. Everyone will agree that these figures reflect a most deplorable attitude on the part of the Government of this allegedly Christian country, especially at a time when unemployment and redundancies have reached critical proportions.</P>
    <P>These statistics may have made little if any impact on this House so perhaps I will be permitted to translate these statistics into flesh and blood and bread and butter matters, in one respect only.</P>
    <P>One month before Christmas a member of the union I represent, with many hundreds of his fellow workers, became disemployed as a result of the close down of the plant in which he was employed. This man is married and has five children. His total income from the State during Christmas week was £12.15. Therefore, the total daily income of the family was £1.72. The income per head per day of the family was 24p. Therefore, if not one penny of that income is devoted to housing, rent, clothing, schooling, household utensils, furniture, <i>et cetera,</i>but every penny is devoted to food alone, and if each member of that household is provided with only three <Col N="92" /> meals a day the most they can spend on a meal per person is 8p. This is a reduction to flesh and blood, to bread and butter of the conditions of tens of thousands of our people. I am sorry the Parliamentary Secretary is not with us at the moment because he is an active trade unionist and he could confirm all I have said. He will confirm also that the cost of providing a meal to the inmates of our prisons and our mental hospitals is not 8p a day but ten times 8p a day.</P>
    <P>Some two and a half months ago following on the disemployment of two and a half thousand members of my union alone &mdash; the overall figure is a great deal worse &mdash; my union wrote to the Taoiseach and asked him to meet a delegation to consider the critical unemployment and redundancy position which had arisen. The Taoiseach replied to the effect that as redundancy and unemployment affected all unions and was a national problem he would be prepared to discuss it with representatives of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, the central trade union movement. A meeting was arranged and the Taoiseach apparently considered it so important that he had almost the entire Cabinet with him. I headed that delegation on behalf of the trade union movement. I opened the proceedings by asking the Taoiseach could he agree that the basis of the discusions should be, first of all, that a critical situation existed. The Taoiseach refused, and so did his Ministers, to accept the discussions on that basis. They said in effect: &ldquo;Crisis, what crisis?&rdquo; Because they refused to recognise, accept and deal with the problem as a crisis the discussions did not get very far.</P>
    <P>Last weekend my union learned that many hundreds of its members had lost their jobs in Denny's bacon factory in Waterford and other plants throughout the country. We summoned an emergency meeting of the executive of the union to consider not only the Denny situation but the national situation. We had all the facts and figures before us. We came to the conclusion that, if the situation was critical two and a half months ago when we met the Taoiseach, it was now ultra-critical. <Col N="93" /> We immediately despatched a telegram to the Taoiseach asking him to recall the Dáil to consider this crisis. We ended our telegram with the following words:</P>
    <P>We urge you in the name of the 81,000 unemployed Irish men and women and in the name of their dependent children and relatives to bring the Dáil together to deal with this subject in emergency session as a matter of major and national crisis.</P>
    <P>That telegram was sent to the Taoiseach on Friday last. We received no reply. Last night, as Senator O'Higgins has mentioned already, and read extracts from the report, the Taoiseach made reference to this at a meeting in some part of the country. This afternoon a letter was delivered to me. I received it here in this House. It is a reply from the Taoiseach's Private Secretary which states that, as Dáil Éireann is to meet in the ordinary way on Wednesday week next, the Taoiseach feels that no substantial advantage could be gained by his requesting the Ceann Comhairle to summon the Dáil for an earlier date. It says that the Government have already taken various steps to safeguard existing employment and to create additional employment and that further action will be taken by the Government as appropriate.</P>
    <P>Whatever one may say about the impractability of summoning the Dáil, what can one say about the complacency of that letter? The Government have already taken various steps to safeguard existing employment. Some hundreds of my members at this very moment have lost their jobs in Denny's factory. What steps has the Taoiseach or the Government taken? What kind of letter is this? As far as I know and as far as the Denny workers are concerned and all those others who have been laid off in recent times, no steps whatsoever have been taken. No steps have been taken, contrary to what the Taoiseach says, to create additional employment. I know of no steps. This will be our reply to the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>Last night in advance of this reply the Taoiseach did attempt a reply at a <Col N="94" /> public meeting. Senator O'Higgins has already referred to this. In one part of his speech the Taoiseach said that in part the present difficulties are due to international events and economic slowdown in the United Kingdom. It seems to me that the Government's excuse not only for unemployment but for a whole host of other ills and failings is an economic shake-up in the United Kingdom, the United States or Europe. They are using the argument that we are reflecting here the unemployment in the United Kingdom. They cannot have it both ways. Is the point being made by the Taoiseach that all the rotten things, the unsatisfactory things in life in the United Kingdom &mdash; unemployment, redundancies, crime &mdash; are all naturally reflected in our way of life but not the fact that the United Kingdom and other European countries have much higher social standards than we have? We take the worst; we reject the best. This is no answer whatsoever to the crisis. I would suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary, because as an active trade unionist I know he is fully aware that a critical situation has arisen, that he endeavour to impress upon the Government the desirability of treating it as a crisis situation.</P>
    <P>This evening's <i>Evening Press</i> says &ldquo;Jobs crises&rdquo;. <i>The Irish Times,</i> the <i>Irish Independent,</i>the Northern papers, the British Press all say &ldquo;Crisis in the Irish Economy&rdquo;. Everybody knows there is a crisis except the Government.</P>

They are going to slow down. They are going to refuse to work overtime. They are going to refuse to work productivity schemes and anything which may result in their becoming redundant.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The £20 million is not enough. This brings me to a very important point. Like Senator O'Higgins I do not think any Member of this House &mdash; certainly I am not doing it notwithstanding what you may take from what I have said already &mdash; or any Member of the other House should attempt to make political capital out of the crisis at present. At a time when so many thousands of our people are being forced to emigrate I do not think anyone should attempt to do such a thing. I am very concerned that, first, this crisis is with us and has been with us for some time and, secondly, because I can see that the Taoiseach and the Government do not, in fact, recognise it as a crisis. Unless one recognises a problem one cannot solve it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The tendency when trade union delegations meet Government Ministers or the Taoiseach on this has been a refusal to recognise the seriousness of the problem. They are not prepared to discuss it and if, finally, we get them to discuss it they say it is because of the economic situation in England or because of something that happened in the United States. They do not come up with any suggestions and finally they say that they are as anxious as we are to ensure full employment, better wages and conditions for everybody. I would accept that any Government should want this. Then they ask what suggestions have we now to offer to <Col N="96" /> help. The answer is that the trade union movement is not the Government, neither is AnCO, neither is the Industrial Development Authority. It is the Government's responsibility. Nevertheless, we should not adopt a negative attitude and if we have any proposals we should be prepared to place them before the Government, but will the Government implement proposals?</P>
    <P>What, for instance, can be done about Denny's? This plant is due to close down in a few days leaving many hundreds of people unemployed. What alternatives have those workers to emigration? The Government have asked for suggestions. I would suggest that the Government take over Denny's and keep it working until they are in a position to provide alternative employment. Is it, in fact, necessary to close down Denny's? I would suggest, also, that in addition to the £20 million injected into the economy of which, as the <i>Irish Independent</i> said today, only approximately £5 million went into industry, the Government should inject a massive sum &mdash; Donal Nevin of Congress has suggested £20 million but I disagree with him as I think it needs even more &mdash; into industry. These are suggestions which we can put to the Government and which we are prepared to put to the Government in a rational, realistic and, indeed, in a friendly way if the Government will recognise that a crisis exists.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <P>I was a little disturbed by some of the points made by Senator Kennedy when he mentioned the withholding of overtime and the Denny's case. Mr. Carroll, on the &ldquo;7 Days&rdquo; programme last week, made practically the same point. I do not want to minimise the present situation but I felt that the labour movement had quite a part to play in assistance and in the giving of advice to the people to create more job opportunities and to lower the unemployment figure. We need the co-operation of the people and the trade union movement if we are to tackle the problem.</P>

      <Col N="97" /> If we go shopping at present we will observe that up to 60 per cent of the clothing and textiles on sale are foreign made. It is necessary to examine the labels on those goods in order to ascertain whether they are English or Irish products. This is one field in which we all could play a very large part if we insisted on buying Irish. Let the foreign products come in, but if we insist on buying Irish we can eventually phase out the foreign articles. By doing so we would be creating greater employment here. It has saddened me recently to observe the quantities of English and foreign-made clothing being sold in this country. They are being sold to the detriment of our Irish workers. We have had a recession in the textile industry during the last 12 months but I have not heard of any effort to encourage the people to buy Irish products. Such an effort cannot be successful unless we have the backing of all sides.</P>
    <P>Over 20 years ago I spent six or seven weeks in Denmark. While I was there I toured some of the industries. I spent two days in an industry which exported quite a lot of its produce to Ireland. I discussed with them their marketing priorities. We like to keep <Col N="98" /> the best of our produce for ourselves and just export our surplus but we can never make a prosperous nation by doing so. We must export the best to foreign markets and keep the remainder for the home market. There is only one industry in Ireland doing so, to my knowledge, at the present time. Denmark is often quoted to us as an example, but they keep the second and third grade pork at home and sell all the best abroad. The same with all their milk products. They are able to deny themselves milk because they know it can be exported. They know how important it is to export. They never use wheaten bread. They use rye bread because it can be grown on the worst soils in bad country. It was a cheap bread and they could not export it, so they used it for themselves. That is what happens in a country which has often been held up to us as an example of what we should do.</P>
