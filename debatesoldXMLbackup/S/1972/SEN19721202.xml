      <Col N="1104" /> Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>Having regard to last night's explosions in the city of Dublin I have no doubt that this House will decide to pass this Bill, and quickly.  It would be regrettable if any Members of the House were to regard the Bill as a drastic measure which had to be accepted by them only because the events of last night had, so to speak, left them no choice.  It would be unfortunate, as well as being quite wrong, if Members felt that, in agreeing to pass the Bill quickly under pressure of events they were agreeing to sacrifice any fundamental legal principles.  I want to assure the House that that is not so.  It is not so despite assertions to the contrary by people who should know better and despite similar assertions by people who know better but who choose to say otherwise.</P>
      <P>I do not propose to delay the House by dealing in detail with various assertions which have been made as to the contents of this Bill.  However, I should like the House to know that I owe it as a duty to answer certain people who in the last few days have used their positions in what at best was an irresponsible effort to mislead the Irish people.  The Irish people have a right to expect that they will get, if not good sense, at least something approximating to factual accuracy from the quarters concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the moment I will confine myself to repeating to this House the basic facts which I gave to the other House in introducing this Bill.  In doing so, I emphasise that I am not giving assurances on the plea that my words carry any weight with judges in courts, but I am stating unchallengeable facts. For instance, if I say to this House, as I do, that evidence is evidence and not proof, I am stating a fact, not giving an assurance.  I now say to this House, as I said to the Dáil, first, that the Bill does not transfer to a defendant the <Col N="1105" /> onus of proving that he is innocent or the onus of proving anything.  Secondly, it does not mean that when a senior Garda officer testifies to his belief that a person is a member of an illegal organisation, the person must be convicted unless he proves his innocence. The words of the Bill are &ldquo;shall be evidence&rdquo;.  It should be unnecessary to say that this means exactly what it says. Under the law as it stands, the chief superintendent's belief is not evidence in a court of law.  The existing law admits as evidence the opinion of what is called an expert witness.  Without the present provision the chief superintendent would not be allowed to testify as to his belief.  The subsection provides that his belief shall be evidence, that is to say, that it will be admitted by the court as evidence.  As with anything else which is evidence in court, it is for the court to weight.</P>
    <P>My third point is that the restrictions in section 4, which apply to reports in the communications media as well as to other forms of comment which are intended to interfere with the course of justice, are not something new and radical.  They correspond as closely as legal draftsmen could make them with the existing common law rules governing comments on cases before the courts.  We are hearing much of this recently propounded claim that the rights of free speech entitle one to try to influence the courts as to how they will deal with a particular case.  This is in practice what is involved.  This House needs no reminding that this claim which is now being made is essentially a claim that justice should be administered at street corners where slogans replace law and demagogues replace the judiciary.</P>
    <P>The times we are living in are sufficiently dangerous to justify me in asking Members of the House to make, and to continue to make, their voices heard in public on this vital issue. Some have already expressed their views in the past, in speech and in writing, on this and on other related issues of fundamental importance, including one or two&mdash;I do not think I should or need to mention names&mdash; with whom I have had political exchanges on other matters.  I am glad <Col N="1106" /> to have this opportunity of acknowledging this.</P>
    <P>The final point I wish to make relates to a meeting that is intended or likely to interfere with the course of justice contrary to section 4.  Under that section a casual or innocent bystander is not, in fact, committing an offence.  This is so because of the basic rule in criminal law that the necessary ingredient in a criminal offence is guilty intent or <i>mens rea</i> as it is called. There are, of course, exceptions in particular statutes but that does not affect what we are concerned with here.  What is more important, this guilty intent is one of the matters that must be proved by the prosecution as part of their duty to prove the case beyond reasonable doubt.</P>
    <P>I may be asked why this is not written into the Bill.  The answer is that it is both clearly unnecessary and highly undesirable to do so.  It is unnecessary because the rule is so basic and so well known.  It is highly undesirable to do so for two related reasons. The first reason is that it is impossible to write all the basic rules into the section.  For instance, we would have to say also that a child of seven years could not be guilty and that duress was a defence.  The second reason is that if this kind of provision were written into one section of one Bill it would immediately raise a question as to the meaning of the hundreds of other provisions throughout the corpus of the criminal law.  The question would be raised that if it is here in this section and not in that other one it must not be applicable to that other one.</P>
    <P>The House is well aware of the urgent need for the Bill.  This is why I have concentrated on the objective of showing to Members that the Bill is not only necessary but that it is a perfectly reasonable Bill that does not make, and can be clearly seen not to make, any one of the radical changes which have been alleged over the past few days.</P>

      <P>An amendment to the Second Reading has been received and has been circulated to Members.  It is in the names of Senator Robinson and Senator Horgan.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Chathaoirleach, I should like to move the following amendment:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;Seanad Éireann declines to give a Second Reading to the Bill on the ground that it is an inappropriate procedure to deal with urgent legislation having regard to the terms of Article 24 of the Constitution.</P>
      <P>In moving this amendment I should like to make it clear that I move it because I value the safeguards of parliamentary democracy in this country.  I value the importance of the Seanad as a second Chamber.  In doing so I look to the Constitution itself and, in particular, to Article 24 which has built-in safeguards for the type of crisis we are in today.</P>
      <P>The Dáil passed all Stages of this Bill at 4 o'clock this morning.  Members of the Seanad received telegrams this morning requesting them to meet at 3 o'clock this Saturday afternoon. The reason given by you, a Chathaoirleach, was to consider the Offences against the State (Amendment) Bill. The Leader of the House wishes to bring a motion before us asking for the urgent signature to this Bill of the President under Article 25 of the Constitution.  Article 25 provides that in normal circumstances the President will not sign a Bill before the fifth day or later than the seventh day after it has been passed by both Houses but there is a provision in Article 25.2.2º which reads:</P>
      <P>At the request of the Government, with the prior concurrence of Seanad Éireann, the President may sign any Bill the subject of such request on a date which is earlier than the fifth day after such date as aforesaid.</P>
      <P>This is what the Leader of the House proposes to do.  He intends to ask the Seanad to agree to the President signing this Bill tonight so that it will be law as of tonight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to make the point very firmly, that we are using the wrong procedure to do this and that we have not got the very safeguards set out in the Constitution.  Article 24 provides for the situation in which it is <Col N="1108" /> wished to abridge the time for the Seanad to consider legislation.  We find ourselves in the situation today where we were called together urgently on a Saturday afternoon and where the Leader of the House has a motion before us asking for the urgent signature of the President so that this Bill can become law.  Article 24.1 of the Constitution provides:</P>
    <P>If and whenever on the passage by Dáil Éireann of any Bill, other than a Bill expressed to be a Bill containing a proposal to amend the Constitution, the Taoiseach certifies by messages in writing addressed to the President and to the Chairman of each House of the Oireachtas that, in the opinion of the Government, the Bill is urgent and immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace and security, or by reason of the existence of a public emergency, whether domestic or international, the time for the consideration of such Bill by Seanad Éireann shall, if Dáil Éireann so resolves and if the President, after consultation with the Council of State, concurs, be abridged to such period as shall be specified in the resolution.</P>
    <P>In other words, the Taoiseach can specify in this resolution what time the Seanad will have to consider this matter.</P>
    <P>The value of this procedure, and the reason why I have moved this amendment to encourage the Seanad to ask for this procedure to be used is that there is a safeguard for emergency legislation.  The safeguard is the appropriate one that it is has not had the parliamentary review which it ought to have had and, therefore, it ought only to last for a certain period.  It is provided in Article 24.3 that:</P>
    <P>When a Bill the time for the consideration of which by Seanad Éireann has been abridged under this Article becomes law it shall remain in force for a period of ninety days from the date of its enactment and no longer unless, before the expiration of that period, both Houses shall have agreed that <Col N="1109" /> such law shall remain in force for a longer period and the longer period so agreed upon shall have been specified in resolutions passed by both Houses.</P>
    <P>The significance of that is clear.  If we are to have emergency legislation it means that the Houses of Parliament cannot look as carefully at the legislation as they would otherwise do.  It means that in the Seanad this afternoon we cannot look at this Bill as carefully as we should.  The many arguments and statements made on this Bill two days ago are as true now as they were then.  No matter how quickly we filter it through this House today those arguments will still remain true.</P>
    <P>I should like to address myself particularly to Senators on the other side of the House.  It is appropriate for this House to say that its position under the Constitution is as a second legislative reviewing body.  It can certainly accept the Taoiseach's right to state that the matter is one of urgency. It can accept emergency legislation, but it ought to see to it that the constitutional safeguards are there and that this emergency legislation should not last more than 90 days unless there is a resolution by both Houses to continue it.  In that period we would have had time to think about it, there would not be the panic emergency climate of last night and the Bill would not appear in the same way to have been steamrolled through both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>It is vital that the Seanad stress the importance of putting that time limit on the Bill before us.  At present it appears that the Government want the best of both worlds: they want to steamroll this Bill through but they do not want to use the emergency procedure and the emergency safeguards. This House should assert itself and should require the certification that this is emergency legislation, that it is being regarded as such and that we return here after the weekend and consider it.  It will not take long to implement the procedure under Article 24.  The Taoiseach merely has to specify in writing to the President and the Chairman of the Dáil and Seanad and then a resolution passed by the Dáil, that the time for this House to <Col N="1110" /> consider it may be abridged.  It is then an Article 24 Bill: it then has a time limit of 90 days unless renewed.</P>
    <P>I do not want to take up any more time on this motion though I hope I shall have the support of Senators on both sides for the proposal that we do not give the Bill a Second Reading and that we ask that it be brought back to us under the emergency provisions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like very briefly to support this amendment and to underline the same basic point that Senator Robinson made.  The question facing us in this situation is a very simple one.  Is this emergency legislation or is it not?  If it is emergency legislation, as Senator Robinson said, the onus is on the Government to take all the steps appropriate under Article 24 of the Constitution, and to accept the 90-day time limit on the legislation under that section of the Constitution.  If it is not emergency legislation we are under no obligation to dispose of it today.  Indeed, I would say that not only are we not under any obligation to dispose of it today but we have an absolute responsibility to do the opposite.  The Minister has already said that his draftsmen had been working on this Bill for a substantial length of time. I think he said that they had been working on it for at least a year.  We are now expected to dispose of it in less than 24 hours, as part of a total period of consideration, which is less than four days.  Is the Oireachtas being asked to dispose in four days of legislation that has taken over 12 months to prepare?  If the Government persist in this and refuse to accept the amendment, they will lay themselves open to the charge of engaging in instant-government which, as we all know, is something less than the real thing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is much force in the arguments that have been advanced by Senator Robinson and Senator Horgan.  However, as I see it there is a position where under the particular Article <Col N="1111" /> of the Constitution which has been referred to, it would be necessary for certain procedures to be gone through. It would be necessary to have the certificate from the Taoiseach.  It would also be necessary for the President to consult with the Council of State.  So far as I am concerned, my attitude with regard to the recent amendment which has been proposed would have to depend largely on the view taken by the Minister and the Government as to the question of urgency in relation to this matter.  I presume the Minister will give us the benefit of his views on that when he is concluding.</P>
      <P>As regards the Bill, I want to say quite clearly and bluntly that I detest it and I detest every section of it. However, I abhor much more the violence and I loathe much more the subversion against which the provisions of this Bill are directed.  Therefore, while I certainly intend to deal critically with the Bill, as far as I go and as far as the Fine Gael Party in this House go, we are not going to obstruct its passage through the House.  I want to make it clear also that I do rely on the assurance given by the Minister in his opening speech that it is not intended that this House should&mdash;these were not his words but I think this was the effect of them&mdash; merely give scant consideration to the provisions of this Bill.  There are a number of matters in the Bill which will require very much more detailed explanation and argument than the Minister has given in his opening statement.  Possibly he will have to discuss those in more detail on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am enough of a realist to know that this meeting of the Seanad is merely the formal geneflection by the Government to their constitutional obligation to bring this Bill before the Seanad. I am also sufficiently experienced in politics to know that it is extremely unlikely that the Minister has the slightest intention of accepting any Seanad amendment to this proposal. Yet, to my mind, this Bill should be amended.  The fact that I am convinced that the Minister has not the slightest intention of accepting any Seanad <Col N="1112" /> amendment does not relieve Senators from their duty of endeavouring at least to obtain certain categorical assurances from the Minister regarding the operation of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I make no secret whatever of the fact that the Bill posed particular problems for my party.  On the one hand, the Fine Gael Party&mdash;the longest-established constitutional party in the State&mdash;has always recognised and accepted and insisted on the recognition and maintenance of lawful authority and the rule of law justly administered. There are certain cardinal and fundamental principles which have always been part and parcel of the Fine Gael heritage: the support and sustenance of legitimate authority; the right of the people to govern in this parliamentary democracy of ours through the duly and lawfully elected representatives of the people; that there should be only one army and one peace force answerable to the lawful Parliament of this country, and acting under it, and that the institutions of the State should be upheld, preserved and respected.</P>
    <P>Those have always been and will always be cardinal and fundamental principles of the Fine Gael policy. Those principles are part of the tradition of the Fine Gael Party, and part of the tradition and history from which this party derive their strength, their courage and their integrity.  For us those principles are precious and are summed up in the phrase, which possibly some cynics nowadays may regard as a cliché, that we are prepared to put the nation before the party.  We take pride in the knowledge, which, perhaps, is forgotten by some and unknown to others, that it was this Fine Gael Party, or their predecessors, that established this State and established the institutions of this State.  It was the past leaders of this party, from whom we can still draw inspiration today who established with sure hands and on a firm foundation after 700 years of foreign occupation, an Irish Army, an Irish Police force, an Irish civil service and an Irish judiciary and who did that in the face of a challenge from within, which no infant state should have had to face.</P>
    <P>Those facts are down in history and will not be contradicted.  Side by side <Col N="1113" /> with that great tradition of the Fine Gael Party, this party in its policy and actions and in its entire outlook has been steeped in the tradition of respect for individual liberty, for the rights of the ordinary people, for the right of free speech and free assembly and the right of the ordinary Irishman as an individual, not to be subject either deliberately or inadvertently through bad legislation, to victimisation or discrimination.</P>
    <P>This party, even in opposition, have vindicated the right of the people and the political parties to free speech. When a party such as ours, representing these twin traditions, is presented with a Bill of this kind which contains inherent conflict between the claims of State security on the one hand and the liberty and rights of individuals on the other, obviously we are faced with the difficulty of trying to ensure that the claims of the State and the rights of the individual as expressed in this Bill will not be mutually exclusive.</P>
    <P>For that reason we sought to have this Bill amended to take it out of the category of police state legislation, and, while recognising the call of State security and the need to uphold the authority of the State and its institutions, we also wanted and still want to protect and safeguard the rights and liberties of individuals.  We have time and again, urged the Fianna Fáil Government to take action against subversives and illegal organisations. The Minister made an oblique reference to this in his opening speech. If this Bill is necessary now it was also necessary one, two or three years ago.  Why was it not introduced before now?</P>
    <P>Any Senator reading this Bill will appreciate that only about 20 minutes' work is required for the composition of a Bill like this.  What were the enormous difficulties which faced the Minister or the Government?  Why after three years of violence or near-violence in this country is this Bill only being introduced now if it was regarded as urgently necessary?  When time was the currency of national safety in this country, Fianna Fáil wasted time.  I do not fault the present Minister for that. However, he may irk some of my <Col N="1114" /> political colleagues.  I say sincerely that since his appointment the present Minister has shown a great degree of activity and determination in his approach to the problems facing this State in so far as his Department is concerned.</P>
    <P>In their outlook and approach the Fianna Fáil Party have apparently felt themselves to be too much prisoners of their own past.  I will quote a few passages from a book written by a former member of the Fianna Fáil Government and Party following the last general election in this country&mdash; and this is what I mean when I say that I am afraid Fianna Fáil have felt themselves to be too much prisoners of their own past in their approach to and outlook on the matters which the Minister is now endeavouring to deal with.</P>
    <P>Page 54 of Mr. Kevin Boland's book states:</P>
    <P>It was in the Parliamentary Party that the real sordidness and cynicism was manifested.  Prior to May, 1970, there was no shortage of militants; almost everybody seemed to be actively engaged in building up the defensive capacity of the beleagured 6-county nationalists.  They were all being spectacularly successful and were in a position to assure anybody prepared to listen that next time it would be different because of their efforts.</P>
    <P>It goes on to say:</P>
    <P>Eoin O'Duffy persuaded the majority of his men to join the Free State Army by assuring them the intention was to &ldquo;put a rifle into the hands of every Catholic in the Six Counties&rdquo;.  This did not happen, but if one were to believe the Fianna Fáil TDs and Senators there could have been few Catholics in the Six Counties without, at least, a shotgun or point .22 rifle by early 1970.  One particularly bellicose Munster Deputy boasted that this was not his first time, he had been running guns into Belfast since 1956.  Needless to say in May, 1970, he changed his tune with the rest and became the stoutest supporter of the restoration of law and order policy.</P>
    <P>These are the words of a former <Col N="1115" /> Fianna Fáil Minister, who for 12 months after the last general election sat around the same Cabinet table with the present Taoiseach.  He referred to deputations coming down from Northern Ireland and said&mdash; this is the important point I would like to make at this stage&mdash;</P>
    <P>Initially, at any rate, there were no IRA elements in these deputations. In fact, the Fianna Fáil Deputies were saying: &ldquo;Where are the bloody IRA?&rdquo;.  One would think that they had been cosseted and nurtured by Fianna Fáil just for such an eventuality and now they had let their sponsors down.</P>
    <P>If that can be written by one who was formerly a pillar of the Fianna Fáil Party, one of the senior, experienced, Government Ministers of Fianna Fáil, am I exaggerating when I state that Fianna Fáil felt themselves to be prisoners of their own past in dealing with the kind of situation which faces them now?</P>
    <P>My party never had any doubt or ambiguity in seeing the situation for what it was and the necessity for action being taken by the Government to preserve peace and national security in this part of the country.  But we still must take into account the question of individual freedom and the rights of the individual in relation to legislation of this sort.</P>
    <P>There is no Member sitting on the Fine Gael benches in any House of this Parliament who wants to give any encouragement or solace to either branch of the IRA or to any other unlawful organisation.  We never did and never will, please God.  That does not acquit us of our responsibility to analyse this legislation to see if it is necessary, to see what it contains, to see if what it seeks to achieve can be achieved without necessarily taking powers which could turn this little State, if mis-used, into a police State. I wish to examine what is contained in this Bill and I should like the House to consider the extent to which it is necessary that these things should be in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the Bill sets out: that where a member of the Garda Síochána <Col N="1116" /> has reasonable grounds for believing that an offence which is, for the time being, a scheduled offence under Part V of the 1939 Act, is being or was committed at any place, and if he has reasonable grounds for believing that any person whom he finds at or near the place at the time of the commission of the offence or soon afterwards knows, or knew at that time, of its commission and he informs that person of his belief, then the guard may demand of that person his name and address and an account of his recent movements.  If the person fails or refuses to give that information or gives false or misleading information he incurs penalties under this Bill when it becomes an Act.  He can be fined up to £200 or, at the discretion of the court, he can go to gaol for 12 months or he can be both fined and imprisoned.</P>
    <P>The Minister has that section solemnly written into this Bill and one assumes from that, that it is necessary that this power should be taken by the Administration.  I wish seriously to question this.  I know an answer to the query I wish to put to the Minister has been given by the Taoiseach in the other House.  It seems to me that the powers which the Minister seeks in that section are already largely, if not entirely, at his disposal through the medium of section 52 of the Offences Against the State Act, 1939, which sets out that whenever a person is detained in custody under the provisions of Part IV of that Act any member of the garda may demand from such person at any time while he is so detained a full account of that person's movements and actions during any specified period and all information in his possession in relation to the commission or intended commission by another person of any offence under any section or subsection of that Act, or any scheduled offence.</P>
    <P>The explanation given as to why the Minister is taking the powers enshrined in section 2 of this Bill rather than continuing to rely on the powers contained in section 52 of the 1939 Act was that section 52 would be open to challenge before the Court of Human Rights.  If that is so, surely <Col N="1117" /> the same thing will apply to section 2 of this Bill.  I have no hesitation in accepting the explanation given by the Taoiseach but I should like to ask the Minister if that explanation is correct, will not exactly the same situation apply with regard to section 2 of the Bill now before us?</P>
    <P>Regarding section 3 of this Bill I have no objection to a court being entitled to draw a reasonable inference from a person's general conduct and surrounding circumstances, that that person was a member of an unlawful organisation.  But the power contained in subsection (1) (a) of this Bill is the only new power which was not available before that the Minister really needs in order to give evidence to the court, of membership of an illegal organisation.</P>
    <P>So long as it is left with the court to make deductions from the facts and draw inferences from them, so long as the court is bound only to act on reasonable inferences I have no objection to that subsection.  If the Minister tells us the power sought in paragraph (b) (1) (3) is required I am prepared to give it to him, though it is not a power I like.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (b) of subsection (1) of section 3 defines &ldquo;conduct&rdquo;.  It states:</P>
    <P>.....&ldquo;conduct&rdquo; includes omission by the accused person to deny published reports that he was a member of an unlawful organisation, but the fact of such denial shall not by itself be conclusive.</P>
    <P>This seems very far-fetched but I am prepared to take the view that if a person is prepared to allow himself to be paraded in the columns of the newspapers, on our television screens or elsewhere as a member or an officer of an illegal organisation and if he is not prepared to deny this and is prepared to allow it to be inferred by the court from his refusal to deny, I am prepared to allow the court to draw the inference that he is a member of an illegal organisation.  On the other hand we are entitled to look for definite and categorical assurances from the Minister that this portion of that section will <Col N="1118" /> not be used mischievously or unreasonably. It could be used unreasonably. I could publish a report in the morning that the Minister for Justice is only masquerading as such, that in fact he is an important member of an illegal organisation.  It would be completely false.  But if I published it and if the Minister did not deny it, his conduct in not denying it could be regarded by the court as conduct from which they could draw a reasonable inference that the Minister was a member of an unlawful organisation.  That is what I would regard as mischievous misuse of this subsection.</P>
    <P>There may be many circumstances in which reckless charges of one sort or another will be bandied about.  Is every politician to be put in the position that he must engage some kind of press clipping service so as to keep his eye on everything said about him in any of the provincial papers to make sure that if such an allegation, as is contemplated by this subsection, is made, he will be in a position to deny it or find himself in jeopardy under this Bill?  I do not think that is the intention of the Minister and the Government.  The Minister should give us an assurance that this subsection will be used with common sense and reason.</P>
    <P>With regard to subsection (2) of section 3 of the Bill virtually all sections of the people, and I daresay many even in the Fianna Fáil Party, reacted strongly against this subsection. It sets out:</P>
    <P>Where an officer of the Garda Síochána, not below the rank of chief superintendent, in giving evidence in proceedings relating to an offence under the said section 21, states that he believes that the accused was at a material time a member of an unlawful organisation, the statement shall be evidence that he was then such a member.</P>
    <P>The Minister defends this extraordinary subsection by saying that evidence is evidence and not proof.  No one can contradict the Minister's statement, but that does not go the whole way.  Is it not a fact that the courts are obliged to come to their decisions on the <Col N="1119" /> evidence before them?  This subsection is inserted for the purpose of providing evidence where no other evidence is available.  If there is no denial of that evidence for any reason, that will be the only evidence before the court and the court is obliged to act on it.  It is evidence and when it is acted on in that way, it can be accepted as proof sufficient to lead to a conviction.  The Minister has recognised, I think, the defect in this subsection by reason of the amendment which he introduced in the Dáil, providing that the subsection shall have a life only whenever Part V of the Act of 1939 is in operation.</P>
    <P>What about section 4 which deals with statements, meetings, processions, etc. constituting interference with the course of justice?  I am very surprised to learn, if indeed I am meant to learn from this Bill, that there is not already authority vested in the State to prevent interference with the course of justice. I have not had an opportunity to do any great research in connection with this Bill, as it was introduced in the Dáil only yesterday and in the Seanad today, but I did have a glance at the Conspiracy and Protection of Property Act, 1875.  This Act was enacted 75 years ago and so far as I am aware, is still in operation.  Section 7 sets out:</P>
    <P>Every person who, with a view to compel any other person to abstain from doing or to do any act which such other person has a legal right to do or abstain from doing wrongfully or without legal authority (1) uses violence to or intimidates such other person or his wife or children, or injures his property; or (2) persistently follows such other person about from place to place; or....</P>
    <P>I am skipping a bit here because it is not relevant to what I have in mind&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>... (4) watches or besets the house or other place where such other person resides, or works, or carries on business, or happens to be, or the approach to such house or place; or....</P>
    <P>If any of that is done, a person is liable under this Act to a penalty of £20, which I agree is very small financially <Col N="1120" /> in present circumstances.  As an alternative, he is liable to imprisonment for three months.  I am entitled to say that there are powers under the statute laws known to us today which could be used to prevent the situation which is contemplated in section 4.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred specifically to subsection (2) of section 4.  This subsection is one of the provisions which worry people in relation to this Bill.  It sets out:</P>
    <P>A person who makes any statement, or who organises, holds or takes part in any meeting, procession or demonstration, that is unlawful under this section shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  on summary conviction, to a fine not exceeding £200 or, at the discretion of the court, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding twelve months or to both such fine and such imprisonment;</P>
    <P>(b)  on conviction on indictment, to a fine not exceeding £1,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years or to both such fine and such imprisonment.</P>
    <P>People are worried about that subsection because a person who is innocent may find himself involved as defendant on the ground that he took part in an unlawful meeting or procession simply by reason of being there as an onlooker.</P>
    <P>There are two points I should like to make on this subsection.  The Minister pointed out that it does not apply to innocent people because for the commission of this offence, it is necessary to have <i>mens rea</i> or a guilty intent.  My first point is that this only arises when the person is in the dock before the court, when the prosecution fail to establish <i>mens rea</i>.  It does not protect the innocent bystander from being brought into the dock and having to clear himself in court.  This is the first point to remember in the context of human freedom and liberty as affected by this section.</P>
    <P>My second point I should like to put in the form of a query to the <Col N="1121" /> Minister.  I do not set myself up as an authority, particularly on questions of criminal law, and if the Minister assures me that for the commission of an offence under this subsection, guilty intent or <i>mens rea</i> is necessary, I accept it without further argument.  I should like to inquire if it is not true that in certain cases statutory offences are created where the question of <i>mens rea</i> is not relevant. Is it not correct that that is the situation under section 21 of the Offences Against the State Act of 1939 which provides that it shall not be lawful for any person to be a member of an unlawful organisation?  If a person is a member of an unlawful organisation, that in itself, under section 21 of the Offences Against the State Act of 1939, is an offence and one punishable under the Act.</P>
    <P>I am reinforced in that belief because it is established&mdash;I am not sure whether it is actually in section 21 or not&mdash;that a good defence for a person who is charged with membership of an illegal organisation is that he did not know that the organisation was unlawful or that he left it as soon as possible after he became aware of the fact.  What this provision means is that a person who had not got <i>mens rea</i> or guilty intent will, by being able to prove this point, be able to provide a good defence to a charge of membership of an unlawful organisation.</P>
    <P>If it was necessary to make that provision for the statutory offence created by section 21 of the Act of 1939, I want to put it to the Minister is it not equally necessary now to provide a statutory defence to the statutory offence being created by section 4 of this Bill?  These are matters which possibly can be explored further in Committee but it is necessary to mention them at this stage.</P>
    <P>I do not want it suggested by anyone that the Fine Gael attitude in examining this legislation critically is in any way unreasonable or reckless. We want the State, whether it be in the form of this Government or any other Government, to have whatever powers are necessary to safeguard its <Col N="1122" /> institutions and to deal with subversive or illegal organisations.  I should like to know from the Minister what organisations in this country have been the subject of suppression orders declaring them to be illegal organisations? We do not want to give any blessing to any legislation of a repressive nature which is unnecessary and which would be open to abuse, even by inadvertence, so far as the ordinary individuals in the State are concerned.</P>
    <P>There is a duty to look on this Bill from both points of view.  The urgency which the Minister has described, and which was justified, motivated the Fine Gael Party in the Dáil to withdraw the opposition which they had mounted against this measure.  They allowed the Minister to have the legislation in the Dáil yesterday.  That is my attitude also in this House, but we are entitled to get the kind of clarification and the definite assurances which I have requested from the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. J. Fitzgerald Mr. J. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment.  The Labour Party's attitude to this Bill is so well known that I do not need to delay the House in spelling out our reasons for opposing it.  But in opposing the Bill, I wish it to be clearly understood that we in the Labour Party deplore and condemn violence, no matter from what source it may come.  Our opposition is based on the belief that this legislation is not necessary to deal with subversives or illegal organisations. There is no government in Western Europe with the powers this Government have, if they had the courage or political will to implement the Acts already on the Statute Book.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Normally one could speak at length on this Bill.  The purpose of speaking on any Bill is in the hope that the Minister, having listened to one's views, would accept them or accept an amendment if it is put forward.  It was clearly demonstrated in the Dáil yesterday that this Government do not intend to accept any amendments.  Their intention seemed to be to ram it through the Oireachtas.  We have evidence of that here again today when the Members of the Seanad were summoned, by telephone <Col N="1123" /> and telegram, to meet on a Saturday afternoon at 3 o'clock for the purpose of passing this Bill.</P>
    <P>There is very little point in hoping that one could get this Bill amended in any shape or form.  The Government intend to ram it through because, at this point of time, it is to Fianna Fáil's political advantage.  Like Senator O'Higgins, I detest every section of this Bill but I would go further than Senator O'Higgins and the Fine Gael Party.  I, and my colleagues, intend to vote against the passage of this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnNash" hpid="Mr. Nash Mr. Nash">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nash</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with interest to Senator O'Higgins and with a certain amount of dismay that a lawyer of his ability and capacity could make some of the statements he made.  Before dealing with the legal aspects of the Bill, I should like to deal with some of his political statements.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnNash" hpid="Mr. Nash Mr. Nash">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nash</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall deal first with some of Senator O'Higgins's political statements in which he said, among other things, that Fianna Fáil is the victim and the prisoner of its own political past.  Unfortunately, we are all to a certain extent the victims of our past but not of our immediate past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The cult of violence in this country had been falling into desuetude.  It has no longer the great name it had when the people in the North decided that Ulster would fight and Ulster would be right and when they decided &ldquo;Not an inch&rdquo;.  The British Government allowed a mutiny to take place in the Curragh and made no effort to punish the members of their military personnel who were involved in that mutiny. Then the cult of violence was renewed in Ireland.  Unfortunately, it still continues on both sides of the Border of <Col N="1124" /> this unfortunate country where it is constantly preached, from childhood upwards, <i>dulce et decorum est pro patria mori.</i></P>
    <P>In my young days, as a child going to the national school, I remember portions of one of the poems in the schoolbooks of those days which spoke about &ldquo;the music of the rifle, so clear and sweet and strong&rdquo;.  This is the type of cult in which the people on both sides of the Border have been rared from childhood.  I pity more than I blame some of the young people in Ireland today who are involving themselves in violence.</P>
    <P>Two nights ago in Molesworth Street I listened to members of Parliament&mdash;some of them members of Her Majesty's Parliament in London, some of them former members of the Stormont House of Commons&mdash;addressing the crowd.  I listened to the emotional diatribe they preached to the unfortunate, ill-educated young people among their listeners.  Each and every Irishman, of whatever political party, is equally guilty with those youths, if he does not raise his voice in logic, in reason and in common sense to persuade people that, if differences have to be settled, they should be settled in accordance with reason, in accordance with logic and in accordance with common sense.</P>
    <P>The cult of the rifle has become so firmly established in our national folklore that, at this stage, it requires the voice, the reason and the persuasion of every sensible person to put an end to it. It is nutured in childhood.  When a cult of force is nurtured, people soon become educated in sadism.  I say this of all persons involved in all extreme groups who today wish to upset the institutions of the State by force of arms. We had an example of it on the news this morning.  An unfortunate man, whose name was not published and whose identity was not known, lost his life.  Those people who took his life were not prepared merely to take his life but tortured him in advance of taking his life.  To them, sadism is a pleasure.  It began when violence was inculcated in them in their youth.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Higgins has put around himself the mantle of peace and goodwill <Col N="1125" /> for himself and his party.  I wish to quote to the House a statement which was made, not by any member of the Fianna Fáil Party but by a prominent member of his party, who was formerly a Member of this House, at an oration over a person who fought for this country, who was glad to fight for his country and who made no compliment of doing so, but who made no boast of doing so.  At the end of the ceremony, when the rifles were fired over the grave, this member of the Fine Gael Party was called upon to make his oration.  I quote from that oration:</P>
    <P>The rifle has spoken and said everything that should be said over the grave of a patriot.</P>
    <P>How can we, in common sense, expect our youth&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Nash</NameTxt>
      <P>How can we expect young people, who have the idealism of youth, the imagination of youth, who lack the experience which only the years can bring, to behave in any better way when this cult was established and nurtured by people who should know better?  There is no point whatever in condemning the gun, which is the instrument of violence, if we condone what the gun does.  So much for the political utterances of Senator O'Higgins.  I shall now deal with his desire to have peace under legislation as it formerly existed.  He stated that section 2 of this Bill was not necessary because the State could have taken advantage of section 52 of the Offences Against the State Act, 1939.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall paraphrase what section 2 of this Bill provides, but shall quote it if necessary.  What it provides is as follows: if a scheduled offence under <Col N="1126" /> Part V of the 1939 Act has been committed&mdash;there are only certain offences under that Act: violence under arms, malicious damage to property, some of the extreme offences &mdash;and if a garda happens to be nearby, and if he sees some person who was near the place when the offence was committed, he can demand from that person his name and address.  Everybody will agree that that is not a very serious infringement of a person's rights.  He can tell the person that he has reasonable grounds for believing that the person whom he finds near the place at the time of the commission knew something about its commission.  Having demanded his name and address, he can ask him for an account of his recent movements. During this time the person from whom he makes his demand and his request is at complete liberty and is under no restraint, he is under no fright nor is he being incarcerated in a police station.</P>
    <P>What Senator O'Higgins states should have been done instead was to rely on section 52.  Section 52 of the Offences Against the State Act, 1939, provides as follows:</P>
    <P>Whenever a person is detained in custody, and it expressly provides &ldquo;detained in custody&rdquo; not when he is free or when at liberty, not when he is not frightened, but when he is detained in custody under the provisions of Part IV of the Act&mdash;</P>
    <P>...any member of the Garda Síochána may demand of such person, at any time while he is so detained, a full account of such person's movements and actions during any specified period and all information in his possession in relation to the commission or intended commission by another person of any offence...</P>
    <P>According to section 52, the person has to be in custody under Part IV of the Act.  That refers us back to section 30 of the Act which enables any member of the Garda Síochána without warrant to stop, search, interrogate, and arrest any person and to take him into custody.  He can then detain him in custody for 24 hours <Col N="1127" /> and on the certificate of the superintendent of the Garda Síochána, can detain him for a further 24 hours. While he is in that custody he can be grilled and questioned and asked not what happened a moment before, but what happened at any time; at any period; what he intends to do in the future; what he knows about what other people did at any time in the past; what he knows about what other people may do in the future.  Surely those draconian rights, if they be deemed to exist, are contrary to ordinary respect for human liberty and human freedom.  The Government so considered, and having so considered and having subscribed to the Convention of Human Rights, they could not take advantage of those draconian authorities given to them by section 52.  They considered they would not be entitled under the Convention of Human Rights to question a man and grill him, under those circumstances, while in custody.  If they did so, such person would be entitled to appeal to the Court of Human Rights.</P>
    <P>Feeling, therefore, that in justice as well as by reason of their obligations to the Convention of Human Rights, they could not take advantage of section 52, the Government introduced this very simple requirement in this Bill which does not interfere with human rights.  Crime has been committed.  A garda has reasonable grounds for believing that this crime is a scheduled offence under Part V of the Act; therefore it is one of the more serious crimes. He has reasonable grounds for believing that the person to whom he is talking and whom he finds at or near the place at the time of the commission, knows or knew at the time of the commission, something about it.  He tells the person that, as is provided in the section, he has these reasonable grounds to believe this crime to have been committed. He then demands from that person to give the garda his name and address, something for which any of us could be asked when driving a motor car any day of the week.  He also demands from that person to give an account of his recent movements.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1128" /> This is something to which no reasonable person could take exception. It is something of which no reasonable person could suggest that it is contrary to the freedom or to the liberty of the individual.  It is something that, having regard to the times and the circumstances in which we live today and the violence that unfortunately surrounds us today, is a very temperate and reasonable measure.  It is the absolute minimum authority which should be given to the police force of our State.</P>
    <P>Near the Border the police may see people from within this State 100, 150, 200 yards from the Border, shooting at people on the far side.  They see them coming away.  Without some power, they can do nothing?  A garda, having explained to them that he believes a serious crime has been committed, is entitled to demand their names and addresses.  He is also by this Bill entitled to demand from them what were their recent movements.  So much for all the draconian rights claimed by section 2 of this Bill.  So much for Senator O'Higgins's strong advocacy of the fact that section 52 should be taken advantage of.  So much for Senator O'Higgins's interest or concern with the freedom and liberty of the individual.</P>
    <P>Section 3 provides as follows:</P>
    <P>Any statement made orally, in writing or otherwise, or any conduct, by an accused person implying or leading to a reasonable inference that he was at a material time a member of an unlawful organisation shall, in proceedings under section 21 of the Act of 1939, be evidence that he was then such a member.</P>
    <P>It is very, very simple.  Even without those words, it would be evidence anyway.  Anything which is relevant to the commission of a crime is evidence in a criminal offence but the nub of that section is paragraph (b).</P>
    <P>In those circumstances, dealing with violent men who are drilled and organised closely together, it is impossible to get one of them to give evidence against the other.  It is impossible to get an ordinary citizen to give evidence in those circumstances <Col N="1129" /> because his life is forfeit if he does.  Therefore, paragraph (b) provides that:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;conduct&rdquo; includes omission by the accused person to deny published reports that he was a member of an unlawful organisation, but the fact of such denial shall not by itself be conclusive.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, we have had people parading the country for the last couple of years under various military titles&mdash;lieutenant this, captain that, commandant somebody else, chief of staff somebody else, assistant chief of staff somebody else.  They love these titles; they are proud of them; they boast of them; they have their bodyguards when they come down to Dublin; but, if they are arrested or charged with being an ordinary simple private, then they say: &ldquo;No, prove it&rdquo;.  How do you prove it?</P>
    <P>It is typical of the type of argument that is being raised in the course of this debate in the Dáil and elsewhere that an effort is made to confuse the ordinary people.  It has been said in the Dáil.  I have also heard it said elsewhere, even on our national network of wireless, that somebody in the course of a motoring offence admitted that he was a member of the IRA and was not prosecuted for it.  I asked the person who made that statement in public: Are you satisfied that a prosecution against him was not pending? His answer was &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  This half truth is fine for an argument or to win a debating point; but surely we should, in the Seanad and Dáil have some greater sense of responsibility.  How do you prove that a person is a member of an illegal organisation?  It does not matter whether the organisation is the Tartan Gang, the UDA or the IRA.  Does anybody in this House or country seriously believe that we can get definite evidence of such a thing&mdash; evidence that will stand up in court, evidence upon which a court will be satisfied &ldquo;beyond reasonable doubt&rdquo; that that person is such a member? Those are the governing words in every criminal trial, that the court must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt.  But if those people are delighted to have <Col N="1130" /> their names in our daily papers or on our national television and wireless services that they are chief of staff and assistant chief of staff and lieutenants and captains and commandants in these illegal organisations, surely some notice can and should be taken of it. Those people should not be allowed to indulge themselves in the vain glory of these titles and then when it comes to take the consequences which a simple private under them must take&mdash; or &ldquo;volunteers&rdquo;, I believe, they call them&mdash;surely in those circumstances those statements made by responsible journalists should be accepted unless the party purports to deny them.</P>
    <P>To suggest otherwise is to suggest that the journalists of this country are wholly irresponsible.  A journalist will not publish a statement of that nature unless he has some grounds for believing it.  If he publishes it and has no grounds for believing it, his organisation or paper will not stand behind him.  If he is so lacking in a standard of honour and he has nothing to support his report he will soon find himself out of a job.  Is it suggested that a journalist can publish all these things and that somebody can indulge in the vainglory of them, in the titles they give him and then say: &ldquo;Prove that I am a member of the IRA&rdquo;?  Where is the man you will get to come into court to prove it?</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) of section 3 is the one on which I have heard the most controversy, in any event.  On yesterday's paper I read a letter signed by a large number of professors of Trinity College, Dublin, to the effect that this was to shift the onus of proof on to the accused from the State.  I was horrified.  My idea of university professors is that they are people who look at things objectively, who examine evidence scientifically, who will arrive at the true state of affairs and a true conclusion no matter what that conclusion will be, who will not prejudge circumstances and prejudge a result.  They did not take the least trouble to acquaint themselves with the facts or to acquaint themselves with some simple rules of evidence in criminal law.</P>
    <P>There were about 20 names to the <Col N="1131" /> letter and for ten guineas they could have the advice of an expert senior lawyer in criminal law.  That would have cost them half a guinea each. They say that the onus of proof is shifted on to the accused, but I say, and I stake my reputation on it as a lawyer, as a Member of this House and as a person who has had considerable practical experience of defending criminal proceedings, that the onus of proof is not shifted to the accused.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Senator pay ten guineas for that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnNash" hpid="Mr. Nash Mr. Nash">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nash</NameTxt>
      <P>It cost me an awful lot more during five years in the university. I saw a letter on the paper by another lawyer stating that it put a person on risk.  We should be straight about this.  Any of us could find ourselves accused and could be innocent. While I was driving up to this House today there was nothing to prevent any citizen of this country who stood on the road from going to the Garda and untruthfully making a statement that a car with registration number such and such, which passed up to Dublin today, struck him and knocked him on the road.  In any of our actions at any moment of any day we are at risk, but it is risk in a reasonable way.  A person is not at risk unreasonably in anything in this Bill.  If a person makes this statement and swears it in court, before I can be convicted of that crime the judge must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that what he has sworn is true. If the judge is not so satisfied I need not go into the witness box; I can ask for a direction and the prosecution is dismissed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the prosecuting witness stands up to cross-examination and I go into the witness box and swear &ldquo;I travelled to Dublin but I hit nobody on the road&rdquo; the judge cannot convict me unless he is satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that my evidence is untrue. The real test is that the court must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt. Evidence and proof are too very different matters.  It amazes me to hear professors from Trinity College <Col N="1132" /> making a statement like they did because, above all people, I would expect them to examine a thing objectively and scientifically and to arrive at accurate conclusions whether or not these met with their preconceived ideas.</P>
    <P>I have here some of the literature the Maynooth students passed around when they paraded outside the gates of this House a few days ago.  I doubt if some of them were really Maynooth students because of some of the comments I heard, such as &ldquo;Burn that joint in there&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>They must have reached their philosophy course at least, and should have been trained in the basics of reason and argument.  Here are some of the arguments they used:</P>
    <P>The Bill denies the right of silence in that silence may lead to prosecution under section 2 of the Bill and to conviction under section 3 (1) (b).</P>
    <P>What do they mean by the &ldquo;right of silence&rdquo;.  Everybody has that.  Nobody accused of a criminal offence is bound to go into the witness box.  Most lawyers dealing with the defence of criminal proceedings find that you will not put your client in the witness box if you know he is guilty; but that does not very often prevent you from having him acquitted.  If a client wishes to remain silent, that is his right.  If, in the instance which I gave of somebody falsely and maliciously alleging I struck him with my car, he wishes to give evidence of that kind I can retain silence.  But I will not do so unless I first tear that man's evidence to shreds and show him up for what he is.  If I have not then succeeded in doing that and if I feel the court still might have doubt about my guilt, I will then go into the witness box and tell the facts.  Those rights are not removed by this Bill.</P>
    <P>I leave myself open to correction in stating that this country and England are the only two countries in Europe where an accused person need make no statements in his defence. In the Latin countries he is brought before an examining magistrate and questioned and he must make a statement. <Col N="1133" /> If he does not make a statement he cannot give evidence in court afterwards. I was speaking to a Scottish lawyer two or three years ago and telling him of our procedure here where the accused is hedged around by every possible protection.  Before he goes into court not only must the State prove everything but must give him a complete transcript of the evidence that is proposed to be given against him and the State are bound within the four corners of that transcript. He can examine it and pick out flaws and see what evidence he can give in conflict that cannot be contradicted so as to acquit himself. He can plead an alibi if he sees a loophole to do so.  In Scotland, if a man wants to get the prosecution evidence in advance, he must give to the State a summary of the evidence which he proposes to give in his defence.</P>
    <P>It is equally important that the ordinary citizens of the State be protected as that any individual be protected.  Is nobody going to defend the silent majority, the people who can have their premises bombed?  The unfortunate people who were wounded here in Dublin last night?  The relatives of the unfortunate people who were killed?  Are the Garda to be prohibited from inquiring the names and addresses of people whom they suspect of knowing something, who were near the scene of that crime? Are they to be prohibited from asking these people for an account of their movements during the previous half hour or so?</P>
    <P>If those people go back to the North and have their names placarded as officers or generals in the Tartan Gang or the UDA and this is not denied, are our police force to be prohibited from arresting them at the next opportunity?</P>
    <P>This softly-softly, life in a balloon atmosphere is, we are told, what we should abide by.  Democracy is not all that old.  France and America are probably the first countries which had democracy as we know it today. England, the mother of parliaments, did not have democracy until comparatively <Col N="1134" /> recently&mdash;she had an oligarchy. In one section of our country we have had democracy for the short period of 50 years.  Democracy is a tender flower that must be nurtured and cultivated. Once it disappears it will not re-appear. In Poland and Czechoslovakia, where democracy has disappeared, it did so because steps were not taken against those who nurtured violence and educated the youth in sadism.</P>
    <P>May I refer to another paragraph from the Maynooth students' literature. It states that the Bill reverses the principle that an accused man is innocent until proven guilty.  This &ldquo;takes the cake&rdquo; as regards logic.  If a person commits a crime whether murder, arson or robbery, he is guilty of that crime. To say of him that he is innocent until proven guilty is poppycock.  He is guilty objectively and factually and any time it can be proved against him he will be convicted.  He is presumed to be innocent&mdash;a very different thing &mdash;until he is proved guilty.  He is presumed to be innocent because any court before which he comes must be satisfied beyond all reasonable doubt that he is guilty.  To suggest that there is anything in this Bill which alters by one iota that very fundamental principle of criminal law is completely and utterly misleading and one would expect something very much better from the Maynooth students, assuming it was the Maynooth students who were the authors of this document.</P>
    <P>Again quoting the Maynooth students:</P>
    <P>It gravely restricts the legitimate right of comment on and criticism of the administration of justice in this country.  In this way we see the rights of freedom of speech and public assembly being seriously infringed.</P>
    <P>I see one way in which the rights of freedom of speech and public assembly can be and will be infringed and that is the day when somebody degrades our courts of justice and is allowed blatantly to interfere with the administration by our judges of the law as it stands with all its protection for the individual.  That is the time when I see a danger of infringement of human <Col N="1135" /> rights.  Section 4 (1) (b) states:</P>
    <P>A statement, meeting, procession or demonstration shall be deemed to constitute an interference with the course of justice if it is intended, or is of such a character as to be likely, directly or indirectly to influence any court, person or authority concerned with the institution, conduct or defence of any civil or criminal proceedings (including a party or witness) as to whether or how the proceedings should be instituted, conducted, continued or defended, or as to what should be their outcome.</P>
    <P>If any of you were unlucky enough to have to involve yourself in court in criminal or civil proceedings as a party or otherwise, would you not wish for that court to be able to give its judgment without fear or favour and that every citizen coming before that court should be equal.</P>
    <P>In my own native town of Thurles we had the boys parading up and down, back and forth in front of the gates of the court.  The witnesses went in in the morning and the prosecution went on.  The boys said nothing to them, but a nod is as good as a wink to a blind horse.  When the witnesses came out at lunchtime, they had to pass through the parade while the boys scowled at them and wagged their banners a little.</P>

They stayed there until 6 o'clock in the evening.  Senator O'Higgins suggests that instead of proceeding under that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnNash" hpid="Mr. Nash Mr. Nash">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nash</NameTxt>
      <P>I will tell you when I have time and when you are intelligent enough to listen to me.  Senator O'Higgins referred to the Conspiracy and Protection of Property Act, 1875, <Col N="1136" /> and suggested it would protect us against all this interference with our courts.  Under this Act if there was a prosecution those witnesses who attended in Thurles court that day would be entitled to give their evidence without any fear and the district justice would feel quite happy that everything was going quite smoothly. If we try to take advantage of the Conspiracy and Protection of Property Act, 1875, it provides that with a view to compelling somebody to do something the party uses violence, intimidates, persistently follows, or watches and besets a house, he can be prosecuted. Under which of those headings could one hope to prosecute successfully those men who paraded up and down in front of the courthouse on that day?  Any superintendent of the Garda Síochána who brought a prosecution under that would be laughed out of court by any reasonable Justice, even though his court was being intimidated&mdash;and I do not mean any disrespect&mdash;even if he felt strongly about the matter. We are told that if a chief superintendent of the Garda Síochána gives evidence that he believes a man to be a member of an illegal organisation at a specified time this is contrary to the basic principles of human justice. I do not wish to waste the time of the House in what are elementary tenets of criminal law known to and practised by every lawyer.</P>
      <P>To take the example given by Senator O'Higgins, let us assume that Chief Superintendent Jones&mdash;for the sake of a better name&mdash;says he believes that our Minister for Justice is a member of the IRA and thereby he is at risk.  Any court hearing the case must first be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the chief superintendent so believes.  A bald statement by him to that effect would not be sufficient for any court to convict.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator is misreading the section.  All he has to do is make the statement that he believes. It does not go to the root of his belief.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnNash" hpid="Mr. Nash Mr. Nash">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nash</NameTxt>
      <P>I will read the subsection 3 (2):</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1137" /> Where an officer of the Garda Síochána, not below the rank of Chief Superintendent, in giving evidence in proceedings relating to an offence under the said section 21, states that he believes that the accused was at a material time a member of an unlawful organisation, the statement shall be evidence that he was then such a member.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Under this there is no statutory requirement to question the grounds for his belief or to show it is reasonable.  All he has to do is state his belief.  That is the evidence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnNash" hpid="Mr. Nash Mr. Nash">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nash</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with a practical incident.  He has gone into court and stated his belief.  The first thing that any accused man, even if he is defending himself as somebody recently was before the Special Criminal Court and I am sure we all agree he was given ample opportunity to do so, will ask the chief superintendent is, what are your grounds for believing this, were you told by an <i>agent provocateur</i>, were you told by a member of the Garda Síochána?  If it was a member of the Garda Síochána, the court must have the best evidence and, therefore, the garda must appear in court.  I am prepared to concede that except it be a member of the Garda Síochána, the chief superintendent is under no obligation to give the source of his information, that is to identify the person because that person as a result might be at risk. He cannot identify the person who gave him the information but he must state, if asked, what type of person it was.  Was it an <i>agent provocateur.</i>  Was it a member of his own force?  Let us assume it was a member of the police force.  In that case the court will insist on the garda's attendance to have the best evidence&mdash;as the Criminal Court did in the prosecution against Seán Mac Stiofáin&mdash;it must have before it the best evidence.  Therefore, the member of the Garda Síochána must attend court and give evidence.  He is a member of the police force.  He is not someone who needs this special protection.  He can be asked: Did you have this information?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Does this section not <Col N="1138" /> get around the best evidence rule?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnNash" hpid="Mr. Nash Mr. Nash">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nash</NameTxt>
      <P>He can be asked: &ldquo;Did you have this information first hand, second hand or so on&rdquo;.  If the civic guard replies that he did not know whether it was second hand, third hand or whatever, the judge cannot be satisfied that the statement is true.  He must be satisfied beyond all reasonable doubt that the accused is guilty of the crime with which he is charged.  Therefore, the judge attaches to his note of that evidence the weight it is worth, and can light a cigarette with it.  The fact that the chief superintendent is convinced beyond doubt and is morally certain that the person is a member of the IRA is not admissible as evidence without this subsection.</P>
      <P>If the chief superintendent is so convinced and can prove that fact to the satisfaction of the court and there is the possibility that the court may be satisfied beyond all reasonable doubt and at that stage only would the accused enter the witness box and swear: &ldquo;I was not a member of the IRA then.&rdquo;  His evidence can also be tested in cross-examination. Unless the court at that stage is satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused is perjuring himself when he swore he was not a member of the IRA, the prosecution must be dismissed.  It is as simple as that.</P>
      <P>I fail to understand why all the people opposed to the Bill have this deep anxiety about the freedom of the individual, the person who is suspected and who is probably guilty, and are not worried about our State, its democratic processes and the preservation of parliamentary traditions. I do not know why they think the Government should take the draconian measures under section 52, when the Government feel it is contrary to human rights to do so, instead of the simple measures under section 2. I leave that to be judged by this House and the people of Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>Notwithstanding what Senator Nash has said&mdash;he is a lawyer and I am not competent to argue the merits of the Bill with him&mdash;this is a serious measure.  An indication <Col N="1139" /> of its seriousness has been the reaction of the public and the opinions expressed by various sections of our community, not all in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  It is quite certain that no measure in recent years has stirred up so much adverse comment as this Bill in the last few weeks.</P>
      <P>It would be quite wrong to dismiss the Bill as a trivial matter or to try and whitewash it in any way.  The Bill has been described as excessive in its content and repressive in its intentions. Any Bill based on the 1939 Offences against the State Act of its very nature would be repressive.  If in the interests of the community, the judiciary and the Garda Force are given powers to repress people intending to carry out violence the measures must of necessity be repressive.</P>
      <P>The Fine Gael Party made their position on this Bill very clear in the Dáil last night.  As Senator O'Higgins has stated, in the interests of peace and security, particularly in regard to the tragic events of the past 12 or 14 hours, they decided to withdraw their amendment to the Bill.  Therefore the Minister can be sure there will be no opposition from the Fine Gael Party to the passage of this Bill.  I appreciate that in discussing this Bill here this afternoon our rhetoric is largely of an academic nature.  The Bill will be passed and the Minister has indicated that no further amendments will be accepted by him.  Our task is to pass the Bill quickly through the second House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Nash quoted a little poem which made reference to the music of the rifle.  I agree with him that unfortunately the cult of violence has been running through our society for many generations.  It is only a matter of two or three years when the music of Belgian rifles purchased with funds intended for a far different purpose caused quite a stir in the columns of our newspapers and among our community here.  When we talk about the cult of the rifle we should not build up a cult of hypocrisy. To put this measure through in a sensible and constructive manner we should appreciate certain factors <Col N="1140" /> which worry the non-lawyer population, the ordinary man in the street who is bemused by the many arguments <i>pro</i> and <i>con</i> which have taken place in the Dáil in the last three days.  They are not sure now whether the Bill is a necessary measure or one of repression giving further powers to the Government of the day.</P>
    <P>People tend to form their opinions by the circumstances of the day.  The tragic circumstances of last night will condition our people, as of now, to a certain way of thinking.  At this moment our people want to ensure that the Government of the day have adequate measures to put down the men of violence and protect the community from the excesses of men apparently bent on the destruction of life and property without any consideration for the awful consequences.  If this measure is necessary now&mdash;and many arguments have been advanced against that point&mdash;it is very difficult to come down on one side or the other.</P>
    <P>Parts of the Bill are necessary but I have grave doubts about the necessity for other parts.  If the provisions contained in this Bill are necessary now, were they not necessary two or three years ago when violence and lawlessness first spread throughout the country? That is one of the questions the ordinary layman is asking.  If this measure is necessary to put down the men of violence and to ensure peace, why was it not brought before the Dáil and Seanad when violence first erupted and when men paraded openly in the streets and at funerals and demonstrations without hindrance?  Surely there were sufficient indications two or three years ago&mdash;some of them were quoted by Senators Nash and O'Higgins and were mentioned in the Dáil&mdash;to impel the Government to act against those people.  Why was this measure not brought before the Oireachtas in time to prevent the serious situation which has since arisen and which has continued openly and blatantly to the present day?</P>
    <P>People have a natural reluctance to give any additional powers to a Government. People react against any additional controls over what they rightly regard as their liberty of movement or <Col N="1141" /> liberty of speech.  It is a natural reaction of any people and our people are no different in that regard.  However, they will give these powers and are prepared to give them if they are satisfied that the existing legislation is not sufficient to contain the lawlessness and the anarchy that have been present in our State in the last two or three years.  If this legislation is necessary, why was it not introduced earlier?  If it is necessary, in what way is it necessary?</P>
    <P>The Minister and the Government can be assured&mdash;they have already been assured in the other House&mdash;that the Fine Gael Party, with their traditions of law and order and their basic commitment to the institutions of the State, will give them any powers they need.  I wish to re-echo that sentiment in this House lest it be forgotten.  The Leader of the Fine Gael Party, Deputy Cosgrave, made it quite clear in the Dáil during the last two days that he and his party would support the Government in any measures necessary to contain men of violence and to ensure peace and tranquillity in our State.  In conditions of lawlessness and anarchy it is not the men of wealth and excessive property who get hurt, but the workers whose jobs may be put in jeopardy and the people who man our State services.  They are the first to suffer in conditions of anarchy and lawlessness.  For this reason we in the Fine Gael Party wish to exercise our responsibility in ensuring that the Government will be fully armed to carry out the proper processes of the law.</P>
    <P>We have to appreciate that we are living in difficult times.  We have to appreciate that the events of last night make things very difficult for the Government, the Army, the judiciary and the Garda Síochána.  They must have the support of the Houses of the Oireachtas in their efforts.  We would be found wanting in our sense of duty if we did not demonstrate the fact that we stand steadily behind our forces.  It must be reiterated that in this State there is only room for one army and one garda force, namely, the Army and the Garda force organised and given their commissions through the Parliament and the people of this <Col N="1142" /> State.  Nobody else has a right to arrogate to himself the powers to take decisions in the name of the people. Nobody has the right, in the name of patriotism, to create trouble in the streets, to destroy property, to rob banks and carry out other nefarious acts.  The fact that a group cloak themselves with the cloak of patriotism does not excuse their actions in any way.</P>
    <P>I am sure this House will discharge its duty provided it is satisfied that these measures are absolutely necessary and that they will be used as temporary measures only in the very special situation which is causing our people very, very grave concern at the present time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FintanKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Nash has just concluded what I would call a most remarkable speech by inquiring why we should display anxiety about the individual over and above the greater interest of the State.  The answer to that question is precisely why I am opposed to this Bill <i>in toto</i> and why I shall vote against it.</P>
      <P>For the reasons advanced by Senator Robinson and others I would be prepared to accept her amendment.  It is clear beyond all doubt that one of the car bomb explosions in Dublin last night was directed against Liberty Hall and all that it stands for and against the whole concept of liberty.  It was directed against the liberty of our people to go about their business in safety and security.  As a Member of this House and as president of the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union, of which Liberty Hall is the headquarters, I condemn emphatically those savage and cowardly attacks and I also condemn those who perpetrated them.  I tender my deepest sympathy and that of my union, and of the entire trade union movement north and south, to all those who have suffered as a consequence of these acts.  Any anger or bitterness we might feel at these acts of violence should be tempered by a sadness at the terrible tragedy which has come to Ireland and her people, north and south.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tragic as the actual physical sufferings have been, in the long run it may <Col N="1143" /> well be that an even greater tragedy will be the ever-growing conflict and dissention and even hatred in the minds of so many people here in the South. We witnessed that in full in the other House during the last few days.  In opposing this Bill I am not activated by dissension.  Indeed, I fully sympathise with the Government, and particularly with the Minister for Justice, in the terrible dilemma in which they find themselves.  All decent peace-loving people want to end violence and injustice on both sides of the Border.</P>
    <P>This Bill will not do that.  On the contrary, it will do the reverse.  Already, even before the Bill passed into this House, there was ample evidence that the introduction of the Bill itself, apart altogether from its subsequent application, had created a new mood of violence.  You cannot end violence and injustice by creating a situation in which many thousands of innocent people may be flung into prison on inadequate evidence or, on rumour. Senator Nash had already pointed out quite clearly&mdash;and he spoke as a representative of the legal profession&mdash;the virtual impossibility of securing adequate evidence of membership of an illegal organisation.  Why then is this Bill deemed necessary?</P>
    <P>Then there is the climate created by the Bill.  You cannot end violence and injustice by creating a situation in which even the expression of a viewpoint on politics, on social questions or on any matter could subsequently be demonstrated as contrary to the provisions of this Bill.  Indeed, to answer Senator Nash's question, I could envisage a situation&mdash;and this has happened in other countries before and after the last war&mdash;in which even to think is an offence against the State.  No doubt, when this Bill is enacted, as unfortunately it seems likely that it will, the Army and the Garda and the courts will, as always, do everything possible to be fair. However, they will be faced with an impossible task.</P>
    <P>While even a short time remains, I appeal to the Government to withdraw this Bill altogether, or at least <Col N="1144" /> to agree to Senator Robinson's amendment. In the interim period I would ask the Government to pay close attention to the policy statement issued this morning by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  That policy statement represents the viewpoint of the majority of the people of the Republic and also the viewpoint of the majority of the people of Northern Ireland.  This is not a policy statement or a condemnation of this Bill issued for a crowd of people marching up and down outside this building.  This is no minority opposition to the Bill.  This is a majority opposition.  It seems unlikely now that the Government will be able to test public reaction to this Bill, but they can test it through the trade union movement.  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions represents 1¼ million workers in Northern Ireland and in the Republic, and I say to the Minister that that view is truly representative of the people of both parts of the country.  They want peace but they do not want a situation in which the introduction of this Bill will make matters a great deal worse.  As one who opposed the introduction of internment without trial in the North, I equally oppose this measure here. At most it could well mean the physical incarceration of thousands of people: at least it will mean the incarceration of the mind of Irishmen and Irish women.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasMullins" hpid="Tomás Ó Maoláin Tomás Ó Maoláin">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Ó Maoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>I was rather astonished to hear Senator Kennedy's reference at the end of his speech to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions manifesto, and to his very optimistic statement that 1¼ million people were going to be influenced by it.  I have a recollection that the Congress of Trade Unions issued a manifesto also on behalf of 1¼ million people against going into Europe.  I do not think that even the members of the trade union movement took any notice whatsoever of Congress on that occasion.  Therefore, we can disregard the threats of what will happen made by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, and, indeed, of the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union&mdash;of which Senator Kennedy has the honour of <Col N="1145" /> being president&mdash;as a result of their power in respect of this Bill.  The statement issued by Congress is a most irresponsible document.  It is nearly as irresponsible as some of the statements that have been issued by the various front organisations which arise in this part of Ireland particularly, whenever there seems to be an opportunity of doing damage to the Government, to the economy or to our progress towards reunification of the whole country.  The latest of these front organisations will be having a meeting next Thursday night, and I notice that our illustrious Senators Robinson and Horgan will be speaking at that meeting, citizens for civil liberties, no less.  It is one of the organisations which arise whenever there is an occasion to get a wallop at the Government and it conceals behind its mask a heterogeneous mixture of peculiar individuals, practically every one of whom has a different policy in regard to social, economic and national matters. There is one thing on which they all agree: they do not want Fianna Fáil. Unfortunately for them, and for Fine Gael, and for the Labour Party, the people apparently are quite satisfied with Fianna Fáil and they therefore remain the Government.</P>
      <P>Senator Kennedy spoke about the introduction of this Bill and that it created a new mood of violence.  He said that the climate created by its introduction was also tending to strengthen the mood of violence.  The climate created by this Bill was created largely by one of these unions affiliated to the Congress of Trade Unions, that is the National Union of Journalists, which pontificates loud and long, whenever somebody steps on its corns, about the freedom of the individual and the freedom of the press and the freedom of speech.  It is a union which, however, arrogates to itself the right to decide in many matters what shall or what shall not go into newspapers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Horgan speaks loud and long here about this great institution which stands for public freedom, that the freedom of the press must be preserved and the right of journalists is <Col N="1146" /> sanctified and sacred.  That particular body here in this city of Dublin, independent of the statement which was made by the Minister for Finance in the Dáil about their failure to stand up for a colleague who had been beaten up in County Meath, showed their love for freedom and their fellowman and what right we the ordinary people would have if that dictatorship had power by telling the editor of a newspaper that because a certain expert was not a member of their union he dare not print an article in their newspaper, otherwise they would shut down the whole plant.  The editor of the newspaper had to agree tamely and the expert who was going to write an article on this subject of Irish industrial development was thrown out.  This climate of which Senator Kennedy speaks is largely created by these gentlemen of the NUJ, by the newspapers and by the commentators on radio and television. I heard some distinguished speakers on the radio during the last week or two including Senators Horgan and Robinson, and from listening to them one would imagine that all hell would break loose in this country if this Bill was passed; that any man would be afraid to talk above a whisper, that there would be no right of free speech left, that every man who passed a public meeting would shut his eyes and put cotton wool in his ears in case he would be accused of being a subversive.</P>
    <P>About 12 months ago we had a Bill before this House dealing with illegal occupations and we had the same climate of terror created by these gentlemen and by these front organisations of which I speak.  We can disregard that sort of talk which is not a statement of the true position as it exists in this country.  The attempt to bring it on to the plain of the Big Brother business, by suggesting that the time may come when even to think will be a crime, is not going to deceive anybody.</P>
    <P>In this part of Ireland we want to preserve the freedom which we established here and which we intend to maintain.  If the Government decide that it is necessary to get more power <Col N="1147" /> than is sought under this Bill they will come back to the Oireachtas and look for it.  If that power seems to be more drastic than this Bill appears to be to some people then the Government will not hesitate to look for that power and get it to preserve the rights and liberties of the people of this part of Ireland.  It is the duty of the Government to do that.</P>
    <P>I spoke of some of the extraordinary statements being made by these front organisations.  I want to refer to one extraordinary statement made by a creature from the North who happens to be an elected representative and who came to Dublin last night.  She has been here before and has been on television and radio.  She spoke at a meeting in Liberty Hall, at which Senator Kennedy spoke, and made disparaging references to the President of Ireland. If I meet that tinker girl it will give me the greatest pleasure to slap her face for those disparaging references.  When the time comes I hope the people of her constituency will remember that. The serious point I have in mind is the statement which appears in today's issue of the <i>Irish Independent</i>, the heading of which is:</P>
    <P Just="Center">Bernadette blames Fianna Fáil for blasts.</P>
    <P>Last night this tinker girl had the impudence to say to the <i>Irish Independent</i>, to the Press Association and to the other newspapers which listened to her that she had confirmatory evidence that no republican or Northern Irelandbased organisation had anything to do with the blasts and that the only people to benefit out of the blasts were Fianna Fáil and those who write can read.</P>
    <P>In any well-run dictatorship this creature would not last very long after a statement like that, and in any country in which, as the NUJ are fond of saying, there is a danger of the freedom of the press the <i>Irish Independent</i> would not last very long for that tendentious heading, but because we have freedom here she is allowed to get away with a statement like that and the <i>Irish Independent</i> is allowed to print a heading like that.  That is what I mean by the climate and the <Col N="1148" /> creators of the climate.  It is these journalists, sub-editors, newspapers who print it, and people like this girl who are allowed to come here and speak like that that create the climate of which Senator Kennedy spoke.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate if you have a person like that and if you also have an individual, with whose party Senator Kennedy's party are connected, leading another party, who avails of the opportunity to give his views on this, as he calls it, draconian legislation.  If he is entitled to give his views on this draconian legislation and on the Government and particular individuals here, then I am entitled to give my views on him and on those associated with him.  Without a shadow of doubt I think that both of the Devlins and Mr. Fitt ought to mind their own business and we will mind the Offences against the State (Amendment) Act and the liberties of the people of this part of the country which is under our jurisdiction until such time as we are able to take charge of the remainder of the country in a democratic and liberty-loving manner.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Russell agrees that this is a serious measure and says the Minister <Col N="1149" /> can be assured of the approval of the House.  I was glad to hear that.  He hopes that the Bill will get through the House as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>So far as we can see, there is a lot of hypocrisy in the two Houses of the Oireachtas.  Some of the Senators on the other side want it both ways.  They want sympathy and to curry favour with everybody but do not appear to have the guts to take a stand on anything. I fear the day will come when they must make up their minds that black is black and white is white.  If they do not wish to have this Bill let them say so.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Higgins gave us a long interesting lecture on the traditions of the Fine Gael Party and I am strongly tempted to follow him down the road from which he started on those traditions. I am strongly tempted to ask him what the result was of the lawful institutions and the lawful army which he created, but I will refrain.  We live and learn and Senator O'Higgins will discover that history cannot forever be cloaked from the people and that the truth will emerge as it is now emerging in spite of the smokescreen created by some of the Senator's co-operators on the newspapers.</P>
    <P>This Bill is very necessary.  It is a step in the direction of giving adequate powers to the Government to ensure that people can sleep in their houses at night without the constant fear of a knock at the door; that people can walk around the streets and chat to a man passing in a car without the fear that something will blow up in their faces.  It is a Bill to help to remove this climate which has crept in here from the slaughter and holocaust which is going on in the North for the last three or four years.</P>
    <P>Anything that will save us from that should receive a welcome and any powers that are needed to help in that situation should be given.  We have seen the tragedy of the Six Counties in the last four years.  We have seen how easily we can drift into trouble here.  I am sorry every member of the Opposition parties did not hear Senator Nash's excellent speech.  He made an unanswerable case for the Bill.  The last <Col N="1150" /> four years can be a lesson to us to be eternally vigilant in the small things such as groups of men walking who cannot be challenged although a crime has been committed a few yards away. We want power to do that.</P>
    <P>During the past few days there have been demonstrations in this city at which leaflets were distributed and in which slogans were carried.  The slogans were not those of peaceful demonstrators or of people who had a just economic grievance.  They were the slogans of anarchy and of people who were determined to apply violence and to use the good intention of crowds of young people, in particular, for their own evil ends.  We must ensure that the Government will be in a position to deal stringently and quickly without being challenged by all types of legal obstacles.  This Bill should receive a quick passage here in the House so that the country may see that the Seanad as well as the Dáil is in earnest about the existing situation which can threaten us by becoming worse.</P>
    <P>There is a very serious aspect to this.  Senators are aware of the development of rocket warfare in the North.  They are also aware of the statements made in the British Press and the House of Commons about where these rocket sites are located. Senators must be aware of the growing feeling among politicians in England that something ought to be done to get the troops to follow home to where the sites are.  It would be very easy for a gang of ill-disposed malcontents to arrange a rocket attack and to ensure we could become involved by involving the British. From that anything could happen. The situation is serious, not one to be tinkered with or to score debating points on.  Every Senator should think twice before delaying this Bill going through the House.</P>
    <P>I should like to pay tribute to the Leader of the main Opposition party in the Dáil for his strong and determined action in regard to the Bill when it went through that House.  The public will appreciate the meaning of what he said and did more than they will the demonstrators, the wreckers, the <Col N="1151" /> saboteurs and those who hold up this Bill.</P>

      <P>I do not propose to delay the business of the House very long.  I should like to express sympathy with the families of those who were killed and injured last night and to the victims of last Saturday night's explosion.  One of the boys seriously injured was a neighbour of mine and during the past week I have seen the horror and revulsion of the parishioners build up against this kind of carry-on.</P>
      <P>I look forward to the Minister for Justice getting down at last to deal determinedly with this type of illegal activity.  Coming up to Christmas, and indeed at any time, our citizens should at least have peace and contentment to pursue their normal everyday tasks without harassment and intimidation of any kind.</P>
      <P>Members of the Oireachtas, from the legal professions especially, have critically examined the sections of this Bill.  Many of them are disturbed by the implications of some of these sections.  Nobody doubts the sincerity of any of our colleagues irrespective of which side of the House they sit.</P>
      <P>I should like to appeal to the public to co-operate with the Garda on the beat to ensure that we do not park our cars indiscriminately, or take up the time of a hard-pressed force in any way.  Every Irishman who is proud of his country and wishes to see it prosper should ensure that his lack of thought does not impose an extra burden on the Garda or the Army in these difficult times.  This would help even in a small way to deal speedily with these problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With this type of activity starting in the Republic it is important that we, who for so many years have enjoyed friendship and good neighbourliness with the different Christian traditions, should in the holy season of Christmas draw closer together.  It is an opportune time for all Irishmen to act like good Christians and to ensure that what has happened in Northern Ireland with such devastating effect does not occur here.  I should like to see the people, <Col N="1152" /> whose job it is to implement these laws to bring peace to our country, having a reasonable amount of success, while at the same time respecting political views.  We must all recognise that in a democratic society the common good should be paramount.  The attitude taken by my party has been to put the safety of the State first.</P>

      <P>Like Senator O'Higgins, I also have a great dislike of repressive legislation.  All forms of injustice and oppression go against my basic principles but, in a situation where normal circumstances do not prevail, there is justification for a restriction of people's rights.  Nobody has a fundamental freedom of right particularly if it cuts across the rights of others.  There is no absolute entitlement to right without taking into account the rights of others.  The situation must be balanced.  On the one hand, we are presented with legislation, which seems repressive, and, on the other, we have a situation where obvious repression exists, that is, the repression of violence and the bomb. When one plants a bomb that is a restriction on the right to life, to movement and to health.</P>

      <P>These are the fundamental rights of people.  The right of free speech is also fundamental. But rights must be placed in their proper perspective.  Last night, a man was deprived of his right to live; his children were deprived of their right to his protection.  This morning I called to the home of one of the men who was killed to sympathise with his family.  Mrs. Duffy was not there, but I spoke to her sister.  The family are shattered as a result of what has happened.  Nobody knows who is responsible, but we all know that a man lost his life and his family have been deprived of their rights.  These factors must be taken into consideration in any situation.  We must ask ourselves now if this is a normal situation.  In my opinion it is not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1153" /> Last night could have proved a very dangerous situation for one of my own family.  My daughter was returning from teacher-training college when the first bomb exploded.  When she arrived on Eden Quay to get the bus, the windows of the bus were broken and the driver's arm was torn and bleeding. Then, as she was walking past the Abbey Theatre, 30 yards in front of her the second bomb exploded.  She was one of the lucky ones and, when I arrived home, she was quite calm. What disturbed her most was the panic which she and all the other people had experienced.  When the first bomb exploded everybody was curious, but when the second one went off there was mass hysteria.  One may say that the blame cannot be placed on any particular person or group.  When a person plants a bomb then he is responsible for the next bomb planted; the second bomb will be one of revenge.  The whole thing becomes a vicious circle; one bomb produces another, and so on.  Those responsible for planting bombs must be stopped.</P>
    <P>I represent an organisation which have always fought against injustice. This is well known in Government circles.  We took on the Fianna Fáil Government in a famous row away back because we felt that they were acting unjustly.  We were on strike for seven months and that strike cost our organisation £¼ million.</P>
    <P>This morning I consulted the executive of my organisation before coming to this special meeting of the Seanad.  A very important decision has to be made.  The volume of opinion of my executive was that people must get off the fence.  This is the opinion of a 32-county organisation; it is one of the oldest affiliates to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the sixth largest union in Ireland. I have already paired with a Member of the other side of the House who could not attend and with whom I have a long understanding.  I could slip out of this situation here today but I am not prepared to play the coward in this matter.</P>

      <P>I am supporting the Government in this matter.  This does not mean to say that I completely agree with all that is contained in the Bill but I have a fundamental responsibility to say what reasonable people think in these circumstances.</P>
      <P>When a person is hospitalised he is asked for his consent to disfigurement, to the amputation of a limb perhaps.  The patient gives his consent knowing that he may be disfigured forever but his life is at stake.  The analogy is somewhat similar in respect of the present situation.  We are being asked to give our consent to a restriction of our rights in an interim period in order to avert complete destruction. I give my consent and those with whom I spoke this morning give their consent.  When the time comes when these abnormal circumstances shall have disappeared, I will be the first to stand up and defend the right of the individual.</P>
      <P>I should like to express my admiration for the conduct of the gardaí last night.  These men risked their lives searching for bombs in order to save the lives of others.  I should also like to pay tribute to the ambulance men who were on the scene immediately and also put their lives in danger. The people in this Assembly should give their consent to this restrictive legislation for the reasons I have mentioned.  We are not being asked to put our lives at risk; we are being asked to suffer these restrictions, as an interim measure, until such time as we appear before this Assembly again and press for their withdrawal. In those circumstances I am voting for the Second Reading of this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I find myself very much in agreement with the sentiments, so ably expressed, of Senator Brosnahan.  We have to ensure that the institutions of the State are maintained, even if that involves certain restrictions.  Senator Nash made an excellent speech here today.  He has many years of legal experience.  He dissected the restrictions and went through the court procedures involved and I do not believe any citizen endeavouring <Col N="1155" /> to play a normal role in the community need have any fears of the restrictions.</P>
      <P>I should like to appeal to the Labour Party and the labour movement to reconsider, very seriously, their attitude to this Bill.  I have a great admiration for the Labour Party for the staunch, non-violent attitude they have adopted at all times in connection with Northern Ireland affairs.  They have joined with other parties in deploring violence as a means of forcing political change and have relied on the democratic procedure of persuasion, mutual agreement and trust as the only way forward to a lasting solution.  The Labour Party have played a significant role in keeping the country as balanced as it has been over the last few years and they should not lose their heads on this issue.</P>
      <P>I should like to contrast the attitude of the Labour Party on the Common Market with their attitude on this Bill. In the Common Market debate the Labour Party&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party accepted the majority view on that occasion and undertook to act as a watchdog for possible ill-effects that might occur.  I believe that the restrictions contained in this Bill have been exaggerated out of all proportion. It is the same type of exaggeration that was indulged in in regard to the Forcible Entry Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Labour Party to accept Senator Nash's analysis of the Bill. There cannot be any grounds for disquiet when the provisions of the Bill are viewed against the maintenance of <Col N="1156" /> law and order.  Last night, we had the experience of two bomb explosions in Dublin and perhaps, while we are speaking here tonight, other bombs may be exploded in the city; it would be a very naive man who would think that we have heard the last of bomb explosions on this side of the Border.</P>
    <P>Once more, I would appeal to the Labour Party to put the public interest first.  All of us here should be committed to that goal.  We must all play our part.  We are all concerned with the freedom of the individual within the context of an orderly society.  We must all endeavour to keep the public calm.  I would recommend that organised groups should read the Bill thoroughly before indulging in obviously exaggerated and wild criticisms. We do not know who were responsible for last night's bomb blasts, but we were threatened with retaliation from the North.  Is this the retaliation that was promised or are some new organisations causing the explosions?  Once retaliation starts it can escalate at an alarming rate.  The happenings of last night, small compared with what the North has experienced, should give us an understanding of and sympathy with the problems of the North and should make us commit ourselves to the achievement of a peaceful solution of the problems of Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>I have been saddened by the debate in the Dáil and in public on this Bill. There has been so much recrimination. Questions are being asked as to who started the wave of violence in our society.  Where did it start?  Who were involved in it in the 1920s and the 1930s?  As someone who was a child at that time, I am not interested in such controversy.  We have work to do on our future development and the attitudes of the twenties and the thirties are not commendable today.  While we go around striking our breasts and crying &ldquo;mea culpa&rdquo; do we ever reflect on the achievements of this State? After going through the misery of a civil war the ballot box, within ten years, transferred power from those who won the civil war to those who lost it.  That is an achievement that is unique in the history of democracies.</P>
    <P>It is something of which we should <Col N="1157" /> be intensely proud.  If we have had growing pains within those 50 years, who can blame us?  Our attitude to the North is traumatic in that we see the national indignation at the settlement that was imposed 50 years ago despite our insistence that it was against the wishes of the majority of the people at that time.  Now, as democrats, who look to a future in which we hope we will have a united Ireland, we can clearly see that that future cannot be brought about by holding any sizeable group of people within the community against their will.  Hence, the policy, which is supported strongly by all three parties, of a non-violent, peaceful solution to the North, to come about when we have persuaded the majority in the North that their place is with us in a united country in the context of a united Europe.  We have, therefore, a great deal to be proud of, but we should not be proud of the debate and the exaggerations that have marred the past three or four days.</P>
    <P>To a certain extent this could have been avoided and I blame the Government strongly in this respect.  Again and again we have called for the setting up of a committee on Northern affairs.  We have not got it.  Likewise, the question of security, which is fundamental in this Bill, should have been handled on an all-party basis.  At least we should have had all-party discussions before it reached its final drafting stage.  If that had been done, the misconceptions would have been avoided, as well as the exaggerations, and a mainly agreed measure would have been presented to the House.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Government that they should, as far as possible, on everything on which we are agreed have tried to work with an all-party approach.  After all, Mr. Heath and Mr. Wilson can work together and, despite the ups-and-downs, can preserve a bipartisan approach to the North.  It shows us in a poor light if we here cannot combine where we have much in common.</P>
    <P>What can we hold out to either side in the North about being able to offer them any legitimate and proper place in the administration <Col N="1158" /> and responsibility of a united Ireland, if we cannot begin sharing out responsibilities between three parties here which are fundamentally committed to the democratic way of life and are unanimous in their support for law and order and the rights of the individual?</P>
    <P>I was very taken by the tribute paid by the Leader of the House, Senator Ó Maoláin, to Deputy Cosgrave.  That tribute was richly deserved.  Last night I was in a group watching Deputy Cosgrave's appearance on television.

      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>That was a tremendous achievement and I should like to add my words of congratulation and praise to him for his excellent work.  In the Taoiseach we have got the most underrated leader we have had in our time.  He is a man whose standing abroad is far higher than what is grudgingly given to him at home.  I saw him in action on other fronts, and I saw him give before a delegation of the Senate of the University as fine a performance as any statesman ever gave. We should be proud of the leaders we have and I would ask you to dampen down all this disturbance and criticism. The climate abroad at present is doing a disservice to the country and is also putting off further the day when we can look to a solution of our problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The coming spring can bring that solution, if only we will work together and agree that we are all Irishmen committed to try to do the best we can for the country.  It would be a great achievement if we could influence those who are misguided in their advocacy of physical force and wean them away from it.  We must make it quite clear that our problem today is that of maintaining law and order.  I do not believe that this Bill, <Col N="1159" /> in its implementation, will present any real threat to the individual comparable to the threat to law and order today.  The bombs last night brought a note of realism to the approach to this, but I am afraid that note of realism is inclined to evaporate and I hope that the coming week will not bring the demonstrators back into the streets.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot give warranties on that.  Senator Quinlan made a very good point when he spoke about the responsibility of the Government to seek support from the parties in the Parliament in relation to a matter of this kind.  Everyone in the House knows, in so far as anybody bothers about me, that my position on this is absolutely clear: the safety of the State is supreme.  I would even go into a Greek colonel situation rather than imperil it, provided I knew who the colonels were.  If the Minister's advisors want to search the records of this House they will find that I said I was in favour of the maintenance of the power of internment as a necessary State provision for the defence of the State.  I do not depart from that position in the slightest degree tonight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned that we are carrying out an operation of internment through the procedure of the Judiciary and I am concerned about the final effect of this.  This is not a legalistic point: I am not the kind of lawyer who makes legalistic points.  I am concerned that <Col N="1160" /> the laws spelled out here are respected and supported.  We know that laws which are not respected and supported are not capable of being enforced.  It is important that the majority of the people are in support of what we decide in relation to this.  At this point it is silly to talk about amendments.  We are not going to get amendments.  The Bill is going to be enacted and that is all about it.  You have all got your instructions. I understand that.</P>
    <P>We ought to learn something from this experience.  We had two Opposition parties in this Parliament totally committed to the security of the State. We learned of this legislation on Monday morning of this week.  Why were we not consulted before?  Why were our views not sought before?  All you want, you will get from us.  I know well what is defective in the existing legislation and I would repair that defect, but I would not give you what you are looking for here, if you want me to sign my personal name over what is asked from me, because it goes too far.  I ask myself why do you go so far, and I cannot get an answer to it.  Why do you put in the Bill what you do not need?  There are things in this Bill which are not needed to achieve what you want to achieve.  I will give you in two seconds what you want to achieve.  Why is there no express provision in this Bill enabling an accused to negative an averment against him as there was in section 26 of the Offences against the State Act, 1939.</P>
    <P>The tradition of my party has been talked about and even sneered at.  Mistakes, mistakes, mistakes, on all sides mistakes.  There have been mistakes on all sides.  The instruments of this party are very valuable.  They have been referred to by the Leader of the House this evening when he referred to Deputy Cosgrave.  I agree with Deputy Cosgrave on this measure, completely, this Bill should not have been presented to us in this form.  I do not speak of the Seanad because now we are simply a rubber stamping machine, which is a disgrace. It is a mistake by the Government not to regard this House as a deliberative assembly capable of making amendments, and expected to <Col N="1161" /> make amendments&mdash;a fundamental Government mistake.  It is a bad blunder for the future of this country. What are we all here for?  £1,500 per year, is that it?  Nonsense.  Most of us are here because we want to do what we should be doing.  We want to express opinions which will affect legislation.  What is the good of calling me to the Seanad on Saturday afternoon to tell the Government that they can get what they will get anyhow from 31 or 32 Senators?  This is a bad blunder if you think in terms larger than the interest of the party now in power.  I can look at that young chap. I could have been his father but I was not.  He will have to live a long life I hope, and he should be thinking of the future of this country.  Our country depends for its future development on the co-operation of all the intelligent informed people of the country.</P>
    <P>Why not get rid of the Seanad if it is simply going to rubber stamp the legislation?  What is the point of it? It is costing the State a lot of money. If it is there it should be used as a serious deliberative assembly.  Senator Ó Maoláin's proposal about curtailing the period of time for which the legislation is to be signed is, with the greatest respect, the greatest nonsense that ever was.  It is introducing an unnecessary histrionic element into the affair. We have lived with this for years.  I was not a bit surprised, God help the poor creatures, at the news of last night's bombings.  I have been expecting it for years.  I cannot understand why anyone is surprised.</P>
    <P>If this legislation is necessary, why did we not have it three years ago? Why had all these events to develop and why had the bombs to go off before this legislation came before us?</P>
    <P>I speak for my party when I say that we are in support of all Government measures in favour of the security of the State because, as Senator Quinlan said, the people who planted those bombs deprived people of their lives and liberties and we must be completely dedicated to the proposition that these people must be destroyed, oppressed and repressed, killed, violated, any word you want to use. <Col N="1162" /> We have no future whatever unless we realise that this threat has got to be destroyed and repulsed.  We are not going to have much of a future if the party in power do not consult us in Opposition when dealing with a situation of this kind.</P>
    <P>I have always had the difficulty of being an Opposition Senator.  I have always had this difficulty because fundamentally I am an Irish supporter. When people talk to me about it I always try to explain my position by saying that there are certain fundamental matters upon which the Government and Opposition always agree.  The Government have behaved badly in relation to this because they presumed on our agreement and they tried to split us.  Thank God they failed.  It has been a miserable performance because we should all be together in relation to this matter.</P>
    <P>I support what the leader of my party in the Seanad said in relation to this Bill.  I dislike an enormous amount of the language in it.  It exposes a lot of people to proving their innocence where they would not be required to do so in normal situations.  I am in a situation in which I would be guilty of an offence under this Bill.  As Senator O'Higgins has said, it is important to reconcile the two traditions which we are glad to stand over in this party, the traditions of establishing and supporting whoever may be the person charged with enforcing the laws of this State. They have generally been our opponents.  That has not diminished our support for the enforcement of these laws.  This is an important point. Are there many parties in different parts of the world of whom it could be said that they have gone in support of the enforcement of the laws by their opponents for over 40 years.</P>
    <P>It is also a party very concerned about individual liberty.  I am distressed by the terms of the Bill.  One hour's conversation between intelligent people and the Bill could have been put into a form which would have been quite acceptable to all.  It is important that it should be acceptable to everybody if it is to be enforceable against everybody. It should be sensed to be just but it is not.  We are not going to get <Col N="1163" /> amendments and on balance in that situation I am not going to oppose it.</P>

      <P>I do not intend speaking in detail on the Bill as the legal approach has been very well put.  Like Senator Brosnahan I think it is a time for not sitting on the fence, it is a time for no middle of the road.  I want to be counted as opposing this Bill.  I find every section and every aspect repugnant.  I may have been more fortunate than some Members of this House in that I was born in one of the few generations in the history of this country that did not until now experience violence.  We had a peaceful life which we want for future generations. Suddenly within the past three years we are involved in a very violent situation which has escalated.</P>
      <P>Like Senator Alexis FitzGerald, though I was deeply shocked by the events of last night, I cannot say I was surprised.  We felt it was coming and it has come.  There is also the violence of removing our liberty.  I find this in the Bill and that is my reason for opposing it.  Senator Quinlan appealed to the Labour Party in a very sincere way, as he saw it.  I should like to assure Senator Quinlan and the House that the decision of the Labour Party to oppose this Bill was not taken without deep consideration of the situation in the country and of the citizens, not just in this part, but in the whole island.  We arrived at a unanimous decision and I expect Senator Quinlan to respect our decision, and I feel sure he does.  He instanced our attitude to the EEC and said we accepted the decision of the people which is right because we believe in democracy.  We will continue to act as the watch-dog and this is perhaps what I have been elected with my colleagues here to do.  I ask him to respect our views as being arrived at not lightly but after very full consideration of our position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I greatly regret the attack by the Leader of the House on the trade unions during this debate.  There is a great difference between what he stated and the statement of the Minister in his opening speech.  Senator Ó Maoláin went much further and he cemented <Col N="1164" /> my basic fears regarding this Bill when he stated that so far as he was concerned if this Bill was not adequate they would come back for more repressive legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Owens</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not misinterpret him.  What we may expect at a future date is an extension of what are illegal organisations.  The trade union movement has been outstanding in maintaining non-violence both North and South.  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions, through their North of Ireland Committee, have gone to great trouble to maintain a united congress and trade union movement. It is not the better-off people who are suffering most of the violence: it is the workers in Belfast.  Last night two workers were killed in Dublin.</P>
      <P>It ill-becomes the Leader of the Seanad to attack the Trade Union Congress.  In future perhaps anybody who raises a voice in opposition is to be treated as a criminal and made to suffer the penalties of the Bill.  I have made my statement, been counted and I thank the House.</P>

      <P>Senator Alexis FitzGerald could have been living in my mind for the past few days, so clearly did he outline my views.  In respect of measures of this kind there is an onus on every Member to place on the record of the House their own views. Like Senator Owens I too have, so far, lived apart from violence.  I have every hope that I may, with the rest of the people in this part of the country, continue to live in that way. The events of last night in the city shocked me and I hope and pray that whoever was responsible has not indicated a commencement of violence in this part of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1165" /> Like Senator FitzGerald I am amazed that it took so long for violence to reach the streets of Dublin in view of events in the North over the past few years.  I have been consistently surprised at the lack of Government action over the last number of years, not to counteract that because it was not here in a physical form, but to take steps to ensure that it would not arise.  If measures are necessary and must be taken why was there a gestation period of three years?</P>
    <P>Senator Alexis FitzGerald said the Government may expect total support of all Government measures from his party.  I am sure the Senator would accept my suggestion that he, in fact, meant total support of all reasonable and responsible Government measures that are necessary to deal with any situation such as this.</P>
    <P>We were told earlier by the Leader of the House that this Bill was designed to save us from events similar to those happening in the North of Ireland.  I greatly fear that this Bill, instead of being a preventative measure, may become the actual agent whereby violence will arise in this part of the country.  I incline to the belief that if one goes too far in an effort to control any activity which is felt to be illegal, the situation can occur where illegal activity not only continues but grows in volume and becomes more bitter in outlook from being driven completely underground.</P>
    <P>I experienced a slight by-product of that feeling this week.  While attending a parliamentary party meeting in this House which went on into the early hours of the morning a threatening phone call was received at my home. The threat was not directed at me.  The person who took the call was requested to pass on a message to me which I in turn, was to pass on to a prominent member of the front bench of my political party in the Dáil.  The message was that if he was not prepared to vote against this Bill his wife, family and himself would be assassinated. It is important that this should be said.  There we see the by-product that can come from a measure such as this.</P>

      <P>I feel an obligation to support any attempt to control their activities.  Senator Ó Maoláin referred to a climate being created in this part of the country by those two wings of the IRA.  He suggested that was why this Bill was necessary.  I am not sure that climate was being created up to the present but if so it is only fair to say that climate was bred by the Fianna Fáil Party.  They must be prepared to accept a heavy share of the responsibility for any such climate.  The speech of a former Minister in the Dáil yesterday demonstrates very clearly what has been stated time and time again by the Opposition parties in the past few years: the Provisional IRA is the nurse child of Fianna Fáil.  Let nobody on that side of the House deny it.  The truth has now emerged and is on the record of the Dáil.  We were told quite clearly the IRA were the bedfellows of the present Fianna Fáil Party.  That party only decided to deal with them when they discovered their bedfellow had grown fangs and become too big to handle.  It was no <Col N="1167" /> longer prepared to take instructions from its founding parent organisation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to refer to the contribution made by Senator Nash where he pointed out to the House that he was a practising lawyer.  That is why the remark was made.  I still hold it is true.  I am not a lawyer.  I do not understand the law to that degree.  When Senator Nash can tell this House that it was impossible to secure convictions against persons who mounted pickets on the district courts, I, without legal knowledge or training, must express surprise because I can recall in the last month or six weeks reading a report in the daily Press of a district justice who called into his court persons who were picketing outside that court and he either threatened to convict them for contempt of court or did in fact fine those picketers for being in contempt of his court.</P>
      <P>Senator Nash quoted from another piece of legislation which he said was the appropriate one and which he pointed out was obviously not effective in dealing with that situation. I mention it now because I would genuinely appreciate if the Minister would deal in his reply with the point I have made</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsection (2) of section 3 is abhorrent. I am expressing a personal opinion.  I find objection to it.  I find <Col N="1171" /> the subsection very hard to stomach. I cannot understand why any person, qualified or otherwise, should be allowed to place his belief before a court and that belief is to be treated as evidence.  I cannot see the correctness of that procedure unless the person who is affected by that belief is entitled to place counter evidence on his own behalf which would obviously be to the contrary.</P>
    <P>I am also concerned that in this Bill there is no provision for a time limit.  While Senator Owens and myself and other Members of this House may be very young we could see our children as adults still living in a country where this Bill was in operation and could be used.  This Bill has been admitted by everybody to have been necessitated by the situation of the day.  If that is accepted then, logically, contained within it there should be provision for its suspension when its authors feel it is no longer necessary.</P>
    <P>Like Senator Fitzgerald, I have no real objection to legislation being introduced in times of emergency or national crisis which is said to be necessary to maintain the right of the majority of the people to live freely and fully and without let or hindrance. Any democracy needs some form of legislation like that which can be implemented if situations arise.  There is no point in any of us suggesting that we can live fully and freely in a democracy without any fear that the political climate of that democracy may change unless there are safeguards to ensure that it does not.  This is why every democracy and every Minister for Justice needs that legislation and needs whatever special police force may be necessary to ensure that democracy continues to thrive.  One is a necessary adjunct to the other.</P>
    <P>My objection to this Bill is that the controls the Minister is seeking are, in certain aspects, excessive.  In view of the situation which manifested itself last night in such a dreadful way, perhaps the Minister will be able to justify to the House why he feels those sections which many of us feel to be excessive are considered necessary.  Not <Col N="1172" /> only this House but the whole country would be extremely interested in his answers.</P>

      <P>My job in replying to this debate has been made very much lighter and easier by the speeches I have heard here tonight, particularly those of Senator Nash, Senator Ó Maoláin, Senator Brosnahan and Senator Quinlan.  They have put across both the need for and the meaning of this Bill more learnedly and more eloquently than I could hope to do.</P>
      <P>I do not propose, at this stage, to go into any minute details on particular provisions contained in sections because, as we are going to take the Committee Stage immediately, it would be repetitive.  I had hoped that current events would have impressed on all Members of the Seanad the necessity for our giving greater freedom and greater powers to the Garda, on behalf of all our people, to try to counteract subversive organisations and the activities of people whose criminal tendency is such that they put the institutions of State at risk. Neither this Bill nor any other Bill can be any guarantee against crime but this Bill will strengthen the hands of the Garda Síochána in their efforts to deal with serious crime.</P>
      <P>As I have already said, I thought that events would have impressed on all Senators the necessity for this legislation. Indeed, it may be said that it impressed it on the vast majority of Senators but not on all.  We had the debate used, in some instances, for purely and very obviously political matters.  I might be excused if I make some reference to the politics of today and yesterday and tomorrow rather than to the politics of 30, 40 and 50 years ago that we heard so much about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What struck me most forcibly during the last week or so was the courage of Deputy Liam Cosgrave.  It has been referred to already tonight on both sides of the House.  As against his courage, I have to look on the position at very close range of certain members of the Fine Gael Party during the last couple of days.  After I introduced this <Col N="1173" /> Bill in the Dáil a speech in what I can only call the most extravagant terms was made immediately afterwards by Deputy Cooney.</P>

The condemnation of this Bill by the Deputy, on behalf of the Fine Gael Party, to the effect that it was beyond amendment and that there was no good in it was followed by the speech of Deputy Cosgrave which repudiated every line of what his spokesman on Justice had said.  If I had gone into Dáil Éireann and made a speech on an important matter relating to the security of this country and if I was followed by the leader of my party, Deputy Jack Lynch, who repudiated every word I said, I would resign.</P>

      <P>In view of Senator Boland's learned contribution when he quoted from statements made by Deputy Blaney in another place yesterday, I thought it rather incomplete of Senator Boland not to continue and quote what the Taoiseach had to say last night in relation to it.  The Taoiseach pointed out, as I now point out to this House, that what was said yesterday in the Dáil by Deputy Blaney was the direct opposite of what he said there in May, 1970.  At that time Deputy Blaney said that he had nothing good, bad or indifferent to do with the IRA or with the founding of it or anything else in connection with it.  As far as I can see, a man who within a space of two years, talking about the same event, says the direct opposite in relation to it can only be a liar.  I do not know which of his statements is a lie, but one of them has to be a lie, and that is the value of what Deputy Blaney had to say yesterday.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not clear whether a motion in Senator Robinson's name is still before the House.  It was not referred to afterwards by other Senators but in order to keep the record right I should like to say that when the Senator suggested that the Taoiseach might avail himself of the provisions of Article 24 of the Constitution, she seemed to suggest that there was some obligation on him to do that, or that he would have acted more correctly if he had done that.  There is, of course, no such obligation on him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach did not send any message to the Seanad under the Constitution which would have compelled them to meet.  He assumed rightly <Col N="1176" /> that the Seanad would be anxious to meet as soon as possible in these circumstances.  The Seanad met of their own volition, acting under the discretion of the Cathaoirleach.  As a non-Member, I am not concerned with the meeting of the Seanad, but as a member of the Government it is obvious why the Taoiseach would assume that the Seanad would wish to meet in these circumstances.  His assumption on this point has been borne out by the largest attendance that I have ever seen in the Seanad, notwithstanding the inconvenience of the day and of the hour.</P>
    <P>There were several detailed points made during the course of this debate which I do not think are worth while dealing with in detail now, if they are going to be raised on the Committee Stage which, I presume, will follow immediately afterwards.  However, there was one point &mdash; although I am not certain if I really have to reply to it, as it was replied to very ably by Senator Nash &mdash; which was raised by Senator O'Higgins.  Senator O'Higgins professed inability to see any great difference between section 52 of the Offences Against the State Act, 1939, and section 2 of this Bill. If the Senator compares the two of them, he will see a very considerable difference between them.  Section 52 relates only to persons who are definitely suspected and already under arrest under section 30, and they are persons who have been under arrest for up to 48 hours.  However, there is no suggestion in section 2 of the Bill that a crime had been committed by the particular person being questioned &mdash;it may have been committed by anyone but the gardaí need to question persons found anywhere in the vicinity of it.  Section 2 sets out in some detail a long list of prerequisites before the section is applicable and therefore before a conviction could be obtained under it for refusal to answer.  As the Taoiseach mentioned in the other House and I think was referred to by Senator Nash, the reason is not a question of whether or not I like section 52 or that I or the gardaí want to use it; we have simply been told that we cannot and that it is clearly and flagrantly in breach of <Col N="1177" /> Article 6 of the European Convention of Human Rights.  With equal certainty I have been told that section 2 here is not in breach of Article 6.</P>
    <P>It is also worth pointing out that section 52 is in operation only when Part V is in operation.  A question of its possible use, therefore, did not arise until the end of May, 1972.  In view of the fact that a number of Senators spoke about the necessity for a time limit in relation to some of the powers contained in this Bill, it is worth pointing out to Senators that there is a definite restriction as to the time at which section 2 can be used, by virtue of the fact that it can only be used in connection with scheduled offences.  Offences can be scheduled under Part V only when Part V is in operation.  This is the restriction as to time of use which I introduced last night by way of amendment in the Dáil in regard to subsection (2) of section 3.  Subsection (1) of section 3 scarcely calls for any sort of limitation. I do not see that any reasonable objection can be made to it, and that was acknowledged by Senator O'Higgins and others.  It simply spells out the power of the court to draw inferences from certain things. That power at the moment was very doubtful whether inferences could be drawn from certain things, but no injustice can be done to any man by drawing inferences from his conduct over a period, and I see no reason why that should not be part of our permanent law.</P>
    <P>Likewise, section 4 is simply a reenactment in statutory form as near or as accurately as the legal draftsman can express it of what is already in the existing law with regard to contempt of court.  With this difference, in order to achieve what we want&mdash;and this brings me to a point that was raised by Senator Boland&mdash;the existing law on contempt of court is now expressed by section 4 of this Bill in statutory form for the purpose of creating a statutory offence.  The purpose of doing that is to give the gardaí power to initiate proceedings, and accordingly to arrest and charge people as appropriate.</P>
    <P>I am afraid that Senator Boland has <Col N="1178" /> fallen into the difficulty of thinking that up to now contempt of court has been a criminal offence for which a conviction could be obtained.  He referred to somebody being brought before a district court for contempt and getting a month's imprisonment or a fine.  That is not a conviction : it is not a criminal offence at all.  It is a civil act of disobedience to the court or a civil affront to the court.  The Garda or the Attorney General have no power at the moment to initiate action against somebody who commits contempt of court or who, in the corresponding words of the section, interferes with the course of justice.  It put the Garda at a great disadvantage.</P>
    <P>Indeed, it was a disedifying public spectacle that outside many courthouses during the last year or two we have had parades of people who sought to interfere with the course of justice; who sought to intimidate the court, the jurors, the witnesses and the parties to a case in the way that they felt that that case should go.  It was not possible for the Garda to do anything about it unless the court directed them to go out and arrest a person or persons and this, to say the least of it, was a frustration and an annoyance to the Garda. It probably was in some way the cause of public scandal because it led ordinary citizens, for example Senator Boland, to believe that the Garda were not bothering to do anything about it.  Frequently the courts were not bothered doing anything about it because they were often unaware of it, and where they were aware of it they took the reasonable attitude that they were not going to be influenced by a crowd of &ldquo;scruff&rdquo; marching up and down outside the courts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley </NameTxt>
      <P>They will no longer be intimidated because under section 4 the Garda will be in a position to <Col N="1179" /> arrest these people or arrest as many of them as will be physically possible at any one time and to charge them with an offence after this Bill becomes law.  This is so obviously an inimical activity towards the institutions of the State and it would always be so irrespective of the state of the country.  I see no reason for any sort of time limit on this Bill.  Section 5 is purely a definition section to extend the existing definition of document.</P>
      <P>In general, the powers sought in this Bill by comparison with the powers existing for 33 years in the 1939 Act are but a pale shadow of some of the things which the 1939 Act does and, I have been advised, and the police have also been advised, that the 1939 Act was drafted in less sophisticated circumstances than exists today and clearly some of the sections&mdash;section 52 and there may well be several others&mdash;are clearly in breach of the Convention of Human Rights.</P>
      <P>It has been suggested to me here, I think, and it certainly was in the Dáil, that I should detail why we have run into difficulty with certain sections. I did that in the Dáil in relation to some sections in December, 1971, and was not thanked for it because I discovered that my exposition was read by some people who made good use of it afterwards when either they or their clients were prosecuted under those sections.  For that reason I am not going to go into any detail in relation to any particular section.  I want the House to understand that it is not my judgment of what is defective in the present law or what is necessary in this Bill that causes the precise matters that are dealt with in this Bill; it is the view and experience of those whose everyday work brings them up against these difficulties.</P>
      <P>It is my duty to ask the Oireachtas to give the Garda and those who have to enforce the law in this country the necessary powers to do it within reason.  The powers set out in this Bill are reasonable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I did not get the opportunity since the recent events in the vicinity of this House to say that it should be <Col N="1180" /> a cause of concern to every Member of the Oireachtas and to every reasonable citizen that on at least one night during this week more than 1,000 members of the Garda Síochána and 100 or more armed members of our Army had to surround this building to enable these two Houses to perform their functions.  In the course of their defence of these Houses several members of the Garda Síochána were injured.  They received injuries like getting a bottle in the eye which can leave a man maimed for life.  The Garda Síochána acted bravely on that occasion and were there for many long hours in unpleasant conditions in order that democracy would survive. When a prisoner in custody had to be guarded by members of the Garda Síochána within the past week they acted more than bravely in keeping him in their custody notwithstanding an attack in, of all places, a hospital containing 532 patients.  They themselves were proud of the way that attack was beaten off.  We are all entitled to be proud of it.</P>
    <P>It is our duty to give them whatever assistance that we, as legislators, can give them in order to enable them to do the difficult and dangerous work which they do on behalf of all of us.</P>

    <P>(a)  has reasonable grounds for believing that an offence which is for the time being a scheduled offence for the purposes of Part V of the Act of 1939 is being or was committed at any place,</P>
    <P>(b)  has reasonable grounds for believing that any person whom he finds at or near the place at the time of the commission of the offence or soon afterwards knows, or knew at that time, of its commission, and</P>
    <P>(c)  informs the person of his belief as aforesaid,</P>
    <P>the member may demand of the person his name and address and an account of his recent movements and, if the person fails or refuses to give the information or gives information that is false or misleading, he shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £200 or, at the discretion of the court, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding twelve months or to both such fine and such imprisonment.</P>
    <P>The problem here, as with many other sections of the Bill, is that it raises a conflict between the protection of the individual and the interests of maintaining <Col N="1184" /> law and order as has been described by the Minister and also the securing of convictions of persons.</P>
    <P>The Constitution, under Article 40, guarantees that a person shall not be deprived of his liberty save in accordance with law.  I agree with a statement of a very well-known American constitutional judge, Mr. Justice Frankfurter, in a case in 1943 when he said: &ldquo;The history of liberty has largely been the history of observance of procedural safeguards&rdquo;.  These procedural safeguards are conspicuous by their absence in this Bill.  It is necessary to ensure that in the political climate in which this Bill is being debated, and with the very real tension in the country, we do not neglect the vital question of writing in procedural safeguards to protect the individual.</P>
    <P>I should like to make one comment, and I make it in the absence of the Senator concerned, that is I was very saddened that Senator Alexis FitzGerald did not see the necessity of processing this Bill even in the very short time we have and of looking at the sections with even more vigilance because of the very short time and the responsibility on Senators to make sure that the safeguards are written in. I propose to explain the reason behind this amendment and to try to convince Senators that the amendment, although not perfectly drafted&mdash;I am prepared to amend the draft&mdash;is necessary and compares with the sort of protection of another jurisdiction which in this area has very similar laws and a very similar desire to protect individual liberty as we have.</P>
    <P>The question of the liberty of the individual in Article 40 of the Constitution that no person should be deprived of his liberty save in accordance with law gives rise to what is meant by &ldquo;in accordance with law&rdquo;.  I want to look first at the way in which a similar provision of the American Constitution &mdash;that:</P>
    <P>No person shall be deprived of his life, liberty or property save by due process of law.</P>
    <P>&mdash;has been interpreted to give the sort of protection which this amendment would try to introduce into this Bill.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1185" /> The requirements of due process are that the person will get a fair hearing. Here I must disagree very strongly with some of the comments made by Senator Nash when he spoke about the fact that in civil law systems a person is very often forced to answer questions and explain his position.</P>
    <P>The civil law systems work under an inquisitorial system.  They do not have, as we have here and in the United States, an accusatory system.  You cannot compare them in the way in which Senator Nash did and forget that in the civil law system there are other built-in protections of individual liberty.  You cannot take the fact that questions may be asked of the accused under the inquisitorial system and try to introduce it into the accusatorial system.  It was a very weak argument on Senator Nash's part and one with which we need not concern ourselves.  We are trying to maintain in this country the accusatory system to balance the conflicts of society and, at the same time, protect the individual.  The requirements therefore of due process and the essentials of fair procedure are that there be a fair accusatory system; that there be jurisdiction over the defendant; that there is some connection between the defendant and the legal unit, that is, that he be in some cases physically present, or domiciled, in some cases citizenship and so on.  He should be given reasonable notice of the proceedings in order that he may prepare his defence.  He should be given a hearing. Some sort of trial is essential.  He must have a fair tribunal, an unbiased judge and a fair jury.  There should be no trial by newspaper or by the media.  A prosecutor must act within reasonable limits in prosecuting.  He must present the prosecution case fairly and not in such an emotional manner as to distort the trial.</P>
    <P>I now come to the relevant part of the essence of due process of these criteria, which is that in recent cases in the United States there has been the extension of the meaning of due process to include the right to legal assistance. This was established in earlier cases, in Gideon and Wainright in 1963.  It was also established that a person has a right to counsel when they <Col N="1186" /> are being interrogated in a police station.  It was established in a case the following year, Escubedo v. Illinois, in 1964.  I should like to quote from the case of Miranda v. the State of Arizona in 1966, where the question of the rights and position of the individual when faced with the process of law was considered.  It was considered by the chief justice of the court at that time, Chief Justice Warren.  I am quoting from the <i>Cases on Constitutional Law</i>, by Freund, Sutherland, Howe and Browne, at page 1417.  Quoting from the judgment of the Supreme Court, Chief Justice Warren said:</P>
    <P>Over 70 years ago our predecessors on this court eloquently stated the maxim <i>Nemo tenitur se ipsum accusare</i> had its origin in a protest against the inquisitorial and manifestly unjust methods of interrogating accused persons which has long obtained in the continental system and, until the expulsion of the Stuarts from the British throne in 1688 and the erection of additional barriers for the protection of the people against the exercise of arbitrary power, was not uncommon even in England.  While the admissions or confessions of the prisoner when voluntarily and freely made have always ranked high in the scale of incriminating evidence, if an accused person be asked to explain his apparent connection with a crime under investigation, the ease with which the questions put to him may assume an inquisitorial character, the temptation to press the witness unduly, to browbeat him if he be timid or reluctant, to push him into a corner and to entrap him into fatal contradictions which is so painfully evidenced in many of these earlier cases made the system so odious as to give rise for a demand&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I will translate.  It means, in English, that in the United States, as a result of the interpretation of the Constitution and through the case law of the Supreme Court, that an individual is entitled to his lawyer when he is being interrogated in the police station.  He is entitled to his lawyer in court.  If he is too poor to afford the services of a lawyer he is given a lawyer under legal aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I am saying here is that when we give the Garda Síochána the right to ask the name and address and an account of the conduct of a person who is found in a particular place by that member of the Garda, that person should be entitled to the presence of a lawyer before giving this information. There is a principle against self-incrimination. This principle is written into the United States Constitution. At the same time, it can be inferred from the protection which our courts give to the personal rights of citizens. I intend to take the time to argue the case from the Irish Courts of the principle against self-incrimination&mdash; that a person will not be obliged in answering a question to incriminate himself.  This could happen in these circumstances where an individual was in a vicinity where the member of the Garda believed that a scheduled offence under the 1939 Act had taken place.  That person could be involved in some other unlawful <Col N="1188" /> activity&mdash;for example, he might have attempted to burgle the next door house.  If the person must give an account of his activity he is incriminating himself.  The law has always been very careful to protect the individual from incriminating himself.</P>

      <P>The Senator might have been visiting a lady not his wife and he might not have wished to disclose what he had been doing over the period in question.  In those circumstances, happily, as the law stands at the moment the Senator could remain quiet without incurring the odium of the criminal law.  This type of provision in section 2 is dangerous in that it can lead a person to incriminate himself by answering the personal questions asked by a member of the Garda, which will give rise to a problem of self incrimination. If he refuses to answer those questions he will be guilty of the offence provided for in section 2.</P>
      <P>In recent Irish case law the tendency has been for the courts to protect what are called the personal rights of the citizen.  I am concerned that it would appear here that one of the personal rights of the citizen, the right to remain private, the right not to have to account for his whereabouts and possibly incriminate himself in doing so, may be infringed by this provision.  We should all be very concerned about the dangers inherent in giving this power.  The courts have used another section, Article 40, section 3 (1) which reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The State guarantees in its laws to respect and, as far as practicable <Col N="1189" /> by its laws, to defend and vindicate the personal rights of the citizen.</P>
    <P>In trying to establish what are the personal rights of the citizen it was stated by Mr. Justice Kenny, in the fluoridation case where a woman was challenging the invasion of her family rights by putting fluoride in the Dublin water supply, that there are personal rights of the citizens which the courts will protect.  They will declare that legislation is unconstitutional if these rights are invaded.  These go beyond the specific rights mentioned in the Constitution.  He gave two instances of where it goes beyond them.  The right to travel around the country is not written into the Constitution but we all accept it as the personal right of the citizen.  He mentioned also the right to marry.  This is not written into the Constitution but we all accept it as being one of the personal rights of the citizen. I would say that another of those rights could be the right to remain silent or at least the protection of legal advice if one is making statements which may be incriminating and the refusal to make them being itself a criminal offence.</P>
    <P>I should like to emphasise the necessity for the House, however late the hour and however tired we may be, to listen to the arguments and to examine the provisions thoroughly. Exactly two years ago to the month the two Houses of the Oireachtas passed a Bill giving powers to the Committee of Public Accounts to inquire into the use of £100,000 of public money.  Because they passed that Bill without sufficient consideration it was declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court within a few months of its enactment.  We do not want the same thing to happen to the Offences against the State Bill.  I believe that there are parts of this Bill which are unconstitutional.  If we are to pass it in a hurry, at least we should implement the procedure under Article 26 of the Constitution and the President should refer this Bill to the Supreme Court.  I do not think that either House of Parliament has scrutinised it sufficiently.  I believe that the powers contained in it are too broad, they are potentially unconstitutional&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Senator <Col N="1190" /> is again moving to a general point that might be more appropriate on Fifth Stage.  It is not appropriate on the discussion on an amendment in which the arguments should be related to the net issue of the amendment.</P>

      <P>I find some difficulty in that when I submit the point I wish to make I become rather technical and, therefore, rather boring.  I have not got the great capacity of Senator Alexis FitzGerald, which I admire very much, to put his attention to the Bill and, if necessary, be boring.  I find myself in difficulties in going on at considerable length in the knowledge that people are tired and that it is a late hour on a Saturday evening.  Nevertheless, there are very important points to be made on the Bill and on each section of it.</P>
      <P>The Irish courts are concerned to protect the individual.  They may find that section 2 of the Bill goes beyond the police powers which are tolerable in the State in view of the constitutional protection of personal rights. Therefore, in moving this amendment I realise that the wording of it is not at all perfect but the idea is a valid one.  If a person is to be asked to account for his movements, with the possibility of having committed a criminal offence if he refuses, the person ought to have a right to have his lawyer present while he is making these statements because of the very broad wording of the section.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>In seconding this amendment, I should like to make one brief point arising from the obvious impatience on the other side of the House.  For my part&mdash;and I am sure I speak here for Senator Robinson also&mdash;the act of putting down this amendment, or, indeed, any amendment, has nothing to do with a desire to filibuster.  I yield to nobody, and I am sure Senator Robinson agrees with me, in my abhorrence of forms of violence with which this section of the Bill is intended to deal.  It is a very sad state of affairs that, in a country such as Ireland, one should have to make such an explicit avowal.  Everybody in this country who is in possession of <Col N="1191" /> his senses is against the type of activities with which this Bill is intended to deal.</P>
      <P>On the amendment, I would agree with and support wholeheartedly the spirit in which Senator Robinson has proposed it.  I agree with her that, perhaps, the wording could be improved. Its basic effect is to counterbalance the restriction on the rights of the individual which is contained in the section, as it stands, with a proviso that may or may not have the effect of protecting a person arrested under this section but which would definitely improve his rights somewhat. Law is becoming more complex every day.  As law becomes more complex, it becomes more and more important to safeguard the rights of ordinary people who have to cope with the law.  They may find themselves in the situation in which, through no fault of their own, they are, or appear to be, on the wrong side of the law.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, it seems at present that in a situation in which law is becoming more and more complex the people whose duty it is to enforce the law are usually in possession of far more information about the law than the people against whom the law is enforced.  The classic example of this is the yellow card issued to members of the crown forces in Northern Ireland giving instructions as to when fire may be opened and when fire may not be opened.  The unfortunate people who may be at the receiving end of the action carried out on foot of this instruction are not at all as well equipped to understand their rights, in a tense and dangerous situation in which conflicts arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would hate to see the situation develop where, in order to protect individual freedom, ordinary people would find it necessary to carry around little pieces of paper or cards reminding them of their rights in situations in which they may be put under arrest or questioned by members of the Garda Síochána, for the only reason that their rights have been so constricted by legislation that they cannot possibly memorise them all and need some convenient form of <i>aide memoire</i> to help <Col N="1192" /> them.  I do not think we are in that situation now.  I see the section, as unamended, as tending towards this situation; it extends the law relating to individual rights without providing the slightest counterbalance in favour of the individual citizen.  I know that the Minister is not completely closed to this point of view, and that he is well aware of the very serious implications of the growing complexity of law generally, and more especially of the law relating to personal freedom of individuals.</P>
    <P>For example, the Minister has to my knowledge, unless I am misquoting him, spoken with some approval of the new free legal advice centres which have been set up in different parts of the country.  As far as I understand the situation, he has even to consider favourably making Government money available to such centres, provided they can show evidence that they are a truly national service.  This is the spirit in which this amendment is proposed, and it is the spirit in which I hope the Minister will accept it, or a version of it.</P>

I do not like being here on a Saturday night any more than Senator Ó Maoláin; I do not like being away from my baby daughter on a Saturday night, and I had other arrangements I would rather attend.</P>
      <P>I still believe it is the duty of Senators present to pay very close attention to the terms of this Bill.  It is a piece of emergency legislation, because of the emergency conditions under which it is being steamrolled through the House.  I have made the point and I should like to see the safeguards for emergency legislation where it would only last for a certain period, unless both Houses of Parliament voted for it to continue.  To suggest that we are either trespassing on this House or that we are abusing the procedure, or that we are deliberately staging a filibuster is to add even more steamrolling to what has already been done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take grave exception to the suggestion that we are abusing our position as Senators.  We are doing what we were elected for, and we shall continue <Col N="1194" /> to do what we were elected for.

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Robinson dealt at some length with the history of liberty.  It is true that the liberty of the citizen can be undermined by the excessive demand for power by the State.  On the other hand, there is another way in which the liberty of the citizen can be undermined, and that is by the failure on the part of the State to take adequate powers to deal with difficult situations.  One situation is just as bad as the other.  It is the duty of the State to take adequate powers to protect institutions and to ensure that citizens are protected against subversion and violence.  One must weigh up one situation against the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Robinson has made some interesting references to procedure in court, again to ensure that the citizen is protected.  She was talking about normal times; normal times are quite different.  The procedure that would be proper in normal times is one thing; procedure that would be appropriate in unusual times is quite another one. We are talking about very dangerous situations, very abnormal times.  We are talking about a piece of legislation which has been brought in because of these difficult times.  There is no mistake about it and no pretence that it is anything other than an unusual piece of legislation which asks for rather <Col N="1195" /> far-reaching powers that would not be asked for in normal circumstances. Consequently, it is a completely different thing.  We must, therefore, think of this Bill on the basis that it is asking for unusual powers because of an unusual situation.</P>
    <P>Apart from that, even if it was not an unusual Bill and an unusual situation, the amendment with which we are dealing asks for powers which are not at all unusual.  In many quite mundane Acts in the statute book, such as the Road Traffic Act and the Road Transport Act, and several other Acts of that kind, the Garda have power to ask for a person's name and address and a limited number of factual details, which enable them to decide whether or not an offence has been committed or is likely to have been committed.  Certainly, to ask somebody for his name and address, and that he should have to get legal advice to answer that kind of a question is really quite ludicrous.</P>

      <P>A person who has to get legal advice as to which of his names he should give does not require much sympathy from us.  It is, therefore, going much too far to suggest that this is a serious inroad on the liberty of the citizen by asking him for his name and address and his movements during a short period beforehand, and to suggest that he should have a legal adviser before he answers that.  The next suggestion is that he will probably be required to have a spiritual adviser as well before he answers these questions.</P>

I appreciate the reasoned way in which he is continuing this debate, but I fear that anybody who rises to his feet to discuss this Bill is in danger of being tainted with either supporting violence or of being a member of an unlawful organisation. I resent that sort of suggestion.  The Senator has said&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I was referring to an inference which could be drawn from the Minister asking why I did not go to the Mater Hospital?  I am here tonight as a Senator debating the legislation which we propose to put on the statute books.  Senator E. Ryan said that these are unusual times.  I would like to refer to the proper attitude of Senators and lawyers and responsible citizens of the State in unusual times.  We should be particularly careful not to limit individual rights, as a response to acts of violence. Such a response could be one of fear and a desire to introduce repression, and to meet violence with another sort of violence.</P>
      <P>At a time such as this when there is a crisis in the country we must be concerned, in talking about due process and about the protection of the individual.  I would like to quote from Mr. Justice Frankfurter in a case in 1951.  It is a relevant quotation, as it underlines the principle under which we operate&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>The requirement of due process is not a fairweather or timid assurance. It must be respected in periods of calm and in time of trouble.  It protects aliens as well as citizens but due process, unlike some legal rules, is not a technical conception with a fixed content unrelated to time, place and circumstances expressing as it does in its ultimate analysis respect enforced by law for that feeling of just treatment which has been evolved through centuries of Anglo-American constitutional history and civilisation.  Due process cannot be imprisoned within the textual limits of any formula representing a profound attitude of fairness between man and man and more particularly between the individual and Government.  Due process is compounded of history, reason, the past course of decisions and stout confidence in the strength of the democratic faith which we profess.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Due process is not a mechanical <Col N="1197" /> instrument or a yardstick.  It is a delicate process of adjustment inescapably involving the exercise of judgment by those whom the Constitution entrusted with the unfolding of the process.  In the Irish context, the Seanad is entrusted tonight with unfolding the process and with debating this Bill from the point of view of whether it has adequate safeguards for the individual.  I ask for the patience of the Seanad to make certain points and to put forward amendments.  This is a serious piece of legislation.  The issue has been clouded both in another place and in this House by outside events, and because of that there is a danger that we will allow ourselves to forget our responsibility as Senators and not examine the legislation before us as we are given the responsibility under the Constitution to do.</P>

      <P>First of all, I am saddened by the attitude taken towards Senators on this side of the House by Senator Robinson in dealing with this amendment.  She seems to be presenting a case that nobody on this side of the House has given this Bill any serious consideration and that nobody has scrutinised thoroughly this particular section of the Bill.  Tonight we are speaking in a situation where we are conscious of the need to have this Bill passed through the Oireachtas as speedily as possible but at the same time I would remind Senator Robinson that we had this Bill before us during the week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am speaking as a Member of the major Parliamentary Party in this House.  This Parliamentary Party considered this Bill thoroughly.  Each section was subjected to scrutiny at a Party meeting and a unanimous decision was reached to support the passage of this Bill through the House. I would like Senator Robinson to be clear that Senators on this side of the House have given careful consideration to the serious matters contained in this Bill at a time when we were under no threat or emergency and at that time it had the unanimous backing of the Parliamentary Party on this side of the House.  It is sad that the attitude and integrity of this side <Col N="1198" /> of the House, in studying this piece of legislation, should be called into question in this way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not calling it into question.  I was asking for patience from that side of the House while we debate the point in the Seanad and are given time to do so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NevilleKeery" hpid="Mr. Keery Mr. Keery">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keery</NameTxt>
      <P>We are engaged in the process of debate and I would have more sympathy for the points being made, particularly in regard to this section, if I thought there was some substance in them.  I listened sympathetically to what Senator Robinson said and I read the amendment which was circulated.  I find it difficult to have any sympathy with her point of view.</P>
      <P>Senator Ryan raised the natural reply which Senator Robinson immediately conceded that the type of powers to question, which are in this section, are already in other legislation and that, indeed, in general terms the right of a person, who is subject to an accusation under the law to legal advice, and to consult a lawyer is never at question in the State.  When this Bill becomes law if a person is brought before the court under this section he will have the right in court to state any grievance or dissatisfaction he may have with the legal aid at his disposal.  This is the normal right of anybody brought before the court.  It is a matter which is subject to the scrutiny of the public and the press and, indeed, subject to the decision by the court, which makes the ultimate decision on the matter of justice involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the factual context in which we are considering this section.  There are no new threats to the rights of the individual.  In particular it seems to me that the remedial wording suggested by Senator Robinson is completely inappropriate and misguided. To say that such a person should have the right to request the presence of his legal adviser really boggles the mind, when we consider the way in which men dedicated to the overthrow of the State and the disruption of law and order could treat that particular suggested wording.  By the time a legal adviser would arrive for such a man a <Col N="1199" /> lot of water would have flowed under the bridge.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">

    <Speaker pid="NevilleKeery" hpid="Mr. Keery Mr. Keery">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keery</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the difficulty.  I want to make my position clear on this because there is a lot of woolly thinking in the matter of personal rights and liberties.  Liberals are classically the protectors of the rights of the individual.  The test of a liberal is if you feel like a liberal.  I feel like a liberal, but the difficulty of anybody who feels this way in the times in which we are living is that there are evil men in our society who are committed to the complete overthrow of that society and if you once recognise that fact and recognise that the majority of law-abiding, ordinary, decent citizens must be protected you immediately run into all sorts of practical difficulties in trying to assess a particular problem affecting particular individuals as this section will do.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that in this section a balance is struck between the rights of the accused individual and of the community as a whole to be protected, particularly when this section deals with an aspect of law which has, in Border areas, fallen into disrepute where we have had extensive coverage in the newspapers of men having ditched guns at the scene of an incident, walked away and laughed scornfully at the Garda Síochána.  This section deals with a menace which has brought the law into disrepute and that it does not interfer in any way with the liberty of individuals who may be questioned within an area where incidents may have occurred.</P>

He began by making a very reasonable case and one with which I agree in principle. This is an unusual situation and we are looking for unusual powers, rescinding for a moment from the question of whether these particular powers are adequate to meet the situation or are a form of overkill.</P>
      <P>Why did not Senator Ryan follow through and take the obvious consequence of indicating his acceptance of a time-limit on the operation of the whole Bill, and not just one subsection?</P>
      <P>I again support Senator Ryan when he stated it is somewhat extreme to expect anybody who is asked for his name and address to cry &ldquo;halt&rdquo; and send for a battery of solicitors or barristers.</P>

      <P>I accept the Senator's correction.  Both Senator Robinson and I have made it clear that our real problem regarding the section is not with the name and address but with the &ldquo;failure to give an account <Col N="1201" /> of one's movements&rdquo; part of it which opens the door to the possibility of self-incrimination.</P>
      <P>The other enactments to which Senator Ryan referred, in which the gardaí are entitled to ask for more than the name and address, are mostly connected with the Road Traffic Acts. The information which they are entitled to seek above and beyond the name and address, is very specific and delineated in the enactments concerned. This is a vague catch-all phrase which raises a small, but substantial, spectre in the area of personal freedoms.</P>
      <P>When Senator Robinson was making what I thought a very reasoned case about individual rights, she was interrupted briefly by the Minister who advised her to go to the Mater Hospital and explain to the people there what their rights were.  I should like to ask the Minister a question which I doubt he will be able to answer.  Why have no prosecutions been taken against the people who assembled outside the Mater Hospital, under section 9 of the Offences Against the State Act, 1939?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnNash" hpid="Mr. Nash Mr. Nash">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nash</NameTxt>
      <P>We are making a lot of ado about what is really very little to the law-abiding citizens of this State.  Article 40 of the Constitution states:</P>
      <P>No citizen shall be deprived of his personal liberties save in accordance with the law.</P>
      <P>We are having a very selective extract from the Constitution.  The same Article states:</P>
      <P>All citizens shall, as human persons, be held equal before the law.</P>
      <P>It also states:</P>
      <P>The State shall, in particular, by its laws protect as best it may from unjust attack and in the case of injustices done, vindicate the life, person, good name and property rights of every citizen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is exactly what this Bill is endeavouring to do.  The citizen is not just the man who is asked for his name and address and an account of his recent movements.  He is also the person <Col N="1202" /> who is shot at, maimed, frightened or has his property destroyed.</P>
    <P>Senator Robinson criticised me for mixing up the inquisitorial system and the accusatory system and stated that I gave a reference which refers to the inquisitorial system which has built-in protections for the citizen subsequently at the hearing.  I am not aware of one built-in protection for the citizen at the actual hearing in the European Courts that is not provided for in our system of hearing of criminal trials.</P>
    <P>Senator Robinson also took very astute selections in quoting from our Constitution which states: &ldquo;The citizen shall not be deprived of his rights save in accordance with law.&rdquo;  In other words any law which purports to deprive the citizen of his rights must be made by the Oireachtas.  That is what we are doing in order to comply with our obligations under the very Article of the Constitution from which she quoted:</P>
    <P>The State shall, in particular, by its laws protect as best it may from unjust attack and, in the case of injustice done, vindicate the life, person, good name, and property rights of every citizen.</P>
    <P>We are endeavouring to protect the lives and properties of all our citizens. Some people were maimed in this city one week ago and two other lives were unfortunately taken last night. While this is required by the Constitution we are told we must only protect the accused.  Most of Senator Robinson's quotations were taken from American law which states the &ldquo;due process of law&rdquo;.  She referred to a quotation from Chief Justice Warren back in the year 1689.  If we go back to 1691 and the Battle of the Boyne we get the nub of the whole problem.  That is where our difficulties all started.  Perhaps the Senator was much nearer to the actual roots of things than she realised.  She then stated, and I took a careful note: &ldquo;A person is entitled to a lawyer when interrogated in a police station.&rdquo;  Nobody is denying that.  The section to which she referred takes the place of a section on which the Government refused to act because the person <Col N="1203" /> could be interrogated only in a police station.</P>

      <P>Section 52 of the 1939 Act.  The Senator stated that if a man is asked for his name and address and an account of his movements in the recent past it is an infringement of his rights.  Senator Robinson went so far as to suggest it was unconstitutional. However, she can argue that in the Supreme Court some day.  Laws must be made to meet circumstances. In the Road Traffic Act, 1961, section 107 (1) provides:</P>
      <P>Where a member of the Garda Síochána alleges to a person using a mechanically propelled vehicle that the member suspects that such person has committed a specified offence under this Act, the member may demand of such person his name and address and may, if such person refuses or fails to give his name and address or gives a name or address which the member has reasonable grounds for believing to be false or misleading, arrest such person without warrant.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnNash" hpid="Mr. Nash Mr. Nash">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nash</NameTxt>
      <P>Subsection (4) of section 107 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961 states:</P>
      <P>Where a member of the Garda Síochána has reasonable grounds for believing that there has been an offence under the Act involving the use of a mechanically propelled vehicle&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(a)  the owner of the vehicle shall, if required, by the member state whether he was or was not actually <Col N="1204" /> using the vehicle at the material time and, if he fails to do so, shall be guilty of an offence,</P>
    <P>(b)  if the owner of the vehicle states that he was not actually using it at the material time, he shall give such information as he may be required by the member to give as to the identity of the person who was actually using it at that time and, if he fails to do so, shall be guilty of an offence unless he shows to the satisfaction of the court that he did not know and could not with reasonable diligence have ascertained who that person was,</P>
    <P>(c)  any person other than the owner of the vehicle shall, if required by the member, give any information which it is in his power to give and which may lead to the identification of the person who was actually using the vehicle at the material time and, if he fails to do so, shall be guilty of an offence.</P>
    <P>That was designed to meet a particular set of circumstances where you had fast moving traffic.  This Bill is designed to meet a particular set of circumstances where people have allocated to themselves the right to take human life, destroy people's property and set themselves up as an army.  In those circumstances a member of the Garda Síochána may demand from a person his name and address and an account of his recent movements. Surely any legislative body with a sense of responsibility, having regard to those facts, should not abrogate its responsibility to protect as is provided for in Article 40 of the Constitution to which I have referred from unjust attack and vindicate the life of the person and the property right of every citizen.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say a few words on this.  Senator Nash is not correct in his approach to it.  He is incorrect in assuming that the section which it is sought to amend in the manner proposed necessarily refers to a person who has been guilty of an offence.  The principal distinction between section 2 of this Bill and section 30 of the Offences Against the State Act of 1939 is that the latter <Col N="1205" /> section refers to a person who is a suspect whereas section 2 of the Bill before us refers to a person who, by reason of his proximity at a particular time, the member of the Garda Síochána has reasonable grounds for believing he knows or knew of the commission of an offence.  This does not necessarily imply that the person is in the position of being a suspect but merely that he was around at the time and the member of the Garda Síochána thinks he must know something about it.</P>
      <P>In those circumstances Senators Robinson and Horgan have put forward the suggestion that a person in that position should be afforded the opportunity of having consultations with his other legal advisers before being required to give the information. I do not think this amendment would solve the problem.  If this amendment were to be accepted by the Minister the result would be to drive the administration back to relying on the combined operations of sections 30 and 52 of the Act of 1939.  The point being put forward is that the person who is being interrogated here is not necessarily a suspect but somebody who, by reason of being in the vicinity, may have knowledge.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to be emotive about this but it is a section which empowers the authorities to require a person to inform with regard to any knowledge he may possess in connection with the commission of an offence.  My reason for saying this amendment would not provide the kind of safeguard which the proposers had hoped to achieve.  With one exception, all the power which the authorities will have under this section is already contained in section 30 of the 1939 Act, which provides that a member of the Garda Síochána</P>
      <P>...may without warrant, stop, search, interrogate and arrest any person or do any one or more of those things in respect of any person whom he suspects&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>I want to emphasise &ldquo;suspect&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;of having committed or been about to commit, or been or having <Col N="1206" /> been concerned in the commission of an offence under this Act.</P>
    <P>The first requirement is that the garda is dealing with a person who is a suspect.</P>
    <P>This section now deals with a person who may have information.  If you combine with section 30 the provisions of section 52 of the 1939 Act, any apparent <i>lacunae</i> are very well filled in because if the garda arrests a person, as he is entitled to do under section 30 of the 1939 Act he is entitled to obtain information from him. All information in his possession may relate to the commission or intended commission by another person of any offence under any section or subsection of this Act or any scheduled offence.  In short, the position is that the proposed amendment would not remedy, so far as the statute law is concerned, the point which Senators Robinson and Horgan have in mind.</P>
    <P>Therefore, there is some vestige or semblance of a safeguard in the present section which does not appear in the other sections I have mentioned, such as sections 30 and 52 of the 1939 Act.  In relation to this section, the garda is required to have reasonable grounds for belief.  If he acts without having reasonable grounds for his belief he may find himself in considerable difficulties.  Under sections 30 and 52 of the other act the garda may act merely on suspicion.  This is not as strong a statutory protection as saying that he must have reasonable grounds for belief before he acts.</P>

      <P>Speaking as a layman, I find the amendment proposed by Senators Robinson and Horgan most unrealistic.  It states that:</P>
      <P>Where a member of the Garda Síochána had demanded of any person his name and address and an account of his recent movements under subsection (1) of this section, such person shall have the right to request the presence of his legal adviser, and such person shall not be obliged to give the information requested until he has consulted his legal adviser.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1207" /> If this Bill had become an Act some months ago let us look at what could have happened in the tragic events near Liberty Hall last night.  If the gardaí, seeing some individuals running towards a car after the blast, stopped them to ask their names, addresses and an account of their movements, would it not be ludicrous if they then had to wait until these people got their legal advisers from Belfast or wherever they came from?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect to the Senator, this is the point of what Senator O'Higgins was saying.  There are other sections of the Offences Against the State Act which are effective in those circumstances.  The gardaí in those circumstances could under section 30 arrest the particular individual involved.  I should like to compliment Senator O'Higgins on his analysis of the section.  In this section we are talking about somebody who is in proximity to where a scheduled offence has been committed, who is being asked to give a reasonable account of his movements.</P>
      <P>There is a certain danger in saying that no law abiding citizen of the State should be bothered by this provision. There are many types of laws which could be introduced on that sort of reasoning which would be a grave infringement of what we regard as the scope of our personal liberty.  Legislation involving the finger-printing of the nation and having a record of all the private details of our lives could be introduced on the principle that it would not bother innocent, right-minded members of society.  If a person is being asked in such vague terms to give information and does not have a right to remain silent and the protection of the normal process of the law it is reasonable that he be allowed to seek legal advice and not be guilty of a criminal offence for which the penalty could be 12 months' imprisonment under this section.</P>

      <P>The trouble with many legislators is that they think and speak mainly of the law in relation to other people but seldom in regard to themselves.  I would ask the Members of this House to place themselves in <Col N="1208" /> the position of an innocent individual caught within the ambit of the circumstances set out in section 2.  If a Member of the House quite inadvertently gave misleading information he would be guilty of an offence and could be subject to a term of 12 months' imprisonment. Can Members of the House be happy about that situation?  Some people are so enraptured with the law that they cannot conceive a miscarriage of justice even within the ambit of the ordinary courts.  I regret to say that in the course of two hours in a district court one can find a great deal of injustice even on the basis of discrimination for equal offences.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are all aware of the kind of situation with which this section is intended to deal.  I have a lot of sympathy with any draftsman who attempts to draft a reasonable piece of legislation to cope with this situation.  The kind of situation I have in mind is the situation in which loud explosions are heard, for a lengthy period of time, in a rural area.  Following such an occurrence the Garda, as they arrive on the scene, stop a number of vehicles occupied by a number of persons slightly out of breath and smelling strongly of cordite.  We are trying to establish whether the present legislation is sufficient to deal with such a situation in which there is a very high element of suspicion and a very low element of objective proof.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of my criticisms of this section is that it might not really do what it is supposed to do.  Take, for example, the word &ldquo;proximity&rdquo;.  I would imagine that the definition of this word in the courts might give rise to a considerable amount of difficulty in establishing anything that might be regarded by reasonable people as a rule of thumb.  Not so long ago we had a very long and detailed argument and correspondence carried on in the pages of the <i>Irish Theological Quarterly</i> after the Irish Catholic bishops had made a rule forbidding the attendance of Catholic priests at horse race meetings. The subject of this correspondence <Col N="1209" /> was to try to define the distance, the yards, feet and inches from a horse race meeting constituted attendance. This argument went on for years so far as I know.  At least one clergyman resolved the problem to his own conscience and satisfaction by sitting in the race course car park listening to the public address system and using a very strong pair of binoculars.  This is a definition of &ldquo;proximity&rdquo;.  The establishment of a consistent definition of &ldquo;proximity&rdquo; is one which might create so many problems for the courts that this section, for all its intended stringency, might be of very little effect.</P>
    <P>I feel that the proper and appropriate operation of section 30 of the 1939 Offences Against the State Act would meet the situation.  It is true that the penalties under that section are relatively light.  Section 30 (6) points out that</P>
    <P>the failure to give a name or address, or the giving of a false or misleading name and address, shall render a person liable on summary conviction to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months.</P>
    <P>I argue, although I am not absolutely convinced of it, that what the Government want to achieve in this section might be more easily achieved by simply extending the penalties under section 30 of the old Act.</P>
    <P>My final point on the section is one of substance, and I believe the House is entitled to consider it before we make up our minds on which way to vote.  It is that the Minister, in his opening speech, told us he had been advised that section 52 of the Offences Against the State Act, 1939, was contrary to Article VI of the European Convention on Human Rights and this was one of the reasons why section 2 of this Bill was being introduced.  He further told us that section 2 was not in contravention of Article VI of the European Convention.  I think we are entitled to a little more information on this.  I should like the Minister to tell us why section 52 of the 1939 Act is considered by him to be in contravention of Article VI of the European Convention and why section 2 of this <Col N="1210" /> Bill will fall within that Article.  It is most important that we should know this before we make up our minds on which way to vote.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that is a reasonable question and one I intended to ask the Minister.  Under section 52 of the 1939 Act the State is dealing with someone who has been detained because he is a suspect who has acted contrary to section 30 of the Act.  Under section 2 here you can be dealing with a completely different set of circumstances. You can be dealing with a person who is innocent, whom the garda in question knows to be innocent but suspects that, by reason of his having been present on a particular occasion, may have seen something or otherwise acquired information but, nevertheless, a person who knows himself to be innocent of the offence.</P>
      <P>I believe that in section 52 you are dealing with a person who has been detained because he was a suspect who had failed to comply with the requirements of section 30 and here you are dealing with a person who is not a suspect but who has failed to give information requested of him.  It would be far stronger to say that section 2 of this Act, for the reasons which I have mentioned, would be in contravention of the Convention on Human Rights.</P>

      <P>Would that be an account of his movements during the last two hours, the last 24 hours, the last seven days or, perhaps, the last month?  If any of us was asked to account for his movements on, say, this day week he may find it easy enough to comply with the request or may have difficulty in accounting for them.  If we were asked to account for our movements about a month ago I am sure we would not find it so easy to comply.  Perhaps this word &ldquo;recent&rdquo; could be defined for us.</P>

      <P>In reply to the point raised by Senator Horgan and pursued by Senator O'Higgins in relation to section 52 and its contravention of the Human Rights Convention, it is not the Minister's opinion that the section is in contravention of the Human Rights Convention.  It is rather the advice he has received from his legal advisers.</P>
      <P>Section 52 of the 1939 Act relates to those who are under arrest and this section does not relate to such people. Let us take the case where, under section 52 of the 1939 Act, you have a person in custody.  One could imagine that a person in custody and under arrest would be subject to certain mental pressures that his arrest would bring upon him.  The position in relation to this section is that the person is not under arrest.  That is another issue that might be considered by the House when they are deciding whether they should vote for or against the Bill.  The Minister is standing four square behind this section.  He finds it to be a reasonable section and the Senator's amendment is totally unacceptable to him.  However, this has been withdrawn now so that point does not arise.</P>

      <P>It is in the section. I should like to outline to the Senator the type of offences which arise under Part V of the 1939 Act, and which this section specifically deals with. These offences include offences relating to malicious damage, explosives, firearms, <i>et cetera</i>.  As Senator Cranitch has pointed out, where this dastardly and cowardly deed was committed in this city, if a person was seen or suspected, or in some way showed by his temperament and so on, that he could have been associated with the particular explosion, would it not be reasonable to apprehend that person, and to ask him for an account of his movements?  I think that is totally reasonable.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the Minister will be able to give us the benefit of his own views before we finish this discussion.  The point I want to make to the Parliamentary Secretary, and through him to the Minister, is a simple one.  The Parliamentary Secretary referred to the apprehension of people who caused explosions or bomb damage in the city.</P>

      <P>Or who may have caused.  I am quite sure that not one member of this House would raise a finger to prevent such a person being apprehended either by reason of amendments or any other way.  Section 2 may also operate against a person actually known to the guards to be completely innocent of any offence.</P>
      <P>In other words, there is no question of apprehending an evil-doer.  It may be positively known to the guards that the person from whom they are looking for information is entirely guiltless and that his only connection with the matter is that he happened to be in the vicinity, and that by reason of happening to be in the vicinity, he may have information.  I want to get this clear.  In those circumstances you are dealing with a person who is guiltless of any offence.  He is going to become guilty of an offence under this section, if he fails to give the information, but up to that time he is entirely guiltless.  There is no point in being emotive about this and saying that you are dealing only with serious crimes, and the apprehension of persons who have committed serious crimes.  I am not going to object to this section going through, but I want to get the record clear.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>In all these things there is the question of human relations. The Garda, who are custodians of the peace, are men of deep integrity. If a garda asked me for certain information at a given point relating to a particular occurrence, I would find it totally reasonable that that information should be sought of me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two things involved here: first, there is the question of the garda's right under this Act to get information and to make inquiries from people, whether or not they are guilty.  If the person from whom he is seeking the information is a person who is also guilty of committing an offence, very few people would have the slightest sympathy with him.  I think the Parliamentary Secretary, who in common with Senator Nash and myself, is a lawyer, would agree with this proposition: generally speaking, it is much better in the interest of the relations between the Garda Síochána and the public that information should be forthcoming on a voluntary basis.  If a garda asked for information, we should feel it our civic duty to give that information.  That is the kind of spirit that we should be trying to inculcate into people, if it is absent. However, that is not what we are doing here and we should not overlook it.  What we may be doing here is dealing with an innocent person and saying: &ldquo;You'll give the information or else...&rdquo;&mdash;12 months or whatever it may be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnNash" hpid="Mr. Nash Mr. Nash">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nash</NameTxt>
      <P>In circumstances such as happened last night if I, or any innocent bystander had any information that could assist the guards in forthwith arresting the perpetrator of that crime, and I refused the reasonable request to give that information, I <Col N="1215" /> would not deserve the protection of the society which I was co-operating in destroying.  It is as simple as that. That is what is required here: that in certain circumstances, whether I am guilty or innocent, if I have information it is my bounden duty to give it.  If I do not give it, I am doing an injustice to the State and I must be punished for that injustice.  I would consider that in circumstances such as those of last night six months would be far too short for the person who would refuse such information.</P>

      <P>When somebody says it is as simple as that, you can be sure of one thing: that it is not.  Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary misunderstood my point about the European Convention. There is a quibble as to whether it is the Minister's opinion or the advice available to him.  If this is the advice available to the Minister and if he has accepted it then it can be accepted that it is the Minister's opinion.</P>
      <P>If the Minister can show me that this section is simply closing a gap in relation to section 52 of the 1939 Act it is likely that I would not vote against it. We have nothing except the Minister's word for it and I would be grateful if he would give us more detail about the advice available to him as to why this gap had to be closed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3.</P>
      <P>To delete subsection 1 (b).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards this section we are being asked to admit three new forms of evidence in the trial of a person under the Offences Against the State Act.  As <Col N="1216" /> can be seen from my amendments I believe that two of these three new forms of evidence should not be admitted as evidence and certainly not in the form in which they find expression here.  I confine my remarks here to section 3 (1) (b).  I oppose the inclusion of this paragraph on the grounds that it offends against the right which people have, no matter how much we may disagree with them politically or in any other way, to a fair trial.  My second reason for opposing this paragraph is because its operation will also interfere with the rights of the people as a whole to be adequately informed about what is going on in the country.</P>
    <P>Senator Brosnahan spoke very eloquently about the rights of people.  He spoke about the right of freedom from violence and intimidation and the right of freedom from the danger of the sort of death which was meeted out in Dublin last night.  I yield to no one, and certainly not to the Senator, in my agreement with this right and in my defence of it.  There are numerous rights in society and if any legislation which, in order to promote one right offends grossly against other rights, it must be examined seriously.  It is a difficult question and in the end, I suppose, a political one, as to the balance that is achieved in legislation between conflicting rights.</P>
    <P>There is not an honest balance between this right to freedom from violence and intimidation and the right of the people to be fully informed of what is going on in the country and the right of people who may be accused of offences to a fair trial in this paragraph of section 3. In section 3 we are being asked to admit a new kind of evidence in our courts:</P>
    <P>In paragraph (a) of this subsection &ldquo;conduct&rdquo; includes omission by the accused person to deny published reports that he was a member of an unlawful organisation, but the fact of such denial shall not by itself be conclusive.</P>
    <P>I abhor and I have a total lack of sympathy with unlawful organisations in this country, but at the same time I am alarmed at the provision in this paragraph.  It militates against <Col N="1217" /> people's rights to a fair trial by allowing as admissible, evidence of published statements about them.  This is a terrifying principle of evidence. It may not be a principle of proof, and no doubt this point has been made and will be made again, but even as a principle of evidence it seems to be very dangerous.  One might accept, as Senator Ryan has already said, that these are unusual times and this is the kind of unusual power that we are looking for but even if I were to accept that I would have to follow through and say that this section, like almost every other section of this Bill, should be accompanied by a time clause.  If I give the Seanad a couple of examples of what this principle of evidence might mean then they might be more disposed to agree with me.</P>
    <P>It is an offence in this country to possess drugs, but it is not an offence to use them.  It could be possible in a hypothetical situation if this principle of evidence were to be extended&mdash;and once it is introduced there is no reason why it could not be extended&mdash;that it might put people in jeopardy in a way in which they are not at the present time.  For example if, in an interview, a person said that he smoked reefers and that he thought the laws on drugs should not be changed because he enjoyed smoking them and if this was published in the newspapers the principle that we have in this paragraph would apply to this sort of case.  This is not, as things stand at the moment, grounds for proceeding against that type of person.  It could be said that it would be in order for the State to proceed against such a person simply on the grounds of published statements by him or about him.  The State could argue that since X said he smoked pot, X must have possessed pot, therefore X is guilty of possessing pot and therefore X must go down the river for a long stretch. This is the sort of avenue we are opening up if we accept that evidence should be admissible in a court of law in the kind of context in which it is written in the subsection.</P>
    <P>The argument behind the subsection can be defeated by <i>reduction ad absurdum</i>.  If things had gone another <Col N="1218" /> way last night and if we were now in the middle of a general election campaign the Members of the Seanad have a clear idea of the kind of scripts which would be pouring out from the script factories and finding their way into the various newspapers.  It is fair to say that a high proportion of those scripts would cheerfully accuse politicians of whatever party&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;of treasonable activity. It has already been done in the House and outside the House to my certain knowledge.  If we accepted the principle of evidence which finds expression here publication in such a case of an allegation that a certain person had engaged in treasonable activity would be admissable as evidence of his having participated in treasonable activity whether it be true or false.  This is the main reason why I am opposed to the introduction of this principle of evidence.</P>
      <P>The secondary reason for my opposition is that the way in which it is operated could affect the rights of people to know what is going on around them, could affect what has been rather inaccurately described at times as &ldquo;the freedom of the Press&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I should like to remind the House that the freedom of the Press is not an end in itself, it exists only in defence of people's right to be informed.  If it is generally noised abroad that a person is or makes himself out to be a member of an unlawful organisation and makes statements supposedly on behalf of such an unlawful organisation it is vital in the national interest that the people should know this.</P>

      <P>I will listen to Senator Honan's contribution with pleasure.  My two main points on amendment No. 3 are first, it offends people's right to a fair trial; secondly, it may be operated in such a way as to make it difficult for people to publish widely known facts about organisations, lawful, unlawful, subversive or whatever, in a way which may very seriously infringe upon the people's right to know.</P>
      <P>I am not going on the freedom of the Press <i>per se</i>; I am going on to the right of people to know the facts. Some time ago I asked a colleague in this House how Mr. de Valera managed in the forties to carry through the operation of very similar legislation to that with which we are dealing today.  I was listening to a television programme where it mentioned that in the forties two persons had died on hunger strike but their deaths were not widely published.</P>
      <P>The interesting answer I was given to my question was that for the first two years of the original Offences Against the State Act operation we were living in a war-time situation with very stringent Press control.

      <P>I understand that this is a Bill entitled to amend and extend the Offences Against the State Act, 1939 and 1940 and 1953 are not mentioned.  I should like to speak on amendment No. 4.  Assuming for the purposes of argument that amendment No. 3 is defeated it is vital to remove from the paragraph the last phrase &ldquo;but the fact of such denial shall not by itself be conclusive&rdquo;.  If we examine the Offences Against the State Acts, 1939 and 1940, we see all sorts of different approaches to the question of evidence of membership of an illegal organisation and to evidence of various other forms of illegal activity.</P>
      <P>In section 26 of the 1939 Act it states in a proviso in relation to the publication of a document that under the section the evidence of a chief superintendent on publication of a seditious document shall be evidence &ldquo;until the accused denies on oath that he published such a document&rdquo;. In other words, in this section a denial on oath by the accused that he did publish such a document is an absolute rebuttal to the evidence of the chief superintendent.  In section 3 (1) (b) of this Bill it states:</P>
      <P>...the fact of such denial shall not by itself be conclusive.</P>
      <P>This is much worse than the provision in section 26 of the Offences Against the State Act, 1939.  It is even worse than the provisions in sections 15 and 24 of the same Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 15 provides that the burden of proof is transferred to the person who is prosecuted on a charge of <Col N="1221" /> illegal drilling.  In section 24 there is a reference to proof of membership by possession of incriminating documents. The relevant part of the section reads:</P>
    <P>An incriminating document relating to the said organisation... shall, without more, be evidence until the contrary is proved that such a person was a member of the said organisation...</P>
    <P>If you constructed an ascending scale of nastiness, this subsection would be at the top of it.  The provision in section 24 would be next down the list and that in section 26 at the bottom. Of three possible formulations relating to the admissibility of evidence in the trial of a person who is accused of membership of an unlawful organisation, this paragraph of the Bill offers us the most objectionable.  This is why I oppose it.</P>

      <P>It is quite legitimate in considering this section or any other section of this Bill to examine the possible way in which the section could be used and to have regard to the fact that it might be used in a way which would be undesirable.  On the other hand, we must also look at it from the point of view of the realities of the situation and the purpose to which the section is likely to be directed.  During the past few years, we have frequently seen in the newspapers bulletins, statements and speeches attributed to people who are described as leading members of the IRA or some other illegal organisation. There is no doubt that the continued publication of statements and bulletins of this nature is highly provocative, in particular to the victims of the activities of these organisations.  Apart from the victims, it is very disquieting for the public generally and gradually could lead to a loss of morale on the part of the public and the feeling that nothing can be done to prevent leading members of an illegal organisation from publishing these statements or bulletins.</P>

    <P>While it is quite legitimate for Senator Horgan to discuss the possible ways in which the action could be <Col N="1222" /> applied, we must have regard in particular to the way in which it is likely to be applied.  The situation I have described needs to be dealt with.  In its own way it is very important and it is something which is frequently mentioned in the north of Ireland by those people who are the victims of the activities of illegal organisations.  It is a cause of great amazement to them that these statements and bulletins can continue to be made.  If this section has the effect of discouraging these statements, because it will be possible to use them as evidence against a person, something worthwhile will have been achieved.  While it is no proof that a person is a member of an illegal organisation, nevertheless if a person is continually described as a leading member of such an organisation and if he takes no action to deny the charge, then I submit it is legitimate evidence, although not conclusive.</P>
    <P>We must be realistic about this.  Anybody who is not a member of an illegal organisation and who sees his name printed in a paper as making a statement or issuing a bulletin will naturally take some steps to deny it.  Such a person will not be victimised by this section. I have no doubt that if he denies it at once, says it is not true, it will not be used as evidence against him.  While it is true that theoretically an individual could be adversely affected in some way by this section, the odds are very much against this happening.  The section clearly says this is evidence that can be used but must, of course, be weighed up by the court.  The possibility of its being abused is very remote. There is a situation which is doing a great deal of harm and this section can play a part in preventing this abuse from continuing.  For that reason, taking the balance of probabilities and acknowledging that there may be some remote risk, nevertheless, the section is well worth while and I do not support the amendment proposed by Senator Horgan.</P>

      <P>I should like to support this amendment.  My task in supporting it has been made easier by the very able analysis of his reasons given by Senator Horgan.  Section 3 was obviously introduced&mdash;and this has <Col N="1223" /> been confirmed by the Minister's statements&mdash;in order to improve the possibility of introducing evidence of membership of an illegal organisation. The Minister has pointed out the difficulty of securing convictions of people as members of illegal organisations and the section is legitimate on this ground.  He can point to the many times the courts have not succeeded in conviction of membership of an unlawful organisation.  This point is not displaced by the rather notorious conviction just recently of Seán Mac Stiofáin as a member&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I withdraw the word &ldquo;notorious&rdquo;.  I am rather tired.  It was a complete misunderstanding.  I withdraw any inference that I support either Mac Stiofáin or his organisation. Section 3 (1) (a) is an attempt to make it easier for the prosecution to bring in evidence of membership of an illegal organisation and have people convicted. As it stands, it does meet the problem.  To illustrate my point, I quote the section:</P>
      <P>Any statement made orally, in writing or otherwise, or any conduct, by an accused person implying or leading to a reasonable inference that he was at a material time a member of an unlawful organisation shall, in proceedings under section 21 of the Act of 1939, be evidence that he was then such a member.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is not conclusive evidence but evidence.  If the section stopped there, I would have no objection.  My objection <Col N="1224" /> to paragraph (b) subsection (1) of section 3 which defines in a way that no judge would at the moment interpret it the word &ldquo;conduct&rdquo;.  We are reading in an interpretation of &ldquo;conduct&rdquo; which I agree with Senator Horgan goes beyond the normal rules of evidence and is much broader than would be accepted by the courts, if they were not given this statutory interpretation.</P>
    <P>The points made by Senator Ryan are not as valid as they might be under the wording of the section.  The problem with this Bill is that, had it had proper time for consideration in another place, it might have been amended and therefore some of the matters before us today would not exist.</P>
    <P>The subsection provides that the conduct includes omission by the accused person to deny published reports that he was a member of an unlawful organisation.  Senator Eoin Ryan pointed out that an innocent person who is not a member of an unlawful organisation would be quick to deny this.  It is not provided for in the section that a person will know of these reports.  It is not provided in the section that the reports be published by organs of newspaper or media in this State.  They can be published by newspapers or they can be published in a permanent form outside the State.  This leaves open the possibility&mdash;not such an unreal possibility&mdash;that foreign newspapers could victimise certain individuals.  There may very well be circumstances where these reports are repeated&mdash;where it is repeated that certain persons are associated with unlawful organisations.</P>
    <P>It is going beyond the bounds of fair trial procedure to interpret the failure of a person to deny these reports as conduct which is evidence of him being a member of an unlawful organisation.  Subsection (1) (a) meets the problem.  It should have stopped there.  The statutory definition goes beyond that.  It throws a burden on those who are making published reports, such as the newspapers or radio and television.  This will be vague enough to bother those journalists who are seeking to inform the public of the <Col N="1225" /> situation and who are seeking to give a fair and impartial assessment of what the problems before the country at the moment are.  I should like to support this amendment first because of the unfair burden and the improper extension of it on the accused by giving a very extended statutory meaning to the word &ldquo;conduct&rdquo; which judges would not give without this provision and, secondly, for the affect it may have on the organs of public opinion and on the newspapers in their reporting.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make one point in reply to Senator Ryan.  We are all in a considerable difficulty here.  I doubt that there would be any difference of opinion between Senator Ryan and myself about the people with whom this section is intended to deal.  Senator Ryan said that the kind of publication to which he referred had been provocative.  That may be so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to ask, as a working journalist, why the newspapers and other media of communication have consistently been not proceeded against under the provisions of the Offences Against the State Act, 1939, <Col N="1226" /> under which they could be proceeded against?  If it is provocative to have a reference in the newspapers to statements emanating from an organisation styling itself as the IRA, it is inconsistent to say the least of it, that newspapers are not proceeded against on foot of the provisions in the Offences Against the State Act. It is equally provocative, for example, for the Taoiseach to be photographed with a printed book in his hand in direct contravention of the Offences Against the State Act.</P>
    <P>My basic point in reply to Senator Ryan rests on the people's right to know.  I would differ with him slightly about the effect of this kind of publication. It is, he says, provocative.  I accept that it can be provocative to some people.  It is not provocative to me except in the sense that every statement published about a person who holds himself to be a member of the IRA confirms my total opposition to and loathing of that organisation. This is not an uncommon reaction to this kind of publication.  This kind of publication is essential if the true facts, the horrors of what people are being exposed to and the hypocrisies and fascism which exists in the country at the moment are to be seen for what they are.</P>
    <P>There are other forms of terminology to which I am equally opposed. Newspapers have the habit of describing somebody as a leading member of &ldquo;The republican movement&rdquo;.  This is an appelation which might become contentious evidence under paragraph (b) of this subsection.  I once thought that it would deflate many of these persons if, instead of describing them as members of &ldquo;The republican movement&rdquo;, we took a journalistic decision, to describe them as members of &ldquo;a republican movement&rdquo;.  It might cut many of these people down to size.  Newspapers and journalists have a duty in this matter.  They are trying to fulfil this duty very seriously. If they have fallen down on this duty to any extent it is because they have not paid enough of the right kind of attention to the IRA. They have not attempted the kind of exposés and articles which would be <Col N="1227" /> an essential and healthy part of our journalistic system at the moment, but this is by the way.</P>
    <P>The main danger of the operation of this subsection is that it will have precisely the kind of effect which Senator Ryan said it would have.  It will either make for a conflict involving complicated questions of ethics and so on between journalists and the State, which I would not like to see happening at all, or, if it removed from the papers virtually all references to named persons who hold themselves as being members of illegal organisations, it would impose a blanket of silence which to me would be much worse than the provocation in existence as a result of the present practice.</P>
    <P>If we are to defeat the IRA, as we must, we will have to do so in the open. Any measure which will operate to drive them further underground will only help them to regroup, to strengthen their forces and to get from secrecy the kind of fresh impetus that all secret organisations get.  It is basically in favour of the people's right to be informed and in favour of the right of an accused person to a fair trial that I put forward my two amendments.</P>

      <P>I accept what the Minister for Justice has said in two respects: first, that this subsection does not transfer the onus of proof to the defendant&mdash;I think it is a very thin argument in favour of it but I am prepared to accept it as a technicality &mdash;and secondly, the contention which either has been or may be made by the other side that this is not, in some ways, a new departure in our law. Anybody who reads section 26 of the 1939 Act will see a precedent for this section.  It reads:</P>
      <P>Where in any criminal proceedings the question whether a particular treasonable document, seditious document or incriminating document was or was not published by the accused, whether by himself or in concert with other persons or by arrangement between himself and other persons, is in issue and an officer of the Garda Síochána, not below the rank of chief superintendent, states on oath that he believes that such document was published, as the case may be, by the accused or by the accused in concert with other persons or by arrangement between the accused and other persons, such statement shall be evidence until the accused denies on oath that he published such document either himself or in concert or by arrangement as aforesaid that the accused published such document as alleged in the said statement in the said statement on oath of such an officer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1229" /> Here we have, in section 26 of the existing law, the admissibility of a statement by a chief superintendent of the Garda Síochána to the effect that the person has committed an offence under the Offences Against the State Act; we have, in section 26 of the 1939 Act, this proviso.  In other words, if the person affected by this statement denies on oath that he is guilty of the offence which the chief superintendent says he committed, this automatically, if my reading of the section is correct, renders inadmissible the chief supertendent's statement.</P>
    <P>I am comparing this section unfavourably with section 26 of the original Act.  This does not mean to say that I approve of section 26 of the original Act.  Both sections have this much in common and this much that is objectionable in common: they effectively preclude the right of an accused person to silence.  They force an accused person to go into the witness box, to expose himself to cross-examination and, in so far as it repeats this effect of section 26 of the 1939 Act, it is objectionable.  It does not only repeat this effect but it goes beyond it by refusing to allow even a denial on oath by the person concerned to render inadmissible the evidence under this section.  This is absolutely extraordinary.</P>
    <P>Another objection to this section has been very well stated by Senator Alexis FitzGerald.  As he points out, it is not a section relating to the admissibility of evidence at all; it is a section arranging for the introduction of internment under a judicial process. We have already had, in the last few days, a letter in the newspapers from a member of the Judiciary criticising this subsection in terms identical with those expressed by Senator Alexis FitzGerald and, if anything, in even stronger language.  I think an event of such rarity should be considered very seriously.  For a member of the Judiciary to come out in public on an issue of this kind, while a Bill is passing through the Oireachtas, is an extraordinarily unique affair.  I believe the man would not have done and said what he did unless he was very <Col N="1230" /> seriously worried by this impending legislation.</P>
    <P>This is really the introduction of internment by judicial process.  There is further proof of this which has not, to my knowledge, been referred to by anybody else.  We have to remember that unless under this subsection the new evidence to be admissible will be the evidence of a garda of the rank of chief superintendent or higher.  In order to assess the effect of this section, it is valid to look at the position and role of chief superintendents in the Garda.  Under the Garda Síochána Act, 1924, which is the founding legislation for the force, superintendents and all ranks above superintendents are appointed not by examination and interview, not by an independent police authority, but by the Government.  This is in significant contrast with the method of appointment of senior police officers in Britain and, indeed, in Northern Ireland, where all such promotions are made by the appropriate police authority, except in the London Metropolitan police area, for which the authority is the Home Secretary. I am not making any criticism of chief superintendents or other such ranks in the Garda Síochána.  The fact that these people are appointed by the Government is very relevant when we consider the credibility of action initiated under this subsection of the Bill.</P>

      <P>The point I am trying to make in relation to this subsection is that for its effect it will rely on the testimony of a small number of police officers who owe their appointment to the Government of the day.  It is fair to say that their appointment can be terminated at any time by the Government of the day. When we further consider that it is standing Garda procedure to refer always to the Department of Justice before bringing any charge under the Offences Against the State Acts, we can accept that the Act has not, and never has been, used by Garda as part of their day to day work, but always in political directions.  The Bill, in effect, gives a number of policemen appointed by the Government a total control over the liberty of the individual and this is an extraordinarily dangerous thing to do.  The method of appointment of chief superintendents, when it is taken in conjunction with the other provisions of this Bill and more especially of this subsection, adds up to a whole series of things which is almost guaranteed to shake peoples confidence in the judiciary. In the first place, we have the admissibility of evidence, which may send a man to prison, evidence given by a chief superintendent of the Garda Síochána.  That chief superintendent has been appointed by the Government. He is giving this evidence in front of a judge or judges who also have been appointed by the Government.

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support Senator Horgan in this amendment for the deletion of subsection (2) of section 3.  This is the section which has perhaps received the most publicity prior to the debates on this Bill and which has been criticised most severely during the debates.  It was said in another place that the tragic events of yesterday did not displace the reasons given or take away any of the validity of the points made about the section.  We must remember that we are debating this in a climate where people who try to point to the lack of safeguards, and to point to the dangers of this Bill, are subject to misrepresentation.  Yet the points at issue are so extremely important that we must consider the legislation in an objective light.</P>
      <P>I agree very much with the points made by Senator Horgan.  One of the matters which will be an intolerable delimitation of the freedom of the individual is the fact that in the section the chief superintendent does not have to give any reasons for his belief: he merely states that he believes, and this can be evidence that a person was a member of an unlawful organisation.  As Senator Horgan has said&mdash;and I agree with him&mdash;this does not displace the burden of proof on the prosecution; it is an evidential presumption which is created.  The problem is that on cross-examination one could imagine a chief superintendent being able to say that he was not in a position to disclose the information which gave rise to his belief.  This would mean that his statement, if uncontroverted, would be sufficient to convict the person of being a member of an unlawful organisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1233" /> I am aware that an attempt was made to introduce an amendment to allow the defendant to deny this on oath.  That is a very limited form of protection.  It was not an amendment which we were prepared to consider introducing, because it would be hard to see how the accused could simply deny this on oath and yet not be open to cross-examination in the witness box.  Therefore, it would compel him to go into the witness box.  I share Senator Horgan's point that, as this section stands, the only effective way in which the accused can prevent the evidential burden from securing his conviction is to go into the witness box and deny.  This is going very far in changing the normal position of the criminal law where an accused does not have to go into the witness box, where he is protected from this and may remain silent.</P>
    <P>No doubt the Minister will emphasise, as he has done before, that the burden of proof has not shifted: that the prosecution still has the burden of proof.  This can become almost a question of semantics when the evidential burden has been placed on the accused because of the statement made by a chief superintendent that he believes him to be a member of an unlawful organisation.  I share the view that it is, in fact, a form of interment by the judicial process and that it is a very dangerous distortion of the present judicial process.</P>
    <P>Like Senator Horgan, I was very surprised at the letter from District Justice Sweetman in the newspapers. Anybody with a familiarity with the judiciary in this country would know how reluctant he must have been to actually state in print his strong reservations about this Bill.  I have also read a number of statements by citizens as to how one can redress the evidential effect of the statement by a chief superintendent.  It is also worth asking whether the superintendent, under the present wording of subsection (2), could base the belief on the type of fact-finding, such as extensive phone-tapping of a particular accused's phone and then, on the basis of that, say he believed the person to be a member of an unlawful organisation.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go into too much <Col N="1234" /> detail in connection with American cases, but it has been interpreted in the American due process that the legislature does not have an unlimited power to create evidential presumptions. This is limited by the requirements of due process.  Is subsection (2) within those limits for the reasons given by Senator Horgan and the objections which I have made on the sections?  It may be that it goes beyond the requirements of procedural due process and the requirements for a fair trial of the accused. Therefore, I support the deletion of subsection (2).</P>

      <P>The first thing I want to say is that I referred here and in the Dáil to the fact that this subsection did not transfer the onus of proof.  I was not putting this forward as an argument for the subsection. I was trying to state what the fact is in order to catch up on the erroneous propaganda which was put out before I was allowed to speak on the Bill.</P>

      <P>I am not saying it is.  I am not putting forward the fact that there is no transfer of onus of proof as an argument for it.  I had to say it twice because the IRA acting under the guises of either Sinn Féin or Republican Movement or the Irish Republican Publicity Bureau or whatever other name they adopt, after holding a meeting in a tall building in the town put out a statement, before the Bill was published, pointing out that the Minister for Justice had transferred the onus of proof. That is why I want to make it clear that I am not putting this forward as an argument for the subsection.  There is no transfer of onus.  Everybody agrees with that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This subsection is, to a great extent, the kernel of this Bill because in the present set-up of unlawful organisations in this country they are not as brave but they are a great deal more sophisticated than they were 20, 30, 40 or 50 years ago.  The leaders of these organisations are <Col N="1235" /> never found with arms or documents on them.  The experience of the police over the last few years has been that they rarely, if ever, go out to do the dirty work.  If they are apprehended or questioned by the police they have nothing on them that would enable evidence to be given against them.  The only way that these people are ever going to be convicted of an offence under the Offences Against the State Act is the offence of membership. The leaders go behind closed doors without any evidence on them and plot the murder and maiming of citizens of this country, both north and south.  They plot the destruction of the property of the citizens of this country without lifting a finger themselves. The people who are caught in the act and with documents on them are usually the small fry.  Rarely, if ever, is a leader of any of these organisations caught and convicted with being a member of such an organisation.</P>
    <P>In the Dáil last night I gave the figures for prosecutions and convictions for this offence from the 1st February, 1972 to the present time. There were 30 prosecutions and only three convictions but the significant thing about that is not that there were only three convictions out of 30 prosecutions but that there were an awful lot of prosecutions that were never brought because the Garda, although they were absolutely positive, had not one shread of what at the moment is admissible evidence, even though they were morally certain that a man was a member of an unlawful organisation.</P>
    <P>That is why this particular offence under section 21 of the 1939 Act is very important and necessary to enable the Garda to widen the amount of evidence which would be admissible against these people who go to such great lengths to keep themselves in the clear even though they endanger the smaller men in their own organisations and also many innocent people in this country, North and South.  People have lost their lives, limbs and homes due to the activities of such people.</P>
    <P>I want to make a point in relation to what two Senators said about the <Col N="1236" /> evidential presumption that was placed on a defendant.  There is no evidential presumption placed on the defendant. The position is that the entire onus of proof is on the State and for either of the Senators to say that they accept that there is no onus of proof put on the defendant, but then say that he has to discharge an evidential presumption against him, is to contradict themselves.</P>

      <P>Senator Robinson referred to the limitations in America on the amount or sort of evidence that the Legislature could impose as admissible against a defendant.  I do not know what the limitations in America are, but no doubt, they have definite ones. If Senator Robinson is so keen on whatever limitations they have in America on admissibility of evidence, will she go the whole hog and then we will have the whole American criminal code here which will include federal grand juries, before whom a person against whom the police have not sufficient admissible evidence at the time can be brought and asked a question, and if he refuses to answer it he will get between six months and two years in jail?  The American system would get over my problem.</P>
      <P>I invite Senator Robinson not to be so selective in what she wants to hawk out of America.  Is she agreeable to a system of federal grand juries and congressional committees of investigation where a number of Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas could question certain people who were known to be engaged in illegal activities, but against whom the Garda could not get enough admissible evidence, and if these people refused to answer a question the committee of the Oireachtas could have them committed to prison until such time as they did?</P>

      <P>It is a pity that Senator Robinson in her lauding of the various obscure things that they have in America is so selective and <Col N="1237" /> that she does not tell us all of what happens over there.  She or Senator Horgan mentioned that Justice Sweetman must have been reluctant to write the letter.  She is wrong there as he is not at all reluctant to write letters.  It would be no harm if she read some of the earlier ones written by him.</P>
      <P>The phrase was used by the two Senators who moved these amendments that this section introduced what they described as &ldquo;internment by judicial process&rdquo;.  I wish to make it clear there is no such thing unless the Senators mean the courts are corrupt, in other words imprisoning people who are not convicted.  If they mean that, they should have the courage to say so.  It is a matter for the court to decide under this subsection whether the man is guilty or innocent. In internment it is a matter for the Government to decide.  We, as a Government, have consistently refused to do that.  We only wish to lock up men who have been convicted before a court in accordance with the law.  To describe the conviction of a man who has had a fair trial in a court as internment is suggesting that the courts are a mockery or are corrupt.</P>

      <P>The Minister will recollect that shortly after his appointment to his present post, the Minister and the Taoiseach joined in issuing a declaration to certain people threatening to introduce internment for some plot in relation to the kidnapping of ambassadors or Ministers. I state this in reference to the last remarks of the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am disturbed by this section because we are now departing from the best evidence rule.  We are saying by virtue of a statute that if a chief superintendent states his belief, that that statement will be evidence.  As the Minister stated, the fact that it is evidence does not necessarily mean it is proof.  If there is no other evidence available it is the duty of the court to come to its decision on the basis of the evidence before it and <Col N="1238" /> consequently the mere statement without giving the grounds for belief could lead to conviction.</P>
    <P>I sympathise fully with the Minister's statement regarding the necessity of getting the men at the top as well as other ranks engaged in unlawful activity but the Minister has made a mistake in the drafting of this subsection. It should have been inserted in this subsection that the reasons for the chief superintendent's belief would have to be given to secure any worthwhile protection for an innocent person.  The statement is evidence. It does not matter whether that belief is well-founded.  I am not suggesting that any chief superintendent would go into the witness box and commit perjury, but if such a thing happened, then the statement is the evidence.</P>
    <P>If the Minister wished to have this subsection he should have drafted it in such a way as would require the chief superintendent to state his belief and the grounds for it.  A great deal of unease with regard to this subsection would have been removed if that were written into the legislation.</P>
    <P>I am also disturbed by what the Minister has just stated.  He seemed to be throwing his hat at getting the leaders for any offence except the offence of membership of an unlawful organisation.  What is the penalty for that under section 21 of the 1939 Act&mdash;a fine of £50 or three months' imprisonment?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Possibly on indictment, but it could be £50 or three months.  That penalty can be compared with penalties imposed in other sections of this Bill.</P>
      <P>I would go entirely with the Minister if in addition to the powers conferred in subsection (1) of section 3 he had increased substantially the penalties for membership of an unlawful organisation.  I would like to have heard the views of the Minister in relation to these points.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are concerned here with the statement of the chief superintendent <Col N="1239" /> regardless of the grounds on which that statement is based.</P>
    <P>If a chief superintendent who states his belief in evidence that a person was a member of an unlawful organisation is then cross-examined as to the grounds for his belief, and decides that it would not be in the interests of public safety to disclose that information, he can plead privilege for this.  If privilege is allowed, surely the position arises that the defendant who is before the court will not know on what grounds the chief superintendent bases his belief that he is a member of an unlawful organisation.</P>
    <P>There are weaknesses in this subsection. It is a bad one.  Subsection (1) is all that was needed by the Government by way of strengthening the evidential position as regards membership of an unlawful organisation.  Section 3 (1) (b) goes very far indeed.  Earlier today I was prepared to go along with that.  I was certainly prepared to go along with paragraph (a) of this section.  With those powers contained in subsection (1), and the right of the court to draw a general inference from a person's conduct that he is a member of an unlawful organisation that immeasurably strengthens the position as regards evidence.  In my view it is unnecessary that the Government should go further as they have done in relation to subsection (2).  It is this subsection which has aroused the vast amount of controversy that has been associated with this Bill.  It is not a good thing to enact legislation which is born in this kind of controversy surrounding this particular subsection if it is not necessary.  That is what worries me.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say how much I agree with and appreciate what Senator O'Higgins has just said. He has put the case better than either myself or, with all due respect to her, Senator Robinson.  We are not dealing with theoretical questions here.  We are dealing with the kind of situation which the Minister described and I have every sympathy with him in his attempts to cope with it.  I feel, and I am not alone in feeling, that he is going <Col N="1240" /> too far.  I can envisage many cases arising under this section where somebody comes before the court accused of membership of an illegal organisation. He refuses to recognise the court and a plea of not guilty is entered on his behalf.</P>
      <P>A chief superintendent gives evidence under subsection (2) of section 3 of this Bill and there is no further evidence of any other kind brought before the court.  I may be wrong but it seems to me that in such a case &mdash;and it is the kind of case we will see a lot of under this particular subsection&mdash;the judge would have no alternative but to convict because the only evidence before him would be evidence of membership.  There would be no rebutting evidence or cross-examination. This is why I believe District Justice Sweetman wrote this letter.  Any judge placed in a situation in which, for lack of any evidence to offset evidence given under this subsection he had to convict an accused person for membership of an unlawful organisation, would feel, and rightly so, that he was being used. He was being asked to carry the can for what was basically a political decision.</P>
      <P>Senator Alexis FitzGerald has already said in this House tonight that he could envisage a situation in which internment under the Offences Against the State Act would be necessary. I agree with the Senator's remarks. I, too, could envisage such a situation arising.  I could almost wish that the Government had been honest about this and had introduced or threatened to introduce direct internment rather than this half-hearted measure which falls between all the stools.  The Minister spoke with some feeling, of the moral certainty of members of the Garda Síochána with regard to membership of illegal organisations. I have no difficulty in understanding the feelings of the Minister and the gardaí involved.  As people who are occupied day and night in the fight against this sort of illegal activity their moral certainty must have a genuine passion.  Moral certainty is not, unfortunately, evidence. This is why we should oppose the subsection.</P>

      <P>I should like the guidance of the House how an oral statement could be made in writing.  It is nonsense.

      <P>The second point I should like to make about the section is that the fundamental weakness in the section is related to the fundamental weakness in section 21 of the Act of 1939 relating to membership of unlawful organisations.  Section 21 (1) of the Act of 1939 reads:</P>
      <P>It shall not be lawful for any person to be a member of an unlawful organisation.</P>
      <P>This is an extraordinary statement. What is an &ldquo;unlawful organisation&rdquo; unless it has members?  It is like saying: &ldquo;We decree sins to be unlawful and, therefore, we subsequently decree that everybody who commits sin is guilty of an offence&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems that the original Act was really an attempt to rewrite the conspiracy law.  Many of the problems we are facing nowadays, with regard to unlawful organisations, have arisen because <Col N="1244" /> this attempt was not successful. I would prefer to have seen action taken against unlawful organisations. The mere fact of proscribing, naming and suppressing an unlawful organisation, as such, gives that organisation a kind of glamour status in some people's eyes which would not happen if the people who founded it were prosecuted under other enactments or under the common law relating to conspiracy.  This would have been the better course of action in 1939.  If it had been adopted, then we might now have a more satisfactory and consistent body of case law to follow rather than this imperfect legislation.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke several times about membership as being the only way in which he would get the chiefs of various organisations.  I wonder whether an incitement charge could have been brought against them, in many cases, instead of the membership one?  Senator O'Higgins has already said that section 3 (1) (a) is acceptable to him.  It is acceptable to me also but I wonder whether it will add anything new to current practice. In a recent court case, which received a great deal of publicity, statements made by an accused person were adduced as evidence that he was a member of an unlawful organisation and were capable of being interpreted as giving that effect.  If this happened before this Bill is passed, I wonder if section 3 (1) (a) will add anything new.</P>
    <P>I have a similar problem in relation to section 3 (1) (b) which reads:</P>
    <P>In paragraph (a) of this subsection &ldquo;conduct&rdquo; includes omission by the accused person to deny published reports that he was a member of an unlawful organisation...</P>
    <P>Do the published reports have to be reports published after the date of this measure or can they be reports which were published prior to the enactment of this legislation?  As drafted at present, this section could make reports that were made prior to the enactment of this Bill evidence in proceedings.  I wonder if this does not import a rather dangerous provision into the legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary to tell the House how many suppression orders have been made and in respect of what organisatons.  Is the position at present that the only repression order made declares that Irish Republican Army, also the IRA and Óglaigh na hÉireann, to be an unlawful organisation? That suppression order was made sometime after the passing of the 1939 Act.  Are there any other illegal organisations declared by suppression orders?  If not, does the Minister contemplate making any suppression orders in relation to organisations from across the Border that may operate here?  The Minister should apply the provisions of this Bill, and the other Offences Against the State Acts, to such organisations if the activities which they endeavour to carry on in this State are activities which would come within the ambit of this legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I have one small point to make on this section regarding subsection (2).  I would have thought it preferable if these powers had been given to superintendents or district officers who would be familiar with members of illegal organisations.  Many of the chief superintendents would live some distance from the districts from which those people would operate or live.  Why did the Minister decide to give these wide powers to the chiefs? The man who would know the individual concerned would be the district officer or the superintendent.  If those people had the powers there would be less likelihood of people being wrongly accused of being members of an illegal organisation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBelton" hpid="Dr. Belton Dr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to refer in particular to subsection (1) (b) of section 3, which reads:</P>
      <P>In paragraph (a) of this subsection &ldquo;conduct&rdquo; includes omission by the accused person to deny published reports that he was a member of an unlawful organisation, but the fact of such denial shall not by itself be conclusive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is outrageous.  It is objectionable because the person referred to may <Col N="1246" /> be away for six months or longer and may not have read it, or he may not be living in the State.  He may not have seen the particular publication or journal in which there was a reference to his being a member of an unlawful organisation.  Therefore, I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary who is acting for the Minister that if anything of this nature arises, the person thereby involved should by registered letter be informed that this would be evidence in court.</P>
    <P>I can see the fallacy of this subsection as it stands.  However, I would consider evidence of a registered letter properly receipted by the person to whom it is sent.  That is the point I want to make under this subsection.  In my view it is too loose.  It can be adduced as an offence, even if he has not seen the report.  Who can controvert the fact that he has not seen it?  Who can controvert the fact that he has not been told about it?  If you want to catch a man under this particular section, you must have evidence and proof, and I do not think any case would stand up in court, if the person referred to in the subsection had not seen it.  Who is to prove he had not seen it?</P>

      <P>I should like to deal with Senator Belton's point.  In section 3, subsbection (1) (b), you will find that the word &ldquo;conduct&rdquo; relates to section 1, subsection (a), &ldquo;or any conduct by an accused person implied or leading to a reasonable inference that he was, at a material time, a member of an unlawful organisation&rdquo;.  Therefore, there could be no doubt about what it means.  I should like to assure the Senator that he has raised a very interesting point and it should be given mature consideration.</P>

I understand that this subsection in the principal Act was written rather in the terms of subsection (2) of section 3 in relation to another offence.

There is a provision that that statement should also be accepted as evidence.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>In subsection 1 (b) lines 15 and 16 to delete &ldquo;or is of such a character as to be likely&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I move this amendment in order to remove what I regard as a wrong negation of the principle that a person must have <i>mens rea</i> in a criminal offence and must have the intention to commit a criminal offence and that nobody should be convicted of a crime or conduct likely to interfere with the course of justice unless he had an intention of interfering with it.</P>
      <P>As section 4, subsection (1) (a) stands at the moment it provides&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Any public statement made orally, in writing or otherwise, or any meeting, procession or demonstration <Col N="1249" /> in public, that constitutes an interference with the course of justice shall be unlawful.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Section 4, subsection (1) (b) provides&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A statement, meeting, procession or demonstration shall be deemed to constitute an interference with the course of justice if it is intended, or is of such a character as to be likely, directly or indirectly to influence any court, person or authority concerned with the institution, conduct or defence of any civil or criminal proceedings (including a party or witness) as to whether or how the proceedings should be instituted, conducted, continued or defended, or as to what should be their outcome.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>My grave exception to the words &ldquo;or is of such a character as to be likely&rdquo; is because they mean that a person need have no criminal intent in the way that is normally required in the criminal law and that a person may be judged by an objective standard because of the words &ldquo;likely, directly or indirectly, to influence any court&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This goes beyond the normal bounds.  Like the other Senators here tonight I am almost too tired to express the degree of my concern for this.  The amendment would have the effect of deleting that phrase and then subsection (b) would read&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A statement, meeting, procession or demonstration shall be deemed to constitute an interference with the course of justice if it is intended directly or indirectly to influence any court, person or authority concerned with the institution, conduct or defence of any civil or criminal proceedings...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Surely this is as far as this House should be prepared to go in the creation of a criminal offence.  The Minister explained that this section is a statutory outlining of contempt of court and the creation of a statutory penalty.  It also allows members of the Garda Síochána to initiate proceedings for contempt on the grounds that it is an interference with the course of justice.</P>
    <P>I will have comments to make on the general phrasing of the section bus as <Col N="1250" /> far as I am concerned the section would be greatly improved if &ldquo;or is of such a character as to be likely&rdquo; was deleted.  Here one can draw an analogy with our attitude towards the crime of murder.  There was a tendency by the courts to rely on an objective test of <i>mens rea</i>, if a person was pursuing a course of conduct likely to result in the death of another person.  Then, regardless of his actual intent, if that person was killed this would be sufficient for murder.  There was a classic case of this in England in 1960, the DPP against Smith.  This is now being changed by statute in England.  There is no change here but there is a statutory provision to make it clear that a person could not be convicted of murder by conduct likely to cause death unless he intended to cause either death or serious injury.</P>
    <P>The Criminal Justice Act, 1964 defines malice of forethought which is the <i>mens rea</i> for murder and defines it in such a way as to remove the possibility of this sort of objective assessment of conduct which is not considered or does not necessarily mean that the person would have intended either directly or indirectly to do what is undesirable, that is, to influence any court, person or authority concerned. It means that the prosecution do not have to prove any malicious intent as such.  If they can prove that the person's conduct was likely, directly or indirectly, to influence any court, person etc. then that is sufficient to sustain a conviction for contempt. This goes far beyond what is acceptable; the amendment leaves the section effectively fulfilling the obligation that the Minister deems necessary, and we ought to consider it even at this late stage.</P>

      <P>This is a technical legal amendment and I bow to Senator Robinson's superior legal knowledge. I ask the Minister and the Government to look at this and the following amendment and to judge from them how little difference there is between us on this particular point.  We are all concerned about the same thing. This amendment in the names of Senator Robinson and myself is an eminently reasonable and sensible one. <Col N="1251" /> If we were not discussing it in these particular circumstances it would be dealt with more reasonably and sensibly on the other side of the House. I regret that that is not the case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>With Senator Horgan I bow to Senator Robinson's legal knowledge but I wish I could pay the same tribute to her common sense. This Bill is attempting to deal with a number of problems, one such problem is that the course of justice is being interfered with.  When legal proceedings are taking place in court there are protests, marches and so on outside which, in many cases, are likely to lead to abuse of justice.  This section of the Bill will enable the Government to do something about that.</P>
      <P>It is possible to meet a person who says, and genuinely believes, that he is not interfering with the course of justice and that he has no intention of interfering with it.  He may have his own idea of what justice should be and of the way he would like the course of justice to run.  In a few cases these people may genuinely believe that they are not interfering and that they are entitled to organise marches and have hundreds of people demonstrating outside the courts.  Nevertheless it would be clear to any reasonable person to see that this activity is, in fact, interfering with the course of justice.  Consequently it is essential that these words be left in and it illustrates, once again, the blind spot which Senator Robinson has in her approach to this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>She is concerned, and is quite right to be concerned, about the position of a person who is accused of an offence under this Bill.  But she seems to be quite unconcerned and to pay no regard at all to the question of public policy, to the fact that there are abuses, that something must be done to prevent their continuation. If she looks at that side of the coin and has any regard for the fact that these abuses exist and that something should be done about them, she must realise that it is not merely sufficient to talk about a person who intends to do something but also to talk about a situation where the activity is of a <Col N="1252" /> character which is likely to lead to interference with the course of justice.</P>

I should like to resolve the conflict which appears to be between the views of the Minister and Senator Ryan.  The Minister was very emphatic when dealing with section 4 in reply to the Second Stage debate that <i>mens rea</i> was necessary and that guilty intent must be shown and that that was an integral part of our law and continued to apply in relation to section 4 of this Bill.</P>
      <P>I hope I have not been unfair to the Minister in summarising his views in relation to this matter.  Assuming I have summarised the Minister's views correctly, may I now summarise Senator Ryan's views which, as I understand them, are that in relation to this setion you can forget about intent.</P>

If this is correct then the question of <i>mens rea</i> need not necessarily enter this subsection of section 4.  It is because it is not the intention that <i>mens rea</i> should enter into it that these words are included in the subsection. I should like to know is the Minister correct or is Senator E. Ryan correct?  The easiest way to find out is to ask the Minister bluntly if, in relation to section 4 (1) (b), <i>mens rea</i> is an essential part of the offence.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>In subsection (2), line 23, before &ldquo;makes&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is another attempt to introduce the requirement of <i>mens rea</i>, the requirement of a mental element, into this section, and it provides for the insertion of the word &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo; into subsection (2) of section 4.  It would then read:</P>
      <P>A person who knowingly makes any statement, or who organises, holds or takes part in any meeting, procession, or demonstration, that is unlawful under this section shall be guilty of an offence...</P>
      <P>The object of the amendment is to try to give some protection to the person by preventing circumstances occurring as they could occur under the present text of the Bill.  As I read it, a person could go along and join at the end of a procession or demonstration and be a curious bystander.  If the meeting was of such a character as to be likely, directly or indirectly, to influence any court, person or authority concerned with the institution, conduct or defence of any civil or criminal proceedings, that person could be liable to be guilty of an offence under this section.</P>
      <P>I remind the Seanad that the penalties under this section can be particularly high.  A person can be convicted on indictment to a fine not exceeding £1,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years or to both such fine and such imprisonment.  We ought not to create new criminal offences where there is no requirement of <i>mens rea</i> in the sense of an intention to be involved in conduct hitherto governed by contempt of court.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but taking part is an action.  It is more than just happening to look on as you wander past.  So far as the necessity for the word &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo;, in regard to a person making a statement, is concerned, the law presumes that someone who unknowingly makes a statement is not guilty.  If he is insane or drunk and does not know what he is saying he is not guilty.</P>

It would not cover the situation where the statement or conduct was &ldquo;likely to be&rdquo; an interference with the course of justice.  If one inserted the word &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo; it would be necessary to take out all the words other than &ldquo;intended&rdquo;.  That <Col N="1255" /> would narrow not only the section, which is a valid enough point, but also the existing law on contempt.</P>

I would be worried about deeming it to be of such a character as to be likely, directly or indirectly, to influence any court, person or authority concerned.  I would have thought that the present law in relation to contempt of court which still remains is sufficient to protect a court against the activity of someone who may not intend to interfere with the course of justice in that sense but the court can nevertheless hold that person in contempt.  I am not satisfied with the example the Minister has given.</P>

It is only right that anything which constitutes an interference, whether by means of meeting, procession, statement, words, intimidation of one sort or another with the course of justice, should be stamped on hard.  I make no apology for saying that.  The Minister gave us the example of the possibility of a meeting called by what he described as a front organisation ostensibly for one purpose but which is turned into a meeting designed to interfere with the course of justice. If a front organisation does that then I want it to be stamped on under the law of this land, assuming that the front organisation were deliberately lending themselves to that kind of manoeuvre with the idea of getting around this legislation.  The following is a different matter, and this is possibly what Senator Robinson had in mind when she said it would create more worry for her.  If an innocent organisation holds a meeting for one purpose and the meeting is taken over by a group&mdash;the Minister will understand I am not taunting the Fianna Fáil Party when I use the expression&mdash;of dissidents who then&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>No, indeed not.  Subsection (2) of section 4 adds something to a provision which is already in the Offences Against the State Act.  The section as a whole adds the offence of interference with the course of justice.  I am in favour of a proposal to define such an offence and make people who commit it liable to the penalties.</P>
      <P>I object to the extension of the already stringent terms of the 1939 Act contained in subsection (2).  Section 27 of the 1939 Act is the relevant one here. It refers, admittedly, only to public meetings of an unlawful kind.  It makes only those who organise, hold or attempt to organise or hold such meetings liable to prosecution.  This is the proper way of operating.  I consider the words &ldquo;or takes part in&rdquo; dangerously vague.  They will catch the innocent bystander. It is in effect saying that anyone who follows a band to listen to the music shares the political convictions of the conductor.  This is an enormous assumption to make about anybody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The difficulties which the Minister <Col N="1258" /> faced in the drafting of this section&mdash; I sympathise with him in his attempt to draft a section of this kind&mdash;illustrate to us the whole problem of dealing with meetings and processions.  For example, I would have been happier, if together with this section there was one placing an obligation on organisers of meetings, demonstrations and processions to notify the Garda at least one hour before the commencement of such meetings, and so on.  This would have the advantage of allowing positive identification of persons responsible for holding such meetings, processions or demonstrations.  It would make it easier to bring proceedings against these people in the event of the meetings, processions or demonstrations interfering or intending to interfere with the course of justice.  The state of the law in regard to processions, demonstrations and meetings pertaining to unlawful organisations is very unsatisfactory but I do not accept that this particular section is the best way to deal with the situation.</P>
    <P>In relation to my amendment, I am worried about the possible effects of the inclusion of this phrase in subsection (2).  We must recognise that the Offences Against the State Act and the amending Act are usually used in a political way.  They are not a normal part of the armoury of the Garda Síochána.  Prosecutions are only taken under these Acts after prior consultation with the Department of Justice.  This is something which affects the whole implementation of the law with regard to processions and so on.  The section I have quoted from the 1939 Act is a pretty draconian section.  It states that:</P>
    <P>public meetings shall be unlawful if they are held by or on behalf of or by arrangement or in concert with or for the purpose of supporting, aiding, abetting or encouraging unlawful organisations.</P>
    <P>That is quite a mouthful.  I am surprised that at a time when we are being asked to introduce a piece of legislation such as is contained in subsection (2) we have no evidence placed before us of unsuccessful prosecutions brought under section 27 (1) of <Col N="1259" /> the parent Act.  The Minister gave us evidence of unsuccessful prosecutions in relation to membership.  His case, on this section, and particularly on the subsection, might have been strengthened if he gave us similar evidence in regard to public meetings, unlawful processions and so on.</P>
    <P>The problem is&mdash;section 28 of the 1939 Act which relates to processions near and around the Houses of the Oireachtas is also relevant in this connection&mdash;that there has been a history of dual reaction to illegal processions. They have been either ignored, because it was politically inexpedient to prosecute the people concerned, or they have been exploited because, equally, it was politically expedient to exploit them at a particular time. It is because it is almost impossible to implement a law relating to processions and demonstrations in a way which is not strongly political that this whole section creates considerable problems.</P>

      <P>If a man comes along to a meeting and he realises its purpose or nature when he hears what is being said, and remains, the question whether he takes part in it <Col N="1260" /> or not will depend on what he does. Examples I should like to give are that, if he joins in the discussion, asks questions, applauds and so on, he is likely to be considered as taking part. If he stays for a short time out of curiosity and says nothing, he would not be taking part.  If he only protests that the meeting is a disgrace, or illegal, he will not be taking part.

      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 4 stand part of the Bill&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>At this time of night one almost gets a persecution complex.  I was thinking, while listening to some of the debate, that I could forsee circumstance where I might be caught very easily under the terms of the Bill.  I should like to ask the Minister if he does not agree that this is possible under the Bill.  The section refers to:</P>
      <P>Any public statement made orally, in writing or otherwise... that constitutes an interference with the course of justice shall be unlawful.</P>
      <P>This means any public statement.  It says that a statement&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>shall be deemed to constitute an interference with the course of justice if it is intended or is of such a character as to be likely, directly <Col N="1261" /> or indirectly, to influence any court, person or authority including a party or witness...</P>
    <P>Recently, there was a case before the High Court dealing with constitutionality of section 7&mdash;the provision prohibiting the sale and distribution of contraceptives&mdash;of the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act.  There was a decision given on that case by a High Court judge and I went on television and made a statement criticising, very sharply, the decision of the High Court judge and the reasons for his decision. I do not think anything I said would influence the High Court judge.  I do not flatter myself that anything I may say here would influence a High Court judge or, more important still, would influence a Supreme Court judge, but it might well influence the parties to the case as to whether they should appeal&mdash;in this instance as to whether Mrs. McKee should appeal to the Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>Although I have no intention of influencing the case, the wording of the section is so broad that this would seem to be a case where I would, technically, have made a statement which would be likely to influence the course of justice.  This example shows the ridiculously wide nature of the section.  For that reason, I believe it is unconstitutionally vague.  There is a great problem attached to defining the scope of &ldquo;contempt of court&rdquo;. In this section we have a legislative re-enactment of the gist of &ldquo;contempt of court&rdquo;.  I do not believe that we have sufficient precision or safeguards in it.  I would welcome clarification on that point.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister a simple question on the section.  It relates, in particular, to section 4 (1) (b) which reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A statement, meeting, procession or demonstration shall be deemed to constitute an interference with the course of justice if is intended, or is of such a character as to be likely, directly or indirectly to influence any court, person or authority concerned with the institution, <Col N="1262" /> conduct or defence of any civil or criminal proceedings&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>Under this paragraph we have a situation where a statement, made for the purpose of influencing a court, shall incur all the penalties provided here.  I wish to visualise a situation where the Minister is back in private life, practising as a solicitor, or the Parliamentary Secretary is back in private life, practising as a barrister, or Senator Mrs. Robinson practising as a barrister.  They go into court on behalf of a client and make statements with the deliberate intention of persuading the court, on behalf of their clients.  Is that situation not captured by this paragraph?</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  They are privileged if they make the statements in court.  The Senator knows that as well as I do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the privilege that is being removed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The privilege is not being removed.  The draftsman was told to draft this on the basis that he would re-enact, in statutory form, part of the existing law on contempt. He has done so to the best of his ability and I am advised that it is as near as is humanly possible to make it to the existing law on contempt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it the Minister can safely go back to private practice in that case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>In fact, I should love to go back.  As far as Senator Robinson's problem about the lady who lost her case in the High Court is concerned, Senator Robinson's statements on the case obviously could not affect the High Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I said that but what about the woman herself if it did affect her in her decision as to whether or not she would appeal?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>You are always entitled to suggest to someone that they should proceed with the case, but the general tone of what Senator Robinson said in relation to that case would seem to put her in a grave <Col N="1263" /> danger of being in contempt of court at present.  I am not sure if a person is allowed to make public statements at the moment saying that a decision of the High Court was stupid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>That is my point. Up to now I have always felt happy that I could do so without being prosecuted for contempt of court.  This is done in other jurisdictions.  Up to now I could take a judgment of the High Court, analyse the reasons for it, say that I disagreed with it and write a legal article or make a statement about it.  The reason why that was not contempt of court and the reason why I felt happy on my knowledge of contempt of court was that I could not, in fact, influence the court before which the appeal would come.  I could not influence the Supreme Court because the Supreme Court would not be influenced in their own proper judgment and discretion in the matter.</P>
      <P>What we have done here, in the very wide wording of the section, is to say that any public statement&mdash;</P>
      <P>...shall be deemed to constitute an interference with the course of justice if it is intended, or is of such a character as to be likely, directly or indirectly to influence ...a party or a witness as to whether or how the proceedings should be instituted, conducted, continued or defended, or as to what should be their outcome.</P>
      <P>On the wording of that, it seems to be contempt of court, even if I was not very critical of the court but merely pointed out that arguments had not been made by a defence counsel that might have been made, that there was room for appeal in the case and encouraged the party to take it further. That amounts to an offence, reading it in the way in which the section is framed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>All I can say is that the person will not be any more in contempt of court or in danger of committing an offence after this section is passed than she is now.  I say that without prejudice as to whether or not she <Col N="1264" /> already had committed contempt of court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept this because the wording of the section goes very far.  The fact that &ldquo;a character is likely, directly or indirectly to influence any court, person or authority concerned with the institution, conduct or defence of any civil or criminal proceedings (including a party or witness) as to whether or how the proceedings should be instituted, conducted, continued or defended, or as to what should be their outcome&rdquo; is much wider than contempt of court, and the Minister knows that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but what the Senator is talking about is trivial.  There is scarcely a provision of the criminal law that is not open to technical breaches.  The best way to overcome the Senator's difficulties is to bear in mind the effect of the maxim <i>De minimis non curat lex.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but normally I would have the protection that there would have to be <i>mens rea</i>.  Here we have even eliminated the intent involved. Normally, one could say that this circumstance would not arise because you would not have the necessary intent but, since we do not need any intent here, this does not arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">

      <P Just="Center">SECTION 5.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 10:</P>
      <P>To delete paragraphs (b) (c) and (d).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In talking on this amendment, I should like to start by referring to the last thing the Minister has said.  He said it was almost impossible to draft criminal legislation that did not create technical infringement of a minor kind. It is my understanding that the clauses <Col N="1265" /> in section 5, which I am proposing to delete, create vast numbers of technical infringements, so many technical infringements that it cannot possibly be described as good law.  Definition sections are notoriously double-edged and this one is more double-edged than most.  It creates a situation in which you are casting a net which catches literally thousands of people for the sake of a conviction of maybe ten or 20 people.</P>
    <P>I shall explain what I mean by reference to the Principal Act.  The three paragraphs of the section seeking to delete can be divided very neatly into two lots.  Paragraph (c) stands by itself; (b) and (d) for the purposes off my argument go together.  I should like to deal first with paragraph (c), which adds to the definition of &ldquo;document&rdquo; in section 2 of the Act of 1939:</P>
    <P>any disc, tape, sound track or other device in which sounds or other data (not being visual images) are embodied so as to be capable (with or without the aid of some other equipment) of being reproduced therefrom.</P>
    <P>First of all, I would refer the House to the definition section in the original Act.  The second definition section in the Act is section 3, which defines a seditious document in the following way:</P>
    <P>A seditious document is a document in which words, abbreviations or symbols referable to a military body are used in referring to an unlawful organisation.</P>
    <P>By adding to the definition of &ldquo;document&rdquo; the definition in paragraph (c) of this section we are adding a vast amount of material which is commonly available in this country at present to the category not only of document but of seditious document. There are numbers of ballad groups in this country who sing songs about, or purporting to be about, an organisation known as the IRA.  Many of these ballad groups have cut records into which these songs are permanently inscribed and which are sold all over the country.</P>
    <P>If we pass this section unamended <Col N="1266" /> it will mean many things.  First, I presume that all these balladeers will be technically liable to prosecution for being members of unlawful organisations; secondly, it would mean that any shops in which are gramophone records using these abbreviations or symbols of words would also be liable to prosecution.  Under section 24 of the original Act, it would also mean that the proprietors of such shops would automatically be proved to be members of illegal organisations.  Section 24 of the original Act states that proof of membership can be supplied by possession of an incriminating document relating to the said organisation. If it is plain that one of these records is, at least technically, an incriminating document, it is equally plain that the person who is in possession of it, or on whose premises it is found, is liable to the penalties under the Principal Act.</P>
    <P>The Minister may object that this is a bagatelle and that these are not the people he means to catch.  We are in danger of enacting a situation here in which the proportion between the technical offences that are caught by the Act and the real offences which the Act seeks to catch is absolutely grotesque and unreal.</P>
    <P>I now wish to refer to (b) and (d) together.  Paragraph (b) extends the definition to include any photographs; (d) refers to any &ldquo;film, microfilm, negative, tape or other device&rdquo;.  I will not read the whole paragraph.  If we look at section 13 (1) of the original Act, it refers to anybody who prints a document for reward.  In section 5 of this new piece of legislation we are extending the definition of &ldquo;document&rdquo; to include any photograph or film.  It is also a fairly legitimate conclusion to draw that the act of processing, developing and printing film will be, when this becomes law, printing a document for reward.  Under the original Offences Against the State Act certain obligations are laid on people who print documents for reward.  They are:</P>
    <P>(a) at the time of or within twenty-four hours after printing such document, print or write on at least one copy of such document the name and address of the person for whom or <Col N="1267" /> on whose instruction such document was printed:</P>
    <P>(b) retain, for six months from the date on which such document was printed, a copy of such document on which the said name and address was printed or written as aforesaid.</P>
    <P>This is again what appears on the surface to be another example of a simple definition.  It suddenly puts thousands of people into a situation in which they are technically in breach of the law. I would accept the Minister's contention that no criminal law can be drafted without allowing for some minor technical infringements, but my basic objection to this is my basic objection to the other one as well.  It is the disproportion between the technical offences which are automatically created by this heedless extension of the definition section. The good which the section seeks to achieve is so grotesque as to make it an absolutely absurd piece of legislation.</P>

It is unlikely to be repealed in my lifetime or even after that if one can judge by its predecessors, and by the fact that the State of emergency which was created over 20 years ago under the earlier Offences Against the State Act is still with us.

      <P>The various sections which have been debated, the points that have been raised and the amendments that have been put forward, leave doubts in the minds of Senators on this side of the House as to the desirability, and in one or two instances which we pointed out, the constitutionality of the Bill.  For that reason it is appropriate that this Bill should be submitted by the Presiden to the Supreme Court for a ruling as to its constitutionality under Article 26.</P>
      <P>This Bill did not have the normal time in the House.  It has not got the emergency procedure written into it that the Bill will only last for 90 days and, if it is to be a permanent part of our statute books, then I feel it is appropriate that the President, after consulting the Council of State, should refer this Bill to the Supreme Court, and that the Supreme Court should review its sections to see whether they are a constitutional limitation on the freedom of the individual. I hope this will not be misinterpreted by others.  I am not a supporter of an unlawful organisation and I abhor, as much as any Senator on the other side of the House, the violence and tragedy which have hit this part of the country in the past few days.  I also deplore the violence in the North over the past three years which I do not distinguish from the violence here.</P>
      <P>The parliamentary process has been sadly inadequate in relation to this Bill in so far as it will be a permanent part of our legislation since it has no time limit.  Therefore, I feel that it is an appropriate Bill, and the sort of Bill that Article 26 was intended to cover, for the President, after consultation with the Council of State, to refer to the Supreme Court on the question of whether the sections constitute a legitimate and constitutional curtailment of the liberty of the individual.</P>

      <P>I am glad there is provision in this Bill to apprehend people who, in the opinion of the Garda, and the public, are manufacturing bombs which could kill 50 or 100 people.  I know that, as a result of this Bill, the Garda authorities will be in a position to arrest a man who one month ago could have killed 60 people, 50 yards from my place of business.  There is provision in this Bill for the Garda to arrest a man if he repeats an action which he was guilty of in the past when he organised a mob&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I bow to your ruling, Sir, at this unearthly hour of the morning.  I have many examples of why this Bill is a good one; and I repeat that, if some of the Senators had as much information on the subject as I have, they would welcome the Bill.  When the people of Ireland are given an opportunity to study its implications, the name of the Minister for Justice will go down in history.</P>

      <P>As the leader of the party with a majority in this House and which could have exercised their rights and privileges under Standing Orders here tonight, I should like to say to Senator Robinson that her insinuation that there was any attempt to cut short the debate is entirely out of court.  She and Senator Horgan had ample time to make their case. I resent the idea she has tried to put across that there was an attempt to steamroll this Bill through the House. It got a long and wide-ranging discussion and there was only one &ldquo;vótáil&rdquo;, and it did the trick.</P>
