      <P>Beartaítear leis an mBille seo na toghcháin áitiúla a chur ar athló ar feadh bliana go dtí Meitheamh, 1973.  Beartaítear, freisin, mír 5 den Acht Toghcháin, 1963, a leasú sa chaoi nach mbeidh sé ceadaithe as seo amach duine a chlárú mar togthóir rialtais áitiúil ach amháin san áit a mbíonn gnáthchónaí air.

      <P>The Government's decision to seek postponement of the local elections for a period of one year was based on two considerations.  In the first place legislation is being prepared to effect certain reforms in the local government system arising from the White Paper on Local Government Reorganisation and it is clear that these changes could not be implemented in time to permit the holding of local elections at the appointed time, that is, during the month of June this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="4" /> Secondly, it was considered undesirable that local elections should be held on a date which would be so close to the polling day appointed for the referendum in relation to membership of the European Communities. While Senators may regret the necessity to postpone the local elections I am sure they will agree that this was the proper course to take in the circumstances. The Bill provides that local elections will be held in June, 1973 and every fifth year thereafter and extends the terms of office of existing members of local authorities accordingly. Minor consequential arrangements are made in relation to appointment of school attendance committees and in relation to certain meetings of vocational education committees.</P>
    <P>Section 1 of the Bill provides that a person shall be entitled to be registered as a local government elector in a local electoral area if he has reached the age of 21 years and is ordinarily resident in that area.  In future, therefore, nobody may be registered more than once as a local government elector. I am sure the Seanad will agree that this last vestige of the property qualification for the local government vote should be removed before the next local elections are held.</P>
    <P>The reference to 21 years merely repeats the existing provision in regard to age and is repeated here solely for reasons connected with drafting.  As announced previously it is proposed to hold a referendum on the voting age for Dáil and presidential elections and referenda in the autumn.  If the people at this referendum approve of the reduction of the voting age for Dáil and presidential elections to 18 years legislation will be introduced to make a similar reduction in the voting age for local elections.  The Government's position is that they favour votes at 18 for all elections but consider that the voting age for local elections should not be reduced until the people have given their decision in relation to Dáil and presidential elections.  On this basis, if the proposal is approved by the people, it may be expected that the names of the 18 to 21 year old voters will be on the register coming into force in April next and that they will be able to vote at the local elections in <Col N="5" /> June, 1973.  The necessary amendment of the Constitution Bill was introduced in the Dáil this morning.</P>
    <P>This Bill also removes the disqualification for membership of local authorities on the grounds of being a bankrupt or of having received general assistance during the preceding 12 months.  These disqualifications are contained in the Local Government (Application of Enactments) Order, 1898, and are considered to be out of touch with current thinking, which is that the electorate is entitled to the widest choice possible in selecting its representatives.  I am sure Senators will agree that these disqualifications should be removed before the next local elections are held.</P>
    <P>I recommend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a Bill which, in the main, gives effect to the Minister's earlier announcement regarding the postponement of the inevitable&mdash;that is the postponement of the local elections for 12 months from June of this year until, as the Parliamentary Secretary has said in his opening remarks, June, 1973.</P>
      <P>The danger I see in a course such as this&mdash;this is the third time such a thing has happened in relation to the last two local elections&mdash;is that it has resulted, on each occasion on which it has happened, in a downgrading of the status of local authorities.  This results in a feeling among the general public that local authorities must not be all that important if the Houses of the Oireachtas see fit to postpone the elections for membership of those authorities.  This is the main fear which will be expressed by Members of this House, or of the other House, in speaking on this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This occurs at a time in the development of our State when all of our democratic institutions need every support which can be afforded to them by those in public life, and their importance and their status is in need of being unheld and emphasised.  For that reason it is, perhaps, unfortunate that the Minister for Local Government, through his emissary here today&mdash;his Parliamentary Secretary&mdash;<Col N="6" /> has asked us to accept a Bill which will postpone the elections to those great democratic institutions which have given such sterling service to the State since its inception.  We all know &mdash;and many of us have served or are still serving on local authorities&mdash;of the very great contribution which they make to the way in which this State is run and has been run.  It would be unfortunate if the feeling were to get abroad that we, in the Houses of the Oireachtas, cared so little for them that we were prepared lightly to postpone the very important business of giving the general public the opportunity of deciding who should be the members of the local authority for their area.  It is no harm to remind the House that originally the elections for local authorities took place every three years.  Some considerable time ago that was extended to five years. In my opinion, three years is probably too short a period in which to ask anybody to serve as a member of a local authority.</P>
    <P>In 1965, a Bill, somewhat similar to this, was introduced in the Oireachtas, which postponed for a period of 12 months the elections which were due that year.  Before that period of 12 months had elapsed another Bill was introduced postponing for a further 12 months the local elections, which were scheduled belatedly for 1966. Now the following elections, which should take place five years after the local elections of 1967, if this Bill is agreed to, are to be postponed for a further period of 12 months.</P>
    <P>How are we to be sure, how are members of local authorities to be sure, how are the administrative staff of local authorities and, most important, how are the general public to feel happy in their minds that, if this Bill is agreed to, the local elections which they would like to see taking place, will in fact take place in 12 months time?  We all know that there are at least two, and probably three, further local government Bills which will be brought before the Houses of the Oireachtas during the next 12 months. Any of those will give the Minister an opportunity of further postponing the democratic process of allowing the general public to excercise their franchise <Col N="7" /> and elect members to the local authorities.</P>
    <P>In his opening remarks the Parliamentary Secretary said&mdash;and indeed the explanatory memorandum also says &mdash;that this Bill will have the effect of postponing the elections until June, 1973.  I cannot find anywhere in the few short sections of the Bill any mention of the month June.  The Bill itself says that the election should be held in the year 1973 and quinquennially thereafter. I should be grateful if the Parliamentary Secretary, in his reply, would explain to the House how we can take it as being very definite, from the wording of this Bill, that the elections will take place in June.  My reading of the Bill is that the elections could take place in November or December of 1973.  Perhaps the explanation is in the fact that the elections of 1967 took place in the month of June, probably on this day&mdash;28th June, 1967.  Perhaps that is the reason the Parliamentary Secretary can feel so sure that June, 1973, is the date on which the postponed elections might now take place.</P>
    <P>I have serious doubts as to whether those elections will take place in that month.  The Parliamentary Secretary gave as one of the two main reasons for the postponement the fact that the White Paper on Local Government Reorganisation envisaged major changes in the structure of local authorities and that legislation was now being drafted to give effect to some, if not all, of these changes.  I do not believe that half of the changes which were suggested in the White Paper are to be given effect to in one piece of legislation, which will obviously be of a very controversial nature.  I do not believe that that legislation will be drafted and will have passed through Dáil and Seanad Éireann and be signed by the President in time to allow the local elections to take place, even 12 months from today.</P>
    <P>I am quite sure that when the Parliamentary Secretary rises to reply he will disagree with me.  I hope sincerely that the Parliamentary Secretary will be the person to be proved right. It would be very wrong if he or his <Col N="8" /> Minister has to come back to this House within the next 12 months to seek a further extension of the period. Certainly, there has been no sign yet of the piece of legislation which might be termed the &ldquo;child&rdquo; of the White Paper.</P>
    <P>The second reason given by the Parliamentary Secretary for the postponement is that it would be undesirable to have held the local elections this year on a date which was so close to the date of the referendum in connection with this country's entry into the EEC.  It was therefore suggested to postpone it for 12 months from this month.  Let us consider what the Members of this House and of the other House and everyone involved in public life face in that 12-month period.  As we all know, there is a by-election pending in one of the southern counties.  There is a referendum to take place in the autumn on whether or not people of 18 and over should be entitled to vote in Dáil elections.  Within the next 12 months it is almost certain that a general election will take place.  According to the Department of the Taoiseach, the presidential election will take place some time between April and June of 1973.</P>
    <P>Yet the second reason for postponing the local elections from this year was that it would be undesirable to hold them on a date so near to the referendum.  Instead, they are to be held in a year in which we shall have, in all probability, four other occasions when we as public representatives and politicians will have to go to the hustings. It does not seem to me to be a very valid reason for postponing the elections in 1972&mdash;a year in which there was only one other occasion on which the public were asked to cast their votes&mdash;and decide to hold them in a 12-month period in which there will be four other such occasions.</P>
    <P>It is probably much more likely that it was not unacceptable to the Government, <i>per se</i>, but unacceptable to the political party which at present form the Government, that the local elections would be held in June, 1972, at a time when their stock in the country and their reputation on local <Col N="9" /> authorities is not, to put it mildly, at the highest.  In addition, it would be at a time when their performance, if those elections had been held, might not be as politically advantageous to them as would otherwise have been the case.  I suggest to the House that the reason we are being asked today to postpone for a further period of 12 months the local elections for the Twenty-six Counties is because it is not at present politically suitable to the Fianna Fáil Party to go before the electorate.</P>
    <P>In addition, there are constant and persistent rumours from various parts of the country that certain members of local authorities, inevitably&mdash;probably by coincidence&mdash;being members of the Fianna Fáil Party, have in their possession draft schemes to revise the electoral areas for the local authorities; in other words, to revise the many constituencies which go to form the local authority area.  Before we have another local authority election one of the things we will see is the redrawing of many of these local electoral areas throughout the country.  This will not be done to enhance the prospect of those candidates who do not happen to possess a cumann card.</P>
    <P>I want to turn now to what I regard as the most serious fault of this Bill. That is contained in section 1 where it is outlined that</P>
    <P>any person who has reached the age of 21 years and over shall be entitled to vote in local authority elections.</P>
    <P>Recently the Government have reluctantly agreed to the long standing proposals of other political parties that the vote at 18 should, if possible, be extended to the public.  As an addition to the Parliamentary Secretary's script, he said that the Bill to allow the referendum on this to take place was apparently introduced into the Dáil only this morning.</P>
    <P>There is no need to hold a referendum to extend to those of 18 to 21 years the right to vote in a local government election.  It merely requires a simple amendment to the local election code.  Since this Bill happens to be before the House at present this is obviously the most suitable time at <Col N="10" /> which to correct this anomaly.  The excuse the Parliamentary Secretary has given for not having so done is that he would prefer to wait to hear the views of the Irish people following a referendum, which is to take place in the autumn, on extending the vote to those of 18 and over for Dáil and local elections.  I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary and to the House that the great likelihood is that that referendum will be carried by the Irish people and, if this is so, then this Bill will have to be amended before an election is held, because of certain provisions contained in the Bill. Would it not have been more reasonable to have, as an expression of intent, the word &ldquo;18&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;21&rdquo; inserted in section 1 so that when, as it is almost certain, the people agree that those of 18 years and over be given the right to vote in Dáil elections, there will be no need for a further amendment to this Bill?</P>
    <P>We are being asked to agree to a Bill which will ensure that no local election will take place for 12 months; nevertheless, the Parliamentary Secretary is suggesting that he will have to come back some time within that 12 months to amend section 1 of the Bill now before us.  It would have been a far simpler thing to have made provision in section 1 to allow those of 18 years and over the right to vote in local government elections.  If, to the surprise to all of us here, the people decided not to agree to the referendum proposal in October, the Minister could validly come back to the House then and ask to have section 1 amended to read &ldquo;21 years&rdquo;. It is the intention of my party and myself to table an amendment to section 1 which we will be debating vigorously and will pursue to the end on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>There is a further point in relation to this.  If this Bill, as passed, contained provision for people of 18 years and over to vote in local authority elections those who compile the electoral registers in September of each year would then automatically include on their lists all persons of 18 years and over.  The referendum on votes at 18 in Dáil elections will not take place <Col N="11" /> until October, by which time the compilation of the electoral registers will already have commenced.  If, as we expect, the referendum proposal is agreed to, there will be the double task for those who compile the electoral register of having to go back once again to every household in their area and recheck in each house whether there is anybody between 18 and 21 living there.  It will require their printing a second set of draft electoral registers and virtually double the amount of the work involved in the compiling of electoral electors throughout the country.  By the simple expediency of putting the word &ldquo;18&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;21&rdquo; into this Bill that would automatically be attended to and all those of 18 and over would have their names inserted in that original draft electoral register.</P>
    <P>There is also a grave omission in this Bill, in the explanatory memorandum and in the Parliamentary Secretary's opening speech&mdash;the omission of any reference to the strange anomalous position which exists in Dublin and Bray.  If elections have had to be postponed for valid or other reasons in the other local authority areas, there is absolutely no reason why special elections, which can be held by ministerial order, should not have been held in Dublin city and Bray this year.  Whatever the reasons the democratically elected councils in those two places are no longer there, I think we all agree that that situation has obtained now for far too long and that if it was originally intended as a punishment for the supposed sin of the members of those authorities, the punishment has now been meted out in severe measure.  The punishment has been meted out not to the members of those local authorities but to the ratepayers and the general public in those areas.  I suggest that the Parliamentary Secretary should examine this position with a view to arranging for special elections in Dublin city and Bray.</P>
    <P>If this is not found feasible and if the commissioners have to be reappointed, probably around this time, it is suggested that by the device of appointing 45 commissioners, they <Col N="12" /> being the people who were originally the members of the Dublin City Council, the Minister could to some extent at least restore democracy to the Dublin City Council.  With some little reservation I agree with the provisions of section 1 which allow that&mdash;</P>
    <P>a person shall only be entitled to vote once in any local authority election.</P>
    <P>With the situation which pertains in the county it is important that we should be seen to adhere strictly to the principle of one man, one vote. We had the strange position whereby somebody could vote in the local authority area in which he lived and also vote in a different local authority area if he happened to be a property holder there.  I have a minor reservation in relation to it.</P>
    <P>A person in that position will argue that he is paying high rates on the property which he holds in that second area and consequently should be entitled to a say in the running of the local authority which administers it. That brings us to a situation not involved in this Bill and into which I do not wish to go in great detail.  If the rating system were changed, nobody could feel he was entitled to have a say because of the considerable amount of money he paid.</P>
    <P>We should adhere as strictly as we can to the principle of a person voting once at election time.  I am in agreement with the provisions of section 2 which remove what were, in my opinion, penal clauses which operated against members of local authorities who were unfortunate enough to be in financial difficulties.  I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to explain why in paragraph (b), subsection (1) of section 2, the period of five years is mentioned, when in another part of this Bill we are extending the life of the local authorities to six years.</P>
    <P>The position still obtains whereby part-time employees of local authorities are precluded from standing for election to the local authority in which they serve.  The example was given in the other House of part-time firemen, who are in no way involved in the administration of the authority or in <Col N="13" /> its day-to-day running but who provide a service to their local community often at considerable expense to themselves. This is an anomaly which should have been corrected in this Bill.  The person involved is not expected to make major administrative decisions, but he makes a contribution to his community and, by so doing, might turn out to be one of the most suitable men to serve on the authority.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that the opportunity to provide the vote at 18 years of age was not availed of and that the introduction of this Bill was not coupled with the announcement of the holding of special elections for the restoration of the Dublin City Council and Bray UDC.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. J. Fitzgerald Mr. J. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>As a member of a local authority I do not quarrel with the postponement of the local elections. Since we had the White Paper on Local Government Reorganisation, it was obvious we would not have a local election until we had legislation as a result of that White Paper.  I do not accept that the local elections are being postponed merely because we had a referendum in May last and are likely to have a referendum for votes at 18.</P>
      <P>This Bill also provides for the local elections to be held in June, 1973. Can the Parliamentary Secretary assure the House that this will happen?  Could he inform the House why the deadline of June, 1973, was inserted in the Bill? If we could be prevented from having local elections in 1972 because of one referendum and possibly a second one in this year, I find it difficult to believe we will have the local elections by June, 1973, unless we are to have a presidential election and local elections on the same day, and that is unlikely.</P>
      <P>We shall have a presidential election and this would interfere with the holding of the local elections.  It is also on the cards that we may also have a general election in 1973, so I am at a loss to know why the Bill has tied itself to the deadline of June, 1973. It would be more convenient if the end of 1973 were mentioned rather than half way through the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to commend the Minister and Parliamentary Secretary on <Col N="14" /> the introduction of the section which will end the property qualification in a local election.  Property owners were registered in any local authority area in which they paid rates.  They were entitled to vote in that area if they wished.  Many of them would have to come long journeys and did not avail of this.  They could have been challenged on having voted in another area in which they had a residence, but all this smacked of discrimination.</P>
    <P>We know what &ldquo;one man, one vote&rdquo; means, and I am pleased this has been amended in local authority elections.  I was disappointed that 21 was adopted in this Bill as the voting age.  Without reference to the Constitution we could have given votes at 18 in local elections. The Minister may have taken the view that as we are having a referendum to change the Constitution in this regard it would appear to be anticipating the result of the referendum.  The Government party have given correct forecasts in the past of referenda and everybody agrees there will be votes at 18 as a result of the referendum.</P>
    <P>I do not know what way the voters are likely to react.  All the political parties are agreed that it is time that those of 18 years of age and over, who contribute so much to our economy, should be entitled to a say in the running of our affairs.  As a gesture, we could in this Bill have amended the section in connection with votes at 21 years to give instead votes at 18 years. We expected that we would not have the local elections in 1972.  Is it possible, I wonder, that we may not even have the local elections by June, 1973? It is a great pity that the Bill ties the Minister and his Department to June, 1973, because I can envisage many difficulties in holding the local elections then and, if we cannot hold them, we will have another Bill, as we had five or six years ago, postponing them again.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotHonan" hpid="Mr. Honan Mr. Honan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill before us is very simple.  Its main purpose is to give legal effect to the postponement of the local elections this year.  The main consideration in the postponement was the fact that we were having the referendum to decide on entry to the Common Market.  This was such an <Col N="15" /> important referendum it was vital that smaller matters should not lessen the importance of the occasion.  The people reacted very well.  If we had had red herrings about local elections, the people would not have had the single purpose of deciding this very important matter.</P>
      <P>There are a few points I should like to raise on the question of residential qualifications but they would be more appropriate to the Committee Stage. The Parliamentary Secretary may, however, wish to explain some points.  We have four corporations and a number of other bodies with mayoralties.  The Bill makes reference to urban and rural bodies.  I have seen nothing to distinguish between a corporation and a mayoralty.  Clonmel, for example, has a mayoralty and they describe themselves as a corporation.  But we are just an urban council.  Are Galway, Clonmel, Drogheda, Kilkenny rated in the Bill as being corporations or urban councils?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall leave that.  I just raised the question so that the <Col N="16" /> Parliamentary Secretary would have time to consider the matter.</P>
      <P>The question of votes at 18 years of age has been introduced in this Bill and should be applicable to the election in June, 1973.  There would not be anything very wrong in this.  It is, however, a very important step and the Government are right to test popular opinion on this, because everybody does not agree.  To bring in legislation to give votes at 18 years without any reference to what the people think might not be in the best interests of either local or central government.  I agree that this should be a matter for a referendum.</P>
      <P>There is nothing revolutionary in the Bill before us.  It is only a matter of minor changes and giving legislative sanction to the postponement of the elections.  As the Leas-Chathaoirleach has suggested, we can discuss the more meaty parts on the Committee Stage.  Aspirants at local elections breathed a sigh of relief when they knew they were not going to be involved in a referendum one week and in a local election a few weeks later.</P>
      <P>I know a number of people in Dublin who are in local government and I did not hear any complaints about the postponement.  All we are doing is giving official sanction to the postponement.  I agree with Senator J. Fitzgerald that we may be making a mistake in tying ourselves to June. If we have a presidential election and, as some people are forecasting, a general election, which I hope we will not, it might be a mistake.  However, we can deal with that aspect on the next stage.  There is nothing contentious in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>On the face of it, this is a simple Bill seeking the postponement of the local elections due to be held this year to next June.  I am opposed to any postponement of the local elections.  I say that not because I dread going before the electorate or because the election would be coming too soon after the recent referendum but, after nearly 30 years in local government, I have seen a steady erosion during that time of the status of local government and the stature of local <Col N="17" /> representative.  That is my personal experience over the years.  Whenever there is an overlapping of dates in elections, the local elections are on the chopping block.  There is never any question of postponing or deferring other elections.  The local elections are the easy way out.  I have seen three or four deferments in my time&mdash;some of them admittedly for good reasons during the post-war years when it was probably difficult to hold them.  The idea of changing from the original three to five years was a good one.</P>
      <P>We should have one of two things. We should either have a fixed period for local elections which should be held no matter what other elections interfere with them.  I am a great believer in the old saying &ldquo;Where there is a difficulty and when it is faced up to, it can be overcome&rdquo;.  I have seen the local elections coinciding with the presidential election and I have also seen presidential elections coinciding with a referendum.  The coincidence of elections is nothing new in this country.</P>
      <P>With all due respect to the Parliamentary Secretary and to the Government, that reason for postponing them does not wash as far as I am concerned.  If it were found necessary to postpone them, they could easily be held next September.  There was a time when local elections were held in September, and there was no difficulty in changing it to June.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the question of the preparation of this White Paper, I do not know how long more that is going to go on.  It must have gone on for eight or nine months when the Minister for Local Government did his circuit and got together large groups.  He refused to meet small groups of public representatives. He got large groups of representatives into hotel rooms.  I personally was present at a meeting in Limerick where he met representatives from Limerick city, Limerick county, Clare and North Tipperary.  The crowd was obviously too large to have a worthwhile discussion.  I do not know what impressions the Minister took away with him, but I should hate to think that legislation would be based <Col N="18" /> on the outcome of such large meetings held all over the country.</P>
    <P>We in Limerick City Council and in Limerick County Council requested separate meetings with the Minister, or, as a last resort, that he would meet the public representative of Limerick city and county.  He declined to do this for his own good reasons.</P>
    <P>In this postponement of the local elections I see further evidence of the growing contempt for the local government system in the Parliamentary Secretary's own Department.  What disturbs me is that this apparently growing contempt for the local government system coincides with the growing apathy and indifference amongst the public at large.  We have heard in both Houses reference to the abolition of the Dublin City Council and Bray Urban Council.  I think I am right in saying that in the Dublin city elections no more than 50 per cent of the people ever bother to come out and vote.  That is a sad reflection on democracy in this country.  So little interest is taken in what should be the basic unit of local government&mdash;the city council, the county council, the urban council or the town commissioners.  The highest proportion of votes was something over 70 per cent.  That shows that somewhere between 20 and 30 per cent of the people of this country do not think it worthwhile to vote for local representatives who as well as looking after their own affairs are prepared to look after the affairs of their community.</P>
    <P>I should like to know how many of the younger people in the 21 to 30 year bracket were so disinterested that they stayed at home.  I have a feeling that it is generally the older generation&mdash; the middle-aged and upwards&mdash;who are conscientious enough to go out and vote.  One of the features of local government elections in this country at the present time is that the young generation are just not interested.  I hope that somebody can produce statistics to disprove what I am saying, but I have had considerable experience in local government myself and I am afraid that I am only too right in what I am saying.</P>
    <P>A rather inevitable result of this combination is what I describe, perhaps, <Col N="19" /> rather critically, as contempt by the Minister's Department for the local government system.  Indifference in regard to the local government elections has led all parties to find it harder and harder to get candidates of the right type and calibre to stand for local elections.  Furthermore, in my view, concurrently with the decline of interest in local government and in local representation, there is a disturbing increase throughout the country in petty crime, including destruction to private and public property.  That is true, particularly in the larger urban centres.</P>
    <P>It can be strongly argued that the lack of involvement in local affairs could be a major factor in the growing indifference to the rights of others, an indifference which is being expressed more and more in damage and destruction to property on a widening scale.  One of the strongest arguments which can be put forward in favour of giving votes to young people at 18 is the hope that in having this right they would be induced to involve themselves more in their local affairs and to take a deeper interest in the welfare and the needs of their community.</P>
    <P>In supporting the giving of votes at 18, this is one of the reasons that has activated me more strongly to favour that step.  I appreciate the position regarding the holding of a referendum first to see what the people at large think.  I am in favour of giving our younger people an opportunity of seeing what they can do at the earliest possible date.</P>
    <P>While we are critical of them at times, we must admit that they have qualities of generosity of spirit, of the desire to help others, something which is often sadly lacking in people of the older generation.  For that reason, I hope that whenever votes at 18 come &mdash;they cannot come now because they are not included in this Bill&mdash;we will see a far greater involvement of young people in local affairs.</P>
    <P>As I have already stated, the period of office of local authorities should be stated&mdash;from three to five years, and I think the longer period is far the better.  As an alternative to that, perhaps we should consider the American <Col N="20" /> system whereby, when the Government go out of office, the local authorities also go out of office.  If that system which might possibly be regarded as revolutionary were introduced, it would help to infuse new and more interest into local government elections. It might make them more political, but anybody who still thinks that because a person is labelled &ldquo;independent&rdquo; in local politics, or is known by some other title, such as &ldquo;ratepayer&rdquo; or &ldquo;farmer&rdquo;, he has not political beliefs, is living in cloudcuckoo land.  It would bring more political labels into local government.  That might not necessarily be a bad thing. I would like to see a politician wearing his label where the public can see it, and not going forward under other perhaps less noticeable titles.  The Government should seriously consider the proposal I have made, even if they cannot see their way to defining a fixed period of office.</P>
    <P>I know the question of the White Paper does not enter into this debate, but I hope the Cathaoirleach will forgive me if I refer to it in passing.  We will have an opportunity at a later date, no doubt, of discussing it in greater detail.  It is unfortunate that it has not been published in its final form before this Bill was discussed.  It would have been very helpful to all of us, both in the Dáil and Seanad, if we could have discussed the final proposals of the Minister and the Government in regard to the organisation of local government in conjunction with this Bill.  The two documents are inseparable.  The long-promised White Paper on the financing of local government is equally important to the reorganisation of local government. We are discussing this Bill, which on the surface is a relatively harmless Bill, against the background knowledge that the Minister and his officials are working hard to restructure the whole system of local government. If the White Paper is any indication as to what they have in mind, we will have less rather than more local government in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>The argument put forward very strongly by the Minister and his <Col N="21" /> officials is that the small urban council has no part to play in a modern complex local development system.  I refute that argument absolutely. The reason put forward is that the Minister cannot afford to engage a town clerk and staff.  He cannot afford to do this because the small urban districts, such as town councils, are asked to do what should not be expected of them.  The way we should approach this problem is by asking ourselves what is the smallest unit of local government we can usefully maintain, rather than how many of them we can abolish and so continue the present centralisation of local government in the Custom House in Dublin.</P>
    <P>Local government should be local in every sense of the term; the closer we can get to the grassroots and to the people, the better; because in the final analysis&mdash;and every public representative in this Chamber would agree with me&mdash;the people have shown sound common sense.  The greater the opportunity we can give them to demonstrate their comon sense in voting for their local representatives, the better.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to say anything more at this juncture but to emphasise again my opposition to this postponement. It is a retrograde step and another indication of the fact that there is very little regard in Custom House circles for local public representatives.  I am sorry to have to say that.  Perhaps I have become too identified with local government, but I have seen these changes coming with the extension of the franchise to everybody over 21, which was proper and necessary.  At the same time, however, we saw the clamping down on responsibility by the introduction of the County and City Management Act.  We extended the franchise and at the same time took away the powers.  You cannot have responsibility without powers.  In saying that, I appreciate that in a modern complex system of local government you must have permanent, efficient officials, but we should think now of a greater involvement by public representatives in the whole system of local government.  The two ideas are not necessarily incompatible. <Col N="22" /> Now that we have a young Minister in charge of the Department of Local Government, he should be directing his energies and abilities to finding a proper and reasonable solution of what should not be conflicting issues.</P>

      <P>I share the apprehension voiced because the local elections are being postponed for another year.  The reasons given are quite right.  What Senator Boland said in his opening speech was quite correct.  He said there was a great danger that the impression would be given of the Oireachtas not regarding the local authorities as playing a sufficiently valuable part in national political life and that we are therefore prepared to postpone their elections for another year, having already done this on a previous occasion. We should make absolutely clear that we value the work done by local authorities.  We regard their performance in the national political scene as being of tremendous importance.  We want to involve more people at grassroots level in the local authority scene.</P>
      <P>I share Senator Boland's apprehension that when, next year, the holding of the local authority elections in June comes up for consideration there will be other very pressing reasons why these elections should again be postponed. The pressing reasons given will be the number of elections which will be taking place in 1973&mdash;general election, presidential election, by-elections. There will be another, apparently, valid reason for postponing the local authority elections for another year.  It is a great pity that the elections were not held this year.  Perhaps a six month postponement would have been enough.  It is a dangerous principle to go on postponing these elections, and it will only do the nation harm if people feel that the attitude of the Oireachtas to local authorities is that they only play a minor role.  As Senator Russell has pointed out, it is up to us to let it be known that we feel otherwise and that we wish to see as many people as possible involved in local authority business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the proposal in section 1 of this Bill to abolish the property restrictions for electors.  It is important. <Col N="23" /> Other sections dealing with similar proposals are also to be welcomed.  I welcome very much the proposed referendum to obtain votes at 18 in the Dáil and presidential elections.  All three political parties have expressed their support for this proposal, which is a very important one.  Therefore, I see absolutely no reason why it should fail in a referendum.  It is most important, with the increase in educational levels, and the increase in political awareness of the young people, that they should get votes at an earlier age.  Everybody in this House will support that proposal.  It therefore follows that the proposals, mentioned in the Parliamentary Secretary's address, to incorporate a similar clause into this Bill by amendment later, if the referendum result turns out as expected, will be welcomed by everybody.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer briefly to the problem referred to by earlier speakers, that is the position of the corporations of Dublin and Bray.  If democracy is to function correctly the institutions must have the support of all the political parties involved.  To me, as an Independent, it is a sad reflection on all the parties involved that agreement cannot be reached on the basic principles in order to enable those two bodies to resume operations in the normal democratic manner.  I do not believe that is the fault of one particular party.  I do not know enough about this issue to place the blame on the shoulders of one party or another, but all parties must share the blame.</P>
    <P>Our democracy will manifestly fail to work unless the parties can come together on broad agreement on the way in which those corporations should work.  The sooner moves are made, be they behind the scenes or in any other way, to bring back those corporations the better.  It is highly unsatisfactory that normal democratic rights are denied to the citizens of Dublin and Bray.  I hope that the points in this regard so far made in the debate will spur the parties into action to hammer out an agreement as to what should be done with regard to the rates and when Dublin Corporation and Bray UDC will be restored.</P>

Déanaim comhghairdeas leis an Aire agus leis an Rúnaí Parliaminte as ucht cuid den óráid a tugadh i dtosach báire a bheith as Gaeilge.  Is maith an comhartha é agus tá súil agam go leanfar den deanós sin i gcásanna eile as seo amach.</P>
      <P>In the Parliamentary Secretary's opening statement the reasons are stated quite clearly as to why the local elections have been postponed until next June.  There are two perfectly valid reasons for the postponement.  In the first place, legislation is being prepared to effect certain reforms in the local government system arising from the White Paper on Local Government Reorganisation.  It is clear that these changes could not be implemented in time to permit the holding of the local elections at the appointed time, which is June of this year.  The amount of work put into this matter by the Minister, the Parliamentary Secretary and the Department illustrates quite clearly the interest of the Government in obtaining the best possible form of local government in this State, taking into consideration the needs of our time and the current thinking on matters appertaining to local government.</P>
      <P>This is a short Bill and the various provisions contained in it are worthy of the highest commendation.  Let us take the first section which states:</P>
      <P>A person shall be entitled to be registered as a local government elector in a local electoral area if he has reached the age of twenty-one years and he was, on the qualifying date, ordinarily resident in that area.</P>
      <P>That is quite definite and it rids the scene of the complexity of a voter being given the choice of voting in one area or another through having property in these areas.  Some speaker has already mentioned that it is most desirable that we stand for the principle of one man, one vote.  We stand for that principle and it is quite clear in this Bill that the Minister has placed beyond all doubt that that principle exists in the State. I am sure everybody welcomes it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="25" /> Section 2 is very commendable in as much as it does not debar a person from being a member of a local authority if through some misfortune&mdash; and such things happen&mdash;he becomes bankrupt or is compelled to take assistance of a certain form.  As the Parliamentary Secretary said in his opening remarks, such views are considered to be out of touch with current thinking, which is that the electorate are entitled to the widest choice possible in selecting their representatives.</P>
    <P>Some of my friends on the other side of the House were inclined to take the Minister to task for not predicting that the result of the autumn referendum would be a majority vote in favour of votes at 18 years.  It would take a very brave man, and possibly a reckless one, to anticipate the results of referenda at any time.  I believe the Minister was very wise in his approach. On page 2 of the Parliamentary Secretary's statement we read:</P>
    <P>The reference to 21 years merely repeats the existing provision in regard to age and is repeated here solely for reasons connected with drafting.  As previously announced it is proposed to hold a referendum on the voting age for Dáil and presidential elections and referenda in the autumn....  If the proposal is approved by the people it may be expected that the names of the 18 to 21 year old voters will be on the register coming into force in April next and that they will be able to vote at the local elections in June, 1973.</P>
    <P>I think that is a very sensible approach and I find it hard to see how the Minister could have done anything else.  If the majority of the voters are in favour of votes at 18 the adjustment can be made and everything will be in shipshape order for the local elections next year.  I hope the Bill will get a speedy passage through the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry it has been found necessary to postpone the local elections.  I do not think it was necessary to postpone the elections.  To say that the elections can be held under better conditions in 1973 is, to my mind, wishful thinking because local elections have very little to do with <Col N="26" /> the referendum and local elections should have very little to do with any other type of elections.</P>
      <P>Local authorities are far more important than most people at higher levels seem to think.  The preservation of the powers of local authorities should be one of the foremost thoughts in our minds because if we are to allow central bureaucracy to take control to a greater extent than it has at present we might as well say goodbye to local initiative, and it is on local initiative that the powers of local authorities are built.  The people who dedicate themselves voluntarily to local authorities are certainly deserving of better treatment than to be told at any particular stage: &ldquo;Your election is now postponed for a further period.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I should like to see a situation in which local authorities would be in office within a fixed period after local elections, and that nothing would change that date, whether it be a presidential election, a general election or a referendum.  It should be taken completely out of the context of central government.  Unless this is done in the future people who would wish to serve at local level will be denied giving their services to the State, and that will be the greatest loss that can happen to it during the coming years.</P>
      <P>I believe that next year will be even less auspicious than the current year for the holding of local elections.  God knows what will happen in the meantime. I do not think that even &ldquo;Old More&rdquo; can predict what exactly will be the political situation during the coming year and a half.  However, I am speaking from the point of view of an elected representative.  What about the people?  They have been working under local authorities for the past five years: at least, they have been paying their rates and have been listening to speeches at local level and have attempted to have had services provided.  It is only right that the people should have an opportunity of giving their verdict on how their elected representatives have worked during the previous five years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From my own knowledge, there are many more people becoming involved in the affairs of local authorities than <Col N="27" /> ever before.  Organisations are being set up here and there, such as rate-payers' organisations.  They are bringing before the minds of practically everybody in the area the whole working of the local authority as they see it.  These are not always the best aspects of the working of the local authority, and it means that people are more inclined to criticise than to evaluate the working of their elected representatives.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the people should be entitled to have an opportunity of pushing these fellows into the outer darkness, if they have not proved themselves, or of again sustaining them by re-electing them for a further period.  It is unfortunate that they have been denied that opportunity at this particular time.  I believe that in 1973 there will hardly be a hope at all of being able to hold local government elections.  Because of a presidential election and either a general election or by-elections&mdash;maybe two general elections&mdash;there may not be an opportunity next year of holding local government elections.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary's introductory speech and some of the speeches from Members on the other side have attempted to make the excuse that because of changes that are about to take place in local government law it was necessary to postpone the elections.  The elections have very little to do with local government law, because any regulations made by law can be imposed on an elected local authority.  The fact that the local authority will be elected cannot change whatever regulations will be made afterwards.</P>
    <P>I do not believe anybody will abolish some of the smaller local authorities and we may disregard what may be heard about that.  It would be a pity if the smaller local authorities had to be abolished.  The county area will be preserved, and will have to be preserved.  We should all ensure, as far as possible, that the county area will be preserved as the local unit for all time.  It is traditional, it has worked, and there is no reason why it should not work in the future. <Col N="28" /> I do not think that the election would have affected anything that would happen in the future.</P>
    <P>Some Senators on this side of the House have objected that the 18-year-olds have not been put on the register. I do not agree with that.  It would not be fair to put 18-year-olds on the next register before a referendum has been taken.  It would not be fair to give them votes at local authority level before they were empowered to vote in a general election.  If they were put on the register, with by-elections and perhaps a general election pending, it would cause confusion.  There would need to be distinctive letters on a register to distinguish those who were over 18 and those who were under 18 years.  It is legally necessary under the Constitution that the referendum should be held.  Although I agree entirely that people of 18 years and over should have votes, I think it is better not to have embodied in this Bill anything to give them that vote. I also agree that certain people who hitherto had been disqualified from voting and are now disqualified from becoming members of a local authority should now be allowed to become members, because the broader the spectrum in local authority work the better.  I have very little more to say except to express my regret that it was found necessary to postpone the elections.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not my intention to hold up the passage of this Bill, but I should like to say that in the Local Government (Extension of Franchise) Act, 1935, we in the Government party showed our democracy. We continued to show it by supporting the referendum to extend the voting age to 18.  To legislate for such a provision now would be putting the cart before the horse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I realise that September is the usual month in which to gather the names of those appearing on the register of voters, but the register is compiled much later.  I therefore suggest when these forms are circulated requesting the names of those who will be 21 years next April, that instead of making that request the form should ask <Col N="29" /> for the names of those under 18 years next April.  This information will then be available if and when the people vote for its passage.</P>
    <P>I should just like to refer to one other point.  I object strongly to the method of compilation of registers in many areas.  I think they are diabolical and the Minister should take up this matter with local authorities.  Generally, in urban areas they are very good, but in rural areas they are compiled in many cases alphabetically and bear no relation to the areas in which the people live.</P>

      <P>We had the experience in 1965 of local elections being postponed for a year.  The reason given at the time was because there was a pending general election.  The general election took place in 1966 and we had another postponement of the local elections until 1967.  The reason given was that there was a presidential election in 1967.  That being the situation, I can recall some years ago&mdash;perhaps on one or two occasions&mdash;having the presidential election and the local elections on the same day.</P>
      <P>I am curious to know what is the objection now to having the local elections and presidential election on the same day.  Why were the local elections not held with the referendum?  Some people think that we are dealing with an electorate not capable of voting twice on the one day.  I am not prepared to accept that.  There seems to be no other reason given.  They are afraid that they would have mixed up the local elections and the referendum on entry into the EEC.  I admit that entry into the EEC was a vital decision for the Irish people to make, but it would not have taken anything from the public if they had the opportunity of casting a vote for or against entry into EEC and at the same time, a vote for candidates in the local elections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One must feel that the 1967 elections were postponed because the Government at that time were hoping for a small vote in that presidential election. If they were they were fooled, because if my memory serves me right it was a rather high poll.  It was <Col N="30" /> one of the highest polls we had in any presidential election, and I might mention in passing that it was a close margin.  Maybe these are the reasons; but in any event the House is entitled to know.  If they were the reasons, could anybody give me the reasons why the local elections which are due this year are being postponed?  The Parliamentary Secretary said that legislation is being prepared to effect certain reforms in the local government system arising from the White Paper on Local Government Reorganisation.</P>
    <P>It is five years since we had local elections and why is it that these changes were not made in that time? Why are the Government not geared to hold the local elections in the year they are due?  It is admitting that the Government failed to do what they should have done during that five year period.  Why could the local elections not be held with the referendum which the Government hope to hold in the autumn?</P>
    <P>There are many reasons why the local elections should not be postponed. It takes away tremendously from the status of local authorities to be treating them the way they are being treated at the moment.  Some years ago we had local elections every three years; it was then extended to a five year period.  On the last occasion it was extended to a seven year period.  At the moment it is extended to a six year period and it may be a seven or eight year period. Whatever period of years Parliament agrees on for the holding of local elections should be adhered to, because it is unfair to the representatives in the area to do otherwise.  There are many problems affecting local authorities all over the country.  We have the question of planning applications.  I am not going into this in any detail but we have dissatisfaction in connection with planning applications in every county in the country.  We have a completely unjust rating system in every local authority.  We also have the situation where the Government are failing to give grants to solve the housing problem all over the country.</P>
    <P>It was mentioned earlier that we also have the problem of Dublin Corporation and Bray Urban District <Col N="31" /> Council.  I do not know whose fault it was that Dublin Corporation or Bray Urban District Council were dissolved, but I do know that they have paid their penalty.  They have been suspended for two or three years. Even at this stage it would be no harm if the election was held for Dublin Corporation in order to at least have a first citizen in this city.  The same could be said for Bray Urban District Council.</P>
    <P>According to the Parliamentary Secretary, it was considered undesirable that local elections should be held on a date which would be so close to polling day appointed for the referendum for entry into EEC.  That is not a sincere statement.  There is some other undercurrent in this which I fail to detect.  The referendum on EEC entry was held in May and the local elections should also have been held then.  The Taoiseach often talks about saving expenses in elections.  If the Government were sincere in saving expenses that was the time to save them.  That opportunity has passed, but we still have another opportunity: the referendum on the vote at 18 years of age.</P>
    <P>The vote at 18 years of age is overdue. Everybody knows that, as far back as 1965, this party accepted in its policy that it was time to give a vote to people of 18 years and over. The reasons are obvious.  There is a good percentage of people of 18 years who are paying income tax and other taxes and are justly entitled to a vote. If we do not give some power to youth, even through the ballot box, they could start taking the power to themselves.  We have seen that on numerous occasions&mdash;they have taken to the streets in protest marches of all classes and creeds.  The reason is that they feel they should have some say in government.  This is an opportunity of giving them that say by putting the responsibility on them. Give them the responsibility of becoming Members of this House and of becoming members of local authorities. When we put the responsibility on the youth, we will find that they will answer to that responsibility. <Col N="32" /> Because of the haphazard way we are going about this we are not being taken seriously.</P>
    <P>The Government, who say it is their policy to give votes at 18, had the opportunity of doing it in this Bill. It does not take a referendum to give a vote to people who are voting in the local government election; ordinary legislation can do that.  Why did we not come out and give a lead to the people of the country?  Some Senator at the other side of the House said he felt that they should wait and get the decision of the electorate.  They wanted to test the popular vote.  At the same time, they are now in the position of being able to test the popular vote in the local elections and they are not prepared to do so.  You cannot blow hot and cold at the same time.  If the Government are sincere in giving votes to people at 18, they should give a lead. They had the opportunity of giving that lead and failed to do so.  I recommend that the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary take a second look at this and let us take the initiative in this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Neither of the two reasons given are sufficiently strong to justify not holding the local elections this year.  The White Paper on Local Government was published quite a considerable time ago and it should have been possible for the Government party to have examined it and to have decided which recommendation they intend implementing immediately and the recommendations they do not intend implementing.</P>
      <P>It may have been thought wiser not to hold the local government elections prior to the next general election because a further curtailment of the powers of local authorities might react unfavourably against the Government. Local committees of agriculture have already been threatened, so there are some grounds for believing that the powers of local authorities may be curtailed when the next Bill on the reorganisation of local government is introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no justification for thinking the general public are not competent to express an opinion on our entry <Col N="33" /> into the EEC and on the same day cast a preference for a candidate in local government elections.  People who can make up their minds about an important issue such as entry to the EEC should be able on the same day to indicate whom they wish to have governing them in the local government authorities.</P>
    <P>The question of votes at 18 has been put on the long finger too often.  People at 18 are more mature and take a more active part in public affairs now. They are entering the Garda Síochána, the Army, and the Civil Service.  Therefore, they must have the ability to decide between different candidates at local government elections or between different parties at general elections. Large numbers of persons of 18 are paying income tax under PAYE.  They are contributing financially to the State at an early age and it is proper and just they should have a say in selecting those who are to represent them locally and in central government.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Local Government decided to abolish Dublin Corporation and Bray Urban Council, whether his reasons were justifiable or not, but now it would be in the interest of democracy that they should be restored after the five year period.  If a Minister feels it necessary to abolish two or three corporations or five or six county councils and then has power, through the Oireachtas, to postpone the holding of local government elections from year to year, it could be possible for the people living in these boroughs to be left without representation by elected representatives for up to 12 years. When the Minister felt it necessary to introduce measures to postpone local government elections it is a pity he did not, as a gesture of goodwill towards local authorities in general and towards the principle of democracy, announce that the corporation and the urban council which were abolished, should be restored.</P>

      <P>I welcome the contributions made by Senators and I am pleased they saw merit in many of the proposals contained in this short Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="34" /> The two main issues raised were votes at 18 and Dublin Corporation. There was an indication given that amendments would be tabled to the Bill in respect of each of these matters. Without wishing to influence anyone, I should like to point out that we are anxious to get this Bill through this House as quickly as possible.  In respect of any amendment on the question of the reinstatement of Dublin Corporation, there is provision in the 1941 Act whereby the Minister can, at any time, do exactly this.  It is not necessary to put down an amendment in order to carry into effect what is in the minds of Senators who have advocated this. It is open to them to put down amendments, but they are superfluous.  What they seek to have done could be done through the legislation which gives the Minister power to act at any time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not put down the amendment if the Parliamentary Secretary undertakes to get the Minister to use his powers under the 1941 Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot give that guarantee but the method is there and an amendment does not improve on it.</P>
      <P>This Bill does not prevent electors at the next local elections having votes at 18.  They will have votes at 18 years in the next local elections, which are to be held in June, 1973.  Today in the Dáil the Minister introduced the First Stage of the Amendment of the Constitution Bill which will enable the referendum to be held in the autumn.</P>
      <P>Senator Dalgan Lyons made a very good point here.  If there were to be a general election before June of next year the situation could arise where electors of the age group between 18 and 21 years would be entitled to vote at local elections but not at a general election.  The main point I want to get across is that the over 18s will be entitled to vote at the next local government elections.  In any case they could not be put on the register until April of next year.  To grant them votes by legislation in advance of the result of the referendum is not necessary in view of the fact that they will have votes at the next local government elections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="35" /> The question of the compilation of the register was raised.  In the compilation of the next draft register, which takes place in September, instructions will be given to have the names of those of 18 years of age and over noted.  When the official register becomes effective on the 15th April, depending on the result of the referendum, they can be included in it. Another Senator mentioned that it will be necessary to bring in a Bill to give local electors votes at 18 years of age.  I agree this is necessary, but it can be done in the Bill in connection with the general and presidential elections which must be introduced after the referendum.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons I gave for the postponement was that we did not want to have local elections before the reorganisation of local government. One Senator alleged that there was contempt by the Department of Local Government for the local government system.  This reorganisation of local government is an effort by the Minister and the Government to give more authority and power to local bodies, to leave more authority in the hands of local authorities so that they will have more freedom to take decisions.  This process is going on at the moment.  The Minister for Local Government has done this on a number of occasions. The most recent I recollect was when he sent a circular to local authorities informing them that in the case of housing, if a number of houses, less than six in the group, or any number of specific houses are to be built they do not have to refer plans, tenders or contract documents to the Department. The allegation made by Senators that there is contempt in the Department of Local Government for local authorities is not true.  The reason for the postponement of the elections is that legislation to reorganise local government is being drafted.</P>
    <P>That this reorganisation of local government should take place before the next local elections is logical and disproves the argument made on this point.</P>
    <P>The other reason given for the postponement was proximity to the recent <Col N="36" /> referendum.  This was something that was agreed and welcomed by all the parties.  I have here a statement made by Deputy Cosgrave in which he said that he was glad that the question of the EEC referendum was a single issue and not tied up with anything else which would be put before the people on that occasion. He said that it was of such importance that nothing else should be put before the people on the same day.  Having local elections on that day, as has been suggested, would not have had the agreement of any of the parties.  There were similar statements also by Deputy Corish, Deputy Thornley and others.</P>
    <P>Senator Boland mentioned the question of postponements.  There have been many postponements of local elections in the past.  The last local elections were postponed twice.  It has been so down the years under various Governments.  The suggestion that the elections could have been held in the autumn with the referendum is not a feasible one.  This year we have had one referendum and are due to have another, and in addition there may be by-elections.  The position may not be any different next year when there will be a presidential election and perhaps a general election.  However, as far as the Government are concerned, the local elections will be held in June, 1973.</P>
    <P>One Senator suggested that it should be left open-ended so that if they could not be held in June they could be held on some date in 1973.  When they are being postponed it is best to postpone them for a year.  Another Senator asked why the Parliamentary Secretary was so sure that they would be held in June.  It is laid down in section 84 of the Electoral Act, 1963, as amended by the Local Elections Act, 1966, that it shall be in June.  In other words, that there shall be a definite number of years.</P>
    <P>A statement was made that the actual draft for the proposed local government electoral areas is in the hands of cummann members and members of local authorities.  This is not so.  The Department of Local Government have no knowledge of this and I deny that it is so.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="37" /> Reference was made to the Corporation of Dublin and the Bray Urban Council.  The same arguments which apply in the case of local elections generally apply in the case of Dublin and Bray.  It is probable that quite a number of changes will be made in these areas, especially in Dublin where we have had complaints by various Deputies in the Dáil that there was overlapping.  There were complaints that there was a plethora of unsatisfactory situations where people who lived in Dublin county were tenants of corporation houses. Planning considerations are also involved and there is a very strong case to be made for reorganisation in these two areas.</P>
    <P>I do not think it would be advisable for the corporation to hold elections in Dublin.  Senator Boland suggested that instead of appointing one commissioner the Minister should appoint 45 commissioners.  I presume he has in mind the 45 ex-members of the Dublin Corporation.  I do not see any merit at all in that.  I do not know whether, if that were done, those ex-members would give any undertaking that the existing rate would be adhered to, or whether, if they were reappointed in the capacity of commissioners, the situation would be any different.</P>
    <P>The reason for the abolition of the corporation is well known.  A rate was proposed, an inquiry was held and it was found that the rate was insufficient to run the corporation and provide the services required, especially the health services and, indeed, others.  There is a statutory requirement in connection with the health services and, if less than an adequate rate were struck, one thing that would not suffer would be the health services.  Employment and other aspects of the operation of the corporation would be affected rather than health provisions because legally the health demand would have to be met anyhow.  The point I am making is that I would disagree with the suggestion that the 45 ex-members of the corporation should be appointed as commissioners.</P>
    <P>I mentioned the question of the <Col N="38" /> register.  This will be looked after to ensure that the names and addresses of 18s to 21s will be available for inclusion in the final register.</P>

      <P>In anticipation of the result of the referendum and the legislation which will be necessary Senator Russell accused the Minister of not agreeing to meet members of each local authority.  This would hardly be possible for any minister, especially a Minister as fully occupied as the Minister for Local Government.  The best he could have done and did was to meet, in some cases, members of large local authorities and, in other cases, to have regional or area meetings. He had nine such meetings.  He got the message across that he was prepared to receive, and asked for suggestions from local authorities and other bodies.  A very large number of suggestions have come to hand and as a result any legislation which is being drafted will have regard to a very wide range of information, suggestions and so on, not alone by local authorities but by the public generally.</P>
      <P>In conclusion I urge the House that it is important that we should get all stages of the Bill as quickly as possible, today, if that is feasible.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 2, line 18, to delete &ldquo;twenty-one&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;eighteen&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I would not have agreed to the amendment being taken immediately after tea had I realised that the tea break would finish at 7 o'clock because I had another meeting in the House which extended from 6.30 to 7.30 and which had to be adjourned because this house decided to resume at 7 o'clock.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason for the introduction of this amendment is because it has been, for a considerable length of time, the policy of my party to press for the introduction of the right to vote for 18 year olds and upwards in all elections. <Col N="42" /> As the House knows, the Minister for Local Government recently agreed in the other House, in response to a Private Members Bill introduced by some Members of my Party, to have a referendum in the autumn of this year in order to allow the electorate to decide on the matter of giving votes at 18 in relation to Dáil and presidential elections and referenda.</P>
    <P>As the House also knows the Constitution, as it stands at present, was careful to distinguish between those types of elections and local elections.  It specifically excluded local elections from the proviso that only those of 21 years and upwards should be allowed to vote.  We are all well aware that it requires no more than a simple amendment to the Acts of the Oireachtas to allow 18 year olds and upwards the right to vote in local elections.  Obviously, the most appropriate time to implement this was when the Local Elections Bill, 1972, came before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  For some strange reason, which, with respect, the Parliamentary Secretary has not explained very satisfactorily, the Government decided not to do so.</P>
    <P>They have included section 1 in this Bill and it is, in my opinion, a section which will never be operated.  When the Parliamentary Secretary replied to the Second Stage of this debate he made it very clear that in his personal opinion section 1 of this Bill will be amended before any opportunity to implement it arises.  It is the strangest form of Government to introduce a section, which in the words of the Parliamentary Secretary whose task it is to bring it before the House will never be implemented.  The Parliamentary Secretary said very clearly on several occasions that 18 year olds and upwards will be allowed to vote in the next local elections.  In order that that should happen section 1 will require to be amended.</P>
    <P>It was the submission of some Senators, notably Senator Honan and the Parliamentary Secretary, that it would be wrong to include 18 year olds in this Bill in anticipation of the outcome of the referendum which is due to take place in the autumn and <Col N="43" /> that it would be better to wait and allow the electorate to voice their opinion on this matter in relation to other elections before deciding whether or not to allow 18 year olds to vote in the local elections.</P>
    <P>When the Parliamentary Secretary was replying to the debate, in response to a somewhat unruly interruption of mine, in which I asked if it was in anticipation of the referendum he had decided to instruct those who would be compiling the electoral register to take note of the people of 18 to 21 years in each household, he very courteously replied that it was in anticipation of the result of the referendum that the compilers of the draft electoral register would be instructed to take note of those people.</P>
    <P>Senator Reynolds said earlier in the debate that you cannot have it both ways: you cannot stand up and say it is wrong to include 18-year-olds in this Bill in anticipation of the decision of the Irish people in the autumn referendum, and then say: &ldquo;In anticipation of the decision of the Irish people in the autumn referendum, we intend instructing the compilers of the draft electoral register in September to take note of all those of 18 to 21 years of age currently living in the State&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Consequently, in those simple examples, and in the course of the debate this afternoon, with respect, both the Parliamentary Secretary and Senator Honan contradicted themselves and gave the lie to their own arguments.  It is the intention to anticipate the referendum result by taking note of all those of 18.  Yet, for some reason, the Parliamentary Secretary will not agree to anticipate the referendum result by having, in section 1, the right for people of 18 years and over to vote in local elections.  What it amounts to at present is that if, as we all expect, the autumn referendum proposals are agreed to, the Parliamentary Secretary, or his Minister, or somebody else will have to come back here and to the other House and introduce an amendment to change section 1 of the Local Elections Bill, 1972.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="44" /> Section 3 of the Bill, if agreed to, will ensure that no local election takes place before June, 1972.  Consequently, depending on the result of the autumn referendum, section 1 will never and can never be implemented and will have to be amended before it can ever take legislative effect.  That is bad parliamentary procedure, bad parliamentary draftsmanship, and bad thinking on the part of those who decided to introduce the Bill; it is merely following delaying tactics which are doing no more than holding up the time of the House.  I would have thought that the obvious thing to do, if there was some marked reluctance to introduce the 18 years element at this stage, would be to drop section 1 completely from this Bill and to include it in one of the subsequent Local Government Bills which would be introduced into the Houses of the Oireachtas following the referendum.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is any need to go into great detail as to why we feel those of 18 years and over should be afforded the right to vote.  However, it is no harm to mention that in the opinion of the Government of the day they are entitled and expected, if they are wage earners, to pay taxes.  Under the laws of the country, they are afforded the right to marry.  If they are property owners, they would be expected to pay rates towards the cost of the administration of the local authority area in which they own the property.</P>

Yet, at the same time, we have continued down through the years to disfranchise them.  We can give them an opportunity to remedy that to some extent at present.  For some strange reason, the Parliamentary Secretary appears reluctant to do so.  I exhort the House to consider this amendment carefully.  I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to reconsider this reluctance to agree to it, in view of the fact that he <Col N="45" /> has now admitted that he has taken certain steps in relation to the compilation of the electoral register.  This is in anticipation of the referendum result and to agree to this amendment would be doing no more than to be consistent in anticipating that result in the same way.</P>

      <P>I am afraid Senator Boland has missed the whole purpose of section 1, which is to introduce one man, one vote.  That is what section 1 does, and it is a very important purpose. I cannot understand the statement made by Senator Boland that section 1 will never be put into operation. This is completely misreading the purposes of section 1.  The purposes of section 1 are to give one man one vote, and to do away with the property qualification, to delete this from our statutes.  It happens that in the drafting of that amendment the age of 21 is inserted.  This is drafting procedure rather than anything else. What section 1 is intended to do in this Bill is to give one man, one vote and the contribution made by the Senator misses that point completely, when he says that it is not necessary, that it will never be implemented.  I certainly know that it will and it serves a useful purpose.</P>
      <P>The Amendment of the Constitution Bill 1972 was referred to.  It provides for a reduction of the voting age to 18 years.  As I said, it has been introduced in Dáil Éireann, and it is hoped that it will be passed by both Houses during the present session.  It is intended to put this proposal to the people in the referendum in the autumn.  If the people approve of the change, a Bill will be brought in to make the consequential changes in the Dáil electoral law, and this Bill will also provide for a reduction of the voting age for local government elections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In other words, it will not be necessary to bring in special legislation to do this one thing only.  The legislation required to give the vote at 18 for local elections can be included in a Bill which will be consequential on the result of the referendum for votes at <Col N="46" /> 18 for all elections and referenda.  In accordance with this arrangement, provided of course that the people agree, persons aged 18 and upwards will be able to vote at every election, national or local, taking place after next April. The voting age for local elections could be reduced by ordinary legislation, but the Government's view is that the people should first be given the opportunity of deciding on the voting age for Dáil and presidential elections and referenda.  It would be improper to anticipate the people's decision by reducing the age for local elections until the result of the referendum is known.  In any event, under this Bill, the next local election will be held in June, 1973, and if the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution Bill is enacted by the people and consequential legislation is enacted by the Oireachtas, persons aged 18 and upwards will be entitled to vote at these elections.</P>
    <P>I thought Senator Dalgan Lyons's contribution was very relevant and logical.  He is in favour of letting the people decide first, especially against the background that, even if this amendment were accepted, it would not alter the position.  That is, giving votes to persons at 18 years at the next local election.  I cannot accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Senator Boland is right about section 1.  Section 1 clearly states:</P>
      <P>A person shall be entitled to be registered as a local government elector in a local area if he has reached the age of twenty-one years and he was, on the qualifying date, ordinarily resident in that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment means the insertion of 18 years instead of 21 years.  As a politician I realise that, if votes were given at 18, Fine Gael would command the big majority of that vote.  Of course, the Labour Party would probably claim the same thing.  The Government party seem to be dragging their feet on this.  Under the provisions of the Constitution it would be possible to give votes at 18 in local government elections without the need to have a referendum.  It was not my <Col N="47" /> party wrote the Constitution; the Government party produced that document, but they are inclined to run away from it when it suits them. Everything the Parliamentary Secretary has said here today clearly indicates to me that his party are not sincere about giving votes at 18.</P>
    <P>Let us look at the effect it would have on the electorate if votes were given at 18.  It would increase the number of the electorate in Dublin by 55,000.  In the rest of Ireland it would increase the electorate by 95,000.  That is a total increase of 150,000 votes.  In other words, it would give a 7½ per cent increase outside Dublin and 11½ per cent increase in Dublin.  I wonder if the Government are afraid of this number of votes coming in rather quickly.  I am not saying they are.  The Government party had the opportunity of giving these people the franchise in local government elections, but failed to do so.</P>
    <P>Senator Boland has pointed out that a number of these people are paying income tax and a limited number of them might also be paying rates.  They are by law at liberty to enter a public house and demand a drink.  The have every right of a citizen except the right to vote.</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael Party introduced votes at 18 in their policy as far back as 1965.  Other parties followed that line since.  The Parliamentary Secretary should give this some thought because, if you try to keep these people under, they could become dangerous. We have seen this happen in this country in other spheres.  The Government now have the opportunity of giving them their just rights.</P>

People will put the question: &ldquo;Why ask us to do something that you yourselves as the Government or the Opposition, could have put through without a referendum.

      <P>There will be a referendum held in the autumn to give votes at 18 years for general elections presidential elections, referenda, and so on.  This is not the brain child of any one party and no party should claim credit, as has already been done here this evening for being the pioneers of votes at 18.  As Senator O'Brien has mentioned, when we go canvassing people to vote &ldquo;yes&rdquo; in the coming referenda, it can be pointed out to us that we had an opportunity in the Local Elections Bill, 1972, to show our sincerity by giving votes at 18 in the local elections.  If by some strange quirk of fate the electorate decide we will not give the youth a vote at 18, will we use our powers here as legislators and give votes at 18 in local authority elections?  Or does it mean, <Col N="50" /> if this is defeated in the referendum, that it is the end of votes at 18 in local elections also?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">

      <P>One of the reasons given by the Parliamentary Secretary for refusing to accept Senator Boland's amendment was that it was unnecessary. If this amendment is not accepted and inserted in the Bill, we will be placed in the Gilbertian situation in which, if the Dáil adjourns in July and does not reconvene until October, in the interim period the register will be compiled about the middle of September and young people between the ages of 18 and 21 years will be noted.  I do not know what &ldquo;noting&rdquo; means but that was the Parliamentary Secretary's own expression.</P>
      <P>If this amendment is inserted in the Bill and is passed into law, they will be included in the register as of right.  This is an important difference.  I do not understand what &ldquo;noting&rdquo; means.  It appears to me there will be two lists, one a register of those aged 21 years and upwards and a register of notees, between 18 and 21 years.  The feeling is general on all sides of this House tonight that the amendment will be carried and we will by law be giving votes to all our citizens of 18 years and over.  To be consistent and show our beliefs to the electorate, we, in both Houses of the Oireachtas, should show a lead by including this right in the Bill.</P>

      <P>I was pleased that the Chair gently reminded Senator Honan that his contribution was relevant to the section and not the amendment. With respect, the same remarks might have been addressed to the Parliamentary Secretary when he rose to reply to me.  I know well what the effect of section 1 is and, despite his remarks, I repeat that in view of what he stated before the tea break&mdash;that people of 18 years and upwards will vote in the next local elections&mdash;section 1, as it now stands, will never be operated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 1 applies its provisions to people of 21 years and upwards.  We all confidently expect that that part of section 1 which refers to people of 21 years and upwards will have to be <Col N="51" /> changed.  It is ludicrous to introduce a section into a Bill which Members on every side of the House expect will be changed before it can be brought into operation.</P>
    <P>Senator Russell has made an equally relevant point: that those who compile the electoral register are paid on a head count basis depending on the number of people they have on the register.  If they, in September, are to compile a register of people between the ages of 18 and 21 years who at the time they compiled that list had no right to vote in any election, how does the Parlaimentary Secretary envisage they will be paid for this additional work?  Presumably, it will be one of those neat retrospective pieces of payment we all abhor but which so often happen.</P>
    <P>The provisions of section 1 will never be implemented: it applies to those of 21 years and upwards and we all expect it will have to apply to those of 18 years and upwards.  Surely the neater way of legislating now is to introduce the provision for 18 year olds and also copperfasten the position regarding the compilation of the electoral register.  I fail to see the logic of the Parliamentary Secretary's attitude in this regard.</P>

      <P>A Bill has been introduced in the Dáil today.  It is hoped to have this Bill through in this session in order to allow for a referendum.  Senators have raised the question in relation to the referendum&mdash;&ldquo;What will we tell people who are going to ask why did you not do this job when you could either in Dáil Éireann or Seanad Éireann?&rdquo; Could I suggest to these Senators that the answer is that persons of 18 years will have votes at the next local elections? It is important, when a change such as this is being made in respect of other elections, that the wish of the people should be the guiding factor.  It could be done now, but I share the view of the Government that we should wait to get the views of the people, especially when anticipating the views of the people does not give a single vote to a local government elector more quickly.  By waiting we put ourselves in the position that we will have ascertained the will of the people.  If the referendum is carried we will have legislation and the people of 18 years will have votes in June, 1973.</P>

If he turns to page 2 of the Parliamentary Secretary's introductory speech he will find that it states the Government's position is that they favour votes at 18 years for all elections.

      <P>What I said was that the rate collectors and the other people who compile the register would not take the Government as being serious about giving votes at 18 years. It took a long time to drag this out of the Government.  We ultimately got them to commit themselves to give votes at 18 years to the section of the community who vote in a local government election.  We have the right in this Parliament to give these people a vote, but we are failing to do so.  If we want to get this referendum carried the first thing we must do is give a lead to the Irish people.  Other people may have a different interpretation of the last referendum, but if the Fine Gael Party had not given a lead to the Irish people I wonder what would have happened. It was perhaps against our better judgment that we supported the Government in this, but we gave the lead to the people which we thought they required.  I feel the same today&mdash;that there is an obligation on the Government to give a lead if they feel votes should be given at 18 years.</P>

      <P>I have listened to argument and counter argument and still cannot see where it is leading.  At the moment the relevant age is 21 years.  That is and will be the relevant age for voting until such time as the people of this State by a majority vote decide at a referendum in the autumn that it should be reduced to 18 years. The Minister would stultify himself if he attempted to change that figure of 21 years at the moment.  He would be trying to bring in what one might call a regulation by anticipation.</P>

      <P>I would be prepared to accept the Parliamentary Secretary's argument in good faith.  I would accept that the Government are committed to giving votes to people of 18 years and over.  The only point I take issue with him is that, if the Government are sincere about this, surely they should take steps now to ensure that in the compilation of the register next September the 18 years old and over have a right to be on that register.  As I understand the arrangement at the moment, there will be two types of voters on the electoral register.  There will be the people who have a constitutional right to vote at 21 years of age and upwards and there will be a list of noted persons between 18 and 21.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would suggest in all sincerity to the Parliamentary Secretary that where a rate collector, his assistant or his deputy is asked to compile a register <Col N="56" /> on these lines that register will not be properly compiled, because you are dividing the electors into two&mdash;those who have a contitutional right and those who have no constitutional right. We all agree that the referendum will be successful.  It is only right and proper that this amendment should be accepted to ensure that the 18 years and over have a right to be listed in the register in the middle of September otherwise, they will not have a legal right to do so.  They will be left to the mercy of the rate collectors or their assistants to put them on the register.</P>
    <P>The rate collector can say to himself: &ldquo;If the Government are committed to that and they feel so strongly about it, why do they not give these people a legal right to be put on the register?&rdquo;  They are merely on a noted list at the moment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to clear up this point.  Rate collectors will be instructed and paid to list over 18's. What Senator Russell is talking about as a register, is a draft register.  It will be displayed, as draft registers always are, in public places and will be subject to appeals for additions or deletions. The 18's to 21's will have the same right as anybody to ensure that they will be on that draft register.  They will be issued with forms of appeal if their names are not on and if they want to appeal to have their names included, they may do so.  When that draft register is compiled, it will be as obligatory on a rate collector to put on a 19-year-old as it will be to put on a 90-year-old.  He will be paid the same for doing so.  It will be his duty to do so.</P>
      <P>Election workers of all parties, as they always do, will go through the same procedure of scrutinising of draft registers to ensure that names which should be included will be included.  I should like to clarify that point, because it is not going to be the lackadaisical sort of exercise that some of the Senators have indicated it may be.</P>

      <P>Senator Boland's view and my view differ on this.  I feel that a man who is a bankrupt should not be entitled to be a member of a local authority.  I do not suppose I will get much support for that view in this House but it actually means that a man who is not capable of running his own business could be allowed to sit on a local authority and contribute towards the running of the business of that local authority&mdash;such as the collection of rates, the distribution of moneys and so on.  I believe Senator Boland's point was the opposite.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>The idea behind this section is to give the people the widest possible choice of candidates.  If the electors at the local elections have a bankrupt going forward as a candidate and wish to vote for him that is fair enough but I agree that there is a problem in the case of a person who, in mid-term, becomes a bankrupt.  It is quite possible that the electorate might lose confidence in him as a result and might not elect him again.  There is something to be said for looking at this matter again but, as I indicated in the Dáil, there is a consolidation Bill dealing with disqualifications generally in respect of all elections.  I prefer to have this matter dealt with in that Bill rather than here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>My point is clear enough then.  A person elected prior to becoming a bankrupt and who became a bankrupt in mid-term might, according to the new proposals, be removed <Col N="59" /> from office.  It is not necessarily agreed that he still continues in office under this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>Under this Bill he will continue in office.  However, there is something to be said for dealing with this in the general context of disqualification, which will be dealt with in a Consolidation Bill in the future, and I hope fairly soon.</P>

      <P>I asked a question earlier, on the Second Stage, concerning paragraph (b) in relation to the five-year period, either before or since a person's election.  I merely inquired why the five years was stipulated in view of the fact that in the same Bill we are extending the lifetime of the local authority to six years.  Is it necessary at all to stipulate a five year period?  It might have been better to say: &ldquo;Within the lifetime of the local authority, vocational education committee, or county committee of agriculture, to which he had been elected.&rdquo; Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary would clear up that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is the case, it could happen that a member of a local authority, a vocational education committee, or a county committee of agriculture, who becomes bankrupt between now and June, 1973, would be disqualified from the position he held. This would be my reading of it.  The provisions of this section would not apply to him because it would have been longer than five years since his election; he would have been a member of the authority concerned for longer than five years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  That is not so.  When this Bill is passed, disqualification of bankrupts disappears completely.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It disappears completely in relation to his becoming a bankrupt within five years of his election. The point that I am making is that every member of a local authority for the next 12 months would be <Col N="60" /> in his sixth year as a member of that local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The disqualification is disappearing completely. The reference to five years was contained in the old legislation and it is simply being removed in this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The first subsection of section 2, paragraph (b), specifically refers to a five-year period.  Obviously, the reason it does is that the Applications of Enactments Order, 1898, in article 12, paragraph 4, sub-paragraph (c) says:</P>
      <P>... has within five years before his election or since his election been convicted either on indictment or similarly of any crime.</P>
      <P>Paragraph (b) of subsection (2) of section 2 deletes the words &ldquo;or has within or during the time aforesaid been adjudged bankrupt or made a composition or arrangement with his creditors&rdquo;.  That relates only to the latter portion of sub-paragraph (c) of paragraph 4 of article 12.  A similar wording has been followed in subsection (1) of section 2.  That wording says very clearly:</P>
      <P>A person shall not be disqualified for being elected, chosen, appointed or being a member of a local authority, a vocational education committee or a county committee of agriculture because...</P>
      <P>Then the terms of paragraph (a) are set out.  Subsection (b) reads:</P>
      <P>...within five years either before or since his election or being so chosen or appointed, he has been adjudicated bankrupt, or made an arrangement with his creditors.</P>
      <P>Translating the provisions of that subsection to those who were elected in the local elections of 1967, a five-year period from them would take them quite by coincidence exactly today, because on this day five years ago the local elections were held.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If that subsection had operated in 1967, a person who became a bankrupt within five years of his election&mdash; in other words, within five years of his election on 28th June, 1967&mdash;would not be disqualified.  But section 3 of this <Col N="61" /> Bill extends the lifetime of every local authority, vocational education committee and county committee of agriculture for a further period of one year. On first reading&mdash;I may be wrong and I should like to hear the explanation of it&mdash;it would appear to me that the provisions of subsection (1), paragraph (b) of section 2 will not apply for the next 12 months, because the period mentioned is only a five-year period.  Indeed, if at any time in the future the lifetime of a local authority were extended beyond a five-year span, the protection to people who became bankrupt would no longer apply once they had served a full five years from the date of their being &ldquo;elected, chosen, appointed or being a member.&rdquo;  This is the reason I originally asked why the period of five years had been specified, rather than saying the lifetime of the authority to which he had been &ldquo;elected, chosen, appointed or being a member of,&rdquo; or saying &ldquo;or such longer period as the local authority happens to be left in being&rdquo;. It appears to me that for the next 12 months the bankruptcy provisions which the Parliamentary Secretary is seeking to eliminate will, in fact, continue in being.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  That is not so.  The wording of the section may appear complicated and it may be reasonably asked why the same effect could not be achieved by a simple repeal of the relevant provisions of the Schedule to the 1898 Order.  This part of the 1898 Order is applied to vocational education committees and county committees of agriculture by the Vocational Education (Amendment) Act, 1944, and the Agriculture (Amendment) Act, 1944, respectively. In the event of a simple repeal of these provisions there would be an element of doubt as to whether the repeal would be effective for vocational education committees and county committees of agriculture. These bodies are not local authorities for the purpose of the present Bill. For this reason it is considered desirable to declare in subsection (1) that receipt of general assistance and bankruptcy no longer disqualify a person for membership of a local authority, <Col N="62" /> a vocational education committee or a county committee of agriculture.</P>
      <P>Subsection (2) makes the consequential modification in the provisions of the 1898 order.  Even if a simple repeal could meet the situation, it is desirable that a change in the conditions for membership of local authorities, which is a matter of some importance, should be effected in a positive declaratory way rather than negatively by way of repeal.</P>
      <P>The section was, of course, prepared by the parliamentary draftsman. We have full confidence in his technical competence and there is no doubt but that the section, as drafted, accomplishes the desired objective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. J. Boland Mr. J. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no doubt that it accomplished the desired objective and I thank the Parliamentary Secretary for having read out that.  It accomplishes the desired objective in relation to the normal life of a local authority, which is five years.  I am suggesting that the five years, which is specified in the earlier enactments, has been repeated here because five years is the life of a local authority at present. As it happens we are extending the lifetime of a local authority by one year.  It does not seem to me, under any interpretation of subsection (1) of section 2, that a person who becomes bankrupt between now and June, 1973, can save himself from disqualification. The Parliamentary Secretary is trying to assist in this regard by explaining it to me but, with respect, I do not think that he has made the position clear to the House yet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>As I see it, the position is that these committees are not local authorities, and while part of the section could be left out as far as local authorities are concerned, there is some doubt as to whether it would then cover vocational education committees or county committees of agriculture, which are not local authorities. Therefore, it was necessary to draft it in this way to make doubly sure that what was in mind would be achieved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Why within five years?  Most people who are members of vocation educational committees <Col N="63" /> now were appointed to such committee approximately four years and 11 months ago.  This provision means that, if they become bankrupt within five years of having been appointed to that vocational education committee, they will not be disqualified.  By direct implication it would mean that if one happens to be a member of that committee for longer than five years he may still be disqualified under the terms of the previous enactment.  As it happens, we are extending in another part of the Bill the lifetime of vocational education committees, along with other local bodies for a period of 12 months.</P>
      <P>It appears to me that someone who falls bankrupt in the next 12 months and who happens to be a member of either a local authority, a vocational education committee or a county committee of agriculture can now be disqualified as heretofore.  I am merely making the point.  I hope I am wrong. I hope that no Member of this House who is a member of a local authority, a vocational education committee or a county committee of agriculture becomes bankrupt in the next 12 months. I want to assure the House that I will do the best I can to ensure that it does not happen to me.  Nonetheless, I do not think that this is going to cover anybody who is unfortunate enough to fall into that position in the next 12 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the same thing has happened to the Senator as happened to myself on first reading this.  The five year period has nothing to do with the lifetime of a local authority. It arises from the section in a previous enactment, which specified that a person is disqualified if he became bankrupt within the previous five years.  The five year period referred to the individual bankruptcy rather than to any lifetime period of a local authority.  It has nothing to do with the life of the local authority.  It relates to a five year period from the date of bankruptcy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary is right.  I have found the previous enactment.  It is the Application <Col N="64" /> of Enactments Order, 1898.  It was that order that specified the five year period.  At that time I do not think there were five year periods in the lifetime of local authorities.  I think they were shorter.  Nonetheless, that wording has been repeated in subsection (1) of section 2.  Also coincidentally the ordinary lifetime of a local authority now, in normal circumstances, before the Parliamentary Secretary and his predecessors started changing it about, is five years.  If the Parliamentary Secretary reads the thing carefully it says&mdash;</P>
      <P>...within five years either before or since his election...</P>
      <P>In other words, if he was elected in 1967, that covers the period back to 1962 and that is the portion that refers to &ldquo;before his election or since his election.&rdquo; It means five years from 1967, which brings us to the 28th June, 1972 which is today.  We are extending the lifetime of local authorities today by another period of 12 months and it appears to me that, consequently, the members of local authorities for this further period are not covered by this provision.</P>

      <P Just="Center">SECTION 3.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In subsection (1), page 3, line 4, before &ldquo;An election&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;An election of members of Dublin Corporation and Bray Urban District Council shall be held in July, 1972, and&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="65" /> This amendment refers to the discussion which took place earlier today on the Second Stage in relation to the fact that at present, and for the past number of years, there has been no local authority in existence in the city of Dublin or in Bray Urban District Council.  The section itself extends the lifetime of local authorities throughout the country for a further 12 months. The effect of the amendment would be to agree to the extension of the lifetime of all other local authorities for that period, but to insist that an election should now take place to elect new members to Dublin Corporation and Bray Urban District Council, and that those elections should take place next month&mdash;July, 1972.</P>
    <P>We feel that this is an eminently reasonable amendment in view of the fact that the electorate and the population in both areas have been deprived of their democratically elected councils for a number of years.  It would help the House if we did not go into the pros and cons of why there is not now a democratically elected council in those areas.  Every reasonably minded person in the Chamber will agree that it is unfortunate.  I happen to be chairman for another ten days of a rather large local authority, whose boundaries are contiguous to the boundaries of Dublin Corporation, in other words Dublin County Council.  I appreciate acutely the loss to the city of Dublin and to the tourist drive generally of having no lord mayor in Dublin.</P>
    <P>We should have some dignatory representing the city who would welcome visitors and officials at city receptions and for this reason it would be worthwhile having these elections once again.</P>
    <P>Of equal importance, we would have restored to Dublin city 45 or more members who would represent the views of the ordinary man-in-the-street and give him the confidence of knowing he has an opportunity of presenting his grievance and his point of view.  The city commissioner merely places a bureaucratic stamp on the previously made bureaucratic decisions.</P>
    <P>I state this as someone who has a <Col N="66" /> good deal of contact with a number of the officials concerned who are public servants of the highest order but who are themselves unhappy and discomfited because there is no city council to whom they can turn as a last resort and who will judge what is right and wrong for the city of Dublin.</P>
    <P>This situation applies in the urban district of Bray and if Senator Gallanagh were present in the House now, he would wax eloquent on the need for an urban council to be restored to Bray.  Senator Gallanagh was deeply implicated in the affairs which led up to the unfortunate dissolution of the urban district council in that area.  The Parliamentary Secretary pointed out the power lies with the Minister under the 1941 Act to decide at any stage to convene elections in any area where a local authority have been dissolved and that this amendment was superfluous.  As I pointed out to the Parliamentary Secretary, the Minister has not exercised that power.  I would be happy to withdraw this amendment on the undertaking from the Parliamentary Secretary that he would try to persuade his Minister to use his powers under the 1941 Act to convene these elections. The Parliamentary Secretary has quite honestly told the House that he is not in a position to give that undertaking.</P>

      <P>Since Dublin Corporation were abolished, I, as one of the public representatives in an adjoining area, have been given a tremendous amount of extra work to do.  The people naturally turn to their elected public representatives.  It has become apparent to me, as it must be apparent to anyone with a genuine interest in public life, that the loss of a city council in the major city is a serious loss to the prestige of the city, the prestige of the country, and to the people who are involved in the promotion of tourism.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Boland on this for many reasons. <Col N="68" /> Perhaps the people concerned did not stand up to their responsibilities but Dublin Corporation have been abolished for approximately two and a half years and Bray Urban Council for a shorter period.  They have paid the price and the people whom they represented have also paid the price. How much further do we go to penalise people for doing wrong?  We have all done wrong during our lifetime.  As was stated by somebody, if a person wished to write down the good he has done, his forehead might hold it, but if he wished to write down the wrongs he had done, the biggest wall in this House might not hold all.</P>
      <P>There is no need for a corporation for planning permission, <i>et cetera.</i> Decisions will be made by officials who have not got the grassroots understanding which the elected representatives would have.  There is need for a lord mayor at public functions.  Tourists usually make inquiries about the lord mayor and the Mansion House, and it would not be in any way weak for the Department of Local Government to allow the local elections to be held for Dublin Corporation in this present year in the month of July.</P>
      <P>For that reason I would earnestly appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to see if he could influence the Minister for Local Government to restore Dublin Corporation and Bray Urban Council.  Under the present Act it will be only a year until we have local elections.  Why continue the fight? Nobody wins a fight that is drawn out too long.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to say a word on this.  I hope I will not be accused of interfering in the affairs of the defunct Dublin City Council.  One point has been overlooked.  It has not been adverted to in any of the comments that have been made for or against the abolition of Dublin City Council and Bray Urban District Council, and that is the loss to the citizens of both areas.  The elected councillors may or may not have been right or wrong in what they did.  The Minister decided to abolish them.  So far as I am aware there is no legislation providing that the Minister must order elections at any particular time. <Col N="69" /> It is within the power of the Minister to decide when there will be a fresh election in these two electoral areas. This section of the Act needs careful examination on behalf of the citizens of Dublin and of the electors of Bray Urban District Council.</P>
      <P>The Minister decided that the representatives of both bodies acted wrongly and irresponsibly.  Other public representatives, who did not share the views of the person who voted not to strike an adequate rate on that occasion, have said time and again that they acted irresponsibly. The only one way to decide whether they acted irresponsibly or not is to call fresh elections.  After a stipulated period&mdash;say, of two years&mdash;the Minister should be obliged to call fresh elections and let the citizens of Dublin and the residents of Bray urban district decide if their public representatives acted irresponsibly or wrongly.  They are the people who in the long run pay the piper.</P>
      <P>In all this we are forgetting that it is not the will of a Minister or the irresponsibility of a public representative that is the issue, but the democratic rights of the people of Dublin and Bray.  They are being completely overlooked in this whole issue. Whether the Parliamentary Secretary is prepared to accept the amendment or not, I would urge on him and, through him, on the Minister for Local Government to ensure that the democratic rights of the citizens of Dublin and Bray are restored soon. Let them decide.  If they think that one group acted irresponsibly and those on the other side acted responsibly, let them refuse to elect the people whom they think acted wrongly in the matter.  That is democracy in action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with both Senator Boland and Senator Reynolds that the loss of the Lord Mayor of Dublin extends far beyond the confines of the city, particularly in regard to our tourists from overseas.  This year&mdash;for reasons I do not wish to go into now&mdash;we are dependent more than ever on tourists from the United States of America. We have done everything we can to encourage American tourists to come <Col N="70" /> here and they have come here in greater numbers than ever before.  The one key man in any American city is the mayor.  American citizens coming here find it extraordinary that the capital city of Ireland does not have a first citizen, a lord mayor, or any single person available to extend to them the normal courtesies.  It is a defect that should be remedied at the earliest possible date.  If the councillors and aldermen were abolished and the mayor could stay on in office, if necessary with the agreement of the Minister, that would do something to repair the damage that has been done.  It has damaged the image of the city of Dublin.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support the present amendment in the strongest possible terms.  I cannot understand why the Government are so reluctant to make this obvious gesture to the democratic rights of this city at a time when we are genuinely trying to show how much we value democracy here and how much we value and guard the right of the majority in any community to express their point of view and to have their clearly defined role.  The fact that the Government did not like how the corporation acted some four or five years ago is no reason for the Government to deny this democratic right to the citizens of Dublin.  We might pass off what happened four years ago as an effective if illegal process, in the position in which the corporation and other similar bodies found themselves &mdash;having little or no power and yet being faced with the odium of having to pass on rate increases.  The services have to be provided and the rates have to go up to pay for them.  This was a type of local protest and it is time now for the Government to restore the council.  It ill becomes the Government to lecture any group on democracy if they are not prepared to take the lead themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is appalling to think that our capital city is without its lord mayor as its representative on ceremonial occasions.  I would go so far as to urge the present commissioner to cease his functions at an early stage as a contribution to restoring the corporation and <Col N="71" /> the democratic rights in Dublin.  I appeal to the Government to let us have immediate action on this.  When it comes to democracy action always speaks much louder than theory.</P>

      <P>These amendments would require the Minister to hold local elections in Dublin city and Bray during next month.  Section 45 of the Local Government Act, 1941, requires the Minister to fix a date for new elections in these areas and the date selected must be within five years after the removal from office.  The Minister could select any day in that five year period.  If he considered it desirable to hold elections in Dublin and Bray next month he has ample power under the Act of 1941 to do so.  The amendment is therefore unnecessary.  It would be inappropriate to hold new elections in Dublin and Bray until further consideration has been given to the future shape of local government in these areas.  In Dublin particularly there is a pressing need for overhaul of local government structure and existing legal boundaries between city and county have become increasingly irrelevant.  Therefore, it is not the time for the election of a new city council.  I cannot, therefore, accept this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have here a very long list of councils, urban councils, county councils, and corporations where the same thing has happened down the years. By and large they were restored at the next following local elections throughout the country.  This has been the practice generally.  The main argument is that there will be in a Bill, which will come before Dáil Éireann, proposals to reorganise the local government structure in Dublin city and county.  Everyone admits that it is necessary to do this.  I do not think it would be the right thing to have <Col N="72" /> elections next month and elect members of the corporation for an 11-month period.  This is the main reason why I cannot accept this amendment.</P>

      <P>Surely if the Minister contemplates sweeping changes in the administration of Dublin city and county then there should be some responsible body at local government level which the Minister and the Government would regard as speaking for the citizens of that area.  I cannot think of a better way of getting those representatives together than having the elections immediately.  It is the most potent argument that could be advanced for having the elections.  A consultative body is urgently needed in view of the changes that are being contemplated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The point made by Senator Quinlan is a very good one. The Minister has unfortunately brought into the argument the suggested changes in the local government structure in the areas of Dublin city, Dublin county and Dún Laoghaire Borough. The Parliamentary Secretary will know well that when the Minister went to have discussions with representatives from local authorities throughout the country in relation to the White Paper, he found himself in extreme difficulty when he came to the Dublin area. Dublin County Council reluctantly sent representatives to meet him, because we felt we had the entitlement to be received on our own.  We therefore reluctantly sent representatives to a meeting, along with the representatives from the Balbriggan Town Commissioners and the Borough of Dún Laoghaire. But there was no representative present at that meeting, nobody to speak for and no voice to speak on behalf of the people of the city of Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the very point Senator <Col N="73" /> Quinlan is making.  If the proposed sweeping changes are the reason for not having an election to re-instate the Dublin Corporation, then the Minister is saying that these sweeping changes will take place without having a single democratically elected person to speak on behalf of the citizens of Dublin city.  Indeed, it was an embarrassment to all of us at that meeting&mdash;and, I should like to think that it was an embarrassment to the Minister also&mdash; that, while he was hearing the views of the members of my council, the members of Dún Laoghaire Borough and the members of the Town Commissioners in Balbriggan, there was nobody to advance counter-arguments and perhaps to agree with some of the arguments of behalf of the people of Dublin city.</P>
    <P>It is quite obvious that the Parliamentary Secretary's hands are tied in this regard and that the decision not to have these elections has been taken at a level, with all due respects to him, higher than his.  It is tremendously unfortunate, and if the reason that is being advanced is the genuine reason then it is doubly unfortunate. If, as Senator Quinlan says, that is the case, then this is the time, more so than ever before, when there should be democratically elected people to speak on behalf of the citizens of the present greater Dublin area.</P>
    <P>When the Parliamentary Secretary says that everybody is agreed on the sweeping changes which are needed in the greater Dublin area he is perhaps overgeneralising.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">

      <P>We are all in agreement that some sort of change is necessary, but we are all in very great disagreement as to what that change should be.  I am unhappy and upset at the Parliamentary Secretary's remarks, because they would seem to indicate that in fact a firm decision in relation to the Dublin area has been taken arising out of the White Paper. It is wrong that that should have been announced in a roundabout way talking on section 3 of the Local Elections <Col N="74" /> Bill, 1972.  Perhaps, as a result of this, we will get some firmer information as to what will happen in Dublin city and Dún Laoghaire and Dublin County Council in the next couple of weeks.  It is certainly to be welcomed and is overdue.</P>

But in local affairs, as distinct from national affairs, I believe there is a special need for local authorities.  I am sure Senator Ó Maoláin agrees with me on that.  I am sure that our colleagues who represent Dublin city in the Dáil would be the first to regret the fact that there is no longer a city council in Dublin. Having read the Dáil debates, I know that some of Senator Ó Maoláin's own colleagues there are unhappy.</P>

There is <Col N="75" /> no city council to voice an opinion on behalf of the 600,000 to 700,000 who now live in the city of Dublin.  How can we say then that there is general agreement that sweeping changes in the local authority structure in the Dublin area are necessary?</P>
      <P>Of course, changes are necessary, but I do not agree with the changes the Minister envisages.  Virtually everybody involved in local authority in the Dublin area would feel that changes of some type are necessary.  Nobody has been able to detail, speaking on behalf of the democratically elected Dublin Corporation, the necessary changes.</P>

      <P>Senator Boland has answered himself.  Most of the Members of the Dáil who represent the city of Dublin have also been members of the local authority here, the Dublin Corporation.  Surely if anybody is acquainted with local problems, it is these Members of the Dáil who were members of the corporation. These, as we already said, are easily available for consultation.</P>
      <P>They were democratically elected; they are in daily touch with the people of the city of Dublin and are in as good a position to throw light on the problems of the city of Dublin, with which they have been dealing&mdash;not alone in the Dáil but on the local council&mdash;as any other person who could be called upon.  Senator Boland will agree that there could be no doubt whatever that if the Minister, his Department or anyone who is designing this new structure requires any information on the problems involved in the restructuring of Dublin and its local organisation, then that information can be obtained without much trouble from the elected representatives in the Dáil.</P>

      <P>Under existing law appointments of school attendance committees are due to be made this year.  The committees are appointed partly by the Minister for Education and partly by the local authorities.  The purpose of this section is to postpone the appointments until next year so that the members to be appointed by the local authorities will be selected by the incoming councillors elected in the 1973 local elections.  Section 10 of the School Attendance Act, 1926, as amended, provides for the appointment of school attendance committees for Cork County Borough, Dublin County Borough, Waterford County Borough and Dún Laoghaire Borough.  The committees consist in general of 11 members each, except in the case of Waterford, where the membership is ten.  They are charged with the enforcement of the School Attendance <Col N="77" /> Act in those areas.  In other areas the enforcement authority are the Garda Síochána.  The Minister for Education appoints five members of each committee and the remainder are appointed by the local authority for the area.</P>
      <P>Appointments are made quinquennially and the intention is that they would be made in the years in which local elections take place, so that the selection will be made by newly-elected councillors.  By putting the local elections back to 1973, this Bill breaks a five yearly pattern of local elections.  It is, therefore, desirable that the appointment of school attendance committees should be postponed for a similar period.  The present school attendance committees took up office on 1st January, 1968.  Their successors will be due to take up office on 1st January, 1973.  Under this section, the date of taking up office will be postponed until 1st January, 1974.</P>

      <P>This motion seeks the approval of the House to a draft of regulations which arises from section 41 of the Health Act, 1970.  That section provided for the establishment by regulations of four bodies for the co-ordination and development of the hospital services, one being a national body&mdash;Comhairle na nOspidéal&mdash;and three regional bodies based on Dublin, Cork and Galway. The draft regulations specify the constitution of the comhairle and the constitution and detailed functions of the three regional hospital boards.</P>
      <P>The four bodies referred to were provided for in the Act because of the existence of the two hospital systems, one under the health boards and the other under the various voluntary bodies.  About half of the acute hospital beds in the country are within each system.  The recent changes in the administration of the health services were based on the fundamental assumption that the voluntary bodies would continue to operate their hospitals and the health boards the hospitals which had been transferred to them from the local authorities.  The new bodies are, therefore, intended not to be executive bodies but to work in the co-ordination of the two systems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because of the high cost of the hospital services and of the rise in that cost in recent years, it is essential that future planning must avoid unnecessary duplication in the provision <Col N="79" /> of facilities and services.  Furthermore, the services are highly labour intensive and must be made as efficient in the use of manpower and womanpower as possible.  Developments must therefore be planned in a rational way and the day to day operation of hospitals must be as efficient as practicable.</P>
    <P>The function of Comhairle na nOspidéal will lie largely in relation to decisions at the national level on priorities in the development of hospital services.  They will do this mainly by their deciding influence on the creation of new consultancies and in their general advisory function for the Minister on development in hospital policies.  Within the general pattern evolved through the activities of this central body, each of the three regional hospital boards will coordinate the activities of the different agencies within its region.  Article 8 of the draft regulations itemises the functions which the regional hospital boards will perform for this purpose. They will be engaged in broad reviews of hospital facilities within the regions and will be expected to have full regard to local views in their activities.</P>
    <P>The list of functions listed for the regional hospital boards is fairly wide-ranging but the stress which each of the boards will put on the different functions may vary.  It seems clear too that the boards may not all be in a position to act independently in providing these services.  For example, the organisation of management advice, such as on work study and efficiency in hospitals, may have to be arranged jointly for the regional hospital boards, because the skills required in this field are fairly difficult to come by.</P>
    <P>The comhairle will consist of 23 members, of whom 12 will be medical consultants.  In choosing the members, it will be my aim to have persons who can speak on behalf of most of the major interests involved.  This means a difficult choice and I will be aided in it by suggestions made by several bodies concerned in the hospital services and in the medical profession.  I would hope to announce the membership <Col N="80" /> of the comhairle very soon after the approval of the draft regulations.</P>
    <P>The Dublin Regional Hospital Board will cover the areas of the four health boards on the eastern side of the country; the other regional hospital boards will each cover the areas of two health boards.  In accordance with the Act, half of the membership of each regional hospital board will be persons appointed by the health boards.  In fact, under the regulations, each health board will nominate four members to a regional hospital board. I will appoint the other members. Again, I will aim to have the boards as representative as possible of the different interests involved and I will be aided in this also by the many suggestions which have been made to me. I would not, I should mention, intend to make my nominations to the regional hospital boards until I have seen the nominations of the health boards to them.</P>
    <P>I think that I should make clear to the House the situation as it stands in relation to one important function of Comhairle na nOspidéal, that is in relation to the selection of consultants. Under the Act, functions relating to the selection of consultants both in health board and voluntary hospitals can be given to the comhairle.  However, these can be given only by regulations, made after consultation with the comhairle itself.  It would not, therefore, have been possible for me to include in the present regulations provisions governing the selection of consultants.  Clearly, the comhairle must first be established so that it can be consulted on this.  However, the issue of the selection of consultants has been mentioned on a number of occasions and discussed with many interests involved. It is my intention that it will be a priority task of the comhairle to concern itself with a common selection procedure for consultants in all hospitals.  This procedure would apply to consultants working in both voluntary and health board hospitals and I would expect that all interests concerned would be involved in working out its details.  I think it important to emphasise this in view of statements recently issued which might lead one to think that I have departed in some <Col N="81" /> way from the concept of a common selection procedure for all consultants operated under the comhairle.</P>
    <P>There is another matter related to this, that is, the body with which the consultants should hold their contracts. The FitzGerald Report recommended that this should be the regional hospital boards and provision was made in the Act which could allow for this. However, the discussions relating to the present draft regulations convinced me that it was not essential to make this universal.  Therefore, the regulations provide that the regional hospital board will only make the actual contract with the consultant where the bodies managing the hospital or hospitals concerned agree to this.  In these circumstances, we can expect that a contract with the regional hospital board would normally be made only where a consultant was needed to serve hospitals under two different managements. The change in my view from the original concept is not really so significant and I would stress again that it does not in any way affect my resolve that the aim of evolving a common selection procedure should be pursued.  Indeed, the change in relation to the bodies making the contract could make it easier to achieve a general agreement on selection procedures.</P>
    <P>I am aware that, in setting up these new bodies, there are dangers of duplication and doubt in relation to responsibility for particular decisions.  It is highly important that, on the one side, it should be quite clear where the functions of the hospital managing bodies&mdash;the health boards and the voluntary hospitals end&mdash;and those of the regional hospital boards and the comhairle begin and, on the other side, we must similarly be clear as to what is decided in the Department and what is decided within these bodies.</P>
    <P>I wish to make it absolutely clear that the success of these boards depends on efficient methods of communication, administrative procedures and co-ordination as between the regional hospital boards, the health boards and the Department of Health.</P>
    <P>Equally the same efficient procedures in relation to Comhairle na nOspidéal <Col N="82" /> must be evident.  The Minister for Health will have ultimate responsibility in two ways, by the declarations he will make with the consent of the Oireachtas on national health policy and by the financial requirements involved in the integration and co-ordination of the hospital system.</P>
    <P>Those institutions should in fact bring more expertise to bear on the problems of providing a modern hospital system but both the staff arrangements and the procedures must in no way result in a triple organisation of the two types of board and the Department causing overlapping and Parkinsonian empire building.  We will not be able to afford modern hospital services or attract high class staff if we do not pursue the researches and the consequent decisions based on the growing proportion of specialisation team work and expensive laboratory examination.  In about ten years' time the position will have changed very materially.</P>
    <P>The same warning applies to the need for more efficient management and for the necessary consultancy service.  I am awaiting a report from Messrs.  McKinseys, the firm of management consultants which recommended in relation to the health boards and I have stressed to them that, in whatever solution they propose, duplication and lack of clarity in decision-making must be avoided.  To achieve this the management consultants may have to come up with some novel recommendations.  However, I think that both the new bodies and myself will have to be prepared to examine such recommendations with an open mind.  Because, if the new bodies are not seen to have a clear cut function and to work efficiently, this can lead to frustration for all concerned.</P>
    <P>I should conclude by saying that the administrative organisation of the health boards will prove in the main to have been correctly formulated.  This will not prevent me from watching closely the operation of the new boards and if necessary making changes either administratively or by the consent of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>It does not give very much time.  These orders mark a further step towards the organisation of the health services but notwithstanding the Minister's hope, which I think everybody in this House shares, I have grave doubts that he will not, after all, achieve what he would prefer not to achieve.  I could do no better than to quote from his words at page 4 of his speech.  It sums up his concern for overlapping in regard to the organisation of the hospitals medical services.  The Minister said:</P>
      <P>These institutions should in fact bring more expertise to bear on the problems of providing a modern hospital system but both the staff arrangements and the procedures must in no way result in a triple organisation of the two types of board and the Department causing overlapping and Parkinsonian empire building.

      <P>With the greatest respect to the Minister, I suggest that the bringing into effect of this section of the Act to provide for the establishment of four more bodies is bound to ensure that what the Minister seeks to avoid is in fact going to occur.  He is going to have overlapping.  There would be general agreement that the national body which the Minister proposes are an essential body and will serve a very useful function in co-ordinating and generally supervising the development of the hospital medical services throughout the country.  Like many others who are at present serving on regional hospital boards, I can see no justification whatsoever for the setting up of the three proposed regional hospital boards.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">
      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity of raising the matter which concerns the obstacles to applicants who apply late for grants awarded under the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Act, 1968.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I came across this particular problem in a specific case which was raised by Senator John Doyle and it concerned a student in Trinity College who was, in my estimation, an excellent case for a higher education grant.  He had limited means and had obtained the necessary qualifications in the leaving certificate to entitle him to a grant, but his application to his local authority, the county council, was late in the year in which he sat for the leaving <Col N="85" /> certificate.  When he applied in later years for the grant he found that he was not eligible for it unless he repeated his leaving certificate.  The situation regarding this student was that he was following a medical course.  His course was already under way in college and for the next seven or eight years of his life he would face examinations precisely at the time the leaving certificate examination would be taken. Therefore, without dropping a year in college, he was unable to repeat the leaving certificate, and so is ineligible for a grant as the regulations stand.</P>
    <P>I made inquiries with the Department of Education about the regulations in general.  I believe very firmly that if a student has qualifications and is, therefore, under the terms of the Act or of the local authority arrangements, eligible for a grant, and if he applies late in one particular year, he should not have to repeat his leaving certificate in order to become eligible for a grant.  It seems to be a preposterous regulation that a student should have to repeat his leaving certificate.  Therefore, I made representations to the Minister on 14th April, 1972, and have not received in any sense a satisfactory reply.  I have had consultations with various members of his Department who were very helpful, but from the Minister himself I have had no reply in which he suggested that the regulations under which these grants are issued would be changed.</P>
    <P>It is absolutely ridiculous that someone who has the leaving certificate qualifications in one particular year should have to go through the test again when, in all probability, he will be engaged either in doing other examinations or doing some work outside, if he has achieved sufficient qualifications to merit his entering university.</P>
    <P>The particular case I was investigating is not a single instance of this injustice.  For example, in certain subjects in university there is an age limit of 18 years.  A student who takes the leaving certificate at age 17 is not eligible to enter the university in that particular year to sit for the subject he wants to study finds that he is still <Col N="86" /> not eligible to enter a university without repeating the leaving certificate. This is a situation which should be changed.  There is absolutely no justification for it and I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will be able to say this evening that a change is being made in the appropriate regulations.  I agree that as a matter of administrative agreement there must be a closing date.  The closing date at the moment is 31st August.  This closing date is the same for all the local authorities involved.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the Parliamentary Secretary brings the regulations into line with the local authority regulations in the United Kingdom or Northern Ireland about which I have been making inquiries.  They state that if somebody is late in applying to his local authority in a particular year, then he is eligible to re-apply at the same date the following year with the same qualifications without sitting any further examinations or without going through any further tests.  The qualifications which he achieved in the year X will stand to him in the year X+1 in which he sends in his application.</P>
    <P>There is another case which I have come across and I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to comment on it.  I am not sure what the position is, whether the person involved would be handicapped in a similar way by these regulations.  This case concerns a girl whose mother died during the first year of the girl's university course.  She was summoned back by her family to look after domestic arrangements so she withdrew from the university; she had a grant and therefore she signified to her local authority that she was withdrawing from the college for one or perhaps more years until the domestic arrangements of her family had been settled, and she then would wish to continue the university course.  To do that she would have to have a maintenance grant.  If she is forced to re-apply for maintenance in the year in which she re-enters university, then it could be that under these regulations she will be debarred from receiving a grant unless she repeats the leaving certificate.  This is the basis of my case.  I fear strongly that there is no <Col N="87" /> justification for a regulation of this type.  I know that the local authorities under the 1968 Act make their arrangements and also that there has to be uniformity in the arrangements which they make for issuing grants. They obviously have to get the arrangements checked and agreed by the Minister and his Department.  The situation seems clear to me.  Those people who achieve university qualifications in one particular year, provided they have the qualifications for entrance to the university to do the particular courses they wish to do in following years, should have these qualifications regarded as making them eligible for grants from the State through the local authorities in following years without the need to repeat the leaving certificate examination.</P>
    <P>I found, from discussions with officials in the Department, that there were a number of people who were in this situation.  People apply late for various reasons.  I do not argue that someone who misses the closing date should automatically get a grant in the first year.  There have to be administrative procedures; one has to have closing dates and the Department and the local authorities have to adhere to them. This is not the point.  As I have pointed out, in the North of Ireland people are debarred from a grant in the first year afterwards, but they are eligible from then on.  The grant scheme in this country is an important step forward in higher education.  It is a step forward because it manifestly increases the opportunities for those people who need help most of all, people who do not have the financial backing to avail of our higher educational facilities.  In the way I see it, this change would be a minor one, but an important one. It would affect a number of students, such as those I have mentioned.  It would affect people who find they cannot go to university.  It would affect people who take their leaving certificate and decide to take some time off before going to university to learn, perhaps, something in business, or to learn some more about the outside world before making the decision as to what course they should choose.  There is going to be a greater <Col N="88" /> tendency to do this.  It is a welcome tendency.</P>
    <P>My impression of people who come in in this way&mdash;mature students&mdash;is that these people contribute a great deal.  They are highly motivated; they know exactly what they are driving at. Their aims are often clearer than those of people who come to university straight after school, precisely because they have been around and have seen what they want to do.  If their circumstances are straitened and if they have the correct qualifications for receiving a grant why should they be debarred? I do not know the answer to that question.  The point of this discussion is that at the moment the regulations debar someone like this from receiving a grant.  I feel strongly that there are no obstacles to changing this regulation.  I know that people have made representations to the Minister. I know also that the Union of Students in Ireland have taken up this point. I never received any cogent reasons from my discussions with the people in the Department of Education why such a regulation should stand.  Therefore, I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to get this regulation altered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is difficult to take much time in supporting something that is so obvious a claim for justice.  The grant system is a laudable step forward to enable deserving students, of proven academic ability, to receive university education.  Why this should be ravelled up by the red tape shown in the present situation, or why any Minister on being alerted to this red tape situation would not immediately slash it, is beyond me.  Any case which is so obvious should not take up time.  Why should a student <Col N="89" /> who has missed the closing date be compelled to re-sit the leaving certificate? This baffles me as an educationalist. It shows the bankruptcy of the educational ideas of those who for one moment would stand over such a system.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will not stand over this.</P>
      <P>Having a gap between the leaving certificate and entering college should be encouraged.  This regulation prevents that.  Most of us engaged in education would like to see students taking time off after doing the leaving certificate to get acquainted with the world or to study some subjects other than those they had done in the leaving certificate.</P>
      <P>The worst use we can make of the year following the leaving certificate is to be forced to re-study again for the leaving certificate, knowing that at the end of the year these four honours must be got in order to obtain the grant.  I query the inflexibility of the closing date.  The principle of what we are trying to achieve in helping students to get to university is far more important than administrative convenience.  The penalty inflicted in Northern Ireland of a year's loss is too great.  We should be more progressive.  Some slight fine would be sufficient to ensure that the proper closing date be adhered to.</P>
      <P>I cannot see why the Government should willingly encourage students to misspend a year of their lives at such an important juncture.  I appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to show the dash he showed in this House and cut this red tape and impose some sanctions on whatever miserable public servant thought up this and is now being paid to think up fool reasons as to why this iniquitous procedure should be continued.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister and the Department of Education have been accused of many things, but I do not think they have ever been accused of the intention and commitment to think up ways and means of having students waste a very important year in their lives, as Senator Quinlan has just suggested. When I put on record some of the <Col N="90" /> exceptions which have been accepted by the Minister in this area, Senator Quinlan will be glad to accept that, far from doing that, they are actively concerned that the time of students, both during the course of their studies and, if necessary, after the leaving certificate course, should be spent to the best possible advantage of the students, prior to their taking part on university study.</P>
      <P>The declared objective of the higher education grant scheme is to provide for deserving students the opportunity of proceeding to third level studies at universities and comparable institutions. Senators will be pleased to note that the Minister and his Department have been able to extend similar type grants, if not directly under this particular legislation under comparable provisions, to the training colleges and to the new National College of Physical Education.  When the National Council for Educational Awards is operative, it will be much concerned with determining the nature of the courses of study which qualify for inclusion or which would qualify students for a grant under this or a related scheme.  The matter is at a development stage.</P>
      <P>The educational merit is determined by performance at the leaving certificate examination and the applicant who qualifies on educational merit and on family means in a particular year is offered a higher education grant in that year.  There is reasonable provision for the postponement of grant in cases where circumstances make it difficult or impossible for the student to enter higher education immediately or where it is in the educational interest of the student that he remain a further year in second-level education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will give some illustrations of the type of grounds which have been accepted by the Minister for postponement of grant applications.  Senator West referred to a case of this nature. A student under age or immature provided evidence.  Evidence in the case of age is easily provided and a case of immaturity is accepted from the principal in his school.  Normally the Minister favourably considers a postponement of the grant in that case until <Col N="91" /> that student has an opportunity of doing a further year at secondary school, not just to do his leaving certificate but to reach a certain level of maturity or age.</P>
    <P>In 1967 the regulations introduced at post-primary level required that students had to be not less than 12 years on the 1st January preceding their entrance to secondary school, which would mean they would have to be not less than 16 years in June of the year in which they completed their leaving certificate studies.  This happily coincides with the age limit for university entrance.  They must be not less than 17 years on the 1st January of the first academic year.  Some students in the last three years have been in difficulties in that they entered post-primary school too young and had to wait one year or sometimes more before they could enter into university courses.  This will not happen any longer.  One will slot into the other because the entry requirements as to age will correspond.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Mr. Quinlan Mr. Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>The wisdom of that is doubtful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Even allowing for that we are still in a position to consider, on the first clause I have mentioned, grounds for postponement. Senators are aware that entry to certain faculties at this stage is determined by a points system and other competitive but not stringent regulations applied to the universities.  The Minister has power, and does favourably consider the opportunity for a student, to postpone his grant until he acquires that special subject for that special faculty.  In the case of a student taking a pre-recommended university course, as happens in many schools particularly in the Dublin region, the Minister is empowered and has sanctioned postponement in certain circumstances.  The student may have been considering pursuing a religious vocation and did not require his university grant immediately.  It could be postponed until he might require the grant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those are the grounds on which postponements are effected at present.  The Minister sympathetically considers the <Col N="92" /> particular aspects of each case.  But, as Senator West has said, there has to be a closing date for this reason if none other, that the applications have to be processed by the local authorities and the universities notified in time for their registration date.  The schools are adequately aware of this both because of this motion and questions that have been raised in the Dáil.  One would hope that, between the notifications to the schools and the repeated reference to this question, this matter would bring itself to the attention of the school authorities and the pupils concerned.</P>
    <P>With regard to Senator West's suggestion that in any particular year a student who is qualified would be allowed to apply in any year subsequently, the obvious question arises: where do you stop?  The qualification is related to family income.  It is related perhaps to place of residence because the rate of grant varies.  In many cases it is related to the number of dependants in the family.</P>

      <P>Very much so. The Senator is aware of many of the problems which apply at entry level at university.  If the free-for-all which Senators West and Quinlan are suggesting were introduced, that number could fluctuate considerably from year to year when it increases, as increase it will.</P>

      <P>If the universities could provide the accommodation on a free-for-all basis there might be some merit in what Senator West is saying.</P>

      <P>If I may conclude on this point, the Senator is not just talking about the late applicants in a particular year.  He has suggested that once one qualifies in a particular year one can take the grant whatever year one might choose to do so.  That would give rise to&mdash;&mdash;</P>
