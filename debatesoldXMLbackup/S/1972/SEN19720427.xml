      <P>In opening last night I traced a little of the idealistic background of the Common Market itself and the fact that we must all feel a great sense of pride and confidence in the fact that the whole movement began by such statesmen as de Gasperi, Schumann and Adenauer who were ranked as the three finest statesmen that have emerged in Europe in the past few hundred years. We all support the full realisation of their dream of a Europe united, a Europe that has a major role to play in the world, which will be a counterweight representing the European viewpoint between America on the one hand and Russia on the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The movement started off on economics. Spectacular results have been achieved. They are now working towards an ever-closer type of political union which may take ten to 15 years to realise. In joining we have a commitment to work with the other <Col N="856" /> nations for the fulfilment of this ever-closer union of European peoples. It is not so much a commitment as a privilege and an honour to be able to contribute to the strengthening and the fashioning of the new Europe, just as we are anxious to play our part in the United Nations and in other bodies working for a better world. We can make a very positive contribution in the fashioning of the new Europe. We can be pragmatists as well as idealists in that we realise that the development of a new Europe involving a close union with European peoples is essential for the preservation of peace both in Europe and in the world as a whole.</P>
    <P>It is essential that the major powers like Germany, France, Italy and England be part of that union. Equally, we should realise that we are not essential to it. It is not going to make or break the united states of Europe whether or not we are a part of it. Our position on the periphery of that group between Europe and America gives us a still further boundary position that is not right. I should like to emphasise that, having achieved European union which may take ten to 15 years at that stage, the Treaty setting out this new union and the political and other commitments involved in it, including defence, will have to come back to each of the member countries for ratification. It is laid down in the Treaty of Rome that such a procedure has to be followed.</P>
    <P>The amendment of the Constitution which will be put before the people on 10th May ensures that they will have to be consulted when this new Treaty comes for ratification. There will have to be another referendum in ten to 15 years time. At that stage we will have to face squarely the political and other commitments involved in continuing in the Community. If our not taking part in it did any damage to the cause of European and world peace, I would be very keen that we should take part. On the other hand, I believe it does not matter to European and world peace whether or not we are in it. In short, the crucial referendum will be the one in ten to 15 years time. We have a very free hand in looking at our position <Col N="857" /> at that stage. We can make a decision either to opt in or out as we feel it suits our national interests. I would feel that, having played a part in fashioning it, there would be a desire on our part to continue. I wish to stress that the people will have the last word then. In ten to 15 years time we will be able to look at the world situation. We cannot say today what the world situation is likely to be. Neither can we forecast the economic situation then. Is there going to be an economic advantage to our staying in the political community at that stage? All these points will have to be weighed.</P>
    <P>The present referendum deals solely with a trade pact. That cannot be emphasised too often. It is merely the question of gaining entry into European markets for our goods and the opportunity of working with others towards the betterment of Europe and world peace. Consequently, we can assess this question as if it were one of a trade pact. We must consider if it is in our national interest to enter into this pact. It is not going to affect the development of the European Economic Community whether we enter or not at this stage. We are only an island of four million people and can exercise no decisive powers. We can have a great moral influence&mdash; Christian leadership&mdash;in joining with the Christian Democrats and others in fashioning the new Europe. The decision is ours. It revolves solely, at this stage, on the question of the trade pact.</P>
    <P>There is another point which should be emphasised. If at any time in the short term, in the next three, four or five years, all our estimates were proved wrong, as the Leader of the Labour Party seems to suggest when he says that we are not ready for full membership and that it will have very disastrous effects for us, then the obvious duty of any Irish Government would be simply to recognise the situation and return to Brussels to renegotiate our position.</P>
    <P>There is nothing binding in the question of a trade pact. If you cease to obey the rules, then you are out. It is <Col N="858" /> as simple as that. France withdrew from participation in 1948 and did not return for a year and a half. What was the meaning of the recent French referendum? If the people had voted &ldquo;No&rdquo;, what would that have meant? Obviously it would have meant that France was out. Mr. Wilson stated that he would renegotiate, although his position is very doubtful and seems to be an exercise in political gymnastics. It does not advance the credibility of his leadership. This is the factual position. All the interested parties such as the major political parties, the independent economists, various students of political and economic affairs, the various farming organisations, the federation of manufacturers and many of the trade unions, including Mr. Larkin's union and others, cannot be wrong in deciding that this opportunity offers us a tremendous possibility to develop our country.</P>
    <P>As regards the negotiations and results, we agree that the transitional terms were more favourable than any of us expected. The Government deserve our congratulations on their achievements. These achievements were largely the work of the official Civil Service negotiating team in Brussels. The Minister for External Affairs, Deputy Hillery, gave them excellent leadership. Any criticisms are less than generous because there have been no suggestions as to how the terms might be improved.</P>
    <P>In the present situation great credit is due to the Fine Gael Party for taking a national stand on this question, when a narrow self-interest in their case might have given them the opportunity of bringing down the Government. I hope that this coming together will mark the beginning of a frequent non-party approach to many of our national problems, and that all-party committees, on the basis of their use in Holland and elsewhere, will become a feature of our approach to our problems. We cannot afford the luxury, in 19th century fashion, of political debate and exaggerated political criticisms. We are too small a community. The world is too small for us to indulge in such luxury. I hope we will choose the all-party approach for the <Col N="859" /> future. If the referendum is carried by a large majority, as I am confident it will, I hope the Labour Party will come in with the others to ensure a united approach to our problems in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>The dominant feature in the present context is that we cannot compare the future with the present. People may say about the present situation that we could be worse off. The one certainty about the future is that, if we do not go in, we will be even worse off than at present. Our two main exports, industrial and agricultural, to the British market are going behind the tariffs walls of EEC. This would be a totally new situation for us. If we are to judge by our success over the past ten years in selling to the countries behind that tariff barrier, there is little hope for the future.</P>
    <P>In the early sixties we had quite a promising sale in some agricultural products, beef especially, to Germany, Holland and some other continental countries. That trade has virtually disappeared now due to the levies, quotas and other restrictions placed on it. We will be endeavouring to help the hill farmers in our development of the sheep industry, but we can all remember how we were treated in the Paris market where it was not simply a case of having to face a tariff of 20 per cent or 25 per cent, but of having the door shut in our faces whenever it suited the French authorities to do so. Consequently, our exports to that market have been greatly reduced and provide no base whatsoever for the development of an Irish sheep industry.</P>
    <P>We know of the difficulties we encountered in selling our dairy products two or three years ago when butter was being sold in some African countries&mdash;which were new markets we were told to develop&mdash;at a shilling a pound. Yet a market of 200 million people was available in Europe and we could not get butter into it to sell it even at a shilling a pound. What hope have we of selling dairy products in the EEC? What hope have we of getting them in when England has <Col N="860" /> been unable to secure the continued access of New Zealand and Australian dairy products on the same basis as heretofore? In fact, the Australians are going out of the market and the New Zealanders are to have their cheese exports phased out and their butter exports reduced to 80 per cent by the end of the transitional period. That percentage is to be reviewed again after the transitional period. If England was not able to obtain better percentages for her dominions in New Zealand and Australia what hope have we of doing so? Surely our hope does not lie in the sending to Brussels of some of the hundreds of would-be negotiators that have blossomed forth on the Irish scene? The idea of negotiations held by those people is simply that we just send over everything we have and they are expected to take it.</P>
    <P>I was amazed to read in today's paper that the Leader of the Labour Party, who is in favour of an associate agreement, in trying to point out the difference of his associate membership concept of the EEC and the full membership that has been negotiated, wants to have full access for all our industrial products to the enlarged EEC without quotas or levies. What does he expect to give in return for such a concession? Surely he would have to give the same as Sweden and the other associate members, that is, access to the Irish market on the same terms for all European industrialists. No other arrangement would be possible and that arrangement would only cater for industrial goods. It is regrettable that the Labour Party seem to have forgotten about the question of maketing agricultural products. Some of them suggested that we could sell them to eastern Europe. Our history of selling to eastern Europe over the last 20 years has not been very impressive but this was not the fault of the sales teams who went out there. We have an imbalance of at least six to one with most of those countries.</P>
    <P>Underlying this assumption of associate membership there is a feeling that we will be in a position to prop up industries that are in trouble. In other words, by means of State aids <Col N="861" /> we will be able to dump our products on the EEC if we remain outside it. That simply is not true because the fundamental concept of free trade in the Common Market is that there will have to be fairly rigid rules to prevent dumping. I believe we are more concerned with the prevention of dumping than the bigger countries because much more damage could be done to our industries by dumping. I cannot understand why people can put forward such naïve ideas on trade arrangements.</P>
    <P>Other alternatives have been suggested, which would be comical if the matter was not so serious, such as subsidising both agriculture and industry. One celebrated economist has even suggested using the printing presses for money. I thought we had moved a little away from that kind of thinking. Those who hold that our economy is too weak for full membership cannot have studied the protocol of the EEC or realise the value of what has been negotiated. The protocol, on page 114 of the White Paper, recalls that the fundamental objectives of the Community consist of a steady improvement of the living standards and working conditions of the people living in the member states, together with the harmonious development of their economies by reducing the differences between the various regions and the assisting of the more backward economies. It goes on to note that the Irish Government have the same objectives. On page 114 under the heading &ldquo;The Member States of the Community&rdquo; it says:</P>
    <P>TAKE NOTE of the fact that the Irish Government has embarked upon the implementation of a policy of industrialisation and economic development designed to align the standards of living in Ireland with those of the other European nations and to eliminate under-employment while progressively evening out regional differences in levels of development.</P>
    <P>Having noted that as being an Irish policy the third paragraph states:</P>
    <P>RECOGNISE it to be their common <Col N="862" /> interest that the objectives of this policy be so attained.</P>
    <P>It is in the interest of the EEC that the Irish Government succeed in its policy of regional development and of raising the standard of living of our people. The fourth paragraph goes on to say:</P>
    <P>They agree to recommend to this end that the Community institutions implement all the means and procedures laid down by the treaties, particularly by making adequate use of the Community resources intended for the realisation of the Community's above-mentioned objectives.</P>
    <P>That is a blank cheque intended for our use to demand all sorts of concessions and aids to carry through our policy of improving the standard of living of our people and of eliminating difficulties in the less favoured parts of the country. Of course, the cheque is only as good as our negotiating team. Our negotiators may look for some special concession, particularly if that special concession is intended as an inducement for industry in order to prevent that industry from getting into trouble. If our team fight strongly enough in Brussels for it, then the Commission are empowered to give anything they like under this protocol.</P>
    <P>I do not think that the importance of that has been realised. I am amazed at the attitude of a party such as Labour, and their supporters who claim to be socialists in the best sense of the word, and who are supposed to be completely concerned with the welfare of their fellowman. Although many of us subscribe to the idealisms of socialists, we may question the practicality of some of their statements, and we can accept their idealism and practical Christianity in their concern for the underprivileged and the underdeveloped.</P>
    <P>It amazes me that these same people can treat absolutely cynically the aims and objectives of the Common Market, which are largely aims and objectives in which socialist thought has played a very strong and leading part in fashioning. It began with the Christian Democrats and today the dominant philosophy in Europe is that of the <Col N="863" /> Social Democrats and the more middle-of-the-road thinking of socialism. As far as I know, there are only two socialist parties in Europe who are not endorsing and accepting the aims and objectives of their fellow-socialists in Europe for the improvement of conditions in Europe generally. They are the Irish Labour Party and the British Labour Party, although the latter have not questioned the objectives. They have only suggested negotiating for better terms. Otherwise, they are in favour of entering the EEC.</P>
    <P>I consider this to be extraordinary and I should like spokesmen for the Labour Party to explain this deep distrust they have of their fellow-socialists in Europe. If they are subscribing to socialist parties in general, are we to accept that their protestations are not to be taken seriously?</P>
    <P>If we take into account the situation in our six counties in Northern Ireland, it baffles the mind to see how anyone would want to convert the existing, we hope, temporary border into a permanent European border, maintained by the resources not of Britain but of Europe. This would disrupt the trade that has always existed between North and South. A great deal of play has been made that ten out of the 12 representatives from the Unionist and nonUnionist sides in Westminster opposed entry into the EEC. That is not correct. They opposed the entry of Britain into the EEC. I can see the reasons for and against that.</P>
    <P>If I were part of the British system and took a narrow British insular outlook on it, I might feel that England would have to pay a fairly high price for being part of the fashioning of a new Europe. On the other hand, if one is European-minded and conscious of the need for peace and the development of industry in the world, one would ensure that for the potential peace and development of the EEC Britain should go in and play her part in it. However, the issue they voted on was that the comparable issue today would have to be, with the decision of Britain to go in, whether they wanted the Six Counties to stay out or to go in? I have no doubt that of the ten <Col N="864" /> who voted, most of them, in such circumstances, with Britain going in and so creating a completely different situation, would have voted that the Six Counties should do the same.</P>
    <P>The dominant issue for us is to have access to our markets in Britain. That is the reason for our voting for entry, along with the realisation that we must have complete economic development of our resources if we are to achieve the full development of our country. Politics without an economic base is of little use to any country.</P>
    <P>We have to look, then, at what this arrangement has to offer. We have to examine it from the point of view of both agriculture and industry. In the case of industry we find at present that some of our industries are going through a difficult period, largely due to technological changes. The textile industry, for example, is having great difficulty in competing with the various synthetic fibres available. Consequently, they have redundancies and many of them are closing, but it is not the EEC which is causing that. It is simply the changes in technology.</P>
    <P>We have got to accept that in the modern industrial world technology is always changing, that new processes are coming in, making more products obsolete. Consequently industry must always be ready to adapt to change, to go into new lines of work and to retrain its workers. In any factory there are three aspects. There are the workers, there is the factory building and there is the management. The three have got to be able to change&mdash; change processes, change the work they are doing&mdash;when there is the demand. There is no use in producing an article that you cannot sell. We have tried in the past two years to reduce redundancies and to retrain workers. I do not think there is need for redundancies except to help people who are at the stage where retraining would impose too great a burden on them. Most of our workers would profit considerably by periodic retraining. The necessity for this comes about when the process has to be changed.</P>
    <P>We have got to accept this, and the only hope for succeeding in retraining is to have a pretty strong economy. There should be money available from <Col N="865" /> other sectors of the economy for retraining schemes and redevelopment schemes. By and large, I think we owe a commitment to our people that any of those who are required to undergo retraining due to factory closure or due to the necessity to change the product should have an assurance from the Government that during the period of retraining their pay packets will not in any way suffer, and that their families will not suffer in any way. Any group that are retrained will afterwards be a much more valuable industrial group and will be able to contribute much more to the economy than before their retraining. Their whole prospects should increase very considerably under a retraining scheme. It is really one of the outstanding hopes of the future that we have worthwhile and dynamic retraining schemes. Therefore, at all stages we will be able to have buildings and retrained people waiting to take on the new industrial processes and new factories that must inevitably come here as a result of our joining in the Common Market group.</P>
    <P>There is the other side of the industrial arm, the home market. Here I think a great deal could be done to awaken the conscience of our people to the necessity to buy Irish and to support Irish. In this regard I think all the organisations, both the trade union movement and the farmers' organisations, could do a lot more than they have been doing to bring home to their members the necessity for supporting Irish industry, and also the necessity to make their complaints known in shops which try to hide the country of origin of the goods which they sell. You can see on their shelves articles, many of which are imported, displayed in such a way that the casual buyer could believe that they were home produced.</P>
    <P>We have to take strong action in this matter. The necessity for action in it becomes more important if we are in the Common Market. The Government cannot take part in that, but this is a free country, with free association, and if the associations themselves through their members can do it the housewife, by taking her custom elsewhere, can very quickly enforce a <Col N="866" />&ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; policy. We must also play a part in the development of efficiency in our Irish industries. Indeed, that can be sadly lacking in many of them. It is no service to the nation or to the employees in such inefficient industries to allow them to carry on in their slipshod and old-fashioned ways.</P>
    <P>By all means, we should at all stages insist on efficiency, insist on having the job done properly, but we should not take the easy way out that many are inclined to take and say: &ldquo;Oh, well, that is an inferior article and we will buy the foreign article.&rdquo; We should buy the article but insist that the job be done properly and make our complaints known at factory level, publicly if necessary. If we do that, then I am sure we will really do a job in modernising the industries catering for the home market. Many of them have for too long used their protection shield as a reason for not advancing or for not being efficient.</P>
    <P>That is the workers' side of it. There will be great opportunity, with new industries continually coming in, both to expand our industrial base and at the same time to replace those that have become outmoded. There will also be opportunities for workers who will avail themselves of retraining facilities, when offered, so as to become still better able to do a more complex job than they have been doing. All this adds up to great hope at that level.</P>
    <P>The Government should be able to pour in large retraining funds. I know that the Common Market fund will contribute half the cost, but we will have to be prepared to pour in the funds necessary to compensate the families while the workers are being retrained. There is not the slightest objection to our doing that under any terms of the EEC. The only obstacle is our own lack of funds.</P>
    <P>It is recognised that our social welfare standards are rather low despite efforts to increase them. The recent budget has been a very good example of that but we still have a long way to go and the family of the worker who is undergoing retraining are <Col N="867" /> entitled to full consideration under our social welfare code.</P>
    <P>As far as farming is concerned, there can be no doubt that the EEC offers a great opportunity for Irish agriculture. It is the opportunity we have been long denied. By contrast, the alternatives offer worse than the Economic War conditions to Irish agriculture. We have had a sorry history in agriculture because we are largely in the exporting market and we have no control over those markets. We had the disastrous Economic War of the 1930s and it took Irish agriculture a long time to recover from that. It coincided with a slump in worldwide agriculture conditions. In the 1950s and 1960s we had a kind of a stop-go policy because we depended on our markets to England. England embarked on a policy of cheap food and this meant that we had to subsidise our sale on the British market. After doing that we were still limited by quota restrictions, so that agriculture did not get a chance to expand. At one stage beef was regarded as being in slump.</P>
    <P>Then three years ago the Government panicked because there was a worldwide surplus of dairy products and the price went down. Consequently we were selling butter at less than 5p per lb. in places in Africa. We even set up a reconditioning plant in Philippines because we could not even get what we had to sell into the British market at that time at the prices that prevailed there. As bad as the British market was it was the best outside the US that was available in the world for dairy produce. It is difficult to get any sizeable amount of product into the US. Whether the new negotiators who have arrived on the Irish scene will be able to do a better job with the American market I do not know.</P>
    <P>Agriculture is now offered an opportunity for planned expansion. This planned expansion has been available in Europe since after the war and it has been available in England in the same period. The result has been that British and European agriculture has expanded during the last 25 years at more than 4 per cent per annum. In other words, 100 acres in Europe if <Col N="868" /> producing £1,000 in 1940 today is producing on average between £2,400 and £2,500. That calculation is made on the value of money in 1940. It is a two and a half fold increase, whereas our increase has been less than 1 per cent. We have only had a 50 per cent increase since 1950, from £1,000 to £1,500, yet we have more potential than any comparable area in either Great Britain or western Europe, and given the opportunity we can do it.</P>
    <P>In other words we can make up that leeway. The EEC is offering us the opportunity of doing it. For us it means that our expansion is now about to begin and the estimates made by various farming organisations and various specialist groups all pin-point our potential and the fact that we can easily average at least a 5 per cent increase in the next ten years if we get the conditions as offered in the EEC.</P>
    <P>What is the alternative to that? If we do not go in there is no question of getting any arrangement with the Common Market for the sale of dairy products unless they have a shortage there, and this is unlikely. Even if it were likely, the sale would be negotiated on their terms. So the only product that we could hope to sell is beef. We have fought here against turning the country into a beef ranch, but make no mistake about it, if we fail to get into the EEC the only use we can make of our land is as a beef ranch with a consequent reduction in total output and consequently a reduction of manpower on the farm. Even then the price for beef would be substantially below what we would get if we were members of the EEC because we would have to pay a levy and a tariff. If we do not enter the EEC it would be impossible to continue to subsidise dairy products and to keep anywhere near the present price. Industry will require aids to get over the adaptations and the technological innovations required to provide employment, so where will we get the money for the development of agriculture? It cannot be done so the country would be forced into being a ranch.</P>
    <P>What are the opportunities offered if we accept full membership? On last year's production figures for exports, <Col N="869" /> which were around £170 million, we would earn another £70 million. The Government would no longer be called upon to pay subsidies which cost around £35 million last year. This year there is a reduction in that, due to the high prices prevailing for dairy products on the British market. If England goes behind the barrier and we are out we cannot calculate what subsidy would be required next year.</P>
    <P>This is the situation at the moment. We are capable of this 5 per cent increase and it could well be exceeded in the early years. This 5 per cent increase in production means at least a 10 per cent increase in exports, because all our increased production is for export. We cannot consume any more dairy products at home. This is an exporting industry and the 5 per cent increase would mean that, over the transition period up to 1980, we would have a 50 per cent increase. A 5 per cent increase means a 20 per cent increase in exports. In a five year period that means over a 50 per cent increase. It means that the exports which would be valued at last year's EEC prices at £240 million, would increase by another £120 million.</P>
    <P>We would have £120 million coming into the country and we ask what this means, apart from the increase in farmers' incomes. First of all, it means that the money is in circulation in the country. It is met by the various indirect tax laws at various stages, such as tax on petrol, beer, and so on. For every £100 put into circulation that way, the tax yield increases by about £40. An increase of £70 million would probably produce £25 million to £30 million additional tax yield. At the end of the period, when we have increased by another £120 million, 40 per cent of the gross, which is £240 million exports, would amount to almost £100 million.</P>
    <P>We might expect that increased production in agriculture alone over the next five years would free the Government from having to pay subsidies, which would show a net saving of around £30 million. At the same time increased production over the period would go from £70 million at present <Col N="870" /> to £240 million, giving tax yields of about £25 million to £30 million up to £100 million. This is money we did not have control of before. Last year's social welfare bill was £83 million. Our health bill amounted to £53 million. This money, if applied to social welfare, would enable rates everywhere to be doubled or spread around to create a spectacular improvement in all spheres. That is only the start because, if the income of the farming community doubles, then the Government will be looking for more taxation from the farming community. That is as it should be.</P>
    <P>There will be income tax on farms and the Government will get a certain amount, whatever they think fair and equitable, from the increased return received by the farmer. This money will help to get our industry adjusted for modern technological change and modern competition. The key to the development of our industry and the key to uplifting our social assistance and improving generally our social services is to have agriculture on a prosperous basis, where it can relieve the Government and the taxpayer of paying the existing subsidies. By the additional foreign exchange it brings in, it will create a tremendous boost in tax returns to the Exchequer, which I have estimated at going from an initial £30 million up to £100 million at the end of five years. The farming community now become considerably more wealthy and consequently provides for the Government additional tax yields by paying income tax on their farms. All this adds up to a picture where industry and agriculture are complementary partners in getting us over the next ten years.</P>
    <P>We cannot kill the goose which lays the golden egg, which is our agriculture. Agriculture will demand a great amount of capital over the next five to ten years if it is to realise its full potential over the next 20 years. The prospects are so good that a certain amount can be financed by external borrowing and a great deal more can be financed by co-operative finance between the various farming co-operatives and co-operative organisations throughout the country. Many small <Col N="871" /> farmers are shedding crocodile tears and the more citified they are the greater the flow of tears.</P>
    <P>We have got to be realistic on the question of small farmers. What is a small farmer? Anyone with 15, 20, 25, 30 or 40 acres could be classified as a small farmer. Most of such farms are operated by very elderly people. In the main there is no one to succeed them. The average age of those working on Irish farms, including the owners, is 57. One-third of those are widows.</P>
    <P>At least half the farmers with under 40 acres have no succession in sight. They are bachelors. The children of those who are married have long since left the drudgery of the small farm and are working in Dublin, England or elsewhere. They are not going to come back. Even in the case of the 40 to 100 acre farm the succession is far from guaranteed. At least a third of those fall into the no succession class.</P>
    <P>Our problem over the next ten to 15 years will be to find people to run the farms. There will have to be a great improvement in inducements on the small farms if we are to get people back to work them. That means the owners of the small farms will need a great deal of training. They will have to be assisted to develop their land by additional specialist advice and also to participate in schemes like family farm holidays in a united states of Europe.</P>
    <P>At that stage it will be a very different situation from what we have today. It would be only a fool who would try to be dogmatic about what conditions would be like then or, indeed, what would be in our national self-interest provided that does not damage the prospects of world or European peace. Let us reserve the matter until then. Meanwhile let us keep the question on the low key on which it should be kept. Let us all join together in making a fresh start for the development of both agriculture and industry within the framework of the European Economic Community.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Government on the success of the negotiations involved. They have done a good job. I <Col N="872" /> would have wished them to have involved the other political parties in the negotiations at an earlier stage. If that had been done, we would have had a more united approach. On 10th May the electorate, having read as much as possible on the subject, should think it out.</P>
    <P>We have to come back to a basis of confidence in regard to the advice they are given. That means that those who supported the Fianna Fáil Party in the last election must face the issue that their party have made the case for entry. It is up to their supporters to show their confidence in the party on 10th May. Are they going to take economic advice from the party they support or are they going to take it from Mr. Tony Coughlan and the various wings of Sinn Féin on that date?</P>
    <P>The flight from the land has been completely misunderstood and overplayed. We speak of a flight from the land of 10,000 a year when, in effect, most of that is in coffins to the local graveyards. In an ageing community of 250,000 people, such as the farming community, about 10,000 people die each year. This means that recruitment to fill the vacancies left is almost negligible. Some of the young people drift away from the land each year. However, this is happening in all countries although some of them are trying to curb this by improving the conditions and the opportunities on farms.</P>
    <P>This is where I take issue with the White Paper. In its prognostications about the future it still accepts the inevitable decline in the farming population. It says, in effect, that deaths will go on at the same rate as they have been. That is taking for granted that we will have from 10,000 to 12,000 deaths every year. It further says that recruitment will not be able to replace this. Therefore, we will have a net loss each year of 8,000 or a 50,000 net loss over the transitional period.</P>
    <P>This view of the White Paper does not really take into account the dynamic upsurge that must occur over the next five years. The farming organisations say that we cannot get from Irish agriculture its full potential unless we can maintain the work force <Col N="873" /> on the land. They say, in effect, that the White Paper is wrong, that we cannot afford to lose 50,000 people off the land over the next five years. We will have to recruit and train young people to come back to a worthwhile career on the land by having all our farms developed in a modern way.</P>
    <P>It will take a while to get across the message that there are good careers for those who specialise in agriculture, such as specialists in dairy herds. I am happy to take issue with the White Paper on some of their statements and to say that I believe their figure of a loss of 50,000 jobs in agriculture is wrong. I agree more with the views of the farming organisations and the advisory services that we cannot afford that loss. I believe the loss will probably be negligible over the next five years.</P>
    <P>That is all to the good because if we do not have to provide for that loss in agriculture it makes the problem of the industrial arm much simpler. It means the new jobs will be in expansion and that therefore industry will not be overburdened with having to provide for redundancies in agriculture. I believe, therefore, the Government forecast for 50,000 new jobs over a five-year period is realistic, and provided proper emphasis is placed on keeping the jobs in agriculture, the figure of 50,000 new jobs is if anything an underestimate.</P>
    <P>Of course, development in agriculture has to break with the past in so far as it must be based a great deal more on the development of co-operative centres from which relief services would be available to carry out the various tasks to enable the farmer to take a weekend off, or a week's holidays, or to do the milking, for instance, over periods of illness and so forth. Indeed many of the smaller farmers, I feel sure, will find much more fulfilment in working part-time in those relief groups instead of doing the work on their own with very inadequate implements on their farms. That is the picture that every progressive agriculturist today sees as being necessary for the full development of agriculture.</P>
    <P>Then we turn to the question of <Col N="874" /> food costs, about which a great deal has been written. Some very misleading pamphlets have been published. We have to examine this to see what the source is. First of all, the only produce affected will be dairy produce and beef. If we take dairy produce, it means the Government must find out in the next five years what consumer subsidy they are paying. That will have to be phased out. The consumption of butter here is given at 40 lb per head annually. This would mean an increase in price of 2p per lb in the next five years.</P>
    <P>The only legitimate increase in the price of beef would be bridging the price up to the European intervention price, that is from £12 to £16 a cwt. over the five year transitional period. That means an increase of £1 a cwt. each year, which is 1p a lb increase liveweight, or 2p a lb deadweight. That is the average increase which should take place and there is no justification for any other increase. The increase per head for a man, his wife and four children over a four-year period should be in the region of £8. This is comparable to the relief in income tax which has been given to such a person in this year's budget.</P>
    <P>A very important role can be played by the Prices Advisory Body in the transitional period because we must ensure that prices are not increased solely to take advantage of our entry into the Common Market. Those increases should not be based on the transfer of subsidies but should only be based on a genuine increase in raw materials. There should not be any increase in the handling costs involved. I hope that the trade union movement will see to it that over the next four to five years the prosperity that is generated by our entry into the Common Market will not motivate general wage increases.</P>
    <P>Everybody outside the trade union movement should be adequately catered for, especially the social welfare group, the old age pensioners, the widows and orphans. They should be given increases in their benefits to compensate for any increases resulting from our entry into the Common Market. In fact they should get over <Col N="875" /> and above any increases which take place. I believe all political parties share the view that social welfare recipients should be brought up to European standards as soon as possible and I believe they will all work to that end. The Minister for Finance is to be congratulated for his action in regard to those groups in the budget. That is only a small token of what we should be able to achieve in the years ahead when we get from our agricultural industry what it is capable of giving.</P>
    <P>As pointed out in the White Paper, the lowering of customs duties for many products will probably mean a decrease in price so there is no justification for any scare that there will be a catastrophic increase in the cost of living when we enter the Common Market. We must try to control inflation during the foreseeable future. We have had an 8 per cent increase in the cost of living because of inflation during the last four years. We all recognise that inflation is far more serious than any increases that could possibly occur from joining Europe. It we could get inflation down to the range of 1 or 2 per cent, or even double that, I would feel we had gone some distance towards controlling it.</P>
    <P>The main point that needs to be emphasised on the question of any anticipated increase in food prices here is that this is an internal matter. The increase is an increase that goes to the farming community for its products and, as such, the money stays within the community. If the Government feel that the farmers have got too much it is a simple matter to take some of this back from them and give it to the groups concerned. But, if the increase was occasioned by imports, then it would be serious because we have to pay for it and we would have no hope of compensating those who had to pay the higher prices within our own community. I do not think that point has been made. Any reasonable discussion of the food prices here concerns a substantially internal matter.</P>
    <P>This is a question of transferred payments. Indeed, if you look at the <Col N="876" /> other side of the picture, if you go back to 1962 or 1963 when our economy was going quite well, during the First Programme for Economic Development we were expanding quite satisfactorily at 4 per cent or 5 per cent per annum. All wage and salary groups participated in this, but the farming community were held at their existing prices. First of all, the price provided was governed by what it was on the British market. It had not gone up. Secondly, we could not put up the home price of dairy products because England was then threatening to operate a type of anti-dumping penalty if we put up the home prices and the result was that we had to keep down the home prices when justice at that stage would have demanded that the farming community should have participated in the 4 per cent or 5 per cent increase in real national income. This increase was available to every other group but they were not allowed to participate in it largely due to British policy. So now it works somewhat the other way. In many ways, had they been allowed to get that, there would be no need to make this adjustment at this stage.</P>
    <P>However, be that as it may, I want to emphasise that what is involved in increased food prices is a transferred payment from the public to the farming community. Up to this the public had been meeting part of that by means of subsidies paid on dairy products to the farming community. Now they will not have to pay those subsidies. The transfer payment is more direct. But the Government are always arranging transfer payments and will always have the primary function of arranging transfer payments between various sections of the community. I, for one, have no doubt that any Irish Government will see that justice is done in this regard and that no one involved in paying the higher prices will suffer from it and that, if needs be, taxation on farms will more than compensate for such increases and provide the means by which transfer payments are made to the other sections.</P>
    <P>But, of course, in this we have to be very careful not to overestimate the position, because if we are really to expand in the future we have got to <Col N="877" /> plough in capital to agriculture. We have to reconcile two things. We have to reconcile the need for capital in agriculture with the need for ensuring that those who have to pay increased food prices are compensated. Indeed, the present budget more than did that. If the next budget does as much as the present budget has done then it is absolutely certain that all groups will be better off than they are at present. I think, therefore, we should have no fears for the future in that regard.</P>
    <P>We must realise we are a small community here&mdash;a republic of three million people. It behoves us to work together, to develop the resources of our country and to see to it that the less fortunate sections of our community &mdash;the social welfare groups, the widows, the orphan, the pensioners and so on&mdash;are all properly catered for and that their present position is quickly and radically improved. It also behoves us to see to it that we value our two greatest assets. The first is our land, which is second to none. Because of our climate's suitability for the growing of grass and the decreased need for housing on farms and our relatively higher winter temperature our potential for development is second to none in Europe. Therefore, let us have confidence in that and let us help it develop.</P>
    <P>The other factor we must recognise, equally with that, is that our future depends on our trained manpower. They must be trained at every level, from the lowest to the highest. The training of manpower in the modern industrial sense calls for a force that periodically has to be retrained either within its own factory to undertake new processes or to change the type of work it is doing. Let us realise it is in the interest of everyone to see that this retraining is carried out and that the family concerned does not suffer in the retraining. That is an obligation we have to all our people. If we do that I have no doubt whatever but that we can compete successfully with any group anywhere and that we can develop our country to play its part in the development and fashioning of the new Europe.</P>
    <P>But I must conclude by stressing the <Col N="878" /> fact that what we are asked today is a very limited question. It is a question of whether we believe that this trade pact is for the betterment of our community. When we see the many great advantages, and probably some disadvantages, I think there is no question but that the overwhelming balance of advantage lies with going ahead.</P>
    <P>Where we go if we do not accept this, I cannot picture. With our main markets in industry and agriculture gone behind tariff walls we would face a return in agriculture to the Economic War conditions of the 1930s. In industry we would have a shock that would make the 10 per cent levies put on ten years ago in England seem insignificant. Also we will have an opportunity of making our contribution to the fashioning of a new Europe. Let us reserve our position completely as individuals as to what we will do if and when, in ten or 15 years time, a treaty comes before us to join the political united states of Europe. At that stage there will be a very different situation from that existing today. Only a fool would try to be dogmatic about what conditions will be like or what would be the best in our national self-interest to do, provided that our national self-interest does not damage the prospects of world peace or of European peace.</P>
    <P>People must ask themselves on 10th May: do they follow Fine Gael or Sinn Féin? When it comes to the followers of the Labour Party and the trade union movement they must realise that the labour movement, alone of the three main sectors involved, is the one which is openly split on this question. There is no evidence of a split anywhere in the Fianna Fáil Party. There is a one-man monetary reform in Fine Gael. In the Labour Party there was a 40 per cent vote pro-EEC at its congress. The outstanding memory of that congress was the appearance of the late Senator James Dunne, of whom no Senator in this House had a higher standing, when he came from his sick bed to make that heartfelt plea which was tantamount to saying we were better in the EEC than outside it. Mr. Larkin also spoke in favour of membership. Labour supporters must realise that it is an issue on which there is no <Col N="879" /> clearcut decision in their party. Sixty per cent for and 40 per cent against membership would be an inconclusive result. Deputy Corish has made it quite clear that they share none of the opposition mooted by the Sinn Féin group and others and that their sole concern is that we are not ready for full membership. The Labour Party have not, however, given a credible alternative. The alternative given by Deputy Corish in today's paper is exactly the same for industry as it will have under full agreement, without access to the regional fund or any say in the deliberations. What does Deputy Keating offer for agriculture? What he offers is a beef ranch here for Western Europe. That is no alternative.</P>
    <P>Finally, if some unforeseen circumstances should arise over the next few years, as a result of joining the European Economic Community, the protocol gives us the right to demand all the special treatment we require to ensure that the policies of all parties in this country&mdash;raising the standard of living to that of those in Europe and developing the West and other regions &mdash;are not jeopardised. We should be thankful for what has been achieved and look forward with confidence to the next ten years. Let the period after that be judged later. We have enough work to go on with for the next ten years. We have got a ten-year period for fisheries and that is as far ahead as we can look in the troubled world of today. We can be confident that the electorate will respond in an overwhelming manner to the rational case put before them. They will not be misled by the outrageous documents which suggest that because the price of tea is 40p per lb here and 120p per lb in Brussels we will be paying such an increase in its price. Tea will be bought in exactly the same market under the same conditions, if we are in the Common Market, as it is being bought today.</P>
    <P>I would appeal for an end to this misleading type of scare propaganda. The electorate should be allowed to see the issue for what it is. My advice to the electorate is, if you place your confidence with groups or with people, whether they are in vocational organisations, <Col N="880" /> like the national farmers' organisations or the creamery milk suppliers, or with political parties such as Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael or Labour, look to these bodies for your guidance, but remember that the Labour Party is also that of the late Senator James Dunne and Mr. Larkin as well as that of Deputy Keating.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal briefly with this question. I welcome the great opportunity given to this country, North and South. We do not realise the value of this opportunity. Many of the people in the country who are far removed from the problems of Partition may not realise that there is a strong desire for people to rid themselves of isolation. There can be any amount of discussion about this question but the one primary advantage which this country will have, the first in its history, will be to rid itself of the isolation which has bedevilled every section of our community. Most of our voters will realise this.</P>
      <P>Some months ago I thought that the present troubles and the Partition problem consisted of three parts and that entry into the Common Market would certainly solve two of them. Firstly, our commerce and trade were a problem, and a greater problem for those who were living quite near to what was already a border. To many people in Ireland the Border is only a border in name because they are living quite close to it, but a border is also psychological as well as physical. I look forward with hope to entering the Common Market and getting rid of the physical border as well as the psychological border. I felt we would have to live with a political border for some considerable time, but the change in events has now left us with a tremendous opportunity. We now have only the physical and psychological border.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we enter the Common Market we will practically demolish that border. We will then have a people who will come together and reap the advantages for industry, agriculture and the other sectors of our economy of working together to our benefit. This will be an opportunity for a new Ireland to assert itself. It will break down all <Col N="881" /> the artificial problems and issues that exist today. That is my dearest hope because in our small island of four million people we are loaded with administration. We have inherited systems of hospitals, local authorities, health boards and regional boards which are proving very difficult to modernise.</P>
    <P>I can see an opportunity for us when we enter the EEC to get rid of some of the duplication which exists at present. There is an administration in the North of Ireland and an administration here in the Republic. This is duplication at the expense of the taxpayer. Most of our legislation has been inherited and was formulated for conditions which do not exist today. We have numerous commissions that are slow to move and that are dependent on outdated records. In the EEC I can see a healthy new approach to this whole problem. In my own county, County Donegal, we are cut off from the outside world by three bridges, two across the Foyle and one across the Erne. While I sympathise with and understand the feelings of people who would like to see the country united, I cannot envisage any wing of Sinn Féin successfully coming out and opposing our entry to the EEC. If one crosses bridges at Strabane or Derry and sees the barbed wire, the tanks and the armoured vehicles, one realises that a vote against our entry to the EEC would be a vote which would result in making these barriers more permanent. I hope that everybody, not only in Donegal but also in the west of Ireland, regardless of where their religious or political beliefs lie, will come and vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;. I believe it would put them further into the wilderness if we were not to enter the Common Market.</P>
    <P>One of the most frequent comments of anti-EEC advocates is: &ldquo;How much will you pay for your goods in the EEC? What are the prices of them in the European supermarkets?&rdquo; Our people are intelligent and they realise that most of the goods they will buy in a supermarket are goods which are produced at home. The average Irish family are mainly concerned about the <Col N="882" /> prices of basic necessities of life, such as potatoes, vegetables, milk, beef, mutton, fish, bacon, sugar and clothing. Most of those items will increase in price when we enter the EEC but that increase in price will be to the benefit of the Irish people who are producing them. They have been producing such items for numerous years for pitiable wages and under slave conditions. I am delighted that the Irish Farmers Association are making no secret of their determination to enter the EEC. We have a really earnest drive by the farmers' organisation at present and I consider it of great importance.</P>
    <P>Our industries that are viable are bound to succeed in EEC conditions. Taking the broad spectrum of industries from the Guinness brewery to the fishermen in Burtonport every one of them will survive if they are outward-looking and progressive. However, we may lose some of our industries. For some years we have been heavily supporting some of our industries. They were good for us at the time and helped to relieve the unemployment situation. I know of industries which started here. They were given substantial grants to set up here and if some of those industries fail in EEC conditions it will do us no harm at all. I believe our industries will be much healthier inside the EEC. I believe we will get an advantage in regard to items which we have to purchase but do not manufacture.</P>
    <P>We have great potential in our industries such as farming, fishing, tourism and the tweed industry. Those industries will benefit greatly in EEC conditions. We should develop them to the advantage of those who work in them. I find it very difficult to understand the people who are campaigning against our entry. Their case still remains unexplained. I feel confident that voters will think for themselves on this issue. I have no doubt that we will have a massive vote in favour of our entry. I am grateful for the opportunity given to me to speak here in favour of our entry into the EEC. I will be surprised if we do not have an 80 per cent acceptance of the referendum.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to apologise for the late intervention by my party in this debate. Senator Cranitch made the point last night that he had not heard an Opposition voice in the debate. It was a reasonable point to make. However, I wish to explain that our spokesman on the subject, Senator Kennedy, is away at the moment. Other members of our party are also unavoidably absent. We are a small group&mdash;as the Irish group in Brussels shall be if we enter the EEC&mdash;and, as we do not order the business of the House, it is not always easy for us to be here.</P>
      <P>My intervention will be a brief one too. I wish only to place on record the Labour Party's opposition to entry and in doing so I am voicing the unanimous opinion of the political Labour movement and that is the only movement I am in a position to speak for here. Whatever Senator Quinlan might say about splits in the Labour movement on this issue, there is no split in the political Labour movement.</P>
      <P>We were asked to consider the White Paper and we, in the Labour Party, do not share the optimism that appears to exist among the Members of this House, from the speeches I have listened to today. I should like to refer to page 28 of the White Paper which I consider to be disconcerting. It refers to our voice in the EEC, our voting strength on the Council of Ministers&mdash; which is three out of 61&mdash;our voice in the Commission which gives me even more concern because it is just one seat out of 14. This Commission have far-reaching powers and I shall enumerate them: powers to make regulations which apply to member states; powers to make directions, which must be implemented by member states. I understand that this will result in our Parliament having to pass legislation in order to give effect to these directions; I cannot see what function we would have, if we had no choice but to make these directions operative; power to make decisions which must be carried out by all those to whom they are addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This would be understandable if this was an elected democratic body, but it <Col N="884" /> is not. Its institution is totally undemocratic, and placing this control in the hands of such an authority represents loss of sovereignty. We are giving this power to a body which is very far removed from the average Irish man and woman. It is a body to which an appeal would be a very rare, if not impossible, thing. However, it might be something that we could afford to do, or that we would consider a price we ought to pay if, in return, we got improved living standards for the Irish people. This is where we differ from the other parties and groups in this House. We are not satisfied that this will bring improved living standards for the Irish people. Indeed, the reverse appears to be the case.</P>
    <P>We may be described as cautious, but our concern basically is for Irish jobs and the situation concerning the cost of living within the EEC. Our industries at the moment are not geared towards free trade, over which we would have no control. We are a small nation by any standards, but by European standards our industries are minute. At the moment we are in a kind of transition stage. Traditionally, we have had high employment industries depending largely on the home market. Now we are gearing towards new growth industries, but the transition is only at the beginning of the road. The Labour Party feel that at this stage there is too much at stake to have a situation where we would have absolute free trade, as well as a situation where we would have no ability to retain anything in the nature of incentives or differentials, or the ability to locate industry where it might be most suited in the interests of jobs.</P>
    <P>That is why an associated membership might fit better our needs at the moment. I understand that in this we should also have free trade, with the removal of tariffs and quotas, and within our own community we could retain the incentives and differentials and the steps that it would be possible for us to take in order to protect jobs.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party may be described as being cautious by not being prepared to take that gamble, but we are concerned with Irish workers and their wives and families. Perhaps some Irish <Col N="885" /> industries are badly constructed and are dependant on Government aid, and perhaps it would be a good thing to see them go. It would be a good thing to see them go if there were not so many lives and so many domestic budgets depending on those industries.</P>
    <P>We need more time to take stock. If we have full entry into the EEC now, we have a period of five years during which we can take steps, although inadequate, to prevent dumping. After that five years we will be one united market and we can take no steps whatsoever. At this time it is difficult to be sure that after five years our industries will be in a position to face unbridled free trade in Europe.</P>
    <P>The case that the pro-marketeers, as they are called, have been making is that within the EEC industrialists from Britain, from Europe and from outside Europe will come in here to gain access to the 250 million market of Europe, provided that our costs are competitive. Before I go into the question of costs I should like to state that we think the reverse would be the position. Obviously there would be no control over capital and capital will flow where profit can be made. Profit can be made at the heart of the market, which is in the big centres of Europe, and not in Ireland. We can see a situation where Irish labour would have no choice but to follow that capital and that industry out of their native country into the heart of Europe.</P>
    <P>Referring to high costs, we are told by the pro-marketeers that we will have foreign industrialists coming here if our costs are competitive. There is a much better chance of our costs being competitive outside the EEC. There is much talk about high food costs. Naturally higher food costs will result in higher protection costs. We have heard a lot today about the circulation of misleading documents concerning food costs. Of course, there are some that will not stand up to scrutiny. However, there is one published by the London <i>Financial Times</i> which does not, incidentally, include an item such as tea, cited by Senator Quinlan. It was compiled by a group which would have no interest in promoting <Col N="886" /> any anti-EEC campaign but which largely refers to agricultural produce.

Table wine, of course, is much more expensive here than it is in any European country but I do not think we need to mention table wine because this will not form an item of food in the average Irish housewife's shopping basket anyway. Beef, peas, aspirins and probably a few non-relevant ones are listed, but the majority are non-relevant. This is something which carries a great deal of weight with the average Irish housewife.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point being made by those people who would have us believe the increase is to be only two or three pence seems to be related to the <Col N="887" /> apparent rate of increase of commodities as a result of EEC entry. We are not just saying it, but it has been proved beyond all doubt that farm gate prices and shop counter or supermarket shelf prices bear no relation whatsoever. If they bear a relation it is something in the region of four times greater.</P>
    <P>Our experience in the past has not been that we can depend on Government action to spread the burden equitably. We are genuinely concerned about these increased prices, particularly to the lower paid workers, to the social welfare recipients, and also the fact that these increased prices will push up production prices. Indeed we feel that the position could well be that the lower production costs outside could cancel out any tariffs which we would have to overcome even if we do not enter.</P>
    <P>The Irish Congress of Trade Unions' paper <i>Economic Freedom</i> devotes two pages to an analysis of the loss of jobs. It comes up, rightly or wrongly, with a figure of a loss of from 30,000 to 35,000 jobs. The point I am trying to make here is that the analysis and the method by which the final figure was reached are there for all to see. The Government, on the other hand, have come up with a figure of a gain of 50,000 jobs but there is no analysis. We are asked to take the figure on trust. Personally, I chose to take the figure which has been produced for me as a result of pages of research and analysis.</P>
    <P>I will not devote a great deal of time to this issue. I just want to make one more major point. It is concerning policy and I make it because it is one of the reasons why so many people are concerned about entry into the EEC, because of the fact that there is no regional policy. There is also the fact that in Europe itself what they describe as the backward areas, concentrating on agriculture, make up half of a region and a quarter of the population of Europe. I think we should bear this in mind when we talk about all the money that will be available for development in this country. <Col N="888" /> Europe has her own problems on which to spend this money and we are not the only area seeking assistance. Europe has a quarter of a million unemployed. It is to us no consolation to say that something is being done about this, that at the summit meeting in October this will be talked about.</P>
    <P>If we are talking about things that might happen we could also mention the proposal which is at present before the Council concerning land purchase. We have protection on land purchase at the moment; it is limited to those who have spent two years in agriculture in Ireland or to land that has been in dispute for two years. There has been a proposal for a free for all before the Commission since 1969. We must remember that this is in accordance with the Treaty of Rome, unlike the question of regional development. Everybody admits that the Treaty of Rome does not promote regional development, or does nothing to promote it.</P>
    <P>Also argued is the question of a weighting majority which protects the interests of small nations at present. We could also argue that this might be something of very short duration. There are voices raised against this at the moment and the case is being made that it causes stagnation. If we are arguing about things that might happen we could say that there is no regional policy at the moment and that a regional policy would be a very important thing as far as this country is concerned. We are being told by all who speak for the other side of the case, &ldquo;You can make your case against entry, but what is the alternative?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It appears to us that as far as industry is concerned free trade is a realistic thing, but that could be got by any country doing business with the EEC outside the Market. We know our agricultural produce would constitute a problem but we know too that we are not Britons and that when Britain goes in our agricultural produce constitutes a problem. We know that we are Britain's third largest customer and we feel it would not be unrealistic for us to hope or to expect that in Britain's own interests&mdash;not in ours&mdash;Britain would be in favour of making an <Col N="889" /> agreement that would benefit us if we stay out.</P>
    <P>It is difficult for us to state the alternatives in the same detail. It would not be difficult for the Government because they would have to negotiate the alternatives. It is impossible for us, with the limited funds at our disposal, to state the alternatives in the same detail as that in which the case for full membership has been made, but we feel that the alternatives are there and that the alternatives should be used. They would have had to be used if Europe had refused our application and they will have to be used if the Irish people refuse to vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; on 10th May. I do not know what the Irish people will do on 10th May but I am pretty confident that the predictions heard in this House today with regard to the &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote are very unrealistic. I expect we will find that there will be a very substantial &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote from the electorate on 10th May. Our case to them will be that they ought to vote &ldquo;No&rdquo;, and we make no apologies for that. We are doing that in the interests of Irish jobs and of Irish workers and we are confident that very many of them will follow our advice on 10th May.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeggyFarrell" hpid="Mrs. Farrell Mrs. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I had no intention of speaking in this debate because I felt that the case had been pretty well put, logically and clearly, by most of the speakers until this morning. Since Senator Desmond has spoken in the House I am appalled and I had to stand up because Senator Desmond is here representing the Labour Party. I can only say that if Senator Desmond's speech here this morning reflects the knowledge <i>in toto</i> of the Labour Party as regards industry in the EEC then I am sorry for the party which purport to stand up for the rights of the workers in this country. I should like to know who is the guiding spirit in this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also refer to Deputy Keating who has quoted scriptures and statistics and everything else for his own end. I am also reminded that Deputy Keating, before he took his present position, was the person who did a very detailed study of countries in the EEC for two programmes which were subsequently <Col N="890" /> transmitted by RTE. From looking at those programmes many years ago I got the impression that Mr. Justin Keating, as he then was, was in favour of going into the EEC. Why has he changed so suddenly?</P>
    <P>Was I wrong when I understood that all the decisions of the commissioners had to be unanimous? Am I right or wrong in this? We are told about all the powers the commissioners are going to have, but we would have one commissioner, and to be effective the vote would have to be unanimous. Nothing can go through without a unanimous vote. I think it is correct. Again, perhaps I am confusing this with the Council of Ministers, where again we will be represented.</P>
    <P>We are told that our small industries are not geared for the EEC. I have a certain knowledge of small industries because I am engaged in two of them myself, one of which is in complete jeopardy because of the Common Market. It is a business which my husband and I have built from the ground up&mdash;a commercial poultry hatchery. The poultry industry has been afforded very little protection in the EEC conditions, but this does not stop me, after a lifetime of work helping to build this industry, committing myself to Europe, because I am convinced that the future of this country lies in the EEC. If we as a business have to suffer from it we will suffer, but we will survive because we are industrialists with certain managerial ability and if one business goes down we will switch to another.</P>
    <P>The second business we are engaged in would be capable of competing now in the EEC. It is a small business and will never be large. It is a terrible reflection on the people who are engaged in small industries in this country to say that they cannot survive in free trade, because they are already surviving in Anglo-Irish free trade. In the EEC countries 80 per cent of the industries of Europe employ under 100 people, and because of that I have less fear of small industries in the EEC than I would fear for the larger industries, because small industries are adaptable and flexible. People in small industries <Col N="891" /> can be retrained and so all that is needed is good management.</P>
    <P>It is in the field of good management I am afraid we might fall down and not because we cannot compete. I could instance a case of failure where people did not look ahead in time, that is, the railroads of America. They were asked 30 or 40 years ago &ldquo;What business are you in?&rdquo; They said they were in the railroad business instead of saying they were in the transport business. Now they should be operating aeroplanes and any other form of modern transport to transport people and goods. It is the same way with the motor car industry. We are having them pushed up to us <i>ad infinitum.</i> They are in an engineering business. They have 15 years in which to get into another form of engineering business. It is as much the workers' fault as the management if the workers do not see that it is done in their own interests. They have got longer protection than any other industry.</P>
    <P>This must be stated clearly. If you are making shirts you do not say you are in the shirt business : you say you are in the clothing business. Today you might be making shirts and tomorrow you might be making slacks and some other time coats. If you are not prepared to be adaptable in your business, it does not matter whether it is free trade, Common Market trade, or protective trade, you are not going to survive. The workers in the industries who think they may not survive should be educated to look in this way at the business they are working in.</P>
    <P>The trade unions have a duty to their members to educate them in this respect. Senator Kennedy talked about approaching the Taoiseach on another matter and the Taoiseach asked what would he&mdash;Senator Kennedy&mdash;do. This question was posed to a member of a trade union and Senator Kennedy did Pontius Pilate on it and said, &ldquo;You are the Government; it is up to you to do something about it&rdquo;&mdash;and he washed his hands of it. We had exactly the same attitude from Senator Desmond here this morning when she talked about alternatives to the Common <Col N="892" /> Market. She said it was the Government's business to provide alternatives. The Government has committed itself since 1962 to going into the EEC and they have all their efforts and their policy to attaining membership.</P>

      <P>Senator Desmond said, if I am correct, that industries would not be set up here on the outpost of Europe. Has Senator Desmond or any other Members of the Labour Party done any research? It would be easy to ask the people in the IDA how many projects are at present held up here because people are waiting to see the outcome of the referendum. America can come in and set up factories here and have free entry into Europe.</P>
      <P>Senator Desmond also said that they had no incentives to come in. We have got an incentive scheme allowance until 1990 of our free tax concession on industry for export.</P>
      <P>Again, she said there is no regional policy. We have our own regional policy. She talked about capital going out of this country into the heart of Europe when the EEC was set up. The main flow of capital went into certain districts; nobody denies this. The Common Market have seen what happened and they are setting out now to develop their regions. Our regions are not wholly developed now. I live in a backward region and am quite confident that we will see growth there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards prices, there is an attempt to pull so much wool over people's eyes that I will not say any more other than I said when I interrupted Senator Desmond. I should like <Col N="893" /> to apologise to Senator Desmond for the interruption. I do not get cross very often but I could not help my interruption.</P>
    <P>There is talk of lower-paid workers, low social welfare and so on. Our cost of living has been rising over the years and we are not in the Common Market at all. Trade unions and every other movement that represents a worker see to it that the worker gets his increase; and why should this suddenly stop? Are wages going to stop here? Are the prices of foodstuff going to increase with absolutely no increase in wage packets? There is a wage increase every year to enable workers meet the cost of living and this is going to continue. It is not just or right to stand up and say this is not going to continue. Free land purchase has been referred to&mdash;another red herring! There are certain conditions laid down in the Treaty of Rome for this. We once had a famous parliamentarian, Daniel O'Connell, who said he could drive a coach and four through any Act of Parliament, and I wonder if Senator Desmond is aware of the regulations which the French have about land purchase. There is nothing to stop us bringing in regulations exactly the same as the French have. These French regulations are glossed over and not talked about but they are there.</P>
    <P>I will tell you something for free. Two years ago I was very anti-Common Market but I visited the countries concerned. I attended the Co-operative Symposium in Milan two years ago and I spoke to women from the south of Italy. I told them it had been freely said that southern Italy is not gaining as much as it should from the EEC. They told me, and I have no reason to disbelieve them, that while they would like to see the south of Italy getting better much faster they saw a 60 per cent growth since joining the EEC.</P>
    <P>We are seeking free trade with other countries. I take it some of the other countries are behind the Iron Curtain. Though it is not relevant to the EEC I am reminded of the Bulgarian delegate at the Milan conference who described Bulgaria as a paradise. <Col N="894" /> Some of the Irish people who were at the conference spoke Irish among themselves and one of the gentlemen in the party turned to me and said &ldquo;flaitheas atá ann&rdquo; as he listened to the delegate extolling Bulgaria. As the interpretation was coming through the man said: &ldquo;We have come on very well now in our villages. We now have one radio between every six or seven families.&rdquo; That was two years ago. Their standard of living is very low and these are the people with whom it has been suggested we trade.</P>
    <P>Last year we spoke to people in cafés and in the streets in Belgium and Holland. When we asked them about the Common Market they had lived with it so long they had forgotten what it was like not to be in it. Having thought back to their standard of living before they joined the Common Market and the standard of living they now enjoy none of them wanted to opt out. Nobody should be promised paradise in the EEC. We can get markets if we are prepared to work. Everybody must be prepared to work much harder. We are going to have an excellent demand there if the quality is right. We can bring up our standards of living quickly in the EEC. If we do not all I can say is God help Ireland.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PierceButler" hpid="Mr. Butler Mr. Butler">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Butler</NameTxt>
      <P>I have three points to make about which I feel very strongly. I wish to speak in favour of entry into the EEC. First of all, I wish to comment on a pamphlet issued by the Common Market Defence Campaign, called &ldquo;The Common Market and You&rdquo;. The second point concerns the involvement of the unions in this campaign and being a trade unionist myself I want to comment briefly on it. The third point is how the Common Market will affect the industries in which I am involved. I am vice-president of the Creamery Managers Association and I want to state the effects on this industry of joining or remaining outside the EEC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first point then is on this pamphlet. We have heard the prices <Col N="895" /> they quote and they are ridiculous. I was on a tour of Belgium, France and Luxembourg and I found no shop selling steak at 130p per lb. Perhaps this price was charged for a steak lunch in some high-class hotel. We would be very happy, as an exporting industry, in Mitchelstown, if we could obtain 45p per lb for plain cheese. There was a comparison made in the pamphlet of 20p for Irish creamery cheese and 45p per lb for the same type of cheese in the EEC. This is ridiculous because they are not the same type of cheese. You could get 45p per lb for a particular type of cheese in the Common Market but it is not the same cheese that we export. The price of 20p per lb is for Cheddar cheese. The price of 45p per lb is not obtainable in the EEC countries for the same type of cheese. I could give many other examples of a similar kind but instead I will quote item 2 from the pamphlet:</P>
    <P>The EEC has made it quite clear that we can have free trade with the EEC and tariff-free access to the 250 million market without joining.</P>
    <P>This is an untruth. The EEC has not made it clear and has emphatically stated that our agricultural exports into the EEC countries would have to get over the tariff walls and levies would be put on our exports into those countries. In the industry in which I work, the dairy industry, there is no doubt, even among those people who are involved in producing this pamphlet, president Dr. Austin Clarke and those other people. If they have any common sense or any decency they would not try to convey to the people that this was a true statement.</P>
    <P>I should like to quote item 3:</P>
    <P>EEC tariffs are among the lowest in the world averaging 7½ per cent.</P>
    <P>That may be true but the EEC tariffs and our exports would not average the 7½ per cent. It would be nearer to 20 per cent and that is the type of wall we would have to get over. What is stated here is a fallacy and I am upset by the propaganda that this organisation is spreading through the country.</P>
    <P>I quote item 4:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="896" /> We could confine State aid to small and medium size farms which are owned by people who need it most and can make most productive use of it and we could make land available to increase all farms to at least 50 acres&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>and I should like to stress this point</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;and tighten the restrictions on the acquisition of land by aliens...</P>
    <P>The ideal of the EEC is to increase small farms to at least 50 acres. There is nothing new in that and we agree wholeheartedly with the suggestion to increase the acreage of farms to the point at which they would be viable so that farmers would be able to obtain a living comparable with that in industry. They state this fact as an anti-EEC proposition. Those in the EEC agree that this must be done.</P>
    <P>I should like to emphasise to the Government that we should now be thinking of setting up parish councils. These councils would decide who was to get land which would be available in a parish. This is necessary as the people in the various localities would know a farmer who could increase his productivity if he got an increase in acreage. I believe all parties are in favour of this. The people who are forcing propaganda down the throats of the ordinary man in the street must realise they have a bad case in producing figures and comments such as these.</P>
    <P>I should like to speak on the involvement of the unions. Forty per cent of those who attended the conference of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions were in favour of our entry into the EEC. Other trade unionists, like myself, who were not affiliated to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions were not accepted as true trade unionists even though application was made. If we made application now we would be accepted. I speak as a trade unionist and am proud to be one. I speak as a trade unionist involved in agriculture. Our trade union, which consists of over 1,000 members, is completely in favour of entry into the EEC.</P>
    <P>I hope the other trade unions are asking their members to support our entry into the EEC. The Irish Transport <Col N="897" /> and General Workers' Union have come out very strongly against entry into the EEC. I should like to point out to them that in the society in which I work&mdash;Mitchelstown Creameries&mdash;there are some 1,000 members of the ITGWU working there. If those members vote against our entry into the EEC and if by any chance we vote for non-entry also, then I should like to ask the ITGWU where they will guarantee those 1,000 jobs. I am very interested in those people, having worked with them for years in Mitchelstown.</P>
    <P>The other processing factories such as Golden Vale, Avonmore, Killeshandra, Loch Egish, Ballynea and all the processing factories involved in the dairy industry will need a guarantee from the ITGWU about their jobs if we do not enter into the EEC. A loss of 35,000 jobs was mentioned. People in favour of entry have spoken of an increase of 50,000 jobs. I could not say how many jobs will be lost if we do not enter into the EEC or how many jobs will be gained by our entry into the EEC. I am convinced we will gain more in jobs by entry and we will lose more by failure to enter the EEC.</P>
    <P>I am not speaking about the 1,000 jobs in Mitchelstown but about the 100,000 jobs which depend on those positions which will be affected if we do not enter the EEC. Unions have stated there will be a substantial increase in the cost of living but if we examine the 13th round national pay agreement, we will see written into that agreement a clause stating that for every 1 per cent over 4 per cent of the consumer price index, an increase will be given.</P>
    <P>I hope in future national awards that this clause will be incorporated. This would guarantee to those workers that for any 1 per cent over 4 per cent of the increase in the consumer price index, they would be guaranteed an increase in their wages or salary to compensate for any of those increases. The scare which has been put out about a substantial increase in the consumer price index and no substantial increase in wages and salaries is unfounded. As a member of a trade <Col N="898" /> union I would insist that members would get the increase to which they are entitled. I would ask the people who are not in favour of our entry to think of how our small towns and rural areas will be affected if we do not enter.</P>
    <P>In my own town of Cahir, County Tipperary, our main industries are a creamery, a meat processing factory, a meat and bone factory and a compounding factory. There is no doubt that if we enter the EEC all those industries will benefit but if we reject the proposal to enter those industries will be adversely affected. The meat and bone factory may benefit for a few years because farmers will be slaughtering their cows and we will be back to the position we were in in the 'thirties when no one wanted the milk and when hay was selling at £1 per ton. We do not want to return to that. We want to progress.</P>
    <P>I am sure members of the European Parliament will ensure that a percentage of any benefits derived will go to the underdeveloped countries of the world. It is written into the Treaty of Rome that they should help such countries. Once that idea is embedded in the minds of politicians I am sure it will become a reality.</P>
    <P>In 1971, 520 million gallons of milk were taken in at our creameries. An average of 13p per gallon was paid for it and this resulted in an estimated £70 million being paid to dairy farmers. In 1972 the price went up to 17p a gallon due mainly to our impending entry into the EEC. During the transitional period, when we will get the transitional increase, it is estimated that 17p a gallon will be a good base. The price paid in EEC countries is around 21p a gallon and over the next five years an increase of 1p per gallon per year will bring the price paid to Irish farmers to 22p a gallon. The 17p a gallon at present being paid, which is an extra 4p per gallon for 530 million gallons of milk, amounts to an increase of approximately £20 million to dairy farmers. If, after the transitional period, we receive only 21p, our dairy farmers will receive another £20 million. By 1978, even if our milk production stays at 530 million gallons as <Col N="899" /> at present, £110 million will be injected into the Irish economy through the dairy farmers.</P>
    <P>In surveys carried out by An Bord Bainne, An Foras Talúntais and the Irish Creamery Managers Association, it is estimated that milk products for exports, such as butter, cheese, skim milk powder, whole milk powder, butter oil and all other by-products of milk, will increase by 100 per cent by 1978. This will bring the total milk production to a record of 670 million gallons. If we calculate that figure at 21p per gallon, the average target price, it will result in £170 million. That will mean that an extra £100 million will be injected into the economy by 1978. More than likely that £100 million will be spent by the farmers. They are most unlikely to lodge the money in the bank but even if they do it will be invested by the banks in the economy. I am sure the farmers will inject that £100 million into the agricultural industry itself and thereby greatly increase the efficiency of that industry.</P>
    <P>Farmers often ask me would they have an export market for their milk if they increased production by 100 per cent. We will have a market for it and I shall prove that later. Even if we did not have a market there is a target price for milk in the EEC and the farmer would have to be paid for it. There is an intervention price for butter and butter and skim milk powder will have to be purchased by the intervention agencies. If we can get 45p per lb, as stated in the Common Market defence campaign, there is no doubt but that the farmer will benefit greatly.</P>
    <P>Let me return to some of the figures given by An Bord Bainne in a document issued by them. This document is available to any Senator or anyone else interested in it. It states that in 1970 we exported 30,000 tons of butter to Great Britain. That would amount to 66 million gallons of milk. United Kingdom production of butter in 1970 was 50,000 tons. New Zealand exports of butter to Britain amounted to 175,000 tons, Australia, 65,000 tons, Denmark, 85,000; EEC countries, 26,000 and other countries, 49,000 tons. <Col N="900" /> This amounted to a total consumption of butter in Britain of 480,000 tons.</P>
    <P>By 1980 New Zealand will have to reduce their quota by 80 per cent, which will mean reducing the export of butter from New Zealand to 140,000 tons from 175,000 tons. Our production of milk will have substantially increased and we shall be able to export to the United Kingdom 100,000 tons of butter, which represents 520 million gallons of milk.</P>
    <P>Denmark will export 70,000 tons and the EEC countries will send 30,000 tons, which is 390,000 tons that will be consumed in the United Kingdom. That is a reduction of 90,000 tons of butter, and it is estimated that there may be a reduction in the UK, also. The reason is that there may be a change from butter to cheese and other by-products. I shall refer to cheese. In 1971 the production of cheese in the UK reached 120,000 tons. New Zealand exports 75,000 tons of cheese; Australia, 12,000 tons; EEC countries, 15,000 tons; Denmark and Norway, 3,000 tons; Canada, 20,000 tons; and Ireland, 20,000 tons. Relating 20,000 tons to milk, it means 45 million gallons of milk.</P>
    <P>By 1980 New Zealand's exports of 75,000 tons will be gone, as will Australia's and Canada's exports. It is estimated that the UK production will go up to 160,000 tons of cheese. The EEC countries' different types of cheese exports to the UK will be 35,000 tons. Relating the 75,000 tons of cheese, exported by us to milk it represents 180 million gallons. There is a total consumption in the EEC countries and in the UK of 270,000 tons of cheese compared to 255,000 tons in 1971. It will probably be more than that, if there is a change from butter to cheese and from meat to cheese. That shows that 180 million gallons of milk in the form of cheese and 520 million gallons of milk in the form of butter, which is 700 million gallons of milk, will be available to us on the British market alone. It is estimated that we will increase our production of milk by 100 per cent and by 1980 we will have 630 million gallons of milk available. We will not even be able to <Col N="901" /> fulfil what will be available to us in the market. Farmers were worried about this position, but when it was explained to them it was accepted, particularly when a survey was carried out by the creameries and by An Bord Bainne, who have studied the market throughout the world. As mentioned by Senator Eoin Ryan, An Bord Bainne have done an excellent job.</P>
    <P>What could An Bord Báinne do with surplus milk in the next 15 years? It would be impossible for An Bord Bainne to sell, in the form of any dairy produce, the amount that we could produce here. We are getting an opportunity of investing in the dairy industry over £100 million which is expected to create 50,000 new jobs. Senator Quinlan stated that he believed it would create many more than 50,000 jobs. Even if it created 30,000 additional jobs, it would justify our entering the Common Market. This is how the trade unions should be advising their members. They should emphasise, particularly, that the farmers of Ireland would provide jobs.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the small farmers, 85 per cent of whom, with herds of ten cows or under, supply the bulk of milk to the dairy industry. This would mean that the small farmers would receive most of the £100 million. The ICMSA, who represent 90 per cent of the small farmers, studied the implications of our entry into the EEC. They did not issue a statement until they were sure that our entry into the EEC would benefit the small farmers. At the conference which they held, the vote in favour of entry was 90 per cent or more.</P>
    <P>The IFA were quicker off the mark. They also investigated the position and are 100 per cent behind our entry into the EEC, and are canvassing in favour of it. It has been stated that we could secure markets for our beef, mutton and pig meat. What did we export to the EEC in 1971 when those markets were there? The EEC is only 85 per cent self-sufficient in the production of beef, less than 75 per cent self-sufficient in mutton, and probably 98 per cent self-sufficient in pig meat. <Col N="902" /> When it was only around 80 per cent self-sufficient in beef, we still could not sell in the six EEC countries. About three or four years ago, when we were only obtaining £8 per cwt. for beef, the price prevailing in the six EEC countries was £14 per cwt. The tariff wall and the levies must have been more than £6 per cwt., for we could not export into the EEC.</P>
    <P>We could not export one cwt of beef last year or one cwt of beef the year before, and how then can those people who are anti-EEC claim that there is a market available for beef in the EEC countries? I have probably said enough and I hope that the few words I have said, if they are reported, will be reflected upon by any people who are in doubt about our entry into the EEC.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity of recording one or two points that I wish to make regarding the coming referendum. I feel that an extraordinary campaign is being conducted at present in which so many loose statistics are quoted in one way and another and, indeed, in which statistics are picked out to suit the particular argument, irrespective of their validity. Article I of the Constitution makes it quite clear that the people have a right to decide, if they so wish, to join the greater Europe of the future. I wish to quote from Article I of our Constitution which states:</P>
      <P>The Irish nation hereby affirms its inalienable, indefeasible, and sovereign right to choose its own form of Government, to determine its relations with other nations, and to develop its life, political, economic and cultural, in accordance with its own genius and traditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Constitution was written many years ago and it prompts the people of this generation to look ahead and to provide in the best possible way for generations to come. I feel, in common with many others, that if we are to survive as a nation and make our mark on the greater Europe of the future, we must in a very definite way play our full part in the affairs of Europe. Nobody will deny, or attempt to deny, <Col N="903" /> that Ireland as a nation has made its mark in the very much larger United Nations. In an organisation with 110 member nations, the voice of the Irish Republic has on many occasions been heard very loudly and clearly.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I look forward to this country playing an even greater and more significant role in the Community of ten nations of the EEC. Some people might make light of the fact that in the European Parliament three million Irish people will be represented by ten members of the Oireachtas, as compared with 52 million United Kingdom citizens who will be represented by 30 parliamentarians. We are getting an excellent opportunity to make our voice heard and to play our full role in the Europe of the future. Last year when the Oireachtas delegation visited Europe, we certainly got the feeling very strongly that the smaller members especially of the present EEC were more than anxious that Ireland, as a small nation, should become a member of the enlarged Community. We have many things in common. Our efforts and our work there will indeed be complementary. The tactics of many people, who are opposed to Ireland's joining the EEC, in using statistics in the way that they do are very unfair. I saw one publication&mdash;issued by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, I think, but I am not sure&mdash;which claimed that Ireland was a net exporter of pigs. This, of course, is true for the simple reason that we export each year a few dozen breeding pigs in the form of pedigree boars or a few pedigree sows. This is really using terminology and statistics in a most misleading manner. The facts are that we export over a million commercial pigs each year. I should imagine&mdash;and I am speaking without the benefit of the actual figures&mdash;that our imports of breeding stock in any year would not account for any more than two dozen animals. Therefore, for any responsible organisation to allege that we are an importing country in this commodity is going a little bit too far. To the people who accept this kind of propaganda I would suggest that these allegations should not be taken at face value.</P>
    <P>I should like to say a few words <Col N="904" /> about the pig industry. The Mansholt farm policy for Europe, which at present is very much irrelevant to the case, has led many people to believe that there is no future for a small farmer in this country under an EEC situation. We are constantly told by spokesmen that one must have at least 500 pigs, or that one should have a herd of 30 cows if one is to survive in EEC conditions. On my brief visits to the Continent I have not seen any great evidence that every farmer in either Germany or France had this minimum of herd numbers. Indeed, those people who were looking at the &ldquo;Landmark&rdquo; television programme earlier this week could see that rather antiquated farm husbandry methods are being operated in Bavaria. If it is profitable, which I think it will be, for a person to rear 500 or 1,000 pigs under EEC conditions this year, next year or in some years to come, the man with six or even a dozen pigs will earn a higher profit per pig than the man with even 3,000. In a small farm situation, if a person has the time and is able to fit pig production into his day, he will find that prices will be higher. There will always be a place for these small producers. In the last ten years all the small farmers in the EEC countries have not ceased farming. In Germany, if we look at the actual figures of farm sizes, we find that the average farm size in this very highly developed country is only 23½ acres. This is a little less than the average farm size here. We are told that the small farmer will become extinct. Our small farmers will have 15, 25 or 50 acres and their main income will derive from a number of cattle, or perhaps a few cows. How can one argue, in view of the fact that the price of cattle will perhaps appreciate by 40 per cent over the next few years, that just because a man has only a few cattle he will be worse off? I do not accept this argument. If the price of any of the agricultural commodities goes up it benefits everybody, irrespective of his acreage. The prices obtainable at the markets will be the same for all. Irrespective of farm size, the small farmer will not be worse off. His position will be greatly enhanced.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the policy whereby farmers who qualify and produce <Col N="905" /> a seven-year development plan will be able to avail of credit facilities at somewhere in the region of 2½ or 3 per cent per year. This will be a tremendous incentive to young farmers to boost their production and to bring their holdings and their incomes up to a level comparable to the incomes obtaining in industry and from other forms of livelihood.</P>
    <P>It is relevant the we should look at the success of our own small farm incentive scheme. While the incentives are small in our own Department of Agriculture and Fisheries Scheme, and perhaps not as attractive as the ones in the EEC, a large number of people have increased their incomes in a very worthwhile way. I see great scope for development here. In addition, we have a very active ACC. The European farmers, even in the present Six, have not got this type of soundly based institution which, with their new, more enlightened and liberal policies, are contributing tremendously to the agricultural scene at this time.</P>
    <P>We have already established organisations and institutions which can easily be modified to help the farmers and push through these farm development schemes that are so highly desirable. When one looks at the problem of farm succession much the same figures are quotable right across the country. Even in European countries you will find a somewhat similar high percentage of bachelor farmers in their fifties and sixties. This is common to every country. It is something that should be tackled. The way to eliminate this particular malady in our society is to provide these people with incomes that will give them faith in their ability to earn reasonable incomes and, when they have sufficient incomes, they will get married. This will ensure that the numbers of people on the land will be higher than heretofore.</P>
    <P>To date we have not heard much about family farm labour. In some of the programmes we see emanating from the EEC we find that family farm labour is not as important a factor in EEC countries as it is here. This problem has not attracted very much attention to date. It is the belief of <Col N="906" /> people who look at the farming scene in this country that if the farmers are given a guaranteed price structure, as they have been given in the EEC countries, and if these prices are guaranteed over the years by increasing the prices by a certain percentage, whether it be 4 per cent, 6 per cent or 8 per cent each year then production increases. In the past when higher prices were offered to Irish farmers greater production followed automatically. This holds great hope for Irish agriculture and for the Irish countryside in general.</P>
    <P>At present the Danes are exporting quite a substantial amount of bacon to Great Britain mainly because they are not members of the EEC. They would have the difficulty of surmounting the tariff barrier if they exported to Germany. The Danes had a form of associate agreement with the EEC for the past eight or ten years. It is significant to note that they have now decided to become full members, even though they have had experience of associate membership over ten years. They must realise that it is in their own interest to become full members. When they become full members of the EEC next February they will export their bacon to Germany instead of to Great Britain. This will create greater opportunity for the Irish pig producer exporting to the British market. At the moment Irish bacon is commanding a good price in British supermarkets.</P>
    <P>While some experts say that the pig industry is going to be an uncertain one in the future, and that farmers must rear large numbers of pigs, I do not go along with that view. I rear slightly more pigs than average and I am pinning my hopes on a viable and worthwhile pig industry in the years ahead. I look forward to the benefit of higher prices. With the very strict grading system that is operated in our country the Irish bacon, with its superior flavour and unchanged methods of production, should experience a marked improvement in demand in the years immediately ahead with consequent benefits for producers. This redounds to the credit of those people working in the bacon factories. <Col N="907" /> They have improved their standards of efficiency all round. It is a pity that the nationalisation of the bacon industry, when it was first mooted some years ago, did not take a more positive line on that problem. Nevertheless, some of our smaller factories are turning out a higher quality product. One should not pre-judge this aspect.</P>
    <P>Regarding the question of capacity in the meat factories, it is disconcerting that we had capacity to slaughter last year 1,690,000 cattle, although not many more than 700,000 were slaughtered. The Department still occasionally give new licences for the establishing of a new meat factory, but there is an over-capacity. There has been sloppy and bad planning somewhere along the way and the Irish taxpayer will have to foot the bill. In the past few months due to bad management this industry experienced grave difficulties.</P>
    <P>We must get away from the concept of fulfilling the role that we have had traditionally of being a chief supplier of food to the British market. It is only under the umbrella of the united Europe in the EEC that we can get away once and for all from this role.</P>
    <P>It is important to note that should the people decide not to enter the EEC by their vote in the referendum on May 10th next and when the Government or somebody else are looking for the elusive alternatives, and somebody then decides they would like to give our farmers the benefit of EEC prices to raise our farm prices to the level of EEC prices, it would take an increase of roughly a little more than 20 per cent in our turnover tax to do that. That would be an extraordinary decision to make when, by entering the EEC, we would be relieving the Irish taxpayer of more than £30 million in farm price supports.</P>
    <P>On this question of £30 million, we have been told in the past few years during budget time that the farmers were being spoonfed with £100 million per annum. Now when the chips are down we find that this £100 million has been whittled down to £30 million <Col N="908" /> overnight and the taxpayers are only subsidising the Irish farm prices to the tune of £30 million.</P>
    <P>For a number of years the various State departments and the Government have been making available re-adaptation grants to industry to allow them to prepare themselves for eventual entry to the EEC. A considerable number of firms have accepted and benefited from these grants. I should like to place on record that no such concessions were made to agriculture. Farmers engaged in the poultry business or wheat growing, if they wish to stay in operation, must conform and grow the produce for which there is demand. They will not receive any adaptation grants nor are they looking for them.</P>
    <P>This is most evident in the case of poultry producers who over the past few years have invested considerable sums in the erection of large and modern poultry houses. These people will face great difficulties in the months immediately ahead. When it is stated that the EEC will be of benefit only to our farming community it should be borne in mind that the farmers will only benefit if they grow the produce which is required and is in demand in the markets in which we hope to sell.</P>
    <P>People quote high prices such as the German price which is possibly the highest price in the EEC mainly because Germany imports a large percentage of her requirements. The products in the supermarkets there are not exactly the same as here. The trimmings such as fat and bones are cut away and you get for the higher price quite a different article. People who wish to frighten others into voting &ldquo;No&rdquo; by saying that the price of one pound of steak will cost 130p must remember that the 130p at present paid in Germany also includes transport costs into Germany.</P>
    <P>To be really honest it is only fair to quote the prices obtaining in the countries which are self-sufficient in the particular markets. The price of beef here now is around £12 or £13 per cwt. The floor price in the EEC is in the region of £15 per cwt. It is these prices the people who are against our joining the Common Market are quoting, when the actual market price in Germany is £19.50 and varies to <Col N="909" /> Belgium £19.69, France, £18.77 and Great Britain £13.70. There is a marked difference in the prices of this commodity but the Irish price will never hit the top, because our price must carry the transport costs to whichever market we wish to sell in.</P>
    <P>This is important. Nevertheless, it is widely acknowledged that we are capable of producing any item of farm produce that is based on grass cheaper and more competitively than any country in Europe. This is something we must not lose sight of. We have been able to compete reasonably successfully with our milk products and produced quality milk last year at 11p per gallon whereas the Danes have experienced some difficulty even though their price was 2p or 3p higher.</P>
    <P>At the present time it is true to say that the national cow herd in Denmark is falling in spite of the fact that they have had a better developed dairy industry for a number of years. I have every confidence in the Irish farmer's ability to produce a continuing high standard quality Irish milk and our price this season will average somewhere in the region of 16½p per gallon, whereas the guaranteed EEC price up to 1st September next is 22.5p per gallon for butter fat of 3.7 per cent. Our price is 16½p for 3.5 per cent. From September next the EEC price goes up ½p per gallon. When our farmers progress towards these prices our efficiency and output will definitely go up.</P>
    <P>Of all the industries in this country the dairy industry has progressed in a very dynamic way. Great credit is due not only to the farmers but to our big dairy manufacturing industries. As Senator Butler has already mentioned, our cheese has moved up in popularity in the British market to the top. The British consumer does not mind paying a premium price for Irish brand cheese. This is something we must be proud of. It redounds to the skill, craftsmanship and workmanship of our fellow Irish workers.</P>
    <P>In every branch of Irish industry where skill is put into the job there will be very good market prospects for our Irish produce. In my own constituency of Laois-Offaly we have a very outstanding <Col N="910" /> product in &ldquo;Tullamore Dew&rdquo;. This product has in the past been subject to hi-jacking especially in North America and then appeared on the black market. I believe that Waterford glass has been subject to the same. These two products are produced by craftsmen. The work, skill and experience of many years go into their production. In every branch of Irish industry where work, design and thought go into the product this will pay dividends and we will have ready markets for such high quality products. The Houses of the Oireachtas should sit right through the summer this year in order to bring in every possible piece of amending legislation which would make the lot of the Irish worker, businessman or farmer better under EEC conditions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>There are still a couple of months we could fit in. One important point I have in mind and which is relevant to agriculture is that we must amend to some degree the 1965 Land Act to allay the fears of many people who think there will be another European invasion by people who wish to purchase land in this country. The latest figures I have read from France indicate that the price of land in the EEC is on the wane to a small degree. The wheel has turned its full round and the prices tend to come down slightly. It is important that we should have amending legislation to the Land Act to enable Irish farmers to lease land, something which is not legal at the present time, and also to ensure that it will not be so easy for non-nationals to acquire land in this country. If we are going into the EEC we will have less than six months at our disposal to bring in this type of legislation. There are many Bills on the Statute Book that need amending. The quicker they are tackled the better it will be for this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Looking at this purely from an agricultural point of view every farmer in this country, whether big or small, is a potentially viable farmer in EEC conditions. This is a personal view. I say this despite the fact that so many <Col N="911" /> people say that everything in the EEC must be big. After ten years of EEC conditions for six European countries we find there a higher percentage of farmers with very much smaller acreages than our farmers. The Government should tackle the problem and endeavour to put the IAOS in sufficient funds so that we should be able to reap the greatest possible benefit from our membership.</P>
    <P>The Irish Agricultural Organisation Society have a tremendous potential, but they would appear to be handicapped by lack of sufficient funds. Also they would need some more teeth in order to put through more forcibly some of the schemes that have been passed on to them. It is imperative that the IAOS be revamped by an infusion of capital and given adequate powers to enable them to play a dynamic role in spearheading agriculture in the Ireland of the future.</P>
    <P>Membership of the EEC will present Irish farmers, both large and small, with the greatest opportunity yet to exploit to the full their own skills and the full potential of their land. Last year, if Irish farmers had the benefit of EEC prices, it would have meant an additional £80 million income for them. The tourist industry, which is the second largest industry in this country, attracts in a good year something in the region of £100 million. The potentialities of this industry in EEC conditions should not be lost sight of.</P>
    <P>We cannot possibly afford to lose our traditional markets and at the same time surmount the high tariff wall which will be raised against our produce. If we say &ldquo;No&rdquo; on 10th May we cannot turn round and look for sympathy from the people whom we refused to join in becoming full members of the European Community. It is time that the Irish people began exercising their intellect instead of the gentle massaging which passed for work over the past few years. We should tackle the problem of doing our work in a forthright manner. Every section of the community are obsessed nowadays with questions concerning a greater income and higher prices. Too <Col N="912" /> often we are inclined to be indifferent to the quality of our work.</P>
    <P>I would recommend to the people with whom I come in contact over the next ten or 12 days that they should, in the interests of Ireland in the years ahead, vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; in the referendum. This is a great challenge which we cannot afford not to meet. Right across Europe, our people, who even from the Golden Ages, went out as pioneers into Europe, left such a tremendous impression on the countries in which they settled that their memory is still revered in the form of monuments, cathedrals and so on. When Ireland takes its place amongst the nations of Europe, to build that greater and stronger Europe, we will have Irishmen who will play a full role.</P>
    <P>From my visits to Europe one of the sights which made a deep impression on me was passing by the large monument on the battle field of Verdun; and somebody casually remarked that 350,000 Allied troops perished taking that hill on such a date; an equal number also perished in the Second World War. With this greater European family, the danger&mdash;we have had this twice in the present century&mdash;of a third European war will disappear. If each generation can make life a little bit easier for those who follow them, then they will have fulfilled their role.</P>
    <P>For our future it is important that we should be part of this larger family of nations. The outlets in a consumer market with 250 million people will be significantly greater. We will have a proportion&mdash;although we will not be much more than 1 per cent of the population&mdash;of 5 per cent and we will find people who will be able to make our point of view heard. Whatever hope we have of being in this greater Europe we cannot stay as we are, whether we like it or not, so therefore we should go in fighting for the greatest share in this market which we can possibly get.</P>
    <P>Last week I was speaking to members of a Swedish firm who are coming here to set up a new industry, specifically to supply produce to the greater EEC. This is something which will be followed up by other firms. I can see great prospects, not only in agriculture <Col N="913" /> but also in industry and especially in industry allied to agriculture. With these remarks I wish to support the motion.</P>

      <P>These are the general aims. I believe that the women of Ireland should be in the vanguard of this fight to get into Europe. Firstly, because we are supposed, as women, to be the peacemakers of the world. If we do not take our part as peacemakers in the new Europe we will regret it for many a day. We are talking about a new Ireland; it is the same concept which is coming into being in Europe. Many of us speak highly of our Christian, national and democratic ideals. Each country in Europe has those same ideals and we should be with them, ensuring that those ideals are not tampered with because there are people in Europe, and indeed in our own country, whose one aim is to upset all that we hold dear in those three fields.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are no newcomers to Europe. <Col N="914" /> We belong to Europe. Down the years we have made our contributions to Europe. In the Dark Ages we sent our teachers and our scholars. Later on we sent our missionaries. Europe always respected us and always received us with open arms. She received our Wild Geese and she received our clergy later on when they were denied education here. We have always had the very closest and warmest of links with Europe. I believe it is a great compliment to us and to the progress we have made to realise that Europe is anxious to receive us.</P>
    <P>The people who are trying to give us an inferiority complex by asking us to stay out of Europe are admitting that we are second-class citizens of Europe and that we are not fit to take our place there. It is a wonderful thing to know that the people of Europe think more highly of us than do our own Labour Party, Sinn Féin and the other people who are working to keep us out of Europe. I believe we are not going into Europe with our hands hanging. We are going in with a contribution to make. We may not be well off materially but we are well off spiritually and our biggest contribution will be to ensure that those ideals that we hold so high will be protected.</P>
    <P>I was very upset by some of the propaganda currently going around the country. Senator Desmond has referred to the effect of membership on the &ldquo;food basket&rdquo;. Senator Farrell has refuted some of this but I think it should be placed on record that some of the price increases are exaggerated out of all proportion. I would like to mention a few because it is necessary to point out the dishonesty, the exaggeration and the deceit that is spreading the country with regard to prices.</P>
    <P>It is said that sugar will go up from 5½p to 10p. The current Irish price for sugar is 5½p and the European price corresponds to that at 5½p. Why then do the anti-Marketeers try to tell us that the EEC price is 10p? The present price of a pound of potatoes is 1½p and the European price is also 1½p. Why do the anti-Marketeers come along and tell us that a pound of potatoes will cost 6p when we enter Europe? I do not know why the price <Col N="915" /> of oranges is included in the list, but the price of oranges here at present is 9p per pound and the European corresponding price is 9p yet we are told by the anti-Marketeers that it will be 18p. Coffee at present in Ireland is 76p. The European corresponding price is 76p also and still the anti-Marketeers tell us it will be 110p in the EEC. Tea is not grown in Europe so I do not know why the anti-Marketeers should have chosen it, but the kind of tea they talk about must include some gold dust as they tell us it will be 120p per pound. That is a monstrous exaggeration. The price of tea in Ireland at present is 40p per pound and the price of it in Europe is also 40p.</P>
    <P>I could continue on with a list like that and illustrate the gross exaggerations that have been made even in ordinary everyday items. We all admit that butter will increase in price. The present price of butter here is 28p and the European corresponding price is 40p per pound and this is expected to increase to 45p. The price of steak at present is 60p while it is 85p in Europe. We know that at present none of us can afford to buy steak. We all know that in Europe for many a long day nobody could afford to buy butter. When Europeans, with their high standard of living, have not been using butter for many years except as a luxury commodity I do not see why we should be crying about the price of it. As has been said here already, the prices of these commodities will not be as dear to us as it is to the European housewife.</P>
    <P>When Senator Desmond was speaking she referred to the &ldquo;bread basket&rdquo; that was given in the <i>Financial Times</i> on 31st December, 1971. I think I should make the point that there is no such thing as a European standard price&mdash;the price varies from country to country for different reasons. Some countries put on more taxes that others. More is spent on transport in one country than in another and there are different factors affecting the price from country to country. There is no such thing as a standard European price for any commodity. Senator Desmond, like <Col N="916" /> all the other anti-Marketeers, selected Rome, the city with the dearest &ldquo;food basket&rdquo;. In Rome the &ldquo;food basket&rdquo; costs £11.26 but the same &ldquo;food basket&rdquo; in Amsterdam is only £8.88. Here in Ireland the same &ldquo;food basket&rdquo; would cost £8.66.</P>
    <P>Anti-Marketeers have been saying that these prices have not been researched. Any figures put before us by the Government and by the different Departments have all been researched and they are prepared to stand over any of the statistics they have given. We are told&mdash;and I believe in the integrity of the economists who have gone into the prices&mdash;that the price increase will be 2p over a period of five years which amounts to only ½p per pound per year. We have already survived a huge increase of 8p per pound per year over the last three years. I do not see why we should be scared of an increase of ½p in the pound per year over the next five years.</P>
    <P>I think it was Senator Desmond who made the exaggerated statement&mdash; I am sorry to have to quote Senator Desmond so often&mdash;that we were such a great customer of England that she could not do without us. We might <i>per capita</i>, buy more from her than any other country but the fact is that we buy only 2 per cent of what Britain has to export. One can prove anything by statistics but it is as well to put it on the record that England will survive if we do not buy our tiny 2 per cent of her exports.</P>
    <P>We are told in my area that the small farmer will be driven into the sea or that he will be wiped off the face of the earth. In Europe eight out of ten farmers have fewer than ten cows and of that eight two out of three have fewer than five cows. They are small farmers and they are surviving. They are not being wiped off the face of the earth. In the EEC they are so interested in keeping the small farmer on the land that they are giving special financial aids and supplements to his income to ensure that he stays on the land. The same will be true of the small farmer in Ireland. We can still give our supplementary allowance to the small farmer&mdash;which is called the small farmers' dole. There is <Col N="917" /> nothing to stop us continuing to give him that. It is a supplement to his income and any other aids that we give him in the line of grants for housing and so on will continue when we enter Europe.</P>
    <P>Dr. Tom Walsh has gone into this matter very seriously and very deeply. He is a man who is very interested in the small farmer. He said: &ldquo;If we do not go into Europe the number of people leaving the land at present will be only a trickle compared with the flood that will take place.&rdquo; There are exaggerated statements being made about land purchase. One would think that the people of Europe were trying to arrive in Ireland in thousands and buy up all the available land here. Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael are very anxious that whatever land is available in the congested areas should be kept for the small farmers in those areas. There is nothing to stop us from bringing in legislation that will ensure that such land will be kept for the improvement and the restructuring of small farms.</P>
    <P>The cry has gone out regarding jobs that the farmer will be the only one to benefit. This is completely untrue. If the farmers, whether big or small, benefit, this will spill over to the rest of the community. Our small villages will be better off. More goods will be purchased, more work will be available. The farmers' organisations have examined the position and, as a result of the prosperity for the rural community, there could well be 40,000 extra jobs in addition to those in industry.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect that we should get across to the working people. Most of them consider farming as merely taking milk to the creamery, setting crops, and so on. They do not realise that there are at least 5,000 men employed in the fertiliser industry, which is a result of farm industry. There are 31,500 employed in processing farm products and at least another 30,000 servicing those. That is only skimming the surface of the number of industrial jobs that have grown out of the prosperity of the farming community.</P>
    <P>It was the late Seán Lemass and the <Col N="918" /> Fianna Fáil Party who were the architects of industrial Ireland. Surely any sane person would not believe that the Taoiseach, the successor of Seán Lemass, would be the man to do something to jeopardise those jobs. The Taoiseach knows well that we cannot sustain our industrial progress and encourage new industrialists to set up here, unless we get into Europe. Many people have said that several industrialists have come here during the last 12 months and are waiting in the wings to set up industry if&mdash;and only if and when&mdash;we get into the Common Market.</P>
    <P>It is important to quote what Mr. Grey, Director-General of the Federation of Irish Industries, said in Killarney on 5th February. This is a clarion call to the workers from Mr. Grey. Indeed, all managers and industrialists believe the same, that the only way to ensure the future of jobs and to extend their industries is to have a bigger market. I shall quote what Mr. Grey said in Killarney last February:</P>
    <P>I assert with the greatest conviction that most of Irish industry has no future outside the EEC and that the attainment of full employment will be impossible. We are being offered in an extraordinarily generous way the opportunity of creating a sound and viable Irish economy, with growth rates equalising those of other European countries and of achieving this with the minimum dislocation and discomfort. The European Social Fund and the Investments Bank are ready-made institutions to be utilised for our special needs and it will be up to us to put them to full use. Italy has already benefited well from those. The protocol attached to the Treaty assures us of a special recognition accorded to our problems and special protective guarantees have been built into the five-year transition period to enable us to cope with whatever difficulties may arise.</P>
    <P>Finally, there is all the promise that regional policy holds for us and this is especially relevant to our western counties.</P>
    <P>That statement by Mr. Grey, who has <Col N="919" /> gone into all the details of jobs for the younger generation, should be read by the Labour Party, who should be in the vanguard in this fight. It is the one guarantee of getting a bigger market. Without a bigger market any existing industries have no hope of expanding.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like to refute a statement about the Irish language given in the magazine <i>Éirigh.</i> The President of Connradh na Gaeilge says:</P>
    <P>There are three chief sources of worry about the future of Irish in Ireland, when Ireland joins the EEC, that it is an integral part of the background and philosophy of the EEC to neglect minor languages.</P>
    <P>That is one lie which can be refuted in a few minutes.</P>
    <P>That the Irish Government will be deprived...</P>
    <P>mark you,</P>
    <P>...of the power to preserve Irish, let alone restore it against the wishes of the Brussels Civil Service, and that the Gaeltacht would be destroyed by the regional policies now being contemplated by the EEC.</P>
    <P>We know that minor languages have a very special place and that the European Community is most interested that each country do their best to preserve their own language and their own culture. We will be so much one as a trading block that it will be like a breath of fresh air to have access to different cultures, both for ourselves and for every other country in Europe. When Deputy Hillery was negotiating he put before the Community the special place of the Irish language. It is not a working language and would not be practicable, but the Irish language has its place as the official language of this country and is recognised by Europe. All the necessary treaties that will be drawn up will be translated into Irish and the Irish version will have the same validity as the English one or any other version. He has also quoted Hans Van des Groeben, a member of the European Commission, and the statement he has made there is completely misquoted.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="920" /> We have something to give to Europe, we belong to Europe and we should not go in there with an inferiority complex. A few weeks ago I read in a European paper a great tribute paid to Deputy Hillery and the negotiating teams. First of all, they were the most efficiently prepared of the four. They had all their facts, in each language, ready to distribute to the other members. They said they went in with an open mind. They did not go in with a suspicious mind, looking for loopholes around every corner. They appreciated that, because those who had already made a success of the Common Market without us were delighted that their credibility was not questioned by the Irish delegation. There was one interesting point made. They said it was a pity that there was not some way of evaluating the character of the country. If that were possible, we would certainly come out on top, even if not materially.</P>
    <P>I sincerely hope that the women of Ireland will not be fooled by the propaganda regarding prices, that the small farmer will not be fooled about being driven off the land, that land will be bought up, that he will not be fooled about selling our sovereignty. In the Fianna Fáil Party, we have bought the sovereignty of Ireland too dearly to sell anything down the stream. All these different bogies have been laid low by the main speakers, both in the Fianna Fáil Party and the Opposition party and I hope, when the day of reckoning comes on 10th May, that the Irish people will be as wise as they always have been, and that we do not underestimate their intelligence to do the right thing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrosnahan" hpid="Mr. Brosnahan Mr. Brosnahan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brosnahan</NameTxt>
      <P>At the beginning of the debate so much was said that now at the end of it there is very little left to be said and nothing new that one can say. All I can contribute is a personal point of view. I think that we stand at one of the most significant turning points in the history of Ireland as a free nation. No man is an island, he is part of the main. No group of men can remain an island in isolation. The choice is between remaining in an isolated backwater of Europe or else moving on to the exciting challenge <Col N="921" /> which lies ahead, the challenge which will produce expansion and development. That is the choice we have to make and I have no doubt in my mind as to the road I shall take.</P>
      <P>I say &ldquo;Move into Europe&rdquo;, not alone for economic reasons but for philosophical and historical reasons. You have had all the economic arguments and statistics and logistics and so forth in favour of joining the Common Market. For philosophical reasons I think the idea of a United Europe, a United States of Europe, is an excellent idea and I should like to reiterate what Senator McDonald said a while ago.</P>
      <P>When one stands in a war cemetery and looks at the row after row of little white crosses one asks the question &ldquo;What did these young men die for, thousands of them in the bloom of their youth?&rdquo; You ask yourself the question &ldquo;What was it all for?&rdquo; and &ldquo;Is there anything that can be done to stop this senseless slaughter?&rdquo; You get the same feeling also when you stand in the execution chamber of the main prison in Berlin. Perhaps thousands of brave people were put to death by the garrotte, strangulation by hanging, because they stood against tyranny. You ask yourself the same question &ldquo;What was all this for?&rdquo; and you seek an answer but the answer fails to come. You fail to find an answer.</P>
      <P>It is only by getting nations to live harmoniously with each other, to cooperate and trade with each other, exchange points of view, exchange their various cultural heritages, that one can see where the future should lead us. For philosophical reasons, therefore, I maintain that we should join Europe and play our part. We just cannot stand and hold a ringside seat in all this. We must play our part to bring about peace and harmony in Europe and, ultimately, in the world and stop this senseless slaughter which is so pointless and gets nobody any place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For historical reasons also I say we should join. It has been said here over and over again that Ireland made a tremendous contribution towards education and culture in Europe in medieval times, in Renaissance times <Col N="922" /> and subsequently. The Irish people impressed their own personality, their own style, their own particular stamp upon the people of the world and particularly on the peoples of Europe, in Italy, France, Spain, Germany, Switzerland and even further afield in Poland.</P>
    <P>The Irish people have a wonderful contribution to make towards world thinking and especially towards European thinking. My own experience going abroad&mdash;I have been in many countries at various conferences&mdash;is that the Irishman is held in the highest esteem. He is held in very great respect, he is considered as a person of calibre, his views are listened to with great respect and his point of view is carefully noted. When Irish people participate in conferences, seminars, meetings and negotiations which must take place in the years that lie ahead they will come out on top. They will also continue to earn that very great respect which people abroad have for the Irish people, and the Irish person in particular. It is amazing how much people abroad admire the Irish personality. It is an individual type of charm which Irish people have and which people abroad very much admire.</P>
    <P>I think that we have a wonderful contribution to make and we should not miss the opportunity. Never was that quotation from <i>Julius Caesar</i> more apt: &ldquo;There is a tide in the affairs of men which, taken at the flood, can lead on to fortune. Omitted all the voyages of their lives are bound in shallows and in misery.&rdquo; That is the situation in which we find ourselves today. Do we stay where we are in the shallows and miseries, or do we move ahead, do we sail with the tide?</P>
    <P>I have read all the documents issued by both sides, for and against entry and, on balance, my opinion is that all the reasonable, sensible and cogent arguments are in favour of entry. I have read one particular document putting up arguments for not entering and it says that, if Ireland joins the Common Market, emigration, unemployment and all these things will develop. I think that there was a very serious omission in that sentence. The two words &ldquo;do not&rdquo; were left out. If <Col N="923" /> we do not join the Common Market all these things will follow.</P>
    <P>No convincing argument has been put up with regard to the alternative. This is only one statement. This is the only contribution that has been made by one group in this matter: &ldquo;We are not isolationists. We believe any Irish Government of competence and imagination could negotiate some form of trading association with the EEC countries.&rdquo; They expect people to accept that fallacy as a sound argument, as a sound alternative. That is not an alternative. It does not make any contribution at all towards suggesting any reasonable alternative. It says &ldquo;We believe&rdquo; and it says &ldquo;A Government could&rdquo;. It is not that &ldquo;A Government can&rdquo;. They go further still and say &ldquo;negotiate some form&rdquo;. What form?</P>
    <P>I do not think I want to say any more on this. I am personally in favour of entering the Common Market and I think that our future lies in that direction only. There is one thing I should like to say publicly here and it is this. On referendum day, whether people are for the Common Market or against it, they should come out and vote, because the eyes of the world will be upon this country. If we produce a situation which will be considered totally apathetic and, as it were, purposeless, and if the result is most unsatisfactory and does not give a clear indication one way or another, I do not think we will enhance our prestige as a nation. The eyes of the world will be upon us on referendum day and they will be looking for a clear indication.</P>
    <P>A strange remark came to my mind last night when I was thinking of the situation which might follow May 10th if there is a very low poll. We might find ourselves in the same &ldquo;Pompidou&rdquo; or &ldquo;Pompidon't&rdquo; position as France found herself in after its referendum day. Look at the reaction that it had on people. What were the French up to that a majority of the people did not even turn out to vote? It is a most unsatisfactory situation and I would say that everybody of influence should be advised <Col N="924" /> to come out to vote one way or another, for or against, on referendum day, so that the nation will know where it stands and not leave us in this situation of indecision and no clear indication as to where we are going in the future.</P>

      <P>In bringing this debate to a close I should like to congratulate the Seanad on an excellent two days work. The speeches were exemplary. The discussion was conducted on a high standard and the Senators who spoke quite obviously went to some trouble to read the White Paper and the case for and against entry into the EEC. They knew what they were talking about. The result is that an amount of valuable information is now assembled and will be printed in the Official Report of the Seanad debate, which will be available next week in time for copies to be given by Senators to people whom they know are doubtful as to what way they should vote on polling day. It would be a good idea if each Senator got some extra copies and gave them to the people who may have doubts as to what they should do. Having read the debate that has taken place here today, there is no doubt as to what their intentions would be at the end of their reading.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one sad feature to which I must draw attention: the absence from the House of the party which has opposed entry into the EEC. The total abstention of the Labour Party from this debate, except for the short intervention by Senator Desmond, leads me to believe that they felt completely unable to face up to the position which would arise when they were here and had to produce facts to back up the statements they are making and to produce proof of the allegations they have been making around the country as to the sad doom and outcome of our entry into the Common Market. It leads me to believe also that they do not really believe in what they are doing, and that secretly quite a number <Col N="925" /> of them may be hoping that the result will be &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I cannot conceive intelligent people such as the Senator who is one of the motivating forces of one of the biggest trade unions in the country having any illusions about what would happen to £1 million of dairy exports which have been built up in this country should a European tariff wall surround us in the days to come or should we have to surmount such a wall in dealing with the disposal of our exports. I have no doubt but that they realise it perfectly well. I still feel that it is a sad commentary on their sincerity in this campaign that they did not turn up to this debate, make their case and let us hear what each Senator in turn here has been asking: What is the alternative? The only alternative, as Senator Brosnahan and other Senators have said, is isolation.</P>
    <P>There is another alternative, of course. Some notable gentlemen in the Labour Party may want to establish a Cuba here on the offshore of Europe. It might not be surprising if they had ideas in that direction. I am not saying they have, but it is quite possible that it could happen. That other common market is the Cominform, the vast common market of the States of Eastern Europe about which we hear very little. Maybe the Labour Party feel we could make a deal to get into that common market. If they do, they should say so. If they feel that it is a practical proposition that would be approved by the majority of the Irish people, then there is nothing wrong in their thinking about it or making a case. All that is wrong is the attempt to deceive the Irish people, if that is really what they have in mind. We would expect that they would tell the truth about it.</P>
    <P>Therefore, we find ourselves faced with the position that we can either go into Europe by voting &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; on the 10th May, into Europe where there is an assured market of nearly 300 million people, or we can try to get into the East European common market which is controlled by the Communist Parties in the states which comprise Cominform; or else we can remain in isolation attempting to <Col N="926" /> negotiate separately or jointly what the Labour Party describe as treaties of association or arrangements for association. As Senator McGowan pointed out, it would be a peculiar thing to go to the people who put out the red carpet for us and welcomed us so wholeheartedly and tell them: &ldquo;We do not want to join but we want the same privileges as we would have got had we joined.&rdquo; One can imagine the answer that would be forthcoming to that.</P>
    <P>The unfortunate thing about it is that nobody has spelt out what the alternative is. Some of the parties and groups who are opposing the entry of Ireland into the EEC have specified their ideas of the type of society we would have in this country if we got into the EEC. These are the fellow-travellers of the Socialist Party, the Socialist Youth, the Socialist League for Justice, Saor Eire, the anarchistic organisations and the various splinter groups which masquerade as political parties. They have also taken over the Gaelic League and wrecked any chance there was of a non-partisan, non-political organisation working for the Irish language. These have specified the type of Ireland they would like to see, but they have not given a clear answer to the question: what is the alternative to providing the means whereby that Ireland would exist? Where are we going to get the buyers for our exports? Where are we going to get the people who will buy the produce from our farms and factories? We must know that. They have not told us.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party are contenting themselves with running a war of nerves such as Dr. Goebbles ran before the beginning of the last world war and such as the Labour Party itself ran when the Constitution was introduced in 1937. Some Senators may not recall that war of nerves which the Labour Party organised at that time, but it was a colossal attempt to frighten the Irish electorate into believing that, if they voted for the Constitution, there would be wage control, women would not be allowed to work, married women would immediately have to give up their jobs, and there would be all kinds of inspectors listening to, <Col N="927" /> watching for and hearing every word said. A lot of balderdash of that type was published. It fooled quite a number of people.</P>
    <P>There was a point made here about the size of the poll. The Constitution was not passed by a large majority of all the electorate because the campaign waged against it was terrific and almost succeeded. We do not wish that to happen in the case of this referendum. Senators should do their best, as should all people with influence who believe in Ireland's entry into Europe, to ensure that every person who has a vote is brought to the polls or induced to go to the polls on the 10th May and that they record their vote, preferably for entry to Europe. Everyone should be encouraged to record a vote one way or the other so that there will be a clear-cut decision. Nobody should have any doubts about it like as happened with the &ldquo;Oui&rdquo; vote in France last week and the vote on the Constitution here in 1937.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party seem to think that is the only tactic necessary on this occasion also. Unfortunately, they are going even further in many parts of the country. I do not like to have to charge them with this, but there is evidence to show that they are conducting an organised campaign to ensure that, so far as it can be done, the people will not be allowed to read either posters put up by any of the parties who are in favour of entry into Europe or, if they can help it, that the people will not get a chance of reading the literature which is available for that purpose. If that is the type of freedom and the type of society which the Labour Party, including Deputies Corish and Deputy Keating wish to have, I can quite understand their reluctance to tell us all about the alternative to the Common Market they would produce.</P>
    <P>It strengthens my belief that this suggestion of a Cuba in offshore Europe is not so far-fetched after all. It makes me think that possibly Deputy Noel Browne may have had some influence on them to the extent of making them feel that the only way to fight the other party and to be successful is to adopt the tactics which <Col N="928" /> apparently have been adopted and are being used by all the fellow-travelling opponents of entry into Europe. Their tactics seem to be the suppression of freedom of speech and freedom of reading, so far as it is possible for them to do so.</P>
    <P>This campaign of tearing down posters, blackening the streets, painting the doors of houses, both old and new, and painting the sides of monuments is a disgrace to those who are doing it and to those who are tolerating it. If the Labour Party have any control whatever over their workers, they should see that this is stopped immediately. It leaves a blemish on the country which may take years to eradicate. Many of the daubings which appeared during other election times have taken a long time to eradicate.</P>
    <P>The only opposition to our entry into Europe we heard here today was from Senator Desmond. She did not make a very good case. I am glad that Senator Kit Ahern demolished the &ldquo;bread basket&rdquo; suggestion which Senator Desmond appeared to rely on. That has been aired in some of the Labour Party propaganda leaflets and is completely erroneous, and is not based on any facts obtainable. In spite of the fact that it has been challenged in public, and the figures denied by reputable people and newspapers, they still continue to use such propaganda and do not appear to have any intention of departing from such distortion.</P>
    <P>Senator Desmond sneered at the idea that we would have any voice in Europe or have any notice taken of us. I was glad Senator McDonald and Senator Brosnahan referred to that point. We will have a very big voice in Europe and a big influence. We have a lot to be proud of in the voice and the influence we have had and have exercised in international affairs. Senator Desmond should recall the tremendous success which attended the foreign policy pursued by Ireland under the guidance of the former Foreign Minister, Deputy Frank Aiken, at the United Nations, and the two great successful developments which occurred as a result of his efforts for world peace, that is, the entry into the United Nations of the People's Republic of <Col N="929" /> China and the signing of the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, both traceable back to the campaign begun by the representative of Ireland at the United Nations.</P>
    <P>If our foreign policy had so much influence in the United Nations and if we were able to do such wonderful work there, there is no reason why our representatives cannot do the same thing in Europe, where we should be as strong a force for good and as effective as we were in the United Nations. I have no doubt that when our representatives go to Europe, they will find themselves at home and in the position which Ireland had for centuries with Europe, because we are Europeans in spite of the efforts of our neighbouring island to make us otherwise. The tradition of centuries is hard to kill. When our representatives take an active part in European affairs, they will play an honourable part and a useful part and will bring credit to this country.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party attitude and advice to the electorate cannot, because of their past performances, be regarded as reliable. They have never given the right advice to the electorate. They are mouthing their concern with jobs, as Senator Desmond stated, and with the welfare of the working people. Mouthing about that leaves me cold because there is no doubt that, if our factories begin to close, if our emigrant ships begin to fill again, and if our products are no longer saleable here because of tariffs put up by the EEC if we do not go in, the Labour Party advice will have done more damage to this country than anything that has happened for centuries.</P>
    <P>The people would be wise to ignore it completely. As Senator McDonald remarked, if anyone saw the programme &ldquo;Landmark&rdquo; on Telefís Éireann a few nights ago about farming in Western Germany and had any doubts about the advantages of being in the Common Market, either from the rural point of view or from a city point of view, he must have very little intelligence left. There is the most prosperous country in Europe, the country where the workers have the highest standard of living, the country where a socialist Government is <Col N="930" /> in power and that country is completely European in its outlook, in its thoughts and in its desires. If the workers in West Germany are so happy under the European Economic Community&mdash;and they are a proud people, as anyone who knows them will testify &mdash;I cannot understand why anybody would prognosticate here that Irish workers would be harming themselves by joining the European Economic Community.</P>
    <P>If we do not go in, there is very little use in crying over the milk that will be spilt around the roads of our towns and countryside. If we do not go in, there is very little we can do about the development of either agriculture or industry: this great market will have erected a wall around us, a wall which will even follow that artificial boundary which the British invented for us in 1920 and which has been the cause of the trouble between us since. It is now only a boundary which splits our nation here and divides us from the north and from the United Kingdom. But, because Britain is entering the European Economic Community, it would be an international economic frontier against us, a European tariff barrier over which we could not crawl. Our free trade area arrangements would go by the board with the result that the prospects for the future, if we do not succeed in our bid to enter Europe, would be gloomy indeed.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party, which is the leading opposition to going into Europe, should before polling day let the people know definitely in black and white in every newspaper what exactly they were prepared to give in exchange for any association arrangement they might be able to make with anybody, or whether they have in their mind an effort to join the other Eastern European common market Cominform, where perhaps they might find themselves just as much at home as we would find ourselves in Europe. There is no need for me to go through the arguments which were made against joining the Common Market outside this House. The debate here today has dealt very well indeed with the case for it.</P>
    <P>In the course of his lengthy speech <Col N="931" /> Senator Quinlan referred to the Economic War between this country and Great Britain, which lasted from about 1933 to 1937 and which he said had disastrous consequences. I should like for the record to correct that statement. I do not think he would get many people to agree with him when he said that it had completely disastrous consequences. It was very tough on the farmers, who stood foursquare with great courage and whose sacrifices during that period should never be forgotten by the nation. It was they who made the victory. The victory which was won. We got back the ports and airfields. We achieved the abolition of the right of Britain to facilities here during war or strained relations with any other country. It was worth all the struggle of those four years. That made peace possible with Britain on every score except the question of Partition.</P>
    <P>The consequences on that score were not disastrous. Neither were they disastrous on another score. It cured a lot of people of the illusion which many of us had with regard to markets. For four years the British waged an economic offensive against this country. They tried to destroy our cattle industry. They tried to destroy our prospects of survival. They did everything they possibly could to smash our trade. For four solid years we did everything we could to find somebody anywhere in the whole world to buy the produce of our farms and the products of the factories we were then building. We could get nobody. We sold a few cattle here and there, but nothing to compensate for the market that was right next door to us. That proved to me&mdash;and it should prove to the Labour Party also and to anyone else who has any doubts &mdash;that nobody in this world gives a damn about Ireland except we have something to offer or are of some use to them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="932" /> Nobody is going to go out of his way to make any sacrifices for Ireland. Current events proved that in international relations. Nobody is going to buy our produce or our factory goods unless they get a <i>quid pro quo</i> and unless they are quality-standard. We tried and we failed. We could not get markets anywhere. Therefore it was important that we should consolidate the British market and that was done in the light of the progress of economic developments in Europe and throughout the world. That was done by the late Seán Lemass in the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement.</P>
    <P>It is also vitally important that we should now consolidate our position for the future by getting into Europe, where there is a guaranteed market of 250 million people, where our farmers will get good prices, where the products of our factories can get a home and where new factories can be built here by non-members of the Community for the purpose of getting into the European buyers' market. It is vitally important that we do that.</P>
    <P>When Senator Quinlan says that the Economic War had disastrous consequences I cannot agree with him. For the record it should be made clear that, although the farmers suffered grievously, the country won a great triumph and the people of the country should have got a great blessing. I hope on polling day they will realise that we tried out the experiment of isolation. We also tried the experiment of feeling we could get markets wherever we could use the name of Ireland and we did not succeed. Now we have something&mdash;a bird in the hand is worth all the birds the Labour Party can put into all the bushes&mdash;in this country. We should keep it by a massive vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; on 10th May.</P>
