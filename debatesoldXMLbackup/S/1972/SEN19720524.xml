      <P>On the Order of Business, I realise the House has a lot of urgent business today and I do not want to hold it up. We are all glad to see Senator Ó Maoláin back again and I should like to ask him if he could direct his mind, at his earliest convenience, to the long list of motions on the Order Paper. I realise that I have been treated with a good deal of indulgence by the House and that during the last year or so, several motions in my name have been taken. But a good number remain and I am particularly interested in getting Motion No. 18 which asks the Seanad to take</P>
      <P>note of the personnel and terms of reference of the body appointed to review the working of Radio Telefís Éireann.</P>
      <P>If the Leader of the House is able to give any indication as to when this motion might be taken I should be grateful to him.</P>

      <P>On the Order of Business, on the last occasion on which the Seanad met the Leader of the House said he would be in a position in a fortnight's time to give a date for the taking of the Adoption Bill. I should like to ask him if he could give a date for that Bill. There is a very widespread interest in it. As a Private Bill it has been a long time on the Order Paper and has been pressed very continously by its sponsors.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to be clear as to what is happening. The Prisons Bill is not on the Order Paper. I take it that the Leader of the House will move to amend the Order Paper so as to include it. Secondly, my understanding <Col N="935" /> of the position, rightly or wrongly, is that it is not certain it will have left the Dáil by 5 p.m. Therefore it would be a mistake for us to order it for 5 p.m. It should be ordered for not earlier than 5 p.m. Assuming we get it in the course of the evening from the Dáil, I have no objection to the remainder of the proposition by the Leader of the House, that is that we should continue sitting until we finish all its Stages.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tomás Ó Maoláin</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann approves the following Order in draft:</P>
      <P>Rotunda Hospital (Amendment of Charter) Order, 1972&mdash;a copy of which order in draft was laid before Seanad Éireann on 9th May, 1972.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Childers) Erskine Hamilton Childers">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>The order will remove the £1,000 limit on the total value of the land which the Rotunda Hospital may hold under its Charter dated 2nd December 1756, given during the regin of King George II. The present rateable valuation of the hospital is £2,970. Apart from the desirability of rectifying the anomalous situation, there is an immediate necessity to right it, in order that the High Court may make an order transferring <Col N="936" /> the ownership of the Drumcondra Hospital, rateable valuation £240, to the Rotunda. This transfer is being made at the request of the Drumcondra Hospital and with the agreement of the Rotunda. The 28 beds in the Drumcondra Hospital will be used for the post-confinement care of selected mothers and their babies delivered at the Rotunda.</P>
      <P>This is one of the measures being undertaken to ease the pressure on the maternity hospitals in Dublin. By using the Drumcondra Hospital in this way the mother and baby have the benefit of the full maternity hospital staff and facilities at the critical time; uneventful post-confinement is subsequently provided in good conditions without creating dangerous overcrowding in the parent maternity hospital. Section 76 of the Health Act, 1970, states that an order which it is proposed to make amending a hospital charter shall be laid in draft before each House of the Oireachtas and shall not be made until the resolution approving of the draft has been passed by each House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Seanad will have any difficulty in agreeing to what the Minister has proposed. The Rotunda Hospital has a long and very honourable history of service to the people of Dublin and, indeed, beyond them to the people of the whole country. We welcome any expansion of its activities and also welcome any removal of any limitations which existed in the original hospital charter. We will have no difficulty in agreeing to this motion. We hope that, not just in the years to come but in the centuries to come, the Rotunda Hospital will be able to continue to give the valuable service it has given in the centuries that have passed since its foundation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support the motion because the Rotunda Hospital has given magnificent service over the years. There is just one point I should like to refer to. The Minister might enlighten me as to whether there is any restrictions or limitation in the charter regarding the appointment of a master. I have often <Col N="937" /> heard that there was some limitation as to who could be appointed to the post. I should like to take this opportunity of clearing up that point. The Minister may not be in a position to answer at the moment but he may do so at some future date.</P>

  <MainHeading Type="GD" LHead="Private Business. - Dangerous" RHead="Substances Bill, 1970: Second Stage">
    <Title>Private Business. - Dangerous Substances Bill, 1970: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrennan" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. J. Brennan) Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. J. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>As Senators will have gathered from the explanatory memorandum which I have circulated, the object of the Dangerous Substances Bill is, briefly, to bring up-to-date existing law protecting the general public against the dangers inherent in the use of explosives and petroleum, and to enable the Minister for Labour, by means of statutory instruments, to prescribe any necessary measures required to protect the public against other dangerous substances. Many of those things are not subject to any statutory control at present.</P>
      <P>At present, safety law on explosives and petroleum is contained in the Explosives Act, 1875, the Petroleum Acts 1871, 1879 and 1881, and various regulations and orders made under those Acts. These subsidiary instruments were made mostly around the turn of the century. The first thing to be said about that body of legislation is that it belongs to another and a simpler age.</P>
      <P>Although the Explosives Act, 1875, deals with other explosives besides gunpowder, these appear to have been brought in almost as an afterthought and the Act is primarily concerned with gunpowder. It controls in considerable detail the activities of gunpowder factories and the storage of gunpowder in magazines, but most of its provisions are anachronisms today. The very use of the term &ldquo;gunpowder&rdquo; dates the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I could not say offhand whether the Petroleum Acts pre-date the invention <Col N="938" /> of the internal combustion engine, but it is clear that the framers of those laws did not foresee the extent to which our whole civilisation would become so dependent on the products of the petroleum industry. The very definition of the word &ldquo;petroleum&rdquo; has a touch of the alchemist about it.</P>
    <P>The 1871 Act applies to &ldquo;petroleum, including any rock oil, Rangoon oil, Burmah oil made from petroleum, coal, schist, shale, peat or other bituminous substance, and any products of petroleum, or any of the above-mentioned oils which give off an inflammable vapour at less than 100 degress Farenheit&rdquo;. The Act envisages the transport of petroleum in what it calls &ldquo;vessels&rdquo;, which I take to be some kind of fairly small containers, and refers to ships &ldquo;landing&rdquo; their cargoes of petroleum.</P>
    <P>The 1879 Act, by reducing the flash-point of petroleum from 100 degrees to 73 degrees Fahrenheit, restricted statutory control to the lighter and more volatile petroleum-spirit, although the heavier petroleum oils in their own way can be every bit as great a fire hazard as the lighter ones.</P>
    <P>The 1881 Act regulates the hawking of petroleum-spirit from what it calls, &ldquo;carriages&rdquo;. The amount which could be carried in any one &ldquo;carriage&rdquo; is limited to 20 gallons, and again, it is envisaged that the petroleum will be in &ldquo;vessels&rdquo;. Modern methods of transporting petroleum both by sea and by land just do not fit into this legal framework.</P>
    <P>In addition to the deficiencies of existing law which I have already indicated, there are other hazards which technological development has thrust upon us and which are not subject to statutory control at present. Among these are the transport and storage of industrial acids and chemicals, the use of the slurry-truck explosives process in mining and quarrying, and the use of compressed gas cylinders and aerosols. With the continuous acceleration of technology it is only to be expected that further hazards will arise; some of these may take forms which we, like our predecessors, cannot foresee at present. This Bill would enable the responsible Minister to prescribe any measures that may be found necessary <Col N="939" /> to protect the community against such hazards.</P>
    <P>Part I of the Bill makes the usual preliminary and general provision for interpretation, presentation of orders and regulations, expenses, repeals <i>et cetera.</i> One point to which I would like to draw attention is that the definition in section 1 (2) of &ldquo;proper local or harbour authority&rdquo; for the purposes of the Bill will end the anomalous situation in existing law where owners of private harbours can, as harbour authorities, grant petrol storage licences to themselves. The Defence Forces and Civil Defence are exempted from the scope of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Part II deals with explosives. It controls, by means of a licensing system, the importation, possession, sale and purchase of explosives. These restrictions will not apply, however, to firearms ammunition which will continue to be dealt with under the Fire Arms Act, 1925. Explosives may be manufactured only in a licensed factory. There are provisions regarding the marking and packing of explosives for conveyance. The foregoing requirements may be modified, by regulations, for fireworks, safety signalling and rescue devices and similar articles.</P>
    <P>Part III deals with petroleum. It provides that petroleum-spirit in other than small quantities may be kept only in a store licensed by the appropriate local authority or harbour authority. Containers of petroleum-spirit must be marked &ldquo;petroleum-spirit&rdquo; and &ldquo;highly inflammable&rdquo;. There is provision for the making of regulations for the protection of persons against risk of injury caused by petroleum. The term &ldquo;petroleum&rdquo; includes petroleum-spirit but also covers other less volatile and inflammable petroleum such as fuel oil and heating oil.</P>
    <P>Part IV deals with other dangerous substances. It empowers the Minister to declare by order a particular substance to be a dangerous substance and to make regulations to protect persons against risk of injury from such a substance. Before making such an order or such regulations, the Minister must give public notice of his <Col N="940" /> intention, and afford interested parties an opportunity to make representations to him. In common with all other statutory instruments made under the Act, such orders and regulations must be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Part V is concerned with the notification and investigation of accidents arising out of the keeping of dangerous substances under licence. The procedures for holding inquests and formal investigations are similar to corresponding provisions in the Factories Act, 1955, and the Mines and Quarries Act, 1965.</P>
    <P>Part VI deals with administration&mdash; licensing, regulations, exemptions, fees, and powers of inspectors. Licences for explosives factories and magazines will be issued by the Minister. Local authorities and harbour authorities will issue licences for explosives stores and petroleum-spirit stores.</P>
    <P>Appeals against refusals by local or harbour authorities to grant licences, or against conditions imposed by such authorities in licences granted, will lie to the Minister. There is a general power to make regulations for the purposes of the Act and also a power to provide for exemptions by regulations. The powers of inspectors are similar to their powers under existing safety legislation.</P>
    <P>Part VII makes the usual kind of provision for offences, penalties and legal proceedings on behalf of the Minister or licensing authorities as appropriate.</P>
    <P>Finally, Part VIII deals with a number of miscellaneous matters. Setting-off fireworks in public places will continue to be an offence which can be prosecuted by the Garda. Suitable precautions must be taken in the conveyance, loading and unloading of dangerous substances and every ship carrying such substances must notify the harbour master on entering harbour. Trespass upon premises licensed under the Act will be an offence. Employees in such premises must use any safety appliances provided, and must not endanger themselves or others. Regulations may require the posting of abstracts of the Act, copies <Col N="941" /> of regulations, or other prescribed notices.</P>
    <P>Essentially, what I am proposing in this Bill is an up-dating and extension of safety precautions in the use of explosives and petroleum in industry and trade. Both the workers immediately involved and the general public need the support of these safety measures in their every-day lives.</P>
    <P>Senators will have noted that the Bill does not concern itself in any way with the criminal use of explosives which is dealt with in a different code of legislation.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Professor Kelly Professor Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Professor Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>When this Bill was going through the Dáil the two or three Deputies from my party who spoke on the Second Stage said they could not understand how it was that this topic should be dealt with by the Minister for Labour and his Department. One of our Deputies went so far as to say that if he was asked to guess which Department would be the least likely to have this job on their hands he would have guessed the Department of Labour. My feelings about the Bill are exactly the same.</P>
      <P>The lack of cohesion and of administrative liaison on matters which are essentially germane to one another in the eyes of the public are demonstrated very clearly in the Minister's speech. I do not wish to fault him or his officials for what is only a slip, except that it is a significant slip because it shows that the different arms of Government which deal with dangerous things are not working as láimh a chéile as they ought to be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That slip is the Minister's reference to the Firearms Act, 1925. The Minister's colleague, the Minister for Justice, piloted through this House, in one of the most disagreeable debates which I can remember here&mdash;except for that on the Forcible Entry Bill&mdash; the Firearms Bill only about a year ago. The topic which the Minister mentions, about firearms ammunition, is dealt with, not just by the Firearms Act, 1925 alone, but in the Firearms Act, 1925 to 1971. It is a tiny slip, but it is a sign that the Departments dealing with matters which really are <Col N="942" /> related to one another and would in the minds of the public appear to be related to one another, are dealt with in an unsatisfactorily separate and haphazard and, therefore, undesirable manner.</P>
    <P>Everybody on this side of the House, as in the Dáil, will share the Minister's concern that this Bill, will improve the safety position of people whose work involves them in handling explosives or other dangerous things, and I recognise that it will be conducive to that end. This party will not oppose the Bill for that reason. Naturally, we are in favour of anything which will improve safety.</P>
    <P>However, I cannot let the occasion go without adverting to what the Minister said at the very end of his speech, which was identical with what he said in the Dáil. Indeed, I think his whole speech is almost word for word what he said in the Dáil. He says the Bill does not concern itself in any way with the criminal use of explosives which is dealt with in a different code of legislation. Senators will remember that last June when the Minister's colleague, Deputy O'Malley, was piloting the Firearms Bill through this House, he was pressed by me and by other Senators on this side to extend the definition of firearms so as to include things which were not in common understanding firearms but which were, broadly speaking, explosives which could be dangerous to life and property. The Minister rejected that suggestion in the same style as he rejected the other suggestions which came from us, and I shall quote what he said. It is reported at column 387, volume 70 of the Seanad Debates, and reads:</P>
    <P>The question of explosives was raised by Senator Kelly. He was critical of the Bill on the grounds that it did not seem to cover explosives as opposed to ammunition. Of course there is a completely separate code of law in respect of explosives. There is on the Order Paper of the Dáil at the moment, having received its First Reading there, the Dangerous Substance Bill, which seeks to modernise certain aspects of the law relating to explosives. <Col N="943" /> I had hoped that I might be able to bring before the Oireachtas a Bill relating to explosives corresponding to, and at much the same time as, this Bill but I find that unfortunately the law on explosives is somewhat more complicated ...</P>
    <P>But in that passage and in two other passages in the same volume the Minister for Justice represented to this House that the legislation which is now before us would plug the gap which we have discovered, or which we thought we had discovered in the Firearms Bill. We were not able to satisfy ourselves on the point at that time because the Dangerous Substances Bill was not printed.</P>
    <P>I hope I shall not bore the House if I hark back to what happened almost a year ago. The point which concerned us in regard to the question of including explosives in the Firearms Bill was this: the object of that Bill was to put it beyond all possible doubt, in section 4, that the unlawful possession of firearms in this jurisdiction was not any the less unlawful even though they were intended for use in the Six Counties. That would in my opinion have been the law anyway, but the law had been called into question by a couple of judicial directions, and the Minister, quite rightly, wished to put the matter beyond any possible doubt.</P>
    <P>That was the main effect of the Bill which we debated here a year ago. We wished to ensure that it would not be possible for a defendant to say: &ldquo;Yes, I have got this anti-tank gun but it was intended for use across the Border&rdquo;. It was intended to ensure that this could not possibly be a defence to a charge of unlawful possession of such arms.</P>
    <P>The Minister was pressed by other Senators and myself to include explosives in the definition, so that if someone was found in possession of gelignite or plastic explosive, it would not be possible for him to say: &ldquo;I am in possession of it but I do not intend it for use here&rdquo;. That was the reason why we pressed the Minister to extend the definition of ammunition and firearms which already goes beyond the common understanding of firearms.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="944" /> For example, an aerial bomb or a hand-grenade is clearly a firearm under the definitions used by the Firearms Act, and the Minister refused to accept that amendment on the grounds, as far as I could read his intentions, ostensible or genuine, that the whole matter would be dealt with in the Bill which we have now before us.</P>
    <P>I do not see anything in this Bill about the North of Ireland. It may be that there is some other Bill germinating quietly in the Department of Justice which in the end we will be allowed to see, relating to the particular question of explosives in the criminal context. I do not know why we should have to wait for this, so I propose to put down an amendment or amendments to this Bill which will have the effect if accepted, of making it specifically an offence to be in possession of explosives in this jurisdiction notwithstanding that their destination, or the place where their employment is intended, is across the Border. I intend moving a further amendment to make it an offence to export explosives without a licence across the Border into Northern Ireland. Further to that, I intend to move an amendment, similar to the one which I moved last year when the Firearms Bill was being discussed, making it an offence to conspire within this jurisdiction at the importation of explosives into the North of Ireland by whatever route.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Labour is not perhaps <i>au fait</i> with the working of the Department of Justice. That is why my colleagues in the Dáil and my party as a whole feel that this Bill ought to have come from the Department of Justice, despite the dimensions of safety which it contains.</P>
    <P>Let us be honest about this. When anyone mentions explosives these days he is not thinking about quarries, he is thinking about explosives which blow people to bits. I do not know what is in the Minister's mind, but we might not have had this legislation were it not for the tragic prominence which explosives have developed in this country&mdash;I am speaking about the whole country&mdash;over the last year or so.</P>
    <P>When I spoke on the Firearms Bill <Col N="945" /> the following week the Minister appeared not to have bothered with what I had said I was going to do in the way of putting down amendments. He dealt with some impatience, to put it mildly, with the amendments which I had put down although he and his officials had ample notice of the spirit behind them. I want to tell the Minister here today as uncontentiously as I can, that these amendments will be in within a couple of days. I would like him to consider whether his officials might not take counsel with the Department of Justice as to the proper attitude to adopt.</P>
    <P>If our law makes it possible to export explosives without a licence, or in some illegitimate way across the Border into the North, or to contrive the importation of explosives into the North by whatever route, then that law needs amendment, and I cannot see why this Bill might not be an appropriate vehicle for such amendment. There may be reasons of which I do not know; if so, the Minister will have an opportunity of stating them.</P>
    <P>I have not made up my mind whether I will introduce amendments on the following lines or not. I would like to hear what the Minister has to say before deciding on this. I refer to the penalties in connection with the importation and manufacture of explosives. Section 10 of the Act says that:</P>
    <P>No person shall import any explosive except in accordance with a licence granted by the Minister.</P>
    <P>Section 15 says:</P>
    <P>No person shall manufacture any explosive except in a factory licensed by the Minister for the purpose and in accordance with the licence.</P>
    <P>These sections do not contain any penalties, but section 52 provides a sort of blanket system of penalties for offences under the Act to which no specific penalty is individually attached. That section reads:</P>
    <P>A person guilty of an offence under this Act for which no expressed penalty is provided shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £100 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding six <Col N="946" /> months or to both such fine and such imprisonment.</P>
    <P>I am aware that there is another Act in force here&mdash;the Explosive Substances Act, 1883&mdash;which provides penalties for unlawful handling of explosives, but if we are having a specific section in a brand-new Bill which prohibits the unlicensed manufacture of explosives and prohibits also the unlicensed importation of explosives I consider that these penalties are altogether inadequate. What kind of a man would take it on himself to manufacture an explosive substance without a licence? What kind of man would take it on himself to import explosives without a licence? This does not refer to a quarry owner who simply wants to short circuit the trouble of applying for a licence. We are not dealing with somebody whose ordinary legitimate business requires explosives and who does not want to bother going to the Minister for a licence. We may be dealing with such a person, but more probably we will be dealing with somebody who intends to use that explosive to kill people. A system of penalties which provides a maximum of a fine not exceeding £100, or imprisonment not exceeding six months, is a farcical penalty to attach to what I consider would be an extremely serious offence</P>
    <P>I have spoken strongly about that and I will wait to see what the Minister says about it. There may be other legislation to which the Minister's advisers have more immediate access or, speaking bluntly, know about and which I do not know about, which meets this point. If it does not meet this point, I would like the Minister to explain why it is that in this new Bill dealing specifically with the importation and manufacture of explosives, the thing should be trivialised so as to carry the same kind of penalty as might be applied to somebody failing to pay his motor tax or to somebody guilty of an act of careless driving. I am not asking that a penalty should be made mandatory. Somebody with no murderous or subversive intention might manufacture explosives for a lark, a schoolboy, let us say, or to satisfy scientific curiosity, or dishonestly because he wants to avoid <Col N="947" /> the trouble of getting a licence but intends to use the explosive for some purpose which otherwise would be legitimate. I am not asking for a mandatory sentence in a case of that kind. Of course the District Court or any other court would not impose the maximum sentence in such cases. I would be in favour of letting off somebody of that kind with a small fine and no question of imprisonment at all, but it seems to me that the offences here are more likely to be committed by persons of a different type altogether. We are not facing up to the reality of the kind of people they are if we attach this absolutely &ldquo;bread crumb&rdquo; kind of penalty to what I consider is an extremely serious and dangerous offence.</P>
    <P>There are a few other points I would like to mention. I will listen to what the Minister says about them afterwards before I decide whether to ask the House to amend them or not. The Bill as we have it does not state what the criteria are on which the Minister will decide whether or not to license an explosives manufacturer. Although I know that this Minister will act responsibly&mdash;and I am not in any way trying to represent either himself or his colleagues in Government as likely to act irresponsibly in this regard&mdash;I would like to see the Bill spell out the criteria which it will expect to be satisfied before a licence is granted to manufactures of explosives. The same should apply to the question of licensing the importation of explosives.</P>
    <P>While I am prepared to agree and accept unreservedly that the Minister will not behave unreasonably in this regard and does not intend to allow a badly organised factory or unsupervised enterprise to manufacture or import explosives, I should like to see these criteria made explicit, not by regulation but inside the Bill.</P>
    <P>It came as a surprise to me to learn some months ago that explosives were actually manufactured in this jurisdiction. I remeber getting a very ill-tempered letter from a Unionist Stormont MP about a year ago who thought I was being hypocritical in trying <Col N="948" /> to stand up for things which I should not have had to stand up for, namely, the behaviour of this Government in dealing with the North of Ireland situation. He said: &ldquo;How can you say things like that when we know that every day quantities of explosives manufactured in the Republic are coming over the Border?&rdquo; I have since discovered that explosives are manufactured here. There is at least one factory, I think in Enfield, and perhaps there are more factories elsewhere.</P>
    <P>I know there are many legitimate industrial uses for explosives but at a time when explosives are being used daily, not just to destroy property, but to put human lives in terror and often to destroy human lives by taking life itself away, or by making it scarcely worth living, as when limbs are blown off. In a situation like this the Minister should consider a total ban on the manufacture of explosives in all conditions in this jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>It is important that we should show the people in the North of Ireland whom we describe as our &ldquo;separated brethren&rdquo; that we are prepared to treat them as such and are prepared to undergo inconvenience, expense and difficulty in order to leave them in no shadow of doubt but that we regard their flesh, bone and blood just as our own, just as much in need of the same protection and just as dear to us. I have not the technical knowledge to grasp the dimensions of the problem which such a measure would present.</P>
    <P>Maybe it is impracticable or insuperable but if it were not, I would not be aganist a total ban for, say, a limited period in the first instance of six months or a year, on the manufacture of explosives or the importation of explosives with or without a licence. I would revoke whatever licensing arrangements exist in regard to the manufacture or importation of explosives. I would then say to the people in the North of Ireland &ldquo;If you find explosives in caches or in dumps, they have not come from here because none are made here&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I accept the explanation made by the Minister for Justice in the Dáil a few months ago as being sincerely intended when he stated that when <Col N="949" /> caches of explosives are discovered in the North of Ireland, and they turn out to have been manufactured in the Republic this does not prove anything. The Minister stated this because most of the explosives used in the North of Ireland is legitimately imported from here, so it might have been stolen after being imported into the North of Ireland. I accept this as a fair argument. But it is not enough to argue with people. We are not in a debating society with the people in the North of Ireland. We must show them we mean what we say, and that we are not doing shadow-boxing and going through the motions in regard to dangerous things. To refer back again to the debate on the Firearms Bill, we left ourselves open to that criticism this time last year. I would not be against a drastic measure of that kind provided it were only a question of bringing operations in a few quarries to a standstill, or of making Roadstone or some other firm such as that mark time for a few months.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to indicate what his reaction to that suggestion would be. Perhaps he would, in particular, say what criteria he intends to apply henceforth in the licensing or manufacture of explosives.</P>
    <P>These are the only points of substance which I wish to deal with. Depending on the Minister's reaction, I will make up my mind whether or not to put down amendments on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. J. Fitzgerald Mr. J. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support the Bill although, like Senator Kelly, I feel disappointed with it. In introducing the Bill, the Minister has mentioned that it is up-dating the Explosives Act, 1875, which was solely devoted to gunpowder.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To me this Bill appears to be concerned only with transport by ship or storage in harbours or handling depots in harbours. Many of us would be concerned about the transport of petrol, fuel oil or gas in huge containers which travel along our roads. There is not much we can do by way of legislation over and above what is in operation at the moment. It appears <Col N="950" /> odd to me that we are concerned with the ships and the harbours. If the harbour authorities are notified and the shipping companies take the necessary precautions what happens after that or how the substances are transported inland does not appear to be affected by this Bill.</P>
    <P>Senator Kelly has mentioned many aspects concerning explosives and the licensing and handling of explosives. There is another aspect of explosives or dangerous substances, to which I should like to make reference here. This may not be covered in the Bill although the Minister does say in the last paragraph on page 6:</P>
    <P>Senators will have noted that the Bill does not concern itself in any way with the criminal use of explosives which is dealt with in a different code of legislation.</P>
    <P>We all agree that that is correct.</P>
    <P>There is another use for explosives which could concern all of us. Senator Kelly touched on this point. I refer to the case where students or teenagers are experimenting with weedkiller and other types of substances. We know of the many tragic accidents which have taken place as a result of that type of experiment and as a result of this type of substance being available to young people. There does not appear to be anything in this Bill to control that.</P>
    <P>This is not a spectacular Bill. It is, as the Minister stated, up-dating legislation which is almost 100 years old, but while up-dating this legislation, the Minister should have introduced something more into the Bill. I support the Bill as it stands but I should be glad if the Minister in his reply would indicate what he proposes to do in connection with the few points I have mentioned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NevilleKeery" hpid="Mr. Kerry Mr. Kerry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kerry</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say a few words to welcome this particular piece of legislation. I was taken aback at Senator Kelly's opening remarks in that it seemed to me quite natural that it would be the Minister for Labour who would deal with this legislation. Whenever we hear of explosives or dangerous substances we <Col N="951" /> immediately think of their use in the North by illegal organisations for criminal acts. I was confident when I saw the Minister for Labour here that this legislation was primarily aimed at people involved in the use of explosives in an industrial or production context, where the use of such explosives and dangerous substances is part and parcel of their ordinary routine. It is part of the responsibility of the Minister for Labour to deal with all aspects of safety affecting people in their work places.</P>
      <P>The Minister has an inspectorate who are already doing much of the work that will be covered in this legislation in other fields, such as the building industry. It is quite clear that the type of legislation we are dealing with here covers work with which the Minister and his Department are already familiar. This legislation is designed specifically to bring up-to-date legislation affecting the use of dangerous substances and explosives in the context in which I have spoken. I will be interested in anything the Minister says in reply to the points made by Senator Kelly about extending this legislation. It is a welcome piece of legislation up-dating legislation in a field where it is of concern and importance to people who are working with dangerous substances day in day out in a manner neither dramatic nor hitting the headlines, except when by accident tragedy occurs. The sections dealing with the notification and investigation of accidents are very welcome. It is very important that our legislation should be up-to-date in this field.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to mention two points which have not so far been raised. First, I note that under this legislation the Minister will have power to make various safety regulations designed to protect people against the risk of injury from petroleum, <i>et cetera.</i> When one is dealing with legislation which is brining things up-to-date, particularly after such a long period, one always asks one's self: &ldquo;How on earth is it that we did not get around to doing this particular job a lot earlier?&rdquo; I hope that the Minister will use his <Col N="952" /> powers to make regulations as quickly as possible in many of the important fields referred to here.</P>
    <P>As a motorist I am very much aware when visiting service stations that we do not have the same safety precaution signs here that one sees in other countries, where notices are widely displayed about the dangers of naked lights or of keeping engines running in petrol stations, <i>et cetera.</i> We could do with a great deal more awareness of the dangers of substances which nowadays we tend to take for granted. I hope the Minister proposes to introduce regulations which will help to create this awareness and protect the public. The sight of people smoking in the vicinity of stored petrol causes me anxiety. I hope this aspect of smoking and of safety where dangerous substances are concerned will be dealt with by the Minister in his regulations.</P>
    <P>Another matter to which I should like to refer, by way of seeking information, is the reference in the Bill to the use of fireworks in public places. In this Bill I was looking for a clearer definition of a firework. I understood that the sale of explosive-type fireworks is already forbidden here following an accident involving loss of life in a news-agents' shop some years ago. At the times of the year when one sees explosive fireworks in use in Dublin, one feels they are fireworks which may have been smuggled in and are being used in an illegal way. There is distinction between sparklers, which are not in any way dangerous or explosive, and explosive fireworks. Perhaps this is a point which needs clarification.</P>
    <P>I am an admirer of fireworks as a spectacle and as an art form, when properly displayed. Firework displays are rare here. I recall the major display of fireworks at a fishing expedition in Dún Laoghaire recently. Many people enjoyed this spectacle. It is a type of display we might see more often as part of our tourist attractions. Reading the section of the Bill dealing with fireworks, it seems to make it an offence for anyone to ignite any fireworks in a highway, street, thoroughfare or public place. There may be other inter-linking legislation, but I should like an assurance that major <Col N="953" /> displays of the kind I have mentioned in a public place are fully and adequately dealt with from the safety point of view, that they are legal in public and that they take place under proper supervision and control.</P>
    <P>Having said that I enjoy firework displays and find them a valid form of entertainment, I should like to say that I am very much against the use of fireworks in any other way. The pleasure that a father may give his children in a small way in his back garden is not worth the hazard that is created. The use of fireworks at certain times of the year, and the pleasure they afford, is not worth the loss of life and limb or the terrorisation of the elderly and of animals that often takes place through their malicious use. Having made that point I should like an assurance that the properly controlled type of firework display, which is in a sense an entertainment, should continue to be possible, but that any existing controls we have to prevent the use of dangerous fireworks should remain. Apart from these small points, I welcome the up-dating of legislation in this field. If there are any other areas of industrial safety where the regulations and legislation are likewise outdated I hope we will deal with them in this House in the near future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrennan" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. J. Brennan) Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. J. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the businesslike approach to the Bill and the important matters dealt with in it. I did anticipate that the debate would focus mainly on the question of explosives, which to my mind is only part of the Bill and is not actually the part which prompted the introduction of legislation in the first instance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I explained in the Dáil that if it were a Bill to deal with the criminal use of explosives, I would be only delighted to explain that I was bringing it in for that purpose and deal with all the matters in relation to that aspect of explosives. But I would not be the Minister dealing with it if that were the purpose of the Bill. The Minister for Justice has framed legislation for submission to the Government <Col N="954" /> to deal with the criminal use of explosives. I do not know what stage it has reached.</P>
    <P>This Bill was made necessary by the advanced technological development of substances which heretofore were unknown in industry and which have come in time and again. We found that existing legislation to protect workers from the risk of injury was inadequate to deal with some rather serious situations. Many substances have come on the market and are dealt with by persons working in industry or the conveyance and storage of these substances and our inspectors have been urging that legislation was overdue. When bringing in that legislation, it was also necessary to include explosives and petroleum.</P>
    <P>As these two are not adequately covered in existing legislation, I was informed by the experts that legislation would have to be up-dated in relation to those whose job it is to work with them whether it be in their conveyance or storage or in their actual manufacture in their premises.</P>
    <P>As Members of the House are aware, industrial accidents have unfortunately increased in recent years. We are seeking to do what we can to reduce the incidence of accidents, particularly fatal accidents in industry. We rely a good deal on the voluntary committees set up under the National Industrial Safety Organisation to take the necessary precaution by training the workers and providing them with the knowledge they should have and advising them on the care that should be exercised in avoiding the dangers that are inherent in the use of machinery, for instance. A very simple thing which causes most accidents is the use of scaffolding and other processes in construction work nowadays. Unfortunately, a great many fatal accidents are reported virtually every week from some particular source. The means which we use to protect the workers and others are adequate if we can get the co-operation necessary from both employers and employees to ensure that all the safety precautions are used and all the necessary training is given for workers to avoid and minimise the risk of injury.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="955" /> There are substances which have come on the market time and again which are not adequately covered and our inspectors have reported that it was necessary to bring in legislation to give the Minister power to make regulations to specify what are, in fact, dangerous substances. On Committee Stage in the Dáil I was pressed by the Labour Deputies to spell out all the dangerous substances but deliberately avoided doing so. Other countries with similar legislation have spelled out a huge list of substances which only a qualified person or, in many cases, a scientist would understand, but they are nevertheless dangerous substances.</P>
    <P>The experience in these countries was that the legislation was not in force for any length of time when it was found that other substances had come on the market and it was necessary to have amendments. We decided to proceed by way of giving the Minister power by regulation to declare at any time a particular thing to be a dangerous substance rather than specify it in the Bill. The principal purpose of this legislation is to deal with these things. Certain chemicals give off fumes which are dangerous to life; there are those that are explosives and not stored properly; there are those which cause skin diseases and there are various other new chemicals coming on the market for which safety precautions may not be properly made owing to defects in existing legislation. In this connection there is the handling and use of explosives and petroleum. The measures taken in this Bill relate to safety in the storage, conveyance, marking, manufacture and importation of explosives. In these areas one could see that the Bill would have a bearing on the criminal use of these explosives. Such cases would not be handled by the inspectors of the Department. They would be a matter for the officers of the Garda Síochána and the Department of Justice. We will shortly have the necessary up-dating legislation to improve the position in that respect.</P>
    <P>It is for that reason that the Department of Labour are the appropriate <Col N="956" /> Department to handle this from the point of view of the safety of workers. There is no ulterior motive in stating that, because if it were for the other purpose, I would be only too glad to state openly that is what it is for. Then the Senators would wonder why it was not some other Minister who was handling it.</P>
    <P>The Bill could, I suppose, if one could see any reason for it, interfere with the legitimate use of products that are absolutely essential in commercial life. One must depend on the good sense of the people drawing up these regulations to ensure that these substances, whether petroleum spirits or explosives, will be permitted to be used only under proper supervision when they are being legitimately used.</P>
    <P>Senator Keery was worried about fireworks. Pyrotechnical displays are a feature of some festivities and I hope there would be no desire on the part of any Minister to interfere with this legitimate use of fireworks. Safety precautions must be taken to safeguard from accidents persons who are handling these fireworks and, indeed, the persons who sell, store and manufacture them. It is merely to tighten up these matters that we have taken power in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I know we will require the date of the coming into force of the Bill&mdash; something we will be dealing with on Committee Stage&mdash;but some time will have to elapse before the appointed date, because a good deal of personnel of the right type will have to be provided, with the proper training and qualifications, in order to make the necessary regulations and provisions in the Bill for matters which are highly technical. For that reason I would say that there will be some lapse of time before we can name the date on which the Bill will come into operation.</P>
    <P>Senator Kelly asked what criteria were to be used in making the different regulations as regards suitability of storage. This is a matter which will have to be provided for in accordance with commonsense and the best expert advice available to us. I would hardly expect to spell that out in the Bill in relation to the many things which we <Col N="957" /> will have to store. For instance somebody was worried about the conveyance of petroleum. That is adequately covered in the Bill, if the Senator will take a look at it. The Bill states &ldquo;any person having possession of or in control of&rdquo; must make adequate provision for its safe handling, so that it is covered whether it is in a tank going along the road or in a boat at sea, or in a tank stored in a place of sale or use.</P>
    <P>We think that we have taken all the necessary powers in this Bill to enable us to provide for the control and the safe-keeping of these substances and have taken all the measures that are necessary to safeguard from injury or death those whose job it is to handle or be employed in any way in connection with them. I would be prepared to consider any amendment that would have a direct bearing on what is aimed at in the Bill. However, in relation to what Senator Kelly suggested about amendments, I would not be prepared to accept any amendments that are designed to make regulations in relation to the criminal use of explosives. This is something that must be left in the hands of the Department of Justice and they have the opportunity now of knowing what is in this Bill with regard to the control of explosives from the safety point of view and from there the Minister for Justice will provide the necessary legislation.</P>
    <P>I could not now say at what stage it may be. I had discussions with them before we had this finally circulated. Anything in relation to the criminal use of explosives will be dealt with in his legislation, as one can understand would be his duty. We are concerned only with the safety of workers and other persons. It need not necessarily always be workers. It may be persons in the vicinity of where dangerous substances are being used, stored or manufactured, and the Bill has adequate powers to provide the necessary regulations to minimise the risk of injury to all persons involved. I can assure the House that it is only brought about as a result of our experience in the field of safety regulations. Existing legislation was inadequate to deal with many of the things which modern science has <Col N="958" /> brought into use as part of commercial life.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Professor Kelly Professor Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Professor Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I realise that I am not allowed to make a second speech, but I wonder if you would allow me, through you Sir, to ask the Minister if he realises that this Bill is creating offences? This Bill has got criminal dimensions and there are matters in it which could be described as criminal activities in regard to explosives. This is the point I have been trying to make, that the line dividing the offences which the Minister is now creating from the offences which he tells us his colleague is going to create in a new Bill is very hard to find.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am prepared to admit what Senator Kelly says, that there is a thin dividing line in some parts of the Bill, particularly those dealing with explosives. For instance, the Senator speaking at first here mentioned the question of the manufacture of explosives and that the penalties provided here would be inadequate to deal with the type of person who had criminal intent in manufacturing explosives. In that case, if a person were manufacturing explosives without a licence with intent to endanger life, we would not handle it at all. The Department of Justice would deal with that. That would quite plainly be a case where the forces of law and order would have to step in and deal with it under another Act and a different type of penalty.</P>
      <P>But there are cases nowadays where it is so easy to make explosives and, unfortunately, there are a number of things which when combined make explosives. Even a farmer, in cleaning part of his land or blowing out rocks, may undertake, without bothering to go about it legitimately, the manufacture of some explosive and as a result his workmen may lose their lives. It has happened. He had no criminal intent whatever.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to control the use and manufacture of explosives we must make this provision. No matter how thin the line may be and no matter how much it may marginally overlap, there can be the criminal side of the use of explosives. However, it would <Col N="959" /> not be handled by the inspectors of our Department though one could suspect or find that it was for criminal use.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret very much that the situation has arisen which makes it necessary to introduce this Bill at short notice both in the Dáil and this House. The main provision of the Bill is to authorise prisoners to be transferred to military custody in certain exceptional circumstances. This emergency has resulted from the riot and destruction which was carried out in Mountjoy Prison on the night of 18-19th May.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As as a result nearly 200 prisoners had to be transferred to other prisons. No other accommodation could be found other than at the military detention barracks in the Curragh for 40 of that number. At present these prisoners are nominally, at least, under the control of two prison officers but the real <i>de facto</i> control is exercised <Col N="960" /> by the military authorities at the Curragh. Their powers in this regard are limited if not non-existent and would have to be rectified. It is the purpose of this Bill to give those powers to the military authorities.</P>
    <P>I hope, when this transfer was originally made on Friday afternoon last, to utilise the military detention barracks at the Curragh as a purely civil prison but the demands on staff are so severe at the moment, as one might understand, that notwithstanding our considerable recruitment in the last year, I simply have not sufficient staff. The Army authorities are quite adamant and the prison authorities are in agreement that it is impossible to run the prison on a half-and-half basis. It must be either totally under military control or completely under civil control. Apart from that there is the difficulty raised by the location of the military detention barracks in or close to the centre of a fairly large complex of military buildings on the Curragh. The military authorities assured me that it would be impossible to have any sort of civil control over a building which is in the middle of a large military complex.</P>
    <P>There is only one section of any great significance in the Bill, section 2, which provides for this transfer to military custody. At the moment there are approximately 40 prisoners in custody in the Curragh. Senators will be aware of the circumstances under which these transfers to Cork, Portlaoise, St. Patricks's, as well as to the Curragh, became necessary. There was a very serious riot in Mountjoy on the night of Thursday, 18th May and the morning of Friday 19th. It was the most serious disturbance in the history of our prisons. An enormous amount of damage has been done. It is impossible at this stage to quantify it in financial terms but it should run into some tens of thousands of pounds at the very least. Apart from the financial implications it means that only a little more than half the number of prisoners who could otherwise be confined in Mountjoy can now be kept there. I described in some detail in the Dáil the course of this riot and the events which occurred on that night.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="961" /> There is one point which was raised in the Dáil and which was quite erroneous to which I should like to refer. It was apparently based on a newspaper report. This was about the question of a master key having been stolen or obtained from a prison officer. No such key was obtained. A key which opened a very small number of cells in one wing was obtained. This was all the officer was carrying.</P>
    <P>Again it is not true to say that the officers immediately lost control or were unable to assist the beleaguered officers. They did so but did not succeed in releasing one of them, Chief Officer Lee, who was put into a cell and kept there by prisoners who had broken free. These prisoners at the time they attacked the officer were not in their cells. They had been on recreation and were returning to their cells.</P>
    <P>The other officers in the prison held what is called the &ldquo;circle&rdquo; of the prison for upwards of one hour. There were very severe attacks from a considerable number of prisoners. Unfortunately, because of the ancient and unusual design of Mountjoy, it is possible, without going through the circle, which is the focal point of the four cell blocks, to get from one cell block to another through the roof. The roof is a matter to which I will be referring later in reference to the length of time it will take to reconstruct Mountjoy to an acceptable condition.</P>
    <P>As a result of prisoners from the B wing, which is the remand wing for unconvicted prisoners, getting through the roof, they got into other cell blocks and broke locks on cell doors and released other prisoners. This, of course, had a cumulative effect, as Senators can well imagine.</P>
    <P>The destruction was extremely severe and just about every movable fitting that could be broken was broken. A very large amount of furniture was smashed and a great number of doors of cells were ripped off their hinges or otherwise broken. Every window in the prison was broken and all the sanitary facilities as well as all the medical and dental facilities were smashed. The pharmacy was smashed and all the drugs stolen or destroyed. The people <Col N="962" /> who instigated this destruction alleged that they had three demands. I dealt with the contents of those demands in the Dáil; they certainly were of no substance. It is particularly significant that they did not include a demand&mdash; this was subsequently issued apparently on their behalf&mdash;to be treated as, what they describe, political prisoners.</P>
    <P>Indeed, the rioters, who in the first instance consisted for the most part of that particular type of prisoner, released people on that occasion whom on other occasions they have taken on themselves to refer to as ordinary criminals. To say the least of it, they certainly accepted the assistance of these so-called ordinary criminals in the orgy of devastation which followed. A demand was made, following a discussion between some of these people and an official of my Department, that no reprisals would betaken against them. I understood this to mean that no proceedings or prosecutions would follow in respect of the various crimes committed in the course of the riot. I immediately said that there could be no question of that demand being met. Those people were given half an hour in which to cease their activities and go back to their cells voluntarily. The Army who were equipped with CS gas and other riot-control equipment, were brought into the inner part of the prison where they could be seen by the rioters. It was made clear that the Army would be used if those people did not return to their cells. They did, in fact, go back to their cells within 15 minutes of that warning being given.</P>
    <P>I have been criticised in some quarters for not having sent in the Army earlier to restore order and for not having delivered this ultimatum previously but on that night I found myself in the position where a senior prison officer was being held hostage by these people. I knew well that these people were capable of taking human life and might well decide to do so. We were also under the impression for part of that night that three other prison officers were being held as hostages because three officers uniforms were apparently acquired by these people in the course of their rampage and were donned by prisoners at a distance from the circle which gave <Col N="963" /> the impression that possibly three other officers were in there. I was, therefore, faced with the dilemma that if I moved in quickly and heavily against these people I might well cause either serious injury or even death to the officers who were being held hostage. For that reason I moved more slowly than my own instincts would normally lead me to move against these people.</P>
    <P>I have also been criticised for the fact that a serious riot took place on that occasion and it was said that I should have ensured that no riot would ever take place either in Mountjoy or in any of our prisons. I can answer that criticism very simply by saying that I could have ensured and could continue to ensure in the future that no riot would take place but the methods that I, or anyone in my position, would have to use to ensure that would be to make life perfectly unbearable for all prisoners in our prisons. Our prison population now amounts to approximately 1,075 people. Any question of rehabilitation of our prisoners in those conditions would be out of the question.</P>
    <P>I regard prison primarily as a place of training and rehabilitation, not as a place of punishment. The confinement and loss of liberty in a prison should be the extent of the punishment, in my view. While there is a loss of liberty to move outside in the ordinary world, the loss of liberty within the prison itself should be kept to a minimum if we are to have any hopes of rehabilitating all who go there, particularly bearing in mind that many of those who go there are men and women who perhaps never got a chance in the world outside. In many cases the aid, assistance, advice and, indeed, the kindness which they receive in prison are received by them for the first time in their lives.</P>
    <P>I could have prevented that riot but the cost of doing so would have been so high socially and might have had a damaging effect on those who visit our prisons from time to time that I would not be warranted in doing it. I regret very much that such an event took place but, at the same time, I make no apology for it because, in <Col N="964" /> the two years since I became Minister, in any discussion in the Dáil on my Department in so far as there was any criticism of the prison system it was that we put too high a premium on security and that we did not do enough to rehabilitate prisoners.</P>
    <P>It is evident to anybody who looks at it that the two things are not compatible; maximum security and maximum rehabilitation. What we have done up to last Thursday was, I thought, a reasonable compromise between the two. There was reasonable security and, at the same time, there was a reasonable chance of aiding, assisting, rehabilitating and educating those in the prisons. I have no doubt that what we did up to then in the way of security was more than adequate for the normal prisoner we receive in our prisons.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, we had in the remand wing of Mountjoy Prison at that time a group of people who are not normal prisoners by any standards and who abused their position in the prison and, in particular, in the remand wing, which is used for unconvicted prisoners, to such an extent that this very regrettable event occurred. Not only have I to think of the other prisoners but I have to think, in particular, of the other remand prisoners and bear in mind that they are unconvicted prisoners and that they may never be convicted and may, in fact, be perfectly innocent.</P>
    <P>I want to take this opportunity of saying, as I said in the Dáil, and as I said at a press conference last week, that the actions of all the prison staff in Mountjoy on that night was tremendous. I was very proud of what they did and I think the whole nation should be very grateful to them for their bravery and for their dedication to duty.</P>
    <P>I have described the exceptional dedication of, for example, Chief Officer Lee. That is typical of the prison service as a whole and I am very glad to be able to say that. On that night, too, the Garda and the Army were there very quickly in large numbers. They prevented the escape of anybody and prevented anybody getting outside the <Col N="965" /> inner part of the prison. Not alone did nobody escape but there was never any possiblity of anybody escaping. I am extremely grateful to the Garda and to the Army for all they did that night, particularly when they were subjected to attacks outside the prison by hooligans and thugs who always seem to gather on occasions such as this. Those thugs were inspired by a small group of anarchists and enemies of democracy.</P>
    <P>The length of time which this Bill will remain in force was fixed in the Dáil today: it is until 31st May, 1974. However, it is subject to the proviso that if it should prove possible to do away with military custody before then, Dáil Éireann could pass a resolution taking section 2 of this Bill out of it before 31st May, 1974.</P>
    <P>I think I met all sides and all views fairly in the Dáil last night and today. I accepted a number of amendments and put down a number of amendments myself. I do not think that any Member of the Dáil had any genuine cause for complaint about the way that this Bill was handled and I hope the Seanad will find it acceptable and will enable it to be passed very shortly so that it can be signed by the President, if at all possible, tomorrow.</P>
    <P>In the Dáil I did not spell out some of the legal difficulties. Perhaps I could say a little bit more about them here. They were referred to in the Dáil by Deputy O'Higgins. There is a very grave danger that certain very dangerous or potentially dangerous people could succeed in their <i>habeas corpus</i> applications. I want to state that for that reason I ask Seanad Éireann for their co-operation in ensuring that we can keep our prison situation totally under control and prevent letting loose on the community any people whom it would be in the national interest to keep in custody, and who have been remanded in custody or sentenced by the courts of this land.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am probably speaking for all Senators when I say that this House has never proved itself lacking in co-operation with a Minister when there were genuine grounds for co-operation being afforded. I would <Col N="966" /> think that on this occasion, in relation to this Bill, the Minister should have no reason to fear that there will be any lack of co-operation from this House. I was glad to hear the Minister speaking of his co-operative attitude in the Dáil. May I start by expressing the hope that the Minister, on his part, will prove equally co-operative with the Seanad.</P>
      <P>In relation to the amendments which have been made to the Bill in the Dáil I can see at the outset that the Minister went a long way towards meeting various points of view which were expressed in the Dáil. Nevertheless, this Bill still bears the hallmarks of what it is, hurried legislation. There are a few points which the Minister should look at again, and which he should amend before this Bill is signed by the President. Otherwise, we may very well face the situation that within a few weeks the Minister may have to come back to the Houses of the Oireachtas to introduce a Bill amending certain provisions in this Bill.</P>
      <P>The introduction of any Bill such as this by a Fianna Fáil Minister invites an emotional reaction. The record of the Fianna Fáil Party generally down through the years&mdash;and I do not exclude recent years&mdash;in relation to the whole question of law and order is such that a certain degree of frustration has been felt by the ordinary people and certainly by members of other parties in the Oireachtas. It is a sad commentary on the lack of preparedness of the Government in the face of the kind of situation which exists even in this part of the country today that a riot in one of our prisons should so dislocate the entire prison service that a Bill of this sort became necessary. I do not think it would have been too much for the people to expect the Minister&mdash;perhaps not the present Minister because he has been in office for only a couple of years&mdash;and the Government as a whole, to have taken steps some years ago to ensure that law and order would be maintained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The actions of a small body of men, who it could have been anticipated were likely to see the inside of Mountjoy Prison, in the course of one night <Col N="967" /> could so dislocate the prison service that the Minister found it necessary to come to the two Houses of the Oireachtas with hastily prepared legislation and to invite the Houses of the Oireachtas to pass that legislation in a matter of hours. The whole sequence of events shows a deplorable situation of unpreparedness for which the Government can be faulted.</P>
    <P>It is easy to take an emotional approach to this Bill. I do not want to do that. I do not think there is any misunderstanding in the minds of the Government or in the minds of the public where the Fine Gael Party stand on questions of law and order and the security and preservation of the democratic institutions of this State. As far as I am concerned, I am prepared to approach this Bill in a purely pragmatic way. In doing that, we must ask ourselves if the Bill is necessary, if the grounds on which the Minister urges its acceptance by the House exist in such force as to render it not merely desirable but necessary for the Minister to have recourse to the radical solution of seeking the assistance of the military authorities and the Defence Forces to keep people in custody.</P>
    <P>If we accept the truth and accuracy of the case made that accommodation in Mountjoy has been so damaged and disrupted that it is necessary to introduce this Bill, then the approach of responsible parliamentarians to the Minister's appeal will be to say that he should have this Bill provided that we can ensure that it is consistent, or can be made consistent, with the rights of the people&mdash;I was going to say rights and liberties, but &ldquo;liberties&rdquo; might not be the right word on this occasion. One of the rights of citizens who for one reason or another have fallen foul of the law and have been sentenced to terms of imprisonment by civil courts is that they should be lodged in surroundings to which the prison codes up to now apply.</P>
    <P>The Minister has made a genuine and reasonable effort to ensure that that code will apply in this Bill. There are some defects in the provisions which have been made and which I propose to refer to briefly now and <Col N="968" /> possibly in more detail on Committee Stage. In his opening speech the Minister raised the question of the differentiation between ordinary prisoners or criminals, on the one hand, and people who claim a special position as political prisoners on the other. I want to say clearly and bluntly that so far as I am concerned I do not recognise that there should be any differentiation whatsoever. If an arsonist burns my house because I am a Fine Gael Senator and another arsonist burns my neighbour's house for some other reason, I see no just cause whatever why there should be any differentiation in the treatment afforded to the two arsonists if they are caught and convicted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as that particular aspect of this matter goes I feel clear in my own mind what my attitude should be. As regards the details of the Bill, there seems to be one glaring omission which should be remedied by this House. I hope the Minister will agree to remedy it. That is, there is no definition whatever of &ldquo;military custody&rdquo;. I have looked at other legislation to see if such a definition might exist in earlier Acts and I have not been able to find it. There is a definition in the Defence Act, 1954, of &ldquo;service custody&rdquo;, but service custody is not precisely the same thing as the kind of military custody that is envisaged in this Bill. If it were the same thing the Minister's remedy would be simple. He should then provide in the Bill that military custody for the purpose of this Bill should be the same as service custody as defined in the Defence Act, 1954. I know that the expression is used in the Offences Against the State Act, but I do not know of any definition. It is essential that there should be a definition. If the Minister considers this he will, on reflection, agree with me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a rather general way he referred to the legal difficulties and problems which arise out of the present situation and which reinforce his argument as to why his Bill should be accepted and passed quickly into law. From the Minister's own point of view it would be a pity if he made too much haste <Col N="969" /> and overlooked a matter which could raise considerable legal problems for him. One of the suggestion I want to make to the Minister is that there should be inserted in this Bill a definition of &ldquo;military custody&rdquo; and I propose to move an amendment to cover that on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>It is hardly necessary to point out that the consideration which Senators on both sides of the House have been able to give to this Bill has necessarily been short and curtailed. To accommodate both the House and the Minister, I have already drafted a number of the amendments which I have in mind so as to enable them to be circulated. I should not like to see the Minister's approach to amendments which are put down in these circumstances to be one of fencing with words. The amendments are put down for the purpose of pinpointing the particular principle or change which I think is involved.</P>
    <P>Before we start the Committee Stage I would like to say that if there is any drafting difficulty which makes any of the amendments which I propose unacceptable I am prepared to take any form of amendment to cover the point which may be drafted by the Minister or any of his officials.</P>
    <P>The second point I want to refer to is one which has been discussed in the Dáil. That is in relation to subsection (3) of section 2. The structure of this Bill is that the Minister can direct the transfer of prisoners to military custody only provided certain pre-conditions are fulfilled. The case the Minister has made, and which I accept, is that because of the trouble in Mountjoy Prison on the 18th-19th May an accommodation problem has arisen and become acute. I accept that as a good reason for introducing this Bill, but the Minister seems to go far beyond that in section 2 (3). The conditions prescribed in subsection (3) have pre-conditions to the Minister making an order directing the transfer to military custody: first, that the Minister is of opinion that prison accommodation or prison staff is insufficient to provide secure and reasonable conditions of custody and, second, in relation to persons for <Col N="970" /> whom accommodation is required is insufficient to provide such conditions without serious detriment to the maintenance in prisons of the normal arrangements for the rehabilitative treatment of prisoners.</P>
    <P>I want to direct the attention of the House to the fact that this goes far beyond grounds of pressure on accommodation or lack of accommodation. The Minister, under the section as framed, is entitled to direct transfer to military custody because of an insufficiency of prison staff. Were it not for the amendment which was accepted in the Dáil limiting the duration of this Bill to a date in 1974, I would regard this question of insufficiency of staff as being a major impediment to ready acceptance of this Bill.</P>
    <P>We are entitled to consider this in theory as well as in practice. In theory, under the section as it stands, it would be open to the Minister deliberately to let the prison staff run down and when it had run down to what need not necessarily be even a point of immediate danger, because it is dependent on the Minister's opinion, the Minister could then, on the grounds of insufficiency of staff, direct transfer to military custody, even though quite adequate and sufficient accommodation under the civil authority and under the officers of the prison service would be available. The Minister's power to direct transfer to military custody is quite justifiable in present circumstances on the basis of lack of accommodation but the Minister has not made a convincing case that it is justifiable on the basis of insufficiency of prison staff.</P>
    <P>There are circumstances when it would be appropriate for the Minister to seek these powers because of an inadequacy of prison staff, but the kind of circumstances which come to my mind would be those in which a certain emergency arises which causes a shortage of prison staff. I am not quite sure how officers of the prison services stand in relation to strikes. If they are entitled to strike for better conditions and use the strike weapon, the Minister might find himself in a position of extreme difficulty and he might then say: &ldquo;An exceptional <Col N="971" /> situation has arisen and I propose to operate subsection (3) of section 2 of this Act because of the insufficiency of prison staff which has arisen.&rdquo; I would accept that case if the Minister is prepared to amend subsection (3) so as to provide that insufficiency of prison staff will be good grounds for transferring to military custody only if the insufficiency arises suddenly and in exceptional or emergency circumstances. As matter stand, there are grounds for objection to the Bill in this connection.</P>
    <P>Another point which I propose to develop more fully on Committee Stage relates to subsection (6) of section 2. I welcome the provision the Minister has made which is a safeguard, that is, the requirement to lay before each House of the Oireachtas a statement specifying the name and the offences where a person has been directed to be transferred to military custody. Here also there is one vital omission which this House should remedy. There is no obligation to state to which place of detention the person has been removed.</P>
    <P>We all know the difficulties and the volume of complaint there have been elsewhere in this country where people were not able to ascertain the whereabouts of those in custody. I do not wish to see that situation arising here. I accept without any qualification that the Minister and the Government have no intention of being secretive about this, that they have no intention of allowing a situation to develop under the operation of this Bill where an outcry can be created because information is not given about the whereabouts of a person in custody. To put it at its lowest level, in his own political interests no Minister would like to have that situation develop, so I am assuming for the purpose of my remarks that it is not the intention of the Minister to have people transferred to military custody in secrecy as regards the location of the place of detention.</P>
    <P>If I am right in that, it does not weaken the Minister's Bill in any respect to require that the place of detention should also be among the particulars to be given under subsection <Col N="972" /> (9) of section 2. I am referring to the Bill as originally drafted. What was formerly subsection (8) has been amended in the Dáil and it is now subsection (9). Subsection (9) of section 2 requires the Minister for Defence to make regulations in relation to the places and the manner generally in which persons in military custody are held.</P>
    <P>There is one thing it does not do, and which I feel should be done in this Bill, and the Minister may reply to this point by saying that it will be covered in the regulations: it does not make any provision to ensure that the person to be placed in charge in places of detention will be a commissioned Army officer of reasonably senior rank. I would have expected a Bill of this sort to provide that the person in charge of the place of detention would be an officer holding a rank of, say, not less than commandant. I recognise that the Minister may tell me that it is the intention to make a provision of that sort in the regulations. If such is the intention, I would suggest that it will not weaken the Minister's Bill in any way to provide in subsection (9) that the regulations which are to be made by the Minister for Defence will provide that the person in charge of the place of detention will be an Army officer holding the rank of commandant or higher.</P>
    <P>The Seanad would be falling down on their job if they did not ask the Minister to make a provision of that sort. I have never in this House refused to accept an assurance given by a Minister. I would be prepared to accept as quite <i>bona fide</i> any assurance which the Minister might give the House in connection with that matter. I, and many of my colleagues, have pointed out that we are not legislating for a particular Minister for Justice or Defence&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Professor Kelly Professor Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Professor Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Or a particular Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;or, for that matter, a particular Government. It may be that another Minister would have different views and so far as the law is concerned neither the courts <Col N="973" /> nor the Minister need have regard so far as legal effect is concerned to any statement of intention made by the Minister in this or the other House of the Oireachtas. On the face of this Bill as it stands, it would be open to the Minister for Defence to provide that a corporal in the military police should be the person in charge of the place of detention. I do not believe that is what this House wants.</P>
      <P>At the outset I said that one of the considerations that must be brought to bear on this Bill is that the rights of citizens who have fallen foul of the law and who are coming under the direction of the Minister to be transferred to military custody under this Bill should be protected. We have a duty to protect those rights. It follows that in relation to this particular matter we have a duty to ensure that the person in charge of the place of detention will be a person who would be regarded by this House, the Dáil, the public and the prisoners, as a responsible person. We should seek to ensure as far as possible&mdash;and I believe this is the intention of the Bill&mdash;that the person who will be in charge will be equivalent in status to the governor of a civil prison. I regard this as of considerable importance. I hope the Minister will endeavour to meet that point of view when we come to Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>I was glad to hear the Minister mention that he hoped to have the Bill signed tomorrow because to some extent that is an indication that the Minister is prepared, if necessary, to go back to the Dáil to amend the Bill tomorrow. I was going to make this offer, and I still make it to the Minister, that if the Minister feels that the points which have been expressed here by me, and which will be expressed by other Senators, merit consideration and warrant amendment of the Bill, as I believe some of them do, as far as my party are concerned we would co-operate to try to ensure that the Minister can, if necessary, go back to the Dáil this evening for the purpose of having the Seanad amendments considered by them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some of the more detailed matters to which I have referred will require to be <Col N="974" /> considered in some depth in Committee. As far as the principle behind the Bill is concerned, owing to the emergency which has arisen, to the necessity to make the provision which is being made here, and in the desire to ensure that there will be proper functioning of our administration of justice, I agree with the Bill in principle and I would not propose opposing the Second Reading.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are being asked to deal with what is, by any standards, a very messy situation. At the same time it is to be regretted that we have what I feel is a very messy piece of legislation to deal with it. At this point I should like to express my agreement with several of the points which have been made very ably by Senator O'Higgins. I am disturbed about, and seek further information from the Minister on, a number of points which have not been adequately dealt with yet in either House of the Oireachtas. Two things have, for one reason or another, been &ldquo;fodged&rdquo; or obscured in the general discussion on this Bill. The first is the exact extent of the accommodation problem to which the riots in Mountjoy have given rise. The second is the exact nature of the legal consequences of allowing the present state of affairs to continue for any great length of time. Also&mdash;perhaps this should be added as a third category&mdash;the legal consequences of the Bill itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of accommodation, the Minister has told us of a number of transfers which have been made. Unfortunately, we have not got any overall figures. It would be interesting to hear from him how many people were in Mountjoy prior to this outbreak and how many people will remain in Mountjoy at present. If, as seems likely, that by far the greater number of prisoners who were in Mountjoy prior to the outbreak are still there, this must put a question mark against the necessity of creating alternative places of detention&mdash;that is unless the Minister intends to transfer to military custody more persons than are at present confined there. There is quite possibly an innocent explanation for this, and perhaps a simple one. <Col N="975" /> Are we to understand that there is no extra accommodation available in the prison in Limerick? This was not mentioned by the Minister. Is it more difficult to provide extra accommodation in all the prisons, apart from Limerick? Would the provision of such accommodation be such a very lengthy and risky process as the one on which the Government are going to embark?</P>
    <P>I will turn briefly to the legal aspects of the matter. The Minister said&mdash;and I heard speakers from other parties agree with him&mdash;that one of the reasons for the urgency with which he is dealing with the Bill is that there might be persons who could obtain an order of <i>habeas corpus</i> and in this way find themselves, at very short notice, released from custody. People in this category are people whom the Minister described as &ldquo;very dangerous&rdquo; or &ldquo;potentially very dangerous&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I would like more information from the Minister as to why he thinks such a course of action might prove successful. It seems that there are two possible reasons why such a course of action might prove successful. In the first place, it might be held by a court that the prisoners concerned were not under effective control of the people to whose effective control they had been consigned. Secondly, it might be held that an action for <i>habeas corpus</i> might lie because they were not being held in custody in the place to which they had originally being confined.</P>
    <P>The Minister told us that the prisoners are nominally under the control of two prison officers in the Curragh, or wherever they are at the moment. Any action for <i>habeas corpus</i> which the Minister has in mind will probably fall under the second heading, on the grounds that the prisoners concerned are not in the place to which they were committed by the court. Accepting this is true and that these are the grounds of urgency could I ask the Minister whether, even subsequent to the passing of this Bill in its present form, persons who are detained not only in the Curragh under the effective control of the military, but in prisons other than the prisons to which they were admitted, might not take an action against the Minister or the military <Col N="976" /> authorities or the prison service for illegal detention? If there is a good a chance as the Minister thinks there is that an action of <i>habeas corpus</i> will succeed at the moment, it seems to me to be a logical consequence that an action for illegal detention would succeed even after the passing of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Regarding the question of military custody, I should like to agree with Senator O'Higgins when he pointed out that this phrase is not defined in the Bill. I would not be quite as willing as Senator O'Higgins to provide a definition for the benefit of the Minister. The whole question of military custody is one of which the legal implications have been, perhaps, obscured because the whole matter has been dealt with so hurriedly. The outlines do not seem to be at all clear despite the Minister's obviously genuine attempts in relation to section 2 to lay down that there should be as little difference as possible between military custody and normal prison practice. If we transfer people to military custody, we are transferring people out of the system in which the vast majority of us live into what is, to all intents and purposes, an enclave in that system. It is also an enclave which has a very long tradition of establishing its own law and order, and perhaps a rather rougher kind of justice than is habitual in the system at large.</P>
    <P>I was reminded very forcibly of this when the Minister spoke of the discussions which were going on between him and the military authorities. At the moment he said the custody operations in the Curragh were technically under the control of two prison officers. The Minister quoted to us the opinion of the military authority that it is impossible to run a prison on a half-and-half basis. I am very sorry that the Minister should have accepted this statement from military authorities as a statement of fact. If the Minister has the confidence in his prison authorities which I believe he has, I believe that in acceding to what is almost a demand by the military authorities for total control of the prison establishments for which they are effectively responsible, he is making an unnecessary <Col N="977" /> concession. Instead of doing this he should have been extending and strengthening and providing some sort of framework for the present <i>ad hoc</i> arrangement.</P>
    <P>At present the Minister says there are two prison officers in the Curragh. To my mind, it should be possible to work with even only one prison officer in the Curragh, as long as the Minister was, as it were, a court of appeal who was effectively able to take decisions on the welfare of the prisoners there, and as long as the principle of civil control of prisoners was not conceded in the way in which the Minister has been asked to concede at the moment. If the Minister had come to us with a different Bill&mdash;one which attempted to tackle this rather more difficult legal problem&mdash;he would have had a great deal more support and a great deal less hesitation than he has at the moment. The Minister denies that he is introducing internment by any door, back, side or front. It seems to me that the distinction is becoming less and less with every speech that is made on this Bill. In fact, this impression was strengthened when I heard the Minister's statement this morning that the Government were actively considering the imposition of special courts.</P>
    <P>To my mind, the special courts plus military custody for persons, at the Minister's discretion, differ only from internment <i>per se</i> in that the review principle which is built into our internment system here would be advanced to take place prior to committal and not at intervals after committal. That is the only difference in reality whatever about the difference in law between internment and the extension of the system that the Minister is currently proposing to us. I use the word &ldquo;extension&rdquo; advisedly because he used the statement about special courts in direct relation to a discussion on this Bill.</P>
    <P>I have put down one amendment to this Bill which I will discuss in more detail on Committee Stage. I found it a very difficult Bill to amend. This may be partly due to my lack of legal knowledge. It is also quite obviously due to the fact that it is a very hastily and, inevitably, badly constructed Bill.</P>
    <P>Taking the Minister's plea for the need for extra accommodation, it is <Col N="978" /> absolutely essential to limit the category of persons who can be sent to this kind of accommodation. The Minister's interest in rehabilitation is well known. Indeed, I must give him credit for it and accept his very real goodwill in this direction, however much I may from time to time find myself agreeing with other criticism at the lack of imagination in what was in many other ways a well-intentioned basic policy. It seems that the kind of system envisaged in this Bill works directly against all the principles of rehabilitation to which the Minister has pledged himself, and in which I believe him to be sincere. The amendment which I am going to offer to the Minister is to exclude from the provisions of the Bill persons who have been sentenced. This is an amendment with which I am not entirely happy but the reasons for it can be readily understood. If we pass the Bill in its present form there seems to be every likelihood that the types of establishment under military control which are envisaged in the Bill will become places where a concentration of particularly dangerous or difficult prisoners might be held. This is not written into the wording of the Bill <i>per se</i>, but one would have to be blind not to see this as a very possible development of it.</P>
    <P>I question quite seriously whether this is an adequate way of expressing our responsibilities either to society as a whole or to the prisoners concerned. Indeed, if there is anything which the riots of last Thursday would have told us it is that the undue concentration of difficult prisoners in one particular institution is a Grade A recipe for trouble. What seems to be under discussion here is the kind of institution which would exemplify this to the fullest possible extent. I do not believe that such an institution would have a remotely rehabilitative effect on the men concerned. Consequently, I do not believe it would be an adequate way of expressing our responsibility to them. In a sense, the greater the crimes which the people have committed the greater are our responsibilities in both directions, towards them to rehabilitate them and towards society to protect them from people who have not been in any way rehabilitated.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="979" /> This present kind of solution which has been put forward today places all the stress on our responsibilities towards society in a very negative way and virtually none at all on the need to rehabilitate the people concerned. There are always violent people in society, especially perhaps in a society like ours in which violence, if not exactly canonised, certainly has been dealt with in a very superficial and limited way for very many years. There will always be people who will say that society is violent and that this justifies the use of violence against society. This is a very, very dangerous thesis for anybody to adopt. I certainly do not adopt it wholesale and the number of situations in which violence can be justified against the repressed and violent society is very much less than is generally supposed and certainly very much less than is usually claimed.</P>
    <P>I would point out to the House that these men who claim that society is violent and claim, therefore, the right to use violence against society are inherently ambiguous in their attitude. They will say that society and its law are violent, but they will also use the law which they claim is violent in an attempt to better their own position and to have themselves released from custody of one kind or another in an attempt to obtain freedom to carry on whatever activities they were engaged in. This is a situation with which people who are keen on the rule of law will always have to contend. There will always be people who will use the law only when it suits them. But the response of society to people like that should not be to tighten up the law unnecessarily. It should not be to give these men the impression that we are playing their game and that we will respond to their violence by even greater violence, and therefore give them an even greater justification for carrying on whatever violence they may have embarked on.</P>
    <P>I believe basically that what we should be about, even if necessary at risk, is the removal of all forms of violence from our society. I see this Bill which is inaccurate and muddled, <Col N="980" /> however well-meaning it may be, as an attempt to meet the particular situation, and as a further and regrettable extension of that violence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Professor Kelly Professor Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Professor Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I realise that the Minister has what seems to me to be sound and good reasons for wanting to get this legislation through quickly. I want to remind the House that we have had an unfortunate experience here in the last year or so of consensus legislation going through in a hurry. On that occasion we were told that we were dealing with a Bill on which all parties were in agreement and which was merely intended to facilitate the Dáil in conducting its function of supervising public accounts. The result was that many Members of both Houses scarcely bothered even to read the Bill and we all felt foolish when it was subsequently found in some respects invalid by the Supreme Court.</P>
      <P>I am anxious, not only on my own behalf&mdash;although I suppose I have a special status to defend here for personal reasons&mdash;that the House would not fall into this trap this time. If there is anything in this Bill&mdash;even though we on this side understand the reason for it and do not go along at all with the long-term explanations for violence which might be offered from some quarters&mdash;which might be objectionable from a constitutional point of view we should be very careful about passing it in a matter of hours.</P>
      <P>I realise very well that prisoners now in military custody are not lawfully in that custody and that they could in theory and I suppose in practice, have themselves released within a matter of hours by applying to the High Court for relief under article 40 section 4, in other words, the <i>habeas corpus</i> procedure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not feel ashamed about cooperating to that extent with the Government in blocking that possibility because I recognise that the Government had on its hands in the events in Mountjoy the other evening an emergency, which, I suppose, could not have been reasonably foreseen. Whether the degree to which violence and subversion has become a normal feature of our life, and in which fellow-travelling <Col N="981" /> with violence has become a normal feature of people's conversation and opinion, is something which the Government can equally be excused for is a separate question. I recognise that the riot the other evening in Mountjoy is something which perhaps no one could have foreseen.</P>
    <P>I recognise that the prisoners had to be accommodated somewhere; that they could not have been simply let loose. I am prepared, therefore, to co-operate with a reasonable measure to legalise the position into which the Government has been forced.</P>
    <P>Before I deal with the provisions which the Bill actually contains I want to say that the message which the prisoners or some of them shouted from the roof of the building, as it was in the course of being reduced to rubble, must make an impression on anybody interested in the ordinary rule of law. The message shouted down by some of these prisoners was that they had been remanded in custody for periods up to four months. Some of these prisoners did not apply for bail and when it was offered to them they refused. The duty of the State, whether or not bail is offered or refused, is to bring prisoners to trial quickly.</P>
    <P>Without boring the House with that chestnut about how justice must not only be done but must be seen to be done, it is important that nobody should be given even the shadow of an excuse for suspecting, let alone making it a plausible point of view, that the State is putting him on the long finger, that the State is keeping him in cold storage, or that the State is in some way withdrawing him from the ordinary legal process for reasons of its own.</P>
    <P>If this State faced a genuine emergency&mdash;and in some respects that may be the case even now&mdash;I would not oppose proper measures to deal with the bullies, of whom there are so many among us. But if that is not the case and for so long as the State is operating the ordinary processes of the law, let them be operated properly because these are the laws on which you and I rely on for our protection just as much as any gunman or bully. The State lies under exactly the same duty in regard <Col N="982" /> to these gunman and bullies as it does towards you and me. If they are on remand in custody they must be tried as quickly as the State can possibly arrange. If there is the slightest substance in the allegation that they are being kept unfairly in custody, unfairly on a prolonged remand, whether or not they have been offered bail or have been refused bail, then the State has a case to answer. If that is true&mdash;I do not assert that it is true, because I obviously do not know what is going on in the minds of the police or the State solicitor's department&mdash;the State must shoulder some of the blame here.</P>
    <P>I am not making a positive assertion about it because I do not have the necessary information. Certainly, four months remand in custody, whether or not bail was offered or refused, seems to me, <i>prima facie</i>, a rather long period for a fairly simple offence. I do not want to make trouble with the Government in this respect, because although by their neglect and inertia in the past they have contributed to the development of this situation, nonetheless they have to handle it now. However an offence which will be made out by simply proving that somebody had a pistol in his pocket or in the boot of his car cannot require such lengthy investigations and collection of evidence as to justify very long remands. Therefore although, as Senator O'Higgins has indicated, we are not opposing this Bill in principle, anything produced in these circumstances necessarily causes, on this side of the House, a certain measure of suspicion.</P>
    <P>There are no two ways about law. This party in particular has often, depending on one's point of view, either been praised or held up to odium as being the party of law and order. I would regard that, in normal circumstances, as being a compliment. We are that and have never been otherwise. In that respect we are distinguished from perhaps all other parties in the State. Law and order is an indivisible thing, a seamless web. It must be applied equally. While I think that the State would be well justified in taking stern measures to put down bullies and murderers, for so long as the law is there as it is it must be equally applied. The same rules about remand and an <Col N="983" /> early trial which would apply to you or me if we were charged with an offence tomorrow ought to apply to men who perhaps have a different disposition in regard to political questions. If we do not wish the same law to apply to them, if we wish some other law to apply to them, then it must be done openly and with the consent of the people's representatives. The Dáil and the Seanad must be told that we propose to give special treatment&mdash;I use the term as a euphemism for especially tough treatment&mdash;to people of a political complexion.</P>
    <P>I am not necessarily against this if we are dealing with subversives who do not stop at anything in order to put their point of view across, who are afraid of nothing except the ballot box. Until this is done openly we must stick to the rules. The suspicion has been raised and nothing the Minister for Justice has said over the last few days&mdash;and I have followed his statements quite closely&mdash;has entirely dispelled my fear that some of the people on remand in that prison may have been kept there as it were in cold storage. That may be the only way of dealing with these men, but, if so, let us do it above board. If it is going to be internment let us call it that. To put a wedge of this kind into the legal system by using an institution like remand or the refusal of bail and the delaying of the trial in order to keep somebody under lock and key without trying him is wrong. It is an insult to the legal system; it is demoralising in the long run, and although no one in this House will be in any doubt as to my feelings about the IRA or their fellow-travellers, for so long as the ordinary law is there is must be equally applied.</P>
    <P>I do not take this Bill to be what some of its opponents have called it. I do not think this is internment by the back door. If I did I would say so openly and frankly. I am prepared to accept that this Bill is intended to meet a difficulty which unforeseen situations created. I do not want to lend any weight which my remarks might have to the suggestion that what we have here is internment by the back door and I do not see how it could be <Col N="984" /> honestly interpreted as that. Having said this, I want to make it clear that the State or the Government if it persists, as perhaps it must, in pushing this Bill through in a hurry, is laying itself open to a difficulty. I have received this final form of the Bill as passed by Dáil Éireann only an hour ago like the other Senators and I have not had time to look at it carefully. I observe that the Minister has given way to points raised in the Dáil by my side, and in regard to the conditions under which people will be held in military custody has tightened up the phraseology of the section in the Bill as originally introduced.</P>
    <P>Originally the Minister was required merely</P>
    <P>to have regard to the desirability of ensuring that the conditions of custody of such persons are not less favourable to them than if they were subject to the ordinary prison rules.</P>
    <P>Now under the Bill in the form which the Dáil has passed, he is obliged to</P>
    <P>make such regulations as will correspond to the rules for the time being in force under the Prisons Act.</P>
    <P>This is quite an important point. A Minister or any executive authority is not entitled to vary the order of a court by making it more severe or by selecting for himself a particular mode of punishment which a judge has not decided on. That has been held by the Supreme Court in a couple of cases over the last ten years.</P>
    <P>I notice in the earlier part of this section that the Minister is entitled to specify the persons who are to be transferred to military custody in a condition of overcrowding or a condition of inadequacy of staff. If the Minister leaves himself in the position where it can be represented that, on the one hand, military custody is a tougher regime than the ordinary prison sentence and that, on the other hand, he is selecting, for the purpose of sitting on them, specified prisoners for despatch to the Curragh there to undergo their imprisonment in military custody, he is doing something which I believe to be constitutionally infirm <Col N="985" /> because he is adding a dimension to the punishment which he has no authority to add. He is adding something to the punishment which only a judge could add to it under our Constitution. That is why it is not just desirable but absolutely essential that the Minister makes certain that no distinction in point of severity can be drawn between this military custody and civilian custody in an ordinary prison.</P>
    <P>Although I have not been in politics as long as Senator O'Higgins I am less optimistic than he. I am more disillusioned with the Government's approach to amendments and I do not propose to move any. I know perfectly well they would not be accepted because the Government do not propose to go back to the Dáil with this Bill, but I want to warn the Minister, through the Parliamentary Secretary, or through his officials, that he is taking a grave risk upon himself if he adopts the policy of specifying particular prisoners and subjecting them to what might be called a tough regime in the Curragh as distinct from the civilian regime of Mountjoy or Portlaoise.</P>
    <P>If he does so, the whole Act will be struck down because&mdash;I should make it clear that I am speaking here of convicted prisoners&mdash;if a prisoner is convicted by a court and sentenced by a judge, that judge will be pronouncing a sentence of imprisonment having regard to the ordinary conditions of imprisonment which exist at the particular time. The judge has not got at the back of his mind the possibility that an executive person such as a Minister will have power in the future to take that man out of prison in Mountjoy, Portlaoise, Cork or Limerick and send him down to a much tougher place in the Curragh. That is the reason why it is absolutely vital to make sure &mdash;I do not know how the Minister will do it because I realise that soldiers are not trained as prison officers and that a military regime in the middle of a barracks, as the Minister explained, is not easy to reconcile with civilian methods of doing things, unless he designates the place as a prison&mdash;that a convicted prisoner is not, by ministerial order or direction, subjected to anything more severe than what the judge had in mind when he pronounced <Col N="986" /> sentence. If the Minister makes the mistake of doing such a thing I want to be on record as warning him that his operations are likely to be invalidated.</P>
    <P>There are one or two other points which I do not intend to make the subject of amendments but to which I should like the Minister to have regard even if they are not written into the Bill when it becomes an Act. In the existing subsection (6) of section 2 certain details in regard to prisoners committed to military custody have to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be. Senator O'Higgins very rightly pointed out&mdash;I am surprised that this was not adverted to in the Dáil&mdash;that a most important detail which does not figure in this subsection is the location of the place of detention. I think it is vital that the location of the prisoner, for reasons of common humanity&mdash;I do not care what kind of scoundrel he may be, his family have certain rights and he has certain rights in regard to them&mdash; should be known to his family and his legal advisers.</P>
    <P>It is important that the details which the Minister is required to make public in this way should contain the location of the military establishment in which the man is confined and should also contain the name of the officer in charge of the establishment. I do not intend to move an amendment to have such a provision contained in the section because I know the Government would not accept it and I would only be holding the House up unnecessarily, but there is nothing to stop the Minister from doing that purely as a prudential measure. He is not required by the subsection to do so, but there is nothing to stop him from doing it. I would strongly urge that it be done.</P>
    <P>I have not had time to think this out but I have doubts about the consititutional validity of a provision which would, in fact, enable a Minister to make a prisoner &ldquo;disappear&rdquo; without trace. I hope that will not be misunderstood as meaning the assassination of him or anything like that, but I have doubts about the validity of any legislative provision which would enable a Minister to leave a prisoner in a situation where no one knew where he was. The reason for these doubts is not just <Col N="987" /> an instinctive one but that there have been decisions of our courts in the last five or six years which have established something which is not spelled out in the Constitution but which is, nevertheless, very real: the citizen's right of access to the courts to have his rights determined.</P>
    <P>A prisoner whose whereabouts is not known by his family or by his legal advisers cannot have access to the courts. That is clear. Again I want to warn the Minister, through his officials, that the details included in subsection (6) of section 2, even though not required by the Bill in the form it will have when passed into law, should contain the name of the establishment in which the man is being kept and the name of the officer in command of it.</P>
    <P>I should have added to what I said about the question of the Minister imposing by his own order a tougher regime on a prisoner who has been sentenced to ordinary imprisonment that the Minister will not get out of that difficulty, in my opinion, by simply applying the powers of section 3 and nominating the Curragh as a prison, because an ordinary judge, a district justice, a Circuit Court judge, a judge presiding over the Central Criminal Court, who sentences someone to imprisonment is doing that against the background of the kind of prison regime to which we are accustomed. I hope that a phrase such as this will not be picked up and misinterpreted or used as a source of alarm; if this Minister or any other Minister were to turn the Curragh into a sort of Devil's Island&mdash;I want to make it clear that I am not accusing him of any such intention, nor have I any reason to think that he might do such a thing&mdash;merely to nominate it as a prison under the powers referred to in section 3 it would not save it from constitutional invalidity in the case of a prisoner convicted and sentenced to ordinary imprisonment. I believe that a sentence of that kind must be understood, and will be understood, by the Supreme Court as intended to be read against the background of the ordinary system of imprisonment we have and not against the background of any more harsh regime. I should like to add a <Col N="988" /> couple of very short remarks. One of them is in connection with subsection (5) of section 2 which states:</P>
    <P>The Minister&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) may, at any time, direct the transfer to a prison of a person in military custody pursuant to this section, and</P>
    <P>(b) shall direct the transfer to a prison of all persons in military custody as aforesaid if he is of opinion that circumstances warranting their being retained in military custody no longer obtain,</P>
    <P>I think in most legislation of this kind a direction from the Minister is expressed to be in writing and is required to be in writing. I have no doubt that in the ordinary case it would be in writing. If this Bill had been drafted with more time&mdash;I am not blaming the Department; I know they were up against a time problem&mdash;a direction of this kind would be in writing. As the Bill stands, it seems to be possible for the Minister to make such a direction by means of a telephone call. That is undesirable because it means that the Minister's directions do not remain on any record and it makes things difficult for a prisoner who is trying to challenge the legality of the steps by which he has arrived in a certain place to present even a <i>prima facie</i> case.</P>
    <P>I am afraid one of the last two things I have to say is politically contentious and I hope that the other side will bear with it patiently. The Minister said that the nation was grateful to the prison officers who showed a devotion to duty. I think he said something equivalent to &ldquo;beyond the line of duty&rdquo;. He referred to one prison officer who was rather badly hurt&mdash;he did not refer to him here but in public recently&mdash;but nevertheless came back to duty the same evening. Of course the nation is grateful to these prison officers, as it is grateful to all the people who have to do the nation's dirty work. It is dirty work. It is grateful to the Garda and to the Army who have to do these jobs. But its gratitude is not so marked towards the political leadership which has been so inert as to render such conditions almost unavoidable but certainly very probable.</P>
    <P>I have expressed this view in the <Col N="989" /> House before and I should like to put it on the record once again that if the threat posed by subversion had been taken seriously when it first appeared&mdash; the day Nelson Pillar was blown up in 1966&mdash;we would not be faced with this situation now. If, instead of the demolition of Nelson Pillar having been taken as a kind of joke then&mdash;as it was, with a Fianna Fáil Lord Mayor saying, after a perfunctory expression of regret, that he never liked the damn thing anyway&mdash;the law had been properly applied, regularly applied, fairly applied and consistently applied from that day to this, we would not now be legislating overnight because of a riot of these dimensions. The nation is grateful to the people who have to do the dirty work. The men in uniform get these perfunctory expressions of thanks; they are sincere, no doubt, but they are perfunctory because they are very often forgotten when it is not convenient to remember them.</P>
    <P>Of course we are grateful to these officers. They make things comfortable for us. We are able to sit in our padded armchairs as a result of their exertions. But a Government that allows political conditions to deteriorate through political fears of their own, through fears of losing votes, through inertia or incompetence, have no right to try and wash their hands by saying: &ldquo;We are grateful to the fellows who have tidied up the mess for us.&rdquo; They must carry part of the blame. I accept unreservedly that the Government, or perhaps I should say that part of the Fianna Fáil Party that are now in government, are genuine in their desire to end bloodshed and violence, and I have said it before. However, I cannot acquit them of incompetence and of vacillation in the way in which they have dealt with this threat in the years gone by. What we are dealing with now, although in itself an unforeseen emergency, is only a sympton of what anybody in his senses could have seen was coming five years ago, when men with sour visages and wearing black berets were going around this country firing shots at gravesides and getting away with it, when people went out to address assemblages of the gardaí and <Col N="990" /> urged them not to do their duty and got away with it.</P>
    <P>In those days it might have been possible to do something about making the people see that we regard this Parliament as being the only authority in the country with the right to decide on issues of peace and war. The Government, for one reason or another&mdash; perhaps it did not suit them, because they could not rely on their own supporters&mdash;did not do that job. We have hammered at them long enough and I do not want to weary Senators on the far side who are solidly in favour of humanity and decency in the way of doing business. Nevertheless, that blame cannot be moved from the place where it lies.</P>
    <P>The last point I want to mention refers to a letter which everyone in both Houses received today from the prison chaplain in Mountjoy. I will not read it. Everyone has seen it for himself, but I should like to cite one sentence. This Catholic chaplain says that it surprises no one in the prison service that riots occur. All understand that prison is such a place as to make rioting an ever-present possibility. This is not strictly relevant to the trouble we had three or four nights ago nor to this Bill. If the House will be patient for a few minutes, I should like to say that everything which that priest has set out in his letter was said by me&mdash; perhaps not so well and certainly not with the background of so much experience&mdash;when we were debating the Prisons Bill last year. At that time I said that the population of the prisons in this country very largely consisted of underprivileged people or of people who were illiterate and therefore unemployable, who were very largely of less than average intelligence and for whom imprisonment was merely society's gesture of despair.</P>
    <P>I do not claim any credit for having said these things. Anybody who has ever spent five minutes considering the point knows it. The reason why I mention it now is not to waste the time of the House or to pat myself on the back for having adverted to this one-and-a-half years ago. It is to urge the Department of Justice again to intercede with their colleagues in the Department <Col N="991" /> of Education to have special funds made available for the study of criminality and of penal methods in this country. In the universities we are in a situation where we have to try to accommodate this very serious social need within our ordinary budget. We have to fight for a lectureship or a Chair in Criminology, for instance, as hard as we would have to fight for a lectureship in, say, Assyriology. I believe that the State should take a specific interest in these dimensions of academic life which have serious social importance. It should not be necessary to fight for money through the ordinary academic channels, when we are trying to do what we can to ease this particular side of the problem. I know that I have strayed somewhat from the subject. I hope that the Minister, who is standing in for his colleague, and the officials behind him, will listen to that and, perhaps, repeat it in the quarter in which it may do most good.</P>

      <P>I am sorry that I cannot share even the limited enthusiasm that Senator O'Higgins and Senator Kelly have for this Bill. In spite of what Senator Kelly has said, to me this Bill is an attempt to have the best of both worlds. On the one hand, we had the Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice emphasising that we would have no internment and that we would have no military courts. Now there will be prisoners in military detention and we can still boast that there are no military courts and no internment. I want to emphasise that I am as concerned as any other Member of the Houses of the Oireachtas for the preservation of the democratic institutions of this State. But I am at a loss to know what this Bill will do for their preservation. Perhaps there are wider powers in the Bill than are apparent to me.</P>
      <P>I should like to know if only political prisoners will be transferred to the Curragh. Will ordinary prisoners, such as housebreakers, be sent to the Curragh? If it is intended for political prisoners only, then it is military detention for political offences.</P>

      <P>As I was saying when the Minister tried to keep me on the right track in connection with this Bill, I want to know if the Minister and the Government are placing all the blame on the political prisoners for the extent of the riot that we had in Mountjoy last week. If he is, then again there is a question of doubt. In the letter referred to by Senator Kelly, which all Members of the Oireachtas received from the Catholic chaplain in Mountjoy, the first sentence states:</P>
      <P>There has been a serious riot in Mountjoy, spearheaded by men on remand who had a purpose but deriving much of its strength and fury from ordinary prisoners who had no particular purpose in mind who rioted because that is their nature and that is the nature of prison.</P>
      <P>He does not place all the blame for the extent of the damage in Mountjoy on the political prisoners.</P>
      <P>Section 2 of this Bill says that the section will continue in operation for two years. This suggests to me that the damage to Mountjoy will be repaired in two years. If the damage to the wing of Mountjoy prison is as serious as we are led to believe by the Minister, then I have my doubts, and I am sure that the Minister has his doubts also, that it can be repaired in two years unless it is proposed just to try to replace it as it existed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If you read through this letter, which we received from the chaplain, it is obvious that many improvements are needed in Mountjoy if we are not to have riots such as this in the future. Leaving that aside, is it not imperative that this damaged section of Mountjoy will have to be demolished and a completely new and remodelled building erected in its place? If that is so, how is it proposed to have all this done by the 31st May, 1974? If Mountjoy Prison is not ready for prisoners to be returned there in two years are we to have another enabling Bill of this kind coming along to extend the period perhaps until 1976? It appears to me that it will take until 1976 or 1980 to repair Mountjoy. We can look <Col N="994" /> forward to prisoners in the Curragh for a long time to come. I do not agree that any prisoner on remand should be handed over to military custody. For that reason I cannot support this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnNash" hpid="Mr. Nash Mr. Nash">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nash</NameTxt>
      <P>I had not intended speaking on this Bill but the last speech prompted me to do so. It is time we defined what a political prisoner is, or what a political offence is. If someone commits murder is the murderer to have one degree of guilt if he is a politician and another degree of guilt if he is a layman? What defines a person as a politician? Is he a politician only and is it a political murder or a political crime only if he refuses to acknowledge the political society as it exists?</P>
      <P>Can any group of people, no matter how large or how small, call themselves a political society capable of taking law into their own hands? If so, what is the difference between a political offence and the offences committed by the Mafia in America? Are we really to get to this stage? Surely crime is crime, murder is murder, arson is arson, no matter by whom it is committed. If society as it exists feels that there should be special circumstances and exemptions for crime committed because of certain methods, why not provide for it in the legislation?</P>
      <P>We should get it clearly into our minds that not only is the person who pulls the trigger responsible for murder, not only is the person who ignites the bomb responsible for maiming but also every person who lends him moral support. People who are maimed or killed owe their loss to every one of us who is not prepared as a member of society to condemn those actions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have all this sort of &ldquo;softly, softly&rdquo; by people who want the best of both worlds. They are prepared to take advantage of society and the laws of society as they exist. At the same time they are prepared to tear down society despite the laws of society. At the moment this Bill is absolutely essential in the unfortunate circumstances that exist. What has happened could possibly have been foreseen, as Senator <Col N="995" /> O'Higgins said but, having been foreseen, very little could have been done about it unless our prisons were to be transformed into strong security prisons. This would mean that the ordinary prisoner would be under terms of detention and restraints which normally were not intended for him. This would mean that prisons, which normally should be for rehabilitation, could not be used for that purpose. In those circumstances, if the Minister had foreseen that and brought in a measure such as this some months ago, then all our liberal members of society would have thrown it out. Because it was not brought in a number of relatively innocent people must suffer. They must forfeit their courses of rehabilitation and their courses of treatment.</P>
    <P>Senator Horgan suggested that the prison in the Curragh should be under the dual control of military and civilians. That would be a tragedy as nobody could ultimately be held responsible by parliamentary procedure or otherwise if the prisoners were not properly treated. It is essential that prisoners who were removed to the Curragh must be kept there under terms not less unfavourable than normally applies to prison and it is essential in their own interests that there must be somebody who can be held responsible if they are not.</P>
    <P>If an injury or an injustice is done to a prisoner by the governor in Mountjoy or the governor in Limerick, through his warders or himself the prisoner cannot sue the governor. He must sue the Minister. Therefore, the prisoners in the Curragh cannot be under the control of the Minister for Justice and the Minister for Defence. There must be one Minister who can be held responsible. It is most important that they should be under the single control of one Minister. Obviously this could not be the Minister for Justice in the Curragh among military personnel in a military barracks.</P>
    <P>Senator Kelly referred to the fact that prisoners are on remand for four months and if there was no justification this seems improper. I agree with him. My experience of criminal law is as follows.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="996" /> A man found with a loaded pistol is entitled to be tried by a jury. In the ordinary course of events the Circuit Court sits four times a year in the locality in which he is found. He comes before the District Court first and informations have to be taken, <i>et cetera.</i> Those of us who have experience of criminal law find that if the court sits once a month, this takes a month, six weeks, or two months depending on your luck. Your client may have been arrested immediately after the last sitting of the District Court and so you must wait, as when your client comes forward for trial there is not sufficient evidence collected by the gardaí at that stage and you must wait for the second month. Then you may find you have just missed the Circuit Court.</P>
    <P>These people may say: &ldquo;We are specially bothered in this regard, we are here longer.&rdquo; In the ordinary course of events many of these people, who now complain, could come before the Circuit Court in the county or area in which they are arrested or charged but if they do so there is a demonstration outside the court.</P>
    <P>Under our system of criminal law a jury must be unanimous in their verdict. The local 12 jurors in the country area, who are well known to everybody, in face of this demonstration, are at risk until the case is tried in the local Circuit Court. Therefore, most of these cases have to be remanded to Dublin. The reason for this is the actions and conduct of the supporters of these people who are complaining that they are on remand too long. The Circuit Court passes locally because they are remanded to Dublin and they must wait another few months. I, as a lawyer with experience of these things, know that the absolute minimum in which an accused can get for trial in the Circuit Criminal Court in Dublin is four months and the average is approximately six months. I wish to clear the air on that point. That has been my experience in defending ordinary criminal offences, and they have no cause for complaint when bail is available to them.</P>
    <P>It is right and proper in the unfortunate circumstances of this case that <Col N="997" /> there is no alternative. I would have liked if these people had not spearheaded the riot, that they had not broken up the prison, and that they had left to the other 500 or 600 prisoners their right to rehabilitation. If you spearhead something in circumstances such as that, human nature being as it is, you are bound to get a following of the more aggressive types of mentality. You are bound to do a vast amount of damage. My sympathy is with the unfortunate people who were serving their sentence to society, or paying their debt to society and being rehabilitated and for whom that opportunity no longer exists.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support the Minister in the introduction of this Bill. He has made a reasonable case on the necessity for it. We all listened to the reports on the riot as it developed at Mountjoy and at the end we were relieved at the way in which the forces contained the riot.</P>
      <P>The proposals made by the Government are the only practical ones in this case. While I agree it would be right to see a definition of &ldquo;military custody&rdquo; my information is that generally conditions under military custody are far more liberal than under the ordinary system. Admittedly military custody enables a greater guarantee of the effectiveness of provisions against any escape. The ultimate guarantee here is that the Dáil can, at any time, move a motion to have this set aside and the Government have limited the operation of the Bill, when it becomes an Act, to two years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would not like the limitation as it stands in any way to cause an unduly hasty job to be done in the rebuilding of the prison facilities at Mountjoy. In rebuilding, the Government would be wise to take proper heed of the letter circulated to all Senators and Deputies by the Catholic chaplain who pointed out that the facilities there are not good. We hope that in the rebuilt Mountjoy, the opportunity will be availed of to provide a prison that stresses in greater measure the rehabilitation procedures and opportunities for the ordinary prisoners, many of whom, as the chaplain pointed out, came from very <Col N="998" /> deprived conditions and are in prison largely due to their unfortunate background history.</P>
    <P>Senator Nash has done us all a favour by his very straight words on this matter of the label &ldquo;political prisoner&rdquo; being bandied around. A prisoner cannot simply be made a political prisoner by the fact of not recognising the court. As Senator Nash has put it, murder or arson are the same heinous crimes whatever the circumstances in which they are committed.</P>
    <P>The Minister should be encouraged by the resolute stand taken by all parties in this House on the question of the enforcement of law and order. We will hope in the months ahead to see an improvement in the general situation throughout the country and that the Government will have every confidence in tackling any problem that should arise by referring back to the referendum results because that was a strong emphatic vote for law and order in this country. I am not suggesting that those who voted &ldquo;no&rdquo; were in any way endorsing the opposite but the very smallness of that vote showed that the overwhelming majority of the people are strongly behind the Government in wanting democratic processes to proceed.</P>
    <P>When it comes to democratic processes we can say that we have a record unique in the world that will never be surpassed in having an unfortunate civil war. The ballot box was allowed ten years later to transfer powers from the victors to the vanquished. Looking back on the results, as an independent observer, I feel the verdict of the people was justified in that it enabled both parties to play their part in the building of the new Ireland. Again, speaking independently, I feel both parties played an indispensable role in that development. In my view the contribution made by Mr. W. T. Cosgrave was matched by that made by the President, Mr. de Valera, in ensuring there was a combined approach to the development of the country. It was a democratic process and the fact that this process was supported by the Army and the Garda enabled that transfer to take place. <Col N="999" /> Surely that is a record that will never be surpassed in the modern world. It is something that shows that the people are very staunch in the democatic processes and are not likely to be diverted from this view.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. B. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad of the constructive attitude taken by the Members of the Seanad towards this Bill and which was similar to the attitude of the great majority of the Members of the Dáil. Fundamentally, this is a Prisons Bill and the purpose of it is to ensure that where the Minister for Justice of the day is dissatisfied in regard to the inadequacy of accommodation or personnel a transfer from a prison situation can be effected into military custody and that it be deemed in military custody to be within the civil prison jurisdiction. That is the principle enshrined in section 2.</P>
      <P>There is no more and no less to the Bill than that. I wish to emphasise this because a lot of remarks have been made that there was something sinister in the Bill. This remark was made by Senator Fitzgerald and alleged by a small minority of the Labour Party in the Dáil who voted against the Bill. This does not arise. It is simply to deal with a basic necessity concerned with the security of the State where accommodation in Mountjoy Prison is inadequate, where there may be a personnel inadequacy and where prisoners on remand or convicted under the ordinary law of our land cannot be housed or supervised properly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are trying to deal with this problem here and to give under section 2, which is the basic section, adequate powers to the Minister for Justice to ensure that places of accommodation called prisons, whether under military or other custody, are made available to ensure that the security of the State is safeguarded and ensuring that accommodation and personnel are available to supervise people who are prisoners of the State. These are people who have done a disservice to the State in the sense of impinging on the law of the land, who have come before <Col N="1000" /> the courts which have put them on remand, or where the courts through the ordinary legal process have ordained a conviction. It is important that we get a sense of reality in this matter and stop going into mirageland about this. What we are concerned about here is the security of the State and that we, as a legislature, give the Executive of the day, who are the Government, the power to ensure that people who break the law or who are regarded as breaking the law and are on remand pending trial, are properly accommodated and supervised and that personnel are available to deal with the problem.</P>
    <P>On Second Reading I believe that is all that needs to be said. I understand suggestions have been made about amendments. In the Dáil the Minister accepted some realistic amendments, in particular a basic one which ensured that there would be a time limitation to the 31st May, 1974. In the Dáil the Fine Gael Party pressed that this should be done to prevent any misunderstanding or in case anything should be read into the matter that might be of a sinister nature. The Minister accepted this amendment. That provides a safeguard against any mischievous people who seek to read into this Bill something which is not intended&mdash;that pending the reconstruction of Mountjoy Prison as a proper prison with the full rehabilitative provisions in it which are not there at the moment, possibly out of evil comes good. The building itself needed reconstruction and we hope this will be done before the end of May, 1974. That amendment, which I regard as an important amendment from the point of view of reassuring people who think there might be something other than is intended in the Bill, was accepted. It ensures that the Bill may cease to operate before that by way of order. That is a matter for the Minister. The important matter is that the Government are charged with the responsibility of reconstructing a major prison in a proper way and to make sure that full provision is made for the rehabilitation and social aspects of prisoners. After all that, we can get on with the job of dealing <Col N="1001" /> properly with the security of this State and not have any mixed-up ideas about it. I welcome the overwhelming support that was given in the Dáil to this measure and the overwhelming support that it has got here in the Seanad also.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

    <P>SECTION 1.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 2 to add to the section the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In this Act the expression &lsquo;military custody&rsquo;means the holding under arrest or in confinement of a person by the Defence Forces by virtue of a direction made by the Minister under this Act.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It is a little bit difficult moving amendments and dealing with Committee Stage immediately following the Second Stage because Senators may not have had the opportunity of digesting the amendments and seeing how they stand in relation to the text of the Bill. On Second Stage I dealt broadly with the amendments which I proposed putting down so that the Minister would have some advance knowledge of them, would have an opportunity of considering them and obtaining some advice from discussions with his Department regarding them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment which I am now moving is to cure what I believe to be a defect in the Bill as it stands. That is, to insert in the Bill a definition of what we mean by &ldquo;military custody&rdquo;. The Bill as it came to us from the Dáil did not contain any definition of &ldquo;military custody&rdquo;. It is an easy thing for anyone to say: &ldquo;Of course we know what &lsquo;military custody&rsquo;is?&rdquo; That is not going far enough, with respect to anyone who may feel like advancing that argument. We have imposed on us the obligation of participating in the legislation which is to have the force of law in this country. When we have done that our job ends. <Col N="1002" /> It is then a matter for the courts to interpret what we have done and any question that is raised with regard to the meaning of the Acts which go through this Parliament, any decision on that question, is a decision which has to be made by the judiciary&mdash;not by this House.</P>
    <P>If we are lazy or slovenly in our work, we have merely to meet a temporary situation in order to accommodate a Minister who for perfectly valid reasons is in a hurry with the Bill. If we allow the legislation to go out from us in an unfinished and untidy way with loose ends, with defects of one sort or another in it, the only result will be that sooner or later the Minister will have to come back to this House with an amending Bill to try to remedy the defects.</P>
    <P>It is a defect in this Bill that there is no definition of &ldquo;military custody&rdquo;. The entire Bill is dealing with something called &ldquo;military custody&rdquo;. It never gets around to face up to what military custody is. I ask the Minister to put in a definition and I am suggesting to him a definition which would cover the position adequately. I suggest that he should amend section 1 by inserting the words:</P>
    <P>In this Act the expression &ldquo;military custody&rdquo; means the holding under arrest or in confinement of a person by the Defence Forces by virtue of a direction made by the Minister under this Act.</P>
    <P>That is exactly what we mean by &ldquo;military custody&rdquo; in relation to this Bill&mdash;that following a direction made by the Minister under section 2 of the Bill when it becomes an Act, a prisoner will be transferred into the custody not of any servants of the Minister for Justice, not of any persons in the prison service but into the custody of the Defence Forces who are under the authority and jurisdiction of a completely different Minister.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice is, in effect, hiving off, from his direct responsibility to one of his colleagues, the custody of prisoners who, in the first instance, were, broadly speaking, under the custody of the Minister for Justice or the servants or officials of his <Col N="1003" /> Department. I think the definition which I have suggested is accurate: I think it is comprehensive and comprises precisely what is in the minds of the legislature in relation to this Bill. It is not only that, but it is necessary. I could visualise a situation arising, if a definition is not put into this Bill, where a dispute could arise and an argument could develop and possibly an adverse decision could be given by the courts all arising out of the two words, which are used so frequently in the Bill, &ldquo;military custody&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It may be it will be argued that the custody of persons in places which are not barrack prisons would not constitute military custody. It might be argued, for example, that if some of the serving personnel who were charged with the responsibility of custody of prisoners in any shape or form were not members of the regular Army but were, for example, drawn from the FCA, that the question of military custody could be challenged on that score.</P>
    <P>There is an infinite variety of ways in which this matter could be raised, any of which might for all we know be successful if raised before the courts. We may let that situation go, we may let it develop, we may chance to luck on it. The Minister may say: &ldquo;Well, surely everyone knows what military custody is; it is not necessary to do this.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He may chance his arm in that way and possibly he would be proved to be correct. Possibly no challenge would ever arise but are we, as responsible legislators, entitled to approach the matter from that point of view when there is a very simple remedy. The simple remedy is to put in a definition of &ldquo;military custody&rdquo; in the Bill, to write into the Bill what we mean by military custody. Would anyone object to the definition I have suggested? If they do, my attitude to it is, as I expressed on the Second Stage, that if there are any flaws in the drafting of this or any other amendment that I have put down I do not think it would be fair to oppose the spirit of the amendment or to defeat the principle of the amendment merely by verbal <Col N="1004" /> fencing, because everyone knows the exceptional circumstances in which we have had to consider this Bill and in which we have had to draft Committee Stage amendments.</P>
    <P>Consequently, if the principle is accepted by the House, and I think it should be, it would be not only a prudent thing for the House to do but, to my way of looking at it, it would be a necessary thing for the House to look at it. If the House looks at it in that way and agrees with the principle, then as far as I am concerned I certainly do not press the particular wording which I have included in this amendment. If the Minister tells me there is another definition of military custody which he thinks would be better, as far as I am concerned that is grand, I will accept it, but it does seem to me that if we are to do our work properly here, if we are to produce a proper piece of legislation to deal with this situation, then we should include some definition of military custody in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr O'Malley) Desmond J. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no need to define terms which have ordinary plain meaning. &ldquo;Military custody&rdquo; is simply custody by the military or the military authority. The responsible Minister is the Minister for Defence who will make regulations under subsection (9) of section 2. The term &ldquo;military custody&rdquo; is to be found in section 51 (3) of the Offences Against the State Act, 1939 which contains no definition of such custody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need for a definition of &ldquo;service custody&rdquo; in the 1954 Defence Act arose from the fact that service custody is not a term that has a plain and ordinary meaning. Our legislation is far too concerned with definitions which instead of defining, result in restricting the meaning. For this reason definition sections now often say (a) or (b) or (c) &ldquo;includes&rdquo; something rather than &ldquo;means&rdquo;. This type of definition is only necessary in order to make sure that a term includes something that it might not otherwise include. Military custody will of course be lawful custody and the Bill clearly distinguishes between military custody and what is called custody in prison&mdash; between a person in military custody <Col N="1005" /> and a person in prison. In these matters we have to rely on the skill, expertise and experience of the parliamentary draftsman who has felt that a definition of &ldquo;military custody&rdquo; is not necessary in this Act any more than it is necessary in the Offences Against the State Act, 1939.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I have never, and I do not now, cast any aspersions on the skill and experience of the parliamentary draftsman but I reject utterly the Minister's assertion that we have got to rely on the skill and experience of the parliamentary draftsman. If that were the situation which were to be allowed to develop in this Parliament there would be no need whatever for a parliament, there would be no need whatever for discussions on Bills once they were produced by the parliamentary draftsman. The Minister already this day conceded in relation to this Bill in the other House of Parliament that it was produced by the skill and experience of his parliamentary draftsman and was not the kind of Bill which was to go through the Houses of Parliament as finished legislation. We see it already and we had his colleague, who substituted for him, replying to the Second Stage of the Bill in a very generous way singing the praises of an amendment accepted by the Minister for Justice in the Dáil although it was moved by this party.</P>
      <P>Therefore we can dismiss as merely a convenient argument by the Minister &mdash;and it is the sole argument he has made on this of any substance&mdash;the argument that we must rely on the skills and experience of the parliamentary draftsman. I do not care whether the Seanad is abolished or not but I do not see any reason why we should, merely on the <i>obiter dicta</i> of the Minister, regard ourselves as redundant, unnecessary, as drones who serve no useful purpose in looking at legislation. I do not see any reason whatever why the collective wisdom of this House should be so lightly dismissed by the Minister&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It is an insult not merely to this House but to the other House of the Oireachtas as well. The Minister was saying that there is no proof of collective wisdom. Does he mean by that that all the wisdom reposes on the benches which support him in this House or is he going further by saying that there is no wisdom whatever in this House&mdash;that whatever bit of wisdom and enlightenment is brought to this House is only when the Minister steps into a seat, having failed to be here to reply to the Second Stage&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>A mistake which is frequently made by youthful politicians is that every question of who is right and who is wrong is to be decided by a count of heads, by people going like so many well-drilled ballet boys to the division lobbies. That does not settle anything in a situation where a Minister can crack the whip and know that he has a majority. Whether a Minister is made of the right mettle very frequently depends on his ability to listen to the views of a minority as advanced in this House or in the other House of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>That is a fact, and I repeat it. I dealt with the Minister's argument that all we can do is to rely on the skill and experience of parliamentary draftsman. What was the only other argument he put up against this amendment? It is that it is not necessary to define in an Act of Parliament something which is clearly understood and that the term &ldquo;military custody&rdquo; was clearly understood. I wonder would the Minister like to reconsider that, like the invitation extended to me by Senator Ó Maoláin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Has the Minister taken the trouble in relation to this matter, for example, to look up the definition section of the Defence Act of 1954? Is the Minister aware that in that Act a definition is given&mdash;and an extremely good definition&mdash;of what civil custody is? If it was necessary in the Defence Act of 1954 to spell out what civil custody is, is it not equally necessary in a Prisons Act of 1972, which is dealing with the transfer of prisoners to military custody, to <Col N="1008" /> define what we mean by &ldquo;military custody&rdquo;? The Minister thinks that all this can be settled by a count of heads. I would have hoped that the Minister's attitude in relation to the Committee Stage would be, as I suggested when I was speaking on the Second Reading, one of co-operation.</P>
    <P>Whatever the Minister may think about it I certainly do not agree that this House should be so lightly dismissed on a Committee Stage of a Bill no matter how urgent that Bill may be. I would be quite prepared to facilitate the Minister as far as possible. I recognise that he has had a difficult day, that he had to deal with this Bill in the Dáil and that he has to deal with it here. I recognise that we are in somewhat the same situation as we were in relation to the Forcible Entry Bill last summer&mdash;that the Minister does not want to have to return to the Dáil with amendments from this House. I am prepared to meet the situation that the Minister will do his best to avoid having to return to the Dáil. That is not a practical difficulty in the present case because when the Dáil meets tomorrow the Minister can bring before it any amendments which are made by this House and he can still have the Bill signed by tomorrow. That is his target, according to the remarks he made when he was introducing the Bill.</P>
    <P>I hope that the Minister, before this Committee Stage is over, will prove more co-operative in discussing the details of this Bill. I do not want to see the Minister without this Bill. I should like to see the Minister have this Bill signed tomorrow as he wishes, but it is no excuse for us as legislators to be slovenly in our own work. I could well imagine if the Minister were sitting in these benches and a Minister from this party was introducing a Bill without such a vital definition as this in it, repeating with a better vocabulary than I have the arguments I am making. I would ask the Minister to reconsider this matter. Not alone do I not want to deprive him of having the Bill signed tomorrow but I do not want the Minister to be in difficulty if this Bill goes through with this kind of infirmity.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1009" /> I am not being hyper-critical about that, because I am not expressing any particular concern for the Minister himself in the political sense. I have no particular wish to advance the Minister's political future but the reason I do not want to see the Minister in difficulty in relation to this Bill is because if the Minister is in difficulty all the rest of us are too.</P>

I do not know whether Senator O'Higgins realises that what he is suggesting is that by bringing this Bill to the Dáil in the morning everything will be honkey-dory. As far as I can ascertain from the gentlemen in that House, it was agreed that the Bill would be finished there at 3 o'clock today and that we would get it here at 3 o'clock. You know what happened. Things do not always work out in the Dáil in the same way as we work them out in the Seanad. They are much more irregular. I have no confidence whatever in any arrangements the Senator might suggest could be made in the Dáil for an expeditious job in the morning. Therefore I think it much wiser&mdash;a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush&mdash;to stick to the programme we have and finish the Bill tonight so that it can be signed as quickly as possible.</P>

I am afraid I am not about to do that now when I talk of Senator Ó Maoláin's contribution. We seem to have had a third argument added. Let us recap it for the record. The Minister is against this amendment because he thinks it is our duty to rely on the skill and experience of the parliamentary draftsman. He thinks it is unnecessary to write in a definition when the words used in the Bill are in plain language. The third reason advanced by the Leader of the House is that the Leader of the Fianna Fáil Party in the Seanad supporting a Fianna Fáil Minister in the Seanad has no confidence in the Fianna Fáil Party in the Dáil.</P>

      <P>I could not agree more with the Chair. We have a fourth argument now that in the other House they are democrats and, presumably, in this House we are not. These are the arguments which are being advanced against this amendment. I do not want to be facetious in dealing with this; I regard this as a serious Bill. I regard it as a serious flaw in a Bill if the Minister, with his eyes open, and the Senators sitting to his left or behind him, with their eyes open, refuse to accept either this amendment or a ministerial amendment which would provide a definition of &ldquo;military custody&rdquo; and I think the Minister will find himself in difficulties. I may be entirely wrong in that. I am not being insincere when I say that if the Minister <Col N="1011" /> does not accept this amendment or a similar amendment&mdash;I hope I am entirely wrong in the point of view I am advancing but in my judgment I am not wrong&mdash;he may be in difficulties if he does not tie up the loose ends which occur in the Bill at the moment. One of those loose ends is the omission of any definition of &ldquo;military custody&rdquo;. If the Minister wants to take a chance on it I cannot prevent him from doing so. I can merely try to persuade him.</P>
      <P>If the Minister has closed his ears to any argument on this question there is nothing I can do to help him except try to persuade him by the votes of Senators in this House. I am prepared to do that if necessary. I had hoped it would not be necessary because, with all due respect to the views expressed by Senator Jack Fitzgerald, I feel that this Bill, even though it is an emergency Bill, is of such importance that it would do nothing but good for this country that there should be a definite degree of solidarity shown in the approach of the Legislature to the problem with which we are confronted. The Minister's attitude in saying that the matter can be settled by a Division, that we can find out by a Division where the wisdom lies, is a divisive attitude which I do not think will help him or help this House in relation to discussion on either this or other amendments.</P>

      <P>If I thought that Senator O'Higgins was right in thinking <Col N="1012" /> that the Minister would find himself in difficulties by not putting in this definition I would be urging the Minister to accept this amendment. I think, on balance, that the Minister is far more likely to be in difficulties by accepting this amendment than by rejecting it. It is wrong to assume always that giving definitions of every term used in a Bill is necessarily going to improve it or going to help in the interpretation of the Bill. The definition that has been suggested is not much more than a dictionary definition. It explains what military custody means, which could probably be obtained by opening a dictionary. This is not the function of a definition in a Bill. Where the term is one which can be readily understood there is no need to define it and in so far as it is necessary to define it when it comes to interpreting the Bill the court is the proper body to interpret it. By attempting to put in a definition, the Bill is far more likely to meet with difficulties in the future. I see no necessity for it and, on balance, I would be very much against it. There are many things in this Bill and in every other Bill that comes before us which you could attempt to define, but it is a mistake to do so. The tendency in recent times in the drafting of Bills is to leave out definitions and leave it to the court to interpret it.</P>
      <P>There are very special cases where you want to strain a particular phrase or number of words to include something which would not normally be included but this is merely for convenience. To say &ldquo;cattle&rdquo; should include &ldquo;rabbits&rdquo; is merely for convenience but normally definitions are to be avoided if at all possible. I believe in this case that the definition suggested by Senator O'Higgins is more likely to lead to difficulties in the future.</P>

These are all defined, and closely defined, in the Defence Act, 1954.

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In subsection (3) to delete &ldquo;or prison staff&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is put down to cover a point which I dealt with on the Second Stage and which was also dealt with in the Dáil. Amendment No. 2, which is to delete &ldquo;or prison staff&rdquo; in subsection (3), is a repetition of an amendment which was moved in the Dáil and which, I think, was negatived there. Amendment No. 3 is, as the Chair has quite rightly pointed out, an alternative to amendment No. 2. On the Second Stage I made the point that, as I understood it, the basis on which this Bill had become necessary and was being recommended by the Minister to the Houses of the Oireachtas, was because of lack of accommodation by reason of the damage done to Mountjoy Prison. I pointed out that subsection (3) goes a lot further than that. It does not limit the operation of the Bill to lack of accommodation, but it extends it also to insufficiency of prison staff. I queried that and pointed out that, at least in theory, a situation could arise where the Minister had let the prison staff run down. By reason of a shortage created over a period of time, if this Bill is passed in its present form, he could then legitimately say: &ldquo;Now there is insufficient prison staff and I can operate the Prison Act: now I can get so-and-so and so-and-so, who is in Mountjoy or Limerick, transferred to military custody.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I did not suggest on Second Stage&mdash; I think I made this clear&mdash;nor am I suggesting now that the Minister would have any intention of acting in that way. I am just saying that it would be open to him, or to any other Minister who succeeds him, to act in that way if the Bill is left unaltered. I concede that there may be particular instances where a staff shortage arises. In circumstances such as those, I could see that an argument could be fairly made that this also should entitle the Minister to turn for assistance to his colleague, the Minister for Defence. It is because of the reservation which I have in mind, because of the possibility of a sudden emergency happening which <Col N="1015" /> might cause a shortage of prison staff, that I suggest amendment No. 3 as an alternative to amendment No. 2. In relation to subsection (3) this would read:</P>
    <P>If and whenever, at a time when this section is in operation, the Minister is of opinion that prison accommodation or prison staff&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>I would insert after that the following:</P>
    <P>(in the event of a sudden emergency causing a shortage of such staff.)</P>
    <P>In other words, the Minister's entitlement to operate the provisions of this Bill, when it becomes an Act, on grounds of shortage of staff, should be limited to cases where the shortage of staff is caused by a sudden emergency.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is not prepared to delete the reference to prison staff, as I assume he is not by reason of the Dáil discussion, I would ask him to consider, at least, putting the position on the basis proposed in amendment No. 3.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Professor Kelly Professor Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Professor Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I want, briefly, to support the amendment proposed by Senator O'Higgins. It is possible that even if the Minister does not accede to the suggestion that the subsection should be amended, the Ministerial opinion contemplated by the subsection will still be subject to judicial review. As the Minister knows, the courts have recently taken the line that a Ministerial opinion, or any other kind of administrative opinion, must be reasonable. In other words, it would not be open, even on the subsection as it stands, for a Minister simply to form an opinion <i>mala fide</i>, and on the basis of an ostensible opinion about prison staff to operate the powers which this subsection contemplates. It would not be possible for him to do that. I mention that merely in a prudential vein. I think it would be wise for the Minister, if he is able to do so and if it is possible, to accede to Senator O'Higgins's suggestion. I can envisage not this Minister nor his Government, but some future Minister or Government, if this law is still in force, doing what Senator O'Higgins suggests and allowing a prison staff to run down to a point where they cannot control and <Col N="1016" /> could not control the inmates of a prison, and using that as the pretext for transferring them to military custody.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Higgins's amendment is a reasonable one. I recognise that the Government are under pressure and difficulty of a kind which could be measured in hours, but in fairness to Senator O'Higgins's argument I must say that it is a perfectly reasonable one and one which the Minister might accept.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad Senator Kelly made that point, because I have some vague recollection of a decision of that nature. I was not very clear on it. It reinforces what I said in the Dáil this afternoon in relation to these amendments which are basically in the same terms as an amendment which was not passed in the Dáil. As of now, there is a shortage of staff in our prisons and there is also a shortage of accommodation. It would be imprudent not to provide for the eventuality that there might not be a temporary shortage in the two-year life of the Bill. The numbers of staff must be related, first to the size of the prison population and, secondly, to the intensity of security required at any given time. As far as the size of the prison population is concerned, the number of prisoners is increasing and it could easily happen, as envisaged in amendment No. 3, that a steady gradual increase could change a situation from where the number of staff who were sufficient in January would be inadequate by March of the same year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as the intensity of security is concerned, there could be a need for intensification of security at a particular time, or over a particular period, which would involve a severe strain on existing staff in the prison. This would be so even though there was no accommodation problem or no undue or unusual increase in the prison population. There is a further factor in that it is likely that within the period of life of this Bill I will acquire further establishments or institutions for the detention of males over 21 years. These institutions may be on the lines of Lochan House, which I am just about to open at Blacklion, County Cavan, <Col N="1017" /> and also on the lines of Shanganagh Castle, Bray. I am committed to the idea that these small centres&mdash;one might like to describe them as large private houses&mdash;rather than vast impersonal institutions are much better for the treatment of young people. The numbers detained in them should not exceed 40 or 50, if at all possible. When one disperses the prison population in these smaller units around the country, as I am in the process of doing, the demand for staff increase more than <i>pro rata</i> with the increase in population. Obviously, a particular establishment will need a certain basic force to look after it.</P>
    <P>There are certain unavoidable overheads which would be avoidable in a large institution on its own. When these additional institutions are provided&mdash;and I hope more of them will be provided during the next two years &mdash;I will then be in a position of having enough accommodation and, indeed, possibly ample accommodation, but at a given time I might have an insufficient number of staff in all the prisons and similar institutions. For that reason, I would have to insist that these words would stand.</P>

      <P>I want to put one point of view to the Minister. I am somewhat alarmed to learn from the Minister that he apparently envisages a situation where, by reason of the terms of this Bill, he will be able to direct the transfer of prisoners to military custody because there is a gradual decrease in the number of people serving in the prison service. I feel that that militates to a great extent against what I thought was the basic reason for the introduction of this Bill. It is a terrifying prospect to find that what I advanced merely as a possibility was something that had been thought of. I was at some pains to point out that I did not believe the Minister had in mind allowing the prison service to run down but it is something analogous to that that apparently is the argument which is being used by the Minister. He is not allowing the prison service deliberately to run down, but he tells us that there is a gradual decrease, and because of this gradual decrease&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister need not feel a bit prickly about this. I am not suggesting that he is not trying to get prison staff. I heard the Minister speaking on television about the efforts to get increased numbers on the prison staff and I was rather taken aback by my misunderstanding of what the Minister had stated here. I thought he had been making the case that there has been a gradual decrease over the years in prison staff, and that that was the reason why he wanted these words to remain in the Bill. There was no decrease in prison staff and I am glad to learn from the Minister now there has been a substantial increase in the prison staff&mdash;it fortifies my argument and lessens the Minister's argument, if we leave out of account, and we cannot do this, that there is an increase in prison population. I have made a note having regard to what I have already said about the drafting of these amendments. I should be happy if the Minister were to accept amendment No. 3, even if he added in &ldquo;or an increase in prison population&rdquo;, in other words, if the reason for using military custody, not being related to lack of accommodation should be due <Col N="1019" /> to a decrease in prison staff which was caused by a sudden emergency or a sudden increase in prison population.</P>
      <P>If we deal only with the question of a gradual increase in prison population and couple with that the Minister's efforts to increase the prison staff, then a gradual increase in prison population should not justify a direction to transfer to military custody. A sudden increase in prison population might be a justification for implementing the machinery of this Act and I would be happy to have the Minister insert by way of amendment to the amendment a reference to an increase in prison population.</P>

In a case falling within subsections (3) or (5) it might not be inappropriate if the Minister were also to detail in the information which he lays before both Houses what exactly has led him to take this step. In other words, if he were to include along with these details the reasons, namely, lack of accommodation and lack of staff, which have led him to take this step, that would automatically lead to a possible debate in either House on the adequacy of the reasons which the Minister alleged.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4.</P>
      <P>In subsection (3) after &ldquo;aforesaid&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;, being persons on remand or sent forward for trial or sentence,&rdquo; and to delete paragraph (iii).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would not have moved this amendment if I had been convinced that this Bill was simply one to deal with a problem of accommodation following the destruction of part of Mountjoy Prison. Just as the previous amendments, with which I sympathise considerably, dealt with the reasons for the Minister's exercise of a power which is to be given to him under this Bill, the amendment I propose is an attempt to deal with the type of person <Col N="1022" /> who will be affected by the Minister's exercise of the powers to be granted him under this Bill. The effect of my amendment, if accepted, would be to remove from the category of persons in detention and subject to the Minister's wishes in this matter, people who have been sentenced for any crime. Perhaps it is incumbent on me to point out at this stage that if this amendment is accepted by the House there will be a consequential amendment to which my attention has just been attracted in subsection (6) of the same section where the words: &ldquo;and, where appropriate, the sentences&rdquo; would also have to be deleted. In many senses I am not happy with this particular amendment as creating a distinction between classes of prisoners, between, on the one hand, prisoners who are on remand or who are sent forward for trial or sentence and, on the other hand, prisoners who have been convicted by a court of the land. I justify this on the grounds that the Minister's statements since the Bill has been introduced have led me to understand that there are already substantial distinctions being made in the Minister's mind between different categories of prisoners to whom he intends to apply this Bill.</P>
    <P>If I had been convinced that it was simply a matter of finding rooms, beds, locks and keys for individual persons for whom an accommodation problem existed by the destruction of part of Mountjoy I would not have moved this amendment. I brought in this amendment because although the Minister did claim the damage to Mountjoy and the consequental need for extra accommodation as one of his reasons for bringing in this Bill, he also asked for it specifically for two other reasons which are quite different in connotation and which imply a distinction already drawn in the Minister's mind between categories of prisoners.</P>
    <P>The first one I have in mind is when yesterday in the Dáil&mdash;the quotation is from today's <i>Irish Times</i>&mdash;he argued for this power to be given to him on the grounds that he needed to segregate certain violent prisoners from other prisoners. In this evening's <i>Evening Press</i> having mentioned in <Col N="1023" /> the Dáil the damage to accommodation he is quoted as saying:</P>
    <P>Taking into account all these factors and the disturbed state of the country, north and south, as well as the unfortunate likelihood that they would have to hold in custody prisoners of a particularly dangerous kind for the next two years at least the time limit he proposed was the minimum compatible with these factors.</P>
    <P>We have a completely new situation introduced by these two statements of the Minister. He is not just asking for extra accommodation for extra people.</P>
    <P>He is asking for extra accommodation for a particular kind of person, to be more precise, for two particular kinds of person, first, the violent type, secondly, the person whose imprisonment is in some way connected with &ldquo;the disturbed state of the country, north and south&rdquo;. The Minister need not have these distinctions so explicitly if what he had in mind was simply the matter of providing additional accommodation.</P>
    <P>It becomes clear in the light of what he said that what he has in mind will be establishments created to hold specifically these two kinds of prisoners. I believe the Minister is creating these institutions for particular classes of prisoners. I question whether it is right or proper for him to make this class of distinction between prisoners.</P>
    <P>This point was put very cogently by Senator Kelly on the Second Reading.</P>
    <P>I agree wholeheartedly with his analysis of the situation without necessarily agreeing with his suggested remedies. I believe that any prisoner who is convicted of a crime, no matter what he subjectively thinks his crime to have been committed for, is entitled to the full, however inadequate, rehabilitatory services of a normal prison and should not be locked up in what will undoubtedly turn into an Irish equivalent of a maximum security prison with distinct political overtones. I am against creating ghettos of any kind in society.</P>
    <P>Creating a ghetto of this kind for <Col N="1024" /> violent prisoners or those whose crimes carry, at least for them, political overtones is basically a step which can only be successful in the short term. The whole history of this kind of institution, whether it was the concentration camps during the war, or before that the internment camps in which Irishmen were interned and since then the internment camps established in the Curragh by native Irish Governments, shows that these institutions, far from remedying the problems they set out to solve, only provide a reservoir of bitterness, an ideological deepening and a totally unrealistic approach to the basic problems they set out to solve, only provide a reservoir of bitterness, an ideological deepening and a totally unrealistic approach to the basic problem. Karl Mannheim, the German sociologist, has said&mdash;I have used this before but not in reference to the Minister for Justice's Department&mdash;that the fundamental tendency of the bureaucratic mind is to reduce all problems of politics to problems of administration.</P>
    <P>The problem of how we cope with our offenders in society is fundamentally a political one quite irrespective of whether the offenders believe they have or have not any particular political justification for any crimes they may commit. The way we treat our convicted criminals is a very useful indicator of the way in which we believe our society should be run. I am against creating distinctions against prisoners. Alarmed by the distinctions which the Minister already appears to have in his mind, I am proposing that convicted prisoners, that is, people on whom society has already passed judgment, should never be segregated, least of all in terms of their real or supposed violence or political allegiance, because this is the worst possible way of reintegrating them back into society, an aim to which the Minister for Justice has pledged himself.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Professor Kelly Professor Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Professor Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Horgan that no distinctions should be drawn between people convicted of an offence which, so far as the law is concerned, is the same offence based on the motive which induced them to commit it. While I think there should not be a special category here of political prisoner who gets honourable treatment like the <Col N="1025" /> treatment which was given by the German army to an officer who had been guilty of an honourable offence and who was confined to a fortress where he could eat all kinds of good things and drink good wine. That is not what the Irish people want. I would not go along with it.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, I agree with Senator Horgan that there should be no excessive severity towards people because of their political views. This is the point which Senator Horgan has missed in his remarks. The State is perfectly entitled to decide as a matter of discussion which prisoners require more security than others. I see no objection to it. I feel that the governor of a prison or those advisers from the Department of Justice or elsewhere are entitled to make up their own minds and are under a duty to the public to make up their own minds which kind of people require more security and which less.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For example, a man who has been convicted for a bank robbery in which possibly someone has been killed will require supervision of a different kind to that required for, say, a woman who has been sent to prison for living on immoral earnings or soliciting or some such thing. It seems that that is unarguable. Common sense dictates that the Executive should be left with this kind of discretion. This is an element of what Senator Horgan is saying which I believe is valid and which I hope the Minister will bear in mind. He was not here when I was making the same point in another context earlier, that is, if the military custody were used not just as a custodial measure but as a penal measure against specified prisoners, then it would be objectionable. In other words, there could be no objection, legal, political or any other kind, not in my view anyway, to subjecting a particular class of prisoner to an extremely close guard. I would have no objection to that. If the form of custody to which he is subjected has dimensions which could be described as penal and going beyond the imprisonment to which a judge has sentenced him, then it is not just objectionable but illegal. From the constitutional point of view, there <Col N="1026" /> is a core of truth in what Senator Horgan says. I have not introduced it into an amendment, because I thought it would be sufficient to express the view here so that the Minister and his advisers could listen to it. Any operation of this Bill, when it becomes law, which can be represented reasonably as conferring on the Minister or on any executive authority the power to intensify or make harsher the punishment which the court has awarded is probably invalid. To that extent, Senator Horgan's point is correct. I only want to draw the distinction in the case of the arguments that are being put forward between security&mdash;in which respect the State has a perfectly legitimate discretion to decide, putting it metaphorically or in the figurative sense, the thickness of the wall or the strength of the bars&mdash;on one hand, and the severity of the regime, on the other. But the State has not the power to select&mdash;and I am afraid the Minister, and I do not mean this Minister but some Minister, might feel he had such power under this Bill&mdash;to select prisoners to whom he was going to give the thick end of the stick to by sending them down to the Curragh. That is something which I believe, in the case of a convicted prisoner to whom sentence has been awarded by an ordinary judge, would be illegal. I hope that even if the Minister does not accept Senator Horgan's amendment, he will bear that in mind.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NevilleKeery" hpid="Mr. Keery Mr. Keery">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keery</NameTxt>
      <P>While there may be some general attraction about the views of Karl Mannheim quoted by Senator Horgan, they are in no way applicable to the contents of the Bill before us or, indeed, to the particular circumstances in which we are dealing with this legislation. The assumption behind what Senator Horgan and a few other people had to say, whether as anonymous senior counsel on television or in another House of Parliament, is that somewhere in this Bill the Minister is given power to be selective in treating prisoners or people on their way to prison in a way which would be more severe than under normal, existing legislation. My view is that the Minister is given no such power under this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1027" /> It is quite clear, for example, that the normal procedure regarding visiting committees will apply to places where the persons may be kept in military custody, and, indeed, the regulations which the Minister for Defence will be obliged to make under this legislation shall correspond to the normal prison rules. That is quite clear in this Bill and it is nonsense to claim that the Minister is in any way given power to mete out more severe treatment than might otherwise be given to ordinary prisoners, whatever claims they may make as to their status.</P>
    <P>One other thing that staggered me about what Senator Horgan had to say in his opening remarks and in his contribution to the discussion of an amendment is the insinuation he makes that somehow the damage to Mountjoy Jail has not been as severe as people think and that some kind of &ldquo;fudging&rdquo; may be going on. He quoted <i>The Irish Times</i> as chapter and verse for his own remarks. May I say to Senator Horgan that one of the gentlemen on the roof of Mountjoy was quoted in <i>The Irish Times</i> as saying:</P>
    <P>There is no prison left. It is gone inside and there will be no walls left unless we get our conditions by tomorrow morning.</P>
    <P>That is the sort of person with whom we have to contend in passing this legislation and in dealing with this present emergency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not doubt that the information is there. I felt there should be more information there for the Minister to be more specific. I mentioned two points in my opening remarks, first, the vagueness of the statistics and the assertion that the prison was almost totally destroyed, coupled with what I believe to be a fact, that the majority of the prisoners who were there before the riot are still there. This seemed to be not incapable of explanation but certainly in need of an explanation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to make one further point in support of my amendment which would have the effect of separating from prisoners who have already been sentenced prisoners who have not <Col N="1028" /> been sentenced and who may be on remand. It has been one of the oldest cries of the prison reform movement in this country that considerable problems are caused by the extent to which prisoners on remand, who may in very many cases be innocent of the crimes with which they are charged, have occasion to mix with the old age, with prisoners who have been convicted.</P>
    <P>Under the kind of scheme I am envisaging, assuming it is necessary, the pressure on the prison system would be relieved precisely by siphoning off these people who in many cases, as I say, may be totally innocent of the charges which are being preferred against them and perhaps putting them under military control as a sort of stopgap measure in a city institution. There are plenty of barracks in our cities which, I am quite sure, could be converted to the kind of accommodation the Minister has in mind with very much less trouble than will be involved in providing accommodation at the Curragh. It would have the advantage for prisoners on remand that it would not in any way seriously affect their accessibility for members of their family and so on.</P>
    <P>Senator Keery and Senator Kelly have spoken basically on the same point. Senator Keery specifically said that nowhere in the Bill could he see the Minister being given the power to be selective in his choice of prisoners who are being subjected to a different sort of treatment.</P>
    <P>This is a point to which Senator Kelly adverted as well. To a certain extent my point is not about whether prisoners who are transferred under this Bill are treated worse or better or treated the same; my point is that the Minister in choosing these people has to be selective. He has already given us an indication of his mind in that he is going to select specifically two kinds of prisoners. It is very bad from the penal point of view that prisoners of this kind should be segregated in ghettos, and I believe that it is a shortterm solution.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotHonan" hpid="Mr. Honan Mr. Honan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I am speaking from my own experience because the inference has been that if you go into military custody it is like sending you to Siberia. My experience is that in the Curragh or any of the other places where people are put under arrest they get infinitely better treatment in military custody than they get in the civil prisons because they have not got the room there to deal with them. I am not prepared to subscribe to the idea that if you put people under military custody they are under inferior people, that they will be treated worst. They have many advantages that they would not have in a civil prison. I know that from experience. The idea seems to be running through this debate that if somebody is put into military custody he will be subjected to regulations that do not exist in civil prisons. My experience is the opposite. Most people who go into military custody are respected. They are judged entirely by their own conduct and they get facilities that could never be made available to them in civil prisons because the room is not there to do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are over-alarming ourselves in thinking that if people are sent to a military detention area they, of necessity, will be worse off than if they were sent to a civil prison. My experience tells me they are much better off. They are better looked after and have more freedom. It depends on themselves what their code of conduct is. In civil prisons there is overcrowding which you have not got in military detention. From my experience of speaking to people who were there they would much prefer to be under military detention than to be confined in a place <Col N="1030" /> like only one of the State prisons. I would say that if they had a choice they would elect to go to a military prison.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that on that description the Senator's definition would not have done anyway. Amendment No. 4 seems to be a remarkable one. I would have found it more understandable if it had been the other way around and if it were suggested that convicted prisoners only might be put in military custody, although one could doubt it after Senator Honan's description.</P>
      <P>I take it that Senator Horgan's views are that military custody is less desirable than civil custody. If that is so, and I assume it is, it seems remarkable that somebody who is convicted of an offence should have an easier place of confinement or regime, as is believed by Senator Horgan in the argument, than somebody who, potentially at least, is innocent. Indeed, I suppose some people who are on remand are innocent and, indeed, one must assume until such time as they are convicted that they are all innocent. It seems remarkable, therefore, to seek to have this done because if one tried to take care of dangerous prisoners and if one felt that one could hold dangerous prisoners more securely in military custody than in civil custody, as a general rule convicted prisoners would be likely to be more dangerous. Of course, the numbers of convicted prisoners in our prisons greatly exceeds the number of unconvicted, which is another factor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, while frankly I do not think there is anything to recommend the amendment itself it does give rise to a discussion of problems generally associated with it. The first thing that was suggested by the mover of the <Col N="1031" /> amendment was that in some way I was categorising prisoners or dividing them into groups. Senator Horgan said this should not be done. I see his argument even though I do not necessarily agree with it. The categories into which I was alleged to have divided them were in fact categories that I went to great pain not to divide them into. Certain elements in society try to impress on us or have us believe that there is such a thing as a political prisoner in Ireland today. Some of these spokesmen, with addresses in two places in the city of Dublin, scream and roar about political prisoners on the one hand and what they call ordinary criminals on the other hand.</P>
    <P>As far as I am concerned everyone who is convicted of a criminal offence and is in our prisons is a criminal, a criminal full-stop, without any adjectives. I have consistently refused, notwithstanding the exhortations of all these people, to adopt the terminology which they use and which is repeated very widely throughout the papers, to the extent now that even the inverted commas which were used about them at one time have been dropped. It is almost accepted now, unfortunately, in some quarters at any rate, in the alleged validity of this claim for something to be categorised specially as different from the ordinary run of criminal. I am very tempted possibly to categorise them by saying that they are worse than the ordinary run of criminal, but I would be defeating my own argument. Therefore, I will not pursue the matter.</P>
    <P>So far as the sending of people to military custody under this Bill is concerned, I do not recognise categories of the type which Senator Horgan has in mind and I will not categorise them in that way. Senator Fitzgerald categorises them in a certain way, too, and feels that a certain type of prisoner should be sent to the Curragh in military detention. In other words, he argues quite the opposite to Senator Horgan. I am afraid I cannot agree with him on that point. I have not made up my mind who is going to the Curragh or even what type of prisoner. I will decide that tomorrow when the <Col N="1032" /> Bill is passed. Certainly, I will not be picking out any of the kind of categories which have been indicated because I do not recognise them as such.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding what Senator Honan has said and in reply to the points very well made by Senator Kelly, I must point out that under existing regulations and for many years past in our prisons one has to separate prisoners from one another in a certain way, to separate different types of prisoners. We have various prisons and the atmosphere in these prisons differs also. Generally speaking the &ldquo;regime&rdquo;, in its true meaning, is different. It is clearly, in practice, more severe in some than it is in others. Notwithstanding that, my predecessors and myself have had power for many years to transfer prisoners from one prison to another. If a prisoner in Limerick Prison is transferred to Portlaoise, he may feel, as most prisoners would, that he is less well off. That power has been recognised in decisions for a long time. There are dozens of these cases every year. I have elaborate powers of transfer, including powers of transfer to Shanganagh Castle from a prison or from St. Patrick's Institution.</P>
    <P>Senator Kelly makes the point that the court, in imposing a sentence, had a particular type of institution and regime in mind but that the offender might be sent to a different type of institution under a different type of regime. My reply to that is that that happens every day of the week. We often have a boy in St. Patrick's and it can be assessed very quickly, usually less than a week, that he is the type of individual who would benefit from Shanganagh Castle. Shanganagh Castle is a completely open institution. There are no locks or bolts, you come and go and walk around as and when you wish. It has a very free and easy atmosphere; undoubtedly it is a very pleasant place. On the other hand St. Patrick's Institution was unfortunately originally built as a prison and we must recognise the fact that it is still basically a prison. A particular boy may have been sent by the court to St. Patrick's but he may spend nine-tenths or more of his period of detention in Shanganagh. One cannot comtenth <Col N="1033" /> plain about that. If it happens the other way around, as occurs quite frequently, that a boy is sentenced to detention in St. Patrick's but that he is very difficult to manage, as many of them are, and is having a bad influence on other young boys there&mdash;they are under 16&mdash;then I can transfer him to Mountjoy Prison. That transfer was tested in the courts many times and was found quite valid. It is recognised in legislation. That legislation is on much the same enabling lines as this legislation we are now considering.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, a court sentences a person to a term of imprisonment. If he is a fairly long-term prisoner&mdash; six months or more&mdash;and the welfare officer in the prison concerned can get him a job, provided he is regarded as a reliable type of prisoner I regularly allow him daily release to employment a month or two before his sentence ends. I may allow him full temporary release to employment for the last few weeks before his sentence ends in order to assist in his rehabilitation. I give these examples to show that there are many instances where the custody or type of sentence which is actually served by a person sentenced by a court may be quite different&mdash;a lot better or a lot worse&mdash;than what the court had ordered. The validity of these transfers has been tested many times and has not been found wanting.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Professor Kelly Professor Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Professor Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to hold the House up with this. What the Minister says about the validity of transfer regulations or statutory provisions is quite true. It was decided by the Supreme Court eight years ago that the rules which permitted the Minister to transfer people from one prison to another were valid. I realise that you cannot expect one prison to be just the same as another in all aspects. I can well imagine a certain hierarchy of preference going up between the four different prisons and the State. That is not really the point I was making. I simply want to impress on the Minister and his advisers this point, that while it is within his powers to order the transfer of a prisoner from one prison to another for reasons of rehabilitation or <Col N="1034" /> security, what is not within his powers &mdash;I am absolutely certain of this&mdash;is to order such a transfer for a punitive reason existing in his own mind. That is definitely not within his powers. I am sure the Minister has not made such a transfer nor has it in mind, but I wish to be on record, since I am not putting an amendment down to this effect, as having made it clear that&mdash;in my opinion at any rate&mdash;that if the power which the Minister is getting this evening is to be used not by this Minister but by any Minister in such a way as to allow him to subject specific prisoners, for reasons which are basically punitive, to a tougher regime than they otherwise would be subject to, the matter would become invalid. That is the only point I wanted to make. The function of inflicting punishment is a judicial function and not a ministerial one.</P>

      <P>The Minister's remarks in response to the moving of this amendment were very interesting and I listened to them with great care. I should like to point out to him that the thrust of my argument on this amendment is quite different from that of Senator Kelly. I am making no judgment, no assumption, of any description about the quality or otherwise of military detention as opposed to the quality of civil detention. This is a separate argument of which I have no experience and I believe, in the circumstances, we have to wait and see. I am making an assumption, based on what the Minister said in the Dáil yesterday and today, about persons who are destined for military custody. The Minister has said that he has not made up his mind about the kind of persons we will have to confine to military custody but it seemed to me from his speeches that he had.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are basically two problems here. First of all, there is the overall accommodation problem caused by the <Col N="1035" /> damage done to Mountjoy Prison. The second problem is what to do with the &ldquo;baddies&rdquo;. I believe that these two problems, which are essentially separate problems, have been confused in this Bill and in this debate. It seems to me that the work of rehabilitation and prison control is carried on at two levels simultaneously. There is the control level and there is the rehabilitation level. Obviously there must be some of both. It has been my view that in our prisons the control element has in the past been stressed too much and the rehabilitation element has been stressed too little. I know this must be a great problem for any Minister for Justice and for any Department of Justice. What I am saying about it is a valued judgment but I give it for what it is worth.</P>
    <P>When it comes to the suggestion, which I believe is an underlying suggestion, behind this Bill that a particular institution&mdash;for the purpose of my argument I do not care whether it is controlled by the military, the Garda, traffic wardens or anyone else&mdash;should be set up for the treatment of prisoners who are adjudged to be particularly violent or whose crimes have been in some way linked to what the Minister has described as the disturbed state of the country, North and South there is an educational analogy here which I believe is quite relevant. If you tell children that they are bad, stupid and unintelligent they will most likely end up by being bad, stupid or unintelligent whether or not they are objectively so. Very often judgments about whether children are intelligent or unintelligent are made in a totally unverifiable and unjustifiable way.</P>
    <P>Senator Kelly made some distinctions in a sense when he talked about the difference between the woman who might be in prison for soliciting and some other person who might be in for some serious bank robbery crime involving violence. It can be a facade to categorise persons in terms of the treatment they need simply in terms of the crimes they have committed. There is the chance, in what has been said in the Dáil, and it is one I am concerned that the Minister should not adopt, of <Col N="1036" /> locking up all the &ldquo;baddies&rdquo; in one spot. It will solve the problems of society but I doubt very much if it will solve the problems of the &ldquo;baddies&rdquo; and it may very well intensify them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to clarify what I said. I said what Senator Horgan quoted me as saying as being one of the factors we have to take into account here. I said that we have an accommodation problem and we also have violent men in our prisons. We have a serious situation in the country, North and South. I said that we, therefore, had to open the Curragh but Senator Horgan has read a further sentence into that which I never uttered which, in fact, was that therefore, all these violent men and troublemakers North and South have to go to the Curragh and consequently all the &ldquo;baddies&rdquo; are now in the Curragh. That is not so nor will it be so. I do not intend it to be like that. In any event the worst of the &ldquo;baddies&rdquo; are neither in Mountjoy nor the Curragh. They are in some other place, and by that I do not mean the Dáil.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 3, subsection (6), to insert after the words in brackets the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;, the place of detention&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister will recall that I referred to this matter on the Second Stage discussion. In subsection (6) the Minister has, I think very fairly&mdash;I conceded this on the Second Reading discussion&mdash;brought into this Bill a provision which requires him to lay before each House of the Oireachtas a statement with regard to people who have been transferred to military custody specifying the names of those <Col N="1037" /> people and the offence or offences with which they have been charged and, where appropriate, the sentences which have been imposed.</P>
    <P>I believe, it is also necessary for the Minister to specify in the particulars which he lays before each House of the Oireachtas the place of detention to which the named persons have been sent. I should imagine that it was merely an oversight that this was not included in the particulars in the first instance. It was probably assumed by the Minister or the skilled and experienced parliamentary draftsman to to whom he referred, that there would only be one place of detention, namely, the Curragh.</P>
    <P>The Curragh is not mentioned in this Bill notwithstanding the reported reference of the Tánaiste to this as being the Curragh detention Bill. It is open to the Minister whoever he may be, to order a transfer to military custody and the military custody could be anywhere. I think it is common knowledge that there has been, from time to time, very serious concern which at times amounted to a public outcry, about a situation in the North of Ireland where sufficient information was not given to relatives, legal advisers, and so on as to where prisoners were located.</P>
    <P>From the point of view of practical politics, apart from anything else, it would be a disaster if a situation were to develop under this Bill, where the Minister, because he is not obliged to do so, does not give the information to the Houses of the Oireachtas as to where any particular prisoner, who has been transferred to military custody, has been detained.</P>

      <P>I am glad I have got someone to agree with me. Maybe I shall have some luck with the Minister, now. This certainly will not weaken the Minister's Bill in any way. I should imagine that the Minister's intention is that this information will be given, except the situation is that there is a general announcement that there is only one such place. Then it can be properly assumed that anyone who has been transferred to military custody will be in that place. So far as the practical effect of the Bill at the moment is concerned, there could be any number of places where a person could be detained in military custody. The Minister is not obliged to say where those places are: He is not obliged to say where any particular prisoner is, under the information which he is required to give under subsection (6).</P>

I wonder if the Minister would agree to meet the point which Senator O'Higgins very rightly raises in some other way. Senator O'Higgins is probably right in saying that this is only an oversight. I do not want to blame the Minister or his Department for this, because they are doing something in haste. I believe that it is an <Col N="1039" /> oversight, and that if anyone in his Department or in the Dáil had spotted this lacuna in the Bill, it would have been set right earlier today. The Minister may not wish to go back to the Dáil now.</P>

      <P>Yes. Subsection (11) requires regulations made under section 2 to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas. I am now suggesting to the Minister that if he could ensure that the Minister for Defence, in making regulations under subsection (9), which are supposed to correspond to the rules&mdash;I presume, the 1947 rules&mdash; would provide that the prisoner's friends and legal advisers would know where he was, it would go some distance to meet Senator O'Higgins's point.</P>
      <P>I do not see anything in subsection (6) about it. The direction there is a direction under subsections (3) or (5) and these directions are contained in sections which do not specify to whom the direction is to issue. In other words, it is not required to be published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> or anywhere else. I am not trying to pick stupid holes in this. It is late and we all want to get it finished. The direction contemplated by these subsections seems to me to be a direction with the sense of the Act, if it merely issues to the governor of the prison from which the man is to be transferred and is then shown to the commandant of the barracks to which he is being brought.</P>

      <P>I have the relevant rules in regard to the conduct of prisoners. I think they are the 1947 rules. The rules relating to visits and communications certainly allow a prisoner to communicate but they do not require anybody to communicate on his behalf with anybody in particular. They do not require the governor or anybody else to let anybody in particular know where he is. I accept that the Minister is in good faith about this.</P>
      <P>What he has said about the Minister for Defence nominating one place only is fine, but from looking at this particular point for the first time I am not sure that the Minister for Defence or the Minister now in the House could be outside the powers of the Act if the Curragh suddenly filled up and there was a riot in the Curragh and they broke all the beds, the dental and laundry equipment and so on and they all had to be removed to other military establishments, say in Templemore, or in Ballina. I am not sure that it would be outside the powers of the Minister for Defence to keep them in out of the way stations of that kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although I accept that the Minister intends that only one place will be used, in the regulations which he is speaking about I am not satisfied that the Minister is obliged to contain persons in military custody only in places for which regulations have <Col N="1043" /> already been made specifying where they are to be held. I do not want to bother the Minister or the House by raising foolish points. It is not a foolish point. Senator O'Higgins's point is a substantial one going right to the root of a citizen's constitutional rights. It is a pompous phrase often abused. I believe that in whatever shape or form the Minister chooses to examine the matter he will be doing himself and his successors, of whichever political colour, a disservice unless he bears Senator O'Higgins's objection in mind and has it seen to in whatever regulations are made under this Bill even if he will not accept this amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>To add to subsection (8) the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;and shall provide that the person in charge of the place of detention shall be an officer holding the rank of commandant or a higher rank&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1044" /> This point is also of importance. There is an error in the drafting of the amendment because the reference is to the Bill as introduced first. The reference in this amendment should be to subsection (9) of the roneoed copy of the Bill we received. This is in relation to the regulations to be made by the Minister for Defence. The position under subsection (9) is that the Minister is required to make regulations in relation to the places, and the manner generally in which persons in military custody should be kept in custody. There is a requirement that such regulation shall correspond to the rules for the time being in force under the Prisons Act. This whole subsection replaces the earlier proposal in subsection (8) of the Bill as introduced, which was much too lose in that it required the Minister for Defence to have regard only to the desirability of ensuring that the conditions in military custody would not be less favourable.</P>
    <P>The present wording of subsection (9) is a considerable advance on that. It does not require the Minister for Defence, in the making of his regulations, to ensure that the person to be in charge of the place of detention will be a person who would be regarded as a responsible person by reason of the rank which he has achieved. I am certain the actual position will be that whoever is put in charge of the place of detention will be a responsible officer. There is nothing in the Act to oblige the Minister for Defence to provide for that and I am suggesting in this amendment that we should add to the subsection which spells out the requirements to be included in the regulations to be made by the Minister that these regulations should provide that the person in charge of the place of detention should be an officer holding the rank of commandant or a higher rank. There will be public confidence if there is no question or no danger of a person who lacks experience for example or who might by reason of junior status not be regarded by the public as a person of sufficient responsibility to be put in charge of an establishment of that kind.</P>
    <P>The Minister may reply that this is covered in the regulations which have <Col N="1045" /> been made. If that is so, I will have to accept that position and I will be glad to know that it is covered. However, it would be preferable that it should be written into the Bill and that there should be no suggestion that there might be any danger of a person who has not sufficient weight or experience being put in charge of prisoners transferred into military custody.</P>

      <P>No one can accuse Senator Crinion of having taken up too much of the time of the House on this serious discussion, but this last minute intervention by him will be an eye-opener to the Minister. I have no doubt that the Minister has read this Bill carefully and knows its contents and has failed to find any such requirement as seems to be common sense to Senator Crinion. There is no requirement in this Bill for the place of military custody to be the Curragh. Even if we assume that the place of detention in military custody is to be the Curragh, there is no requirement <Col N="1046" /> at all in this Bill for the officer in charge to be an officer of senior rank. He could be a corporal in the FCA.</P>

      <P>If Senator Crinion keeps this up there is great danger that in the debate on the next section the Minister will have to specify this House as a prison because we are likely to be here for some time. I anticipate that the regulations which will be made will make a provision of this sort. It is essential to understand in relation to this matter that we are not concerned with the present military establishment in any particular barracks. We are not concerned with what ordinarily is the position in relation to the Curragh or any other barracks. We are concerned here with specific regulations which the Minister for Defence will be obliged to make by virtue of this Act. We are not concerned with any regulations he may make under the Defence Act, 1954, or any Act bar the Prisons Act, 1972. I am concerning myself purely with the regulations which the Minister for Defence will have to make under section 2 (9) of this Bill.</P>
      <P>This subsection is imposing on the Minister for Defence the obligation to make regulations in relation to the places and the manner generally in which persons in military custody shall be kept in custody. It would be open to the Minister, under these regulations, having regard to the fact that the regulations will relate to the place of custody, to say that a corporal in the military police shall be in charge of the establishment. I am not suggesting that he would do it and I am not basing my case on that. I am basing it on the need, as I see it, for the Minister to establish confidence in what is being done by this Bill and what will be done under these regulations.</P>

It seems to me to be much more vital in the interests of those who will be in custody in that place that they get breakfast, dinner and tea every day. The Minister for Defence will have to specify in his regulations under subsection (9) of this section that they will get three meals every day. I think that is vitally important, but we are not asked to write that into an Act of Parliament in case the Minister and his advisers would forget it. Senators opposite expect us to believe that a corporal will be in charge of the barracks.</P>

We do not need to spell out that the prisoners will get their breakfast, dinner and tea. What we are spelling out in this subsection is that the regulations which the Minister for Defence must make will correspond to the rules for the time being in force under the Prisons Acts from 1826 to 1970 governing the treatment, employment and control of persons in prison.</P>

    <P>I do not know if the Minister would wish me at this hour to look up and quote <i>in extenso</i> the prison regulations.

      <P>I have a few questions to put to the Minister on the section. He has made considerable play of the possibility of <i>habeas corpus</i> proceedings being brought unless this section legalises the present situation. Would he care to express his view on the possibility of actions for illegal detention being brought after the passing of this Bill, in the absence of any retrospective section to this Bill?</P>
      <P>I should also like to hear his views in relation to the status of prisoners who will be confined under it, either to actions which may be taken against them arising from activities they have been involved in while in custody or actions they may care to take against the people who are detaining them. Will these actions be taken under military law or in the civil courts? I am also concerned to know what relevance the Minister thinks the disturbed state of the country, North and South, has to the Bill. Am I correct in assuming that he foresees, because of this disturbed state North and South, a large increase in the prison population?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two matters I should like to deal with on the section, mainly for purposes of clarification, although there is some procedural importance in dealing with these matters on Committee if it is proposed to put down amendments on Report Stage. I should like to ask the Minister is there any particular importance in providing at the beginning of section 2 that this section shall continue in operation for a limited time until 31st May, 1974? This was the amendment put in by the Dáil. Am I correct in assuming that effectively that means the Bill&mdash;that no particular <Col N="1050" /> importance is to be attached to the fact that the time limit which the Minister has written into the Bill relates only to section 2?</P>
      <P>On this question of military custody, the flesh and bones of the Bill are contained in section 2, but I wonder if any importance can be attached from the Minister's point of view to a situation where the Bill as a whole remains law, with the exception of section 2, after 31st May, 1974. Is there any importance in continuing in operation, say, sections 3 and 4? I assume there is not and if so I should have thought that what the Minister might have done would have been to provide that the entire Act would continue in operation until 31st May, 1974, and not only a particular section of the Act. The second point I wish to raise is in relation to subsection (5). This provides</P>
      <P>The Minister&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) may, at any time, direct the transfer to a prison of a person in military custody pursuant to this section, and</P>
      <P>(b) shall direct the transfer to a prison of all persons in military custody as aforesaid if he is of opinion that circumstances warranting their being retained in military custody no longer obtain,</P>
      <P>and, if a direction under this subsection is given, thereupon any person concerned shall be transferred to a prison.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Paragraph (a) of subsection (5) is discretionary in that the Minister may at any time transfer back to a prison or transfer for the first time to a prison a person who is in military custody. Paragraph (b) of subsection (5) is mandatory. It sets out when the Minister must transfer to a prison all persons in military custody. Possibly my query is not entirely a fair one but I am wondering if the precedent is that a matter of this sort should depend entirely on the opinion of the Minister. If a situation arises when there is some other Minister there, then it is clear to everyone that the situation which warranted the transfer to military custody no longer exists. If the Minister refuses to act on it, is there any remedy open to the persons who are in custody? Can <Col N="1051" /> they, for example, by <i>mandamus</i> procedure force the Minister to act? If there is no remedy open, it would seem to me that this matter might be looked at again by the Minister.</P>
    <P>If we take the example where the position is reasonably clearcut but a Minister nevertheless refuses to act, it seems to me to be preferable that it should not depend entirely on the Minister's opinion, but that there should be some provision for the matter being reviewed, say, by the court.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Of the five questions which I have been asked, four seek legal advice. I wonder am I the one to give it. Even if I were, I wonder should I. To take Senator O'Higgins's last point, presumably the two steps open are either <i>mandamus</i> by the prisoners themselves, or the moving of a motion in the Dáil to take the section out of effect&mdash;a motion under subsection (2) of the section.</P>

      <P>The only effect will be to keep section 3 in force, but section 3 is not of any great significance if it is not connected with section 2. Section 3 is there to remove doubts which result from vagueness in one of the sections in the 1877 Act which is more or less the basic Act. For that reason, it would be desirable that section 3 should remain in effect.</P>

Senator Keery gave some of the choice quotations that came from Mountjoy that night. There were many others. Those quotations were not all just verbal.
