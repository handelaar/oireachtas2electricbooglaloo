The Whips might possibly discuss the situation in regard to that motion today, in view of the announcement made in the other House that it is proposed to take a referendum on this subject in the autumn.  A number of Senators may feel that in those circumstances there is not much point in discussing this motion tomorrow.  At this stage I should like to suggest that <Col N="678" /> we might discuss it during the day in order to ascertain the general view.</P>

    <Title>Secondary Teachers' Superannuation (Amendment) Scheme, 1972: Motion.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan2" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That the Secondary Teachers' Superannuation (Amendment) Scheme 1972, prepared by the Minister for Education with the consent of the Minister for Finance under the Teachers' Superannuation Act, 1928, and laid before the House on the 11th February, 1972, be confirmed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Minister for Education (Mr. Faulkner) Padraig Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Faulkner)</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment of the Secondary Teachers' Superannuation Scheme provides for three separate items.</P>
      <P>Firstly, it provides that the period of the secondary teachers' strike in February, 1969, may be regarded as pensionable service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, as the existing scheme does <Col N="679" /> not provide specifically for allowances other than those paid for instruction given through the medium of Irish and for the honours qualification allowance, it is necessary to amend the scheme to make provision for all pensionable allowances.  The other allowances to be covered are: the allowance for teaching in the Gaeltacht, the allowances for pass qualifications, masters and doctors degrees, the special functions allowances, and allowances for posts of responsibility.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, the school or basic salary was amended by agreement with all parties concerned from £200 to £400 with effect from 1st July, 1968.  Therefore, it is necessary to amend the definition in the scheme from £200 to £400.</P>
    <P>Níl aon ceist ann nach mbeidh fáilte ag Seanadóirí roimh an dtairiscint seo.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to be very brief.  I agree with what the Minister has said: that this is an enabling instrument which clears up an anomaly in the Secondary Teachers' Superannuation Scheme.</P>
      <P>In welcoming it as far as it goes, I should like to draw the Minister's attention, although I am sure he is already well aware of this, to a number of other anomalies which are particularly relevant here.  This instrument provides that the break in teaching service of a very specified time, that relating to a teachers' strike, shall not infringe a secondary teacher's pension right.  I should like to ask the Minister if he is aware that, as far as I know, there are other teachers whose secondary teaching service has been broken for other reasons and whose pension position has been impaired thereby, and to ask him if he would consider extending a scheme like this to cover such cases, which he could very easily do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not believe that there are very many people involved.  The causes of their break in service are disparate.  As far as I know, one person had a break in teaching service caused by the fact that he was interned in 1921.  Other persons had breaks in teaching service caused by the fact that they were employed <Col N="680" /> in the teaching profession at a time when peremptory and arbitrary dismissals were very much more common that they are nowadays.  It seems to me that there is not a vast amount of money involved here, and the number of people involved is probably very small.  I should be glad if the Minister could assure us that he is <i>ad idem</i> on this and that he would view this kind of situation favourably.</P>
    <P>The final point I want to make is a plea to the Minister to look favourably into the greatest single anomaly of all in the superannuation amendment scheme, which is the lack of parity for secondary teachers in respect of their pension entitlement.  A secondary teacher who left the service before 1968 will be getting between £200 and £300 less than a secondary teacher leaving the service this year.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister would agree that this is not fair.  There are many people who have given a lifetime of service to the teaching profession and who now, at the age of 65 or older, are forced into jobs in their retirement in order to eke out on this meagre pension.  I would ask the Minister to look at this very favourably.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>We can welcome what is provided here.  It is little and late, but it is better late than never.  I hope in the future that the superannuation for teaching bodies in general will be moved into much closer relationship to the Civil Service and other Government schemes than it has been and that we will not have this lagging behind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One thing that worries me a bit is that it says here it is necessary to amend the definition in the scheme from £200 to £400 to take account of the element in the salary, that is the basic salary, paid by the school.  Surely the £400 is already three years out of date?  Why write an out of date figure into this superannuation?  Why not leave the superannuation figure flexible so that it will apply to whatever figure is agreed on for the basic salary?  It seems extraordinary that we have this section of public servants, who are doing an excellent job and doing it very devotedly and wholeheartedly, yet <Col N="681" /> we find the basic element of their salary, which was £400 four years ago, is still at £400, whereas the salary of everybody else in the Minister's Department, from the secretary down, has already been increased at least 30 per cent in the intervening period to take account of the very sharp inflation we have had in the past number of years. The schools cannot pay more at present because the capitation grant, from which the schools pay this meagre sum, has not been brought into line.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand the lack of social justice that seems to permeate many of our dealings with outside bodies.  I should have thought that, where adjustments are made by means of general wage increases and wage rounds to all the various categories of employees, it would not be necessary for me to get up here in Seanad Éireann or anywhere else to urge justice.  A sum of £400, which was paid four years ago, is surely not just today. It needs to be increased by at least 30 per cent.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand why our secondary schools should be penalised in this way.  We are getting remarkable value from our secondary schools, where the cost per pupil is much less than in any other branch of education. It is at least 40 per cent under the cost per pupil in the vocational education system.  I am not saying for one moment that is too high; in fact, it is too low.  But this serves to show how inadequate what we are giving is.  In our secondary school structure we are simply capitalising on the devoted service by many of the religious who keep the system going by ploughing back their salaries.  I do not think that is good enough in the structure of today and I hope that I will not have to get up again in Seanad Éireann after the Budget and make the case that this figure of £400 is four years out of date, that a capitation grant for secondary schools is four years out of date.  I call for elementary social justice for all.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liomsa fáilte a chur roimh an scéim seo.  Níl mé chun mórán a rá ach go bhfuil áthas orm go ndéanann sé socrú gur féidir stailc na meánmhúinteoirí i mí <Col N="682" /> Feabhra, 1969, a mheas mar sheirbhís inphinsin.  Bhí mé fhéin páirteach sa stailc sin.  Ní raibh áthas ar bith ar aon duine bheith ar an stailc sin agus. buíochas le Dia, tá sé sin imithe agus tá tréimhse nua, is dóigh liom, ins na cúrsaí oideachas seo tagtha agus tá a lán den bhuiochas sin ag dul don Aire thar aon duine eile agus dos na heagraíochtaí uilig.  Tá áthas orm go bhfuil i bhfad níos mó comhoibriú ar siúl agus i bhfad níos mó dea-mhéine idir na heagraíochtaí uilig atá ag plé leis na cúrsaí múinteoireachta ar fad. An Seanadóir a labhair romham bhí sé ag caint at an mbuntuarastal a bheith ardaithe.  Bhí sé ag caint mar gheall ar £400 punt.  Nuair a thosaigh mé féin ag múineadh, ní bhfuair mé ach £200 buntuarastal sa chéad bhliain.  Caithfidh mé a admháil go bhfuil feabhas an-mhór tagatha ar chúrsaí pá na múinteoirí i gcoitinne. Dar ndóigh, níl ansin ach an méid atá tuillte ag na múinteoirí.  Is gairm í an mhúinteoireacht a éilíonn dian obair ó na daoine a cleachtaíonn í agus is maith lion go bhfuil na cúrsaí mar atá.  Tá súil agam go leanfar le feabhsú phá na múinteoirí agus má chuirimíd pá na múinteoirí chuid seo den tír seo í gcodarsnacht leis an bpá a gheibheann a gcomhleithidí sa Tuaisceart agus i Sasana feicimíd nach bhfuilimíd chun deiridh.  Ach is cúrsaí pinsin is mó atá i gceist anseo agus arís failtím roimh an scéim.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I have very little to say on this.  Largely I am speaking to get information.  I agree with the three separate items to be provided for by this amendment.  I should like for the moment to jump the second item and look at the third. Senator Quinlan anticipated the point I wished to make with regard to this item, that is, that if the figure of £400 establishes the just basic salary in July, 1968, then obviously a simple look at the consumer price index would indicate that now this should be a higher figure, by at least 25 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from that would it not be possible to devise an amendment to the scheme which would make it unnecessary to come back to the House to make pensional provision in relation <Col N="683" /> to future increases in the basic salary?  It is perfectly obvious to anyone who has given any thought to our affairs that basics are going to rise in some fashion, with some degree of control, within the course of the next few years and that this basic salary will again be amended.  Would it then be necessary again to do this?  Would it not be possible to put in some figure based on some formula which could avoid the necessity to have an authority such as is being asked for in this confirmatory motion?</P>
    <P>The third point is to be sure that I understand what is the second item. There is a basic salary and then there are, in addition to the basic salary, the allowances for instruction given through the medium of Irish and for the honours qualification and these two allowances are pensionable.  But am I correct in understanding that there are other unspecified allowances&mdash;I wonder is the list exhausted&mdash;being the allowance for teaching in the Gaeltacht and so on, as the Minister said, which are at the moment there but are not before the passing of this confirmatory motion pensionable?  I should prefer to be sure that this is an exhaustive statement of all the allowances and to know if it is intended to make pensionable all those that are not at the moment pensionable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mícheál Cranitch</NameTxt>
      <P>Ní bheidh le rá agamsa ach cúpla focal.  Ar an gcéad dul síos, ba cheart go mbeadh gach éinne buíoch don Aire agus don Roinn Oideachais as ucht an scéim Aoisliúntas seo Na Meánmhúinteoirí (Leasú) a chur ós ár gcomhair agus sílim go mbeidh gach éinne sa Teach seo ar aon fhocal mar gheall air.  Cuireann sé ard-áthas ormsa, mar bhun-mhúinteoir, go bhfuil sé i gceist tréimhse stailc na mean-mhúinteoirí 1969 a mheas mar sheirbhís in-phinsin.  Is mór an trua é go mbíonn stailceanna ann ach dar ndóigh is dócha go mbeidh stailceanna ann arís.  Nuair a dhéantar an réiteach ba ceart pé mí-ádh a thárla de thoradh na stailce a réiteach chomh fada agus is féidir.  Sa chás seo, is mór an ní é go bhfuiltear chun an tréimhse stailce sin d'áireamh mar sheirbhís in-phinsin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="684" /> Léigh mé an tríú alt go cúramach ach ní fheadar ar thuig gach éinne é. Deireann sé gur méadaíodh an buntuarastal ó £200 go £400 ón chéad lá d'Iúil, 1968, beagnach cheithre bhliain ó shin.  Nuair a chuirfear an leasú i bhfeidhm, beidh cúl-airgead nó riaráistí cheithre mbliain le teacht.  Ina theannta san, deireann an ráiteas &ldquo;le h-aontú na ndreamanna ar bhain an cheist leo.&rdquo; Dá bhrí sin, tá sé riachtanach an sainmhíniú sa scéim a leasú ó £200 go £400.&rdquo;  Déanfar é sin le h-aontú na ndaoine a bhaineann an cheist leo.  Le cúnamh Dé, san am atá le teacht, beidh éileamh ag teacht arís agus, gan dabht, déanfar socrú cuí sásúil arís le h-aontú na ndreamanna a bhaineann an cheist leo.  Fáiltím roimh an scéim seo agus molaim an tAire agus an Roinn dá bharr.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this amendment with other Senators and I hope that, as they have requested the Minister, it will be possible to treat teachers of all rank&mdash;not secondary teachers, but all ranks&mdash;fairly so far as pensions are concerned and that the scale can be worked out which reflects the teachers' important position in society. They are doing something absolutely vital and they ought to be paid a fair salary for what they are doing.</P>
      <P>I wish to raise one further point with the Minister on the payment of teachers' superannuation and that is in connection with service abroad, which is being encouraged by his Department, in particular service abroad which is recognised for incremental purposes.  I should like to ask him if it is recognised as far as superannuation is concerned. If it is not recognised for the purposes of superannuation could the Department not work out an agreement with the countries in which the service is being given so that when people go abroad to widen their knowledge and to improve their own qualities as teachers this service be recognised for the purposes of superannuation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EileenDesmond" hpid="Mrs. Desmond Mrs. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to express on behalf of this party our agreement with the other speakers in welcoming this amendment scheme.  It is, as other speakers have said, long overdue.  It is <Col N="685" /> vital that in our treatment of teachers at all levels&mdash;primary, secondary and vocational&mdash;we at least ensure that this profession will be able to compete on favourable terms with the other professions and that those people who are qualified to enter the teaching professain may be encouraged to do so.  It is vital that we get the best people possible into teaching and involved in the training of future generations.  Anything we can do to improve their conditions will, I know, get a wholehearted welcome from all sides of this House.  It is vital, of course, that any additional allowances be reckonable for superannuation purposes.  Otherwise these allowances would not have the beneficial effect that they should have.</P>
      <P>I agree with the sentiments expressed by Senator Quinlan on the last paragraph. It seems strange that almost four years after somebody came up with the sum of £400 we should find reference to it in this amendment.  We will all be anxious to hear the Minister say that an amendment can be accepted with a more fluid figure to avoid further amendments, such as we have here today.</P>
      <P>There is just one aspect of teaching to which I should like to refer.  In the very near future elocution and drama teachers will be eligible under this scheme.  I think they are not given full recognition as teachers in our teaching service.  I sincerely hope that very soon they will be recognised for all purposes.</P>
      <P>There is very little else to be said. We all agree wholeheartedly with this amendment and our only criticism is that it should have been introduced a long time ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrosnahan" hpid="Mr. Brosnahan Mr. Brosnahan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brosnahan</NameTxt>
      <P>As a Member of Seanad Éireann and as an official of another teachers' organisation, I should like to say that I most heartily welcome these improvements on behalf of our colleagues in the secondary sector.  I admire very much the helpful contribution made by Senator McElgunn, who is a secondary teacher.  His remarks have been most helpful and will enable the creation of greater teacher solidarity.  Harmony among the various <Col N="686" /> groups of teachers would contribute considerably towards the progress of education.</P>
      <P>The teacher is a key figure in the whole educational process.  When teachers are at loggerheads between themselves and those in control of education great damage is done.  It is most disedifying for pupils to see teachers engaged in internal conflict among themselves and also with those who employ them.  There is every indication that this teacher solidarity is progressing and at the moment all three teacher organisations are engaged in discussing a common salary claim before the Conciliation Council. This will do a lot of good.</P>
      <P>We welcome the proposals in the Bill.  Section 1 restores the pensionable entitlement to those secondary teachers involved in their strike.  Also, allowances which in the past were not taken into account in the calculation of pension and gratuity, will, henceforth, be taken into account.  If they are to be taken into account in the same way as they are in the primary sector, there is a lacuna or a gap here, because over the last year, when one retires on reaching the statutory age or on disability, salary only is taken into account in the calculation of pension and gratuity.  Allowances are only taken into account in the calculation of pension and gratuity on the average of the last three years. The Minister would help teachers very much if he would elaborate on this point and give some indication that allowances will not henceforth be taken into account on the basis of the average of three years but on their level in the final year of teaching prior to retirement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should also like to endorse what Senator Horgan has stated in the matter of parity of pensions, not alone for teachers but for public servants in general.  If it is logical to increase salaries because of the depreciation in the value of money and the rising cost of living, it is equally logical to suggest that pensions should be similarly increased.  Pensions are falling behind all the time, as salaries are being increased. Until such time as there will be parity of pensions a great injustice <Col N="687" /> will continue to be done to those who have given sterling service to the community and the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Minister for Education (Mr. Faulkner) Padraig Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Faulkner)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the House for the manner in which they have accepted and debated this amendment.</P>
      <P>In reply to Senators Horgan and Brosnahan I should like to say that the raising of pensions awarded in, say, 1960 to the present level would be a matter related to pension increases generally and not to any one particular scheme.  Pension schemes are of general application and there could be no question of reckoning breaks in service in relation to one scheme in circumstances which would not apply generally to pension schemes. It is traditional in my Department to recognise strike periods for pension purposes.</P>
      <P>The House may have been led along the wrong track by Senator Quinlan.  He obviously does not understand the situation relating to secondary teachers' salaries.  The State bears all the salary over and above the £400 and the percentage increases which have been given refer to the total salary including the £400.  The schools received an increase in capitation to cover the differences between the £200 and the £400.</P>
      <P>Senator FitzGerald mentioned the question of making the extra allowances pensionable.  This arises from the Ryan Tribunal findings.  Senator Brosnahan also referred to this matter. I should like to remind the House that these allowances did not exist prior to the Ryan Tribunal findings and this is the reason we are including them here. The manner in which the allowances are made pensionable would be a matter for conciliation.</P>

    <P>Government amendment No. 1:</P>

      <P>The purpose of amendments Nos. 1 and 2 is to make it clear that the word &ldquo;hirer&rdquo; as used in the Schedule includes a person who enters into a simple hiring or renting agreement as well as a person who gets a television set on a hire purchase agreement.</P>
      <P>Section 3 (1) and 4 (1) of the Bill require registered dealers to supply the Minister with particulars in relation to any case of the letting of a television set on hire contract or on a hire purchase agreement.  The particulars to be notified by registered dealers, as set out in the Schedule, include the name and address of the buyer or hirer and any change in the address of the buyer or hirer.  The original definition of &ldquo;hirer&rdquo; was defective in that it covered only a person who had a set under a hire purchase agreement.  The amended definition brings the particulars specified in the Schedule into line with sections 3 and 4 of the Bill.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
      <P>Government amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In subsection (1), between lines 25 and 26, to insert:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;hirer&rsquo;means&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  a person described in the definition of hirer in section 1 of the Hire-Purchase Act, 1946, and</P>

      <P>in any other case, the last day of the month which follows the month during which the sale or letting was made.</P>
      <P>Does that mean that if a sale or letting was made, say, on 31st March the licensed dealer would have until the 30th April in which to advise the Minister's Department?</P>

      <P>I would refer the Senator to subsection (3) which reads:</P>
      <P>for the purposes of this Act a television set is sold or let on hire or hire purchase when the contract of sale or, as the case may be, the contract of hire or hire purchase is made.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not quite meet the point I made.  If a person buys a set and says: &ldquo;Send me an invoice for that,&rdquo; and the invoice goes out on the last day of the month the dealer must advise the Minister by the last day of the following month, but if in the interim the purchaser does not go through with the sale, the Minister has been advised by the dealer that a sale has been made but the purchaser does not pay, what happens in that event?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>Does it mean the Minister's officials go round to his house to see if he has a licence for a set he has not got?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Senator not agree that, if the sale does not go through and the dealer is not paid for his set, the dealer is going to recover that set?  If the set is recovered, the question of a licence does not arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree.  But the point is that most traders would give a little more over the normal credit.  Suppose, to take an exact example, that the invoice was sent out on 31st March, then the trader has up to 30th April to notify the Minister.  The trader may say, in the normal course of events, that the purchaser might not pay until some time in May; but he must fulfil the Minister's requirements before his customer has paid for the set.  Is that not correct?  It is regarded as a sale, even though the sale may never be completed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I am trying to make is : would the Minister consider that a month is adequate?  In normal retail trading a month is regarded as fairly short.  A number of people pay their accounts after the elapse of more than a month.  I would suggest that in a situation like this it would not be unusual for a person to pay their account in two or three months.  In the meantime the Minister will have been advised that a set has been purchased by somebody who may subsequently never pay for it.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister envisage that &ldquo;walkie-talkie&rdquo; type equipment would come under the &ldquo;sources of interference with wireless telegraphy&rdquo; referred to in the first sentence of this section.  I ask this question because it could be taken as interfering with equipment which would be operated by the Defence Forces at certain stages.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">

    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">
      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>In fact, &ldquo;walkie-talkies&rdquo; do not come under this section.  One of the reasons I asked was because of the problem of subsection (c), which states:</P>
      <P>the address of the premises at which it has been or is to be installed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If you had movable telegraphic equipment, that might present a problem. If &ldquo;walkie-talkie&rdquo; equipment is dealt with under section 7, would there be any difficulty in regard to movable transmitting equipment?  As far as paragraph (c) of section 5 is concerned, pirate radios often operate from movable vans and trucks, so would there <Col N="695" /> be a problem in getting an address of a premises because it is not really installed on a premises?</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">

This equipment would be in a particular place unless the premises were being changed or something like that.  The type of apparatus the Senator is referring to, such as radio transmitters, would be dealt with under section 7.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Under this section, the Minister is empowered to make an order requiring particulars of equipment capable of causing interference to be notified to him.  This order, presumably, will be published in the newspapers and in <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i> It will then give rise to an offence if anybody in possession of this apparatus, so affected by an order which he may not have seen, does not give by notice the information required by the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a note here which I think I should read to the House, because it might clear up any misunderstanding which might exist:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this section is to build up a register of apparatus or equipment in use which is capable of radiating substantial radio frequency power thereby causing interference with wireless telegraphy. If such a register were available it would make it easier to detect promptly the sources of interference and to take corrective action.  The kind of equipment in mind is industrial and medical of a type which would be specified in an order made by the Minister under this section and the user would supply three things: (a) his name and address; (b) descriptive particulars of the apparatus or equipment and (c) the address of the premises in which it is held.  The Minister's powers in relation to interference generally arise under section 12 of the Wireless Telegraphy <Col N="696" /> Act, 1926, extended by the Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960.  Section 12 of the Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1926, enables the Minister to request the cessation of injurious interference being caused to wireless telegraphy apparatus or a broadcasting station.  Failure to comply with such a request is an offence liable on summary conviction to be penalised with the maximum fine of £10 a day and £1 a day for every day during which the offence continues.</P>
    <P>These people would be requested to give us this information and the order would be made and published.  These people would also be requested to cease injurious interference.  Does that clear up the point?</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, to a considerable degree.  I am thinking of the situation in which someone might be recommended to buy, hire or otherwise acquire an apparatus or equipment to which the Minister is referring, whether the user be in industry or medicine, who might be able to give the descriptive particulars.  What is the machinery through which industrial and medical staff are to be made aware of this kind of obligation?  Is there any machinery whereby the importer or the manufacturer can be required to draw the purchaser's attention to the existence of the obligation?</P>
      <P>I do not know how real the point I am making is, but if somebody asked me to describe some apparatus or equipment, first, I would not be able to do it, and, secondly, if I had not been in the Seanad I would not know that the Minister had power to make this order requiring me to do it.  Is it one of the hazards of being in industry that you are expected to find out all the applicable laws affecting, as the Bill prescribes:</P>
      <P>apparatus or equipment capable of radiating, in conditions specified in the order, radio frequency power equal to or greater than the amount so specified...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>by the Minister, in an order which he may not have seen?  Are there any techniques, administratively, to make people aware of their obligations and <Col N="697" /> to ensure that they are put in possession of the information which they then would give?</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the point made by Senator Alexis FitzGerald and the reasoning behind it.  I am sure that suppliers of heavy equipment and machinery would notify the purchasers of its nature and type so that they would be able to have this information and, if necessary, inform the Department.  The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs has an advisory committee which includes technical experts to advise him on the making of interference regulations.</P>

      <P>Supposing the source of the interference was there before this legislation came along?  What would happen?  If a person suddenly found himself a cause of interference because somebody else had started, say, a radio cab rank outside an industrial building, would the radio cab owners have the right to require the industrial building owners to cease such interference?  If he did, would it have consequences on the operation of the industry concerned and hence on employment in that industry?  I <Col N="698" /> think the Minister would require a sense of balance here so that a frivolous or unjust complaint would not be made against industrialists.</P>

If Senator Russell and I have some machine which causes interference, and which comes within the section, presumably if the Minister makes an order we have to give the prescribed particulars.  But, on my reading of section 7, which deals, so to speak, with the remedies the Minister has for dealing with it in relation to the importing or selling of these machines, if the Minister finds by reason of an order he has made that information is furnished to him as to a source of interference, is there anything he can do about it?</P>

      <P>There is another aspect of interference, under section 5, where people have not adequate voltage. This is a problem in many parts of the country.  There is an onus on the ESB to provide adequate voltage.  If we are to compel people to pay £7.50 for a licence we must take all possible steps to ensure that we provide an adequate service.  I do not think that a semi-State body should be allowed to get away with something they are not entitled to. For example, if you have an inadequate supply of electricity and somebody down the road plugs in an electric kettle, a milking machine or a crusher, your television picture will be obliterated.</P>
      <P>This is interference for the purpose of this section.  Would there not be an onus on the ESB to ensure that such people are protected against that type of interference?  It is necessary for farmers to use electrical farm machinery, but other people wired up to that transformer may suffer as a result.  One can make all kinds of representations to the ESB but it is extremely difficult to get them to remedy the matter. There is an onus on the Department of Posts and Telegraphs to ensure that people who are paying £7.50 for their television licences will get value for their money and proper viewing.  Their viewing should not be interfered with by reason of inadequate voltage.</P>

      <P>I should like to assure Senator Fitzgerald that, by and large, we find the ESB provide a satisfactory service.  However, I am aware <Col N="700" /> that there are isolated areas where the voltage may not be high enough to provide a proper signal to a television viewer.  I would stress that, so far as the holder of a set is concerned, he or she must have a licence irrespective of whether the signal is strong or weak or whether the set is in working order at all.  The fact that a person possesses a television set means that that person must buy a licence.  Senator West, jokingly I hope, said that we should prosecute the ESB.  Maybe we should. This is something we have to look into. Where we have been informed by television viewers that the signal is weak due to low voltage we have brought the fact to the notice of the ESB.</P>

      <P>I have a note here which I shall read for the benefit of the House.  It reads:</P>
      <P>All powers appropriate for the investigation and detection of interference with wireless telegraphy receiving apparatus were conferred on RTE under the Broadcasting Authority (Control of Interference) Order, 1960, and a special interference section within the Authority handles complaints of interference from listeners and viewers.  Any prosecution for failure to comply with the regulations would be a matter for the Minister.  The Authority has not so far found it necessary to recommend that anybody be prosecuted for failure to comply with the regulations against interference.  The policy is one of persuasion rather than of compulsion and it is generally successful.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the note which the Minister read covers the point I am about to make.  Developing Senator Fitzgerald's point a bit further, I should imagine that there are other ways of causing interference rather than by radiating radio frequency power.  For example, am I not right in <Col N="701" /> suggesting that equipment which uses very high voltage, such as welding equipment, can cause interference without actually radiating radio frequency power in the sense that is covered in the section?  If so, has the Minister power to do something about this situation?</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 7 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister to explain in regard to subsection (1) why the phrase in the third line, which reads:</P>
      <P>or for such other purpose as the Minister shall specify...</P>
      <P>is included?  I, personally, react very strongly against giving the Minister&mdash; not this Minister, but any Minister&mdash; global undefined powers of this nautre. The purpose of section 7 is quite clear. The marginal note shows that it is a restriction of manufacture or importation of certain apparatus.  Subsection (1) starts by stating:</P>
      <P>Where it appears to the Minister to be expedient that the provisions of this section should, for the purpose of preventing or reducing the risk of interference with wireless telegraphy...</P>
      <P>That is what the whole Bill is about: the Minister may do certain things. However, it does not end there.  It continues</P>
      <P>...for the purpose of preventing or reducing the risk of interference with wireless telegraphy, or for such other purpose as the Minister shall specify...</P>
      <P>It seems to me that that leaves it wide open to the Minister to think up anything he likes and to decide that such other purpose, even though it might be completely unrelated either to his Department or to the question of interference with wireless telegraphy, can get the hammer under this section.  I cannot see that the section would be weakened in any way by deleting that phrase.  If the Minister insists on keeping that phrase in the Bill, then he should spell out very clearly what is intended by it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>This section enables the Minister, with the consent of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, to make an order prohibiting the sale, letting, manufacture or importation of any apparatus of a type to be specified in the order.  Provision may be made in the order to enable the Minister <Col N="704" /> to grant licences which would exempt licensees from the provision of the section to a manufacturer making equipment of this type solely for export.  Subsection (4) of section 11 provides for a penalty of £50 for a first offence, and £100 for a second or subsequent offence for a contravention of this section, and also provides for forfeiture of the equipment.  The reason for section 7 is as follows.  Subsection (1) of section 3 of the Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1926, provides generally that no person shall keep or have in his possession any apparatus for wireless telegraphy except under licence granted by the Minister.  Certain types of apparatus, for example, certain &ldquo;walkie-talkie&rdquo; sets, operating on the 27 megacycle band&mdash;commonly known as the citizen band&mdash;and &ldquo;bugging&rdquo; devices would not normally be licensed by the Minister, either because it would be undesirable to have them in the wrong hands or because their use would cause abnormal interference with television and radio reception.  Section 7 of the Bill would enable the Minister to keep this kind of equipment out of the hands of the general public and, in some cases, out of the country altogether, but would enable the Minister to make exceptions where the apparatus is to be manufactured for export only.  It will be necessary to have power to cover items for causes other than risk of interference.  For example, &ldquo;bugging&rdquo; devices would not come under this heading.  I hope this answers the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>It gives me a better understanding of what the Minister has in mind, but it does not satisfy me. I think it is still too wide.  I can appreciate that there may be cases such as the Minister has mentioned where it might be desirable on grounds other than grounds relating to interference to have some kind of control, but the particular course the Minister has chosen is entirely without restriction or limitation on him.  As I see it, it would be open to the Minister on this particular section to prohibit the importation of such apparatus merely for the sake of prohibiting importation&mdash;possibly something to do with the balance of payments or something of that sort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="705" /> I feel strongly that any such measure should be taken by the Minister for Finance in relation to the general economic and political situation in the country rather than that it should be done under a Wireless Telegraphy Act. I think it is entirely too wide.  The example I have given may not be a very good one and I imagine that other Senators, if they thought about this, would probably give other examples.  Again, I want to make it clear that I am not suggesting either the Minister or the Department would wish or would in fact act in any way irresponsible in this connection.  The case has often been made, quite correctly, that when we legislate here we are legislating not for a particular Minister, not for a particular staff in his Department, but we are legislating as far as we can for the future.  None of us can say that a power as wide as this might not be irresponsibly used in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am a little worried about this section in particular. I am assuming the Minister will form the right view that it is necessary to make an order to specify a particular apparatus as being an apparatus which should not be manufactured or sold and that his object in doing so would be correct, in thinking that it would prevent or reduce risk of interference of wireless telegraphy and simply leave it at that for the moment and not even consider such other purposes as he may specify.  If you were wrong about that and it were in a given situation desirable that certain apparatus be made, sold or imported here for reasons more important than the question of interference with wireless telegraphy, you would increase the legal problem for the State and the situation could not be corrected until this order had been revoked under the procedures laid down in the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know enough about defence or about security or about medicine, but these matters seem to me to be more important than reducing the risk of interference of reception on your television set.  For the purpose of reducing the risk of interference of reception, the Minister could ban something which is needed for some other purpose which has not been <Col N="707" /> taken into account when the order was made, because the nature of the section does not direct one's mind to this kind of problem.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce has been speaking in terms of production generally, and of the economy; but life is more important than death and I suppose if we did close down all the hospitals in Ireland our television reception would be greatly improved, but would this be a desirable thing?  One has got to weigh various other objectives against this particular objective.  It may be possible to devise a section whereby through extension of the licensing provisions, for example, the Minister could close down Telefís Éireann as being an apparatus for interfering with my wireless telegraphy reception because I live next door to it and it definitely reduces my reception of television from other television programme producers. It is just an example&mdash;a fatuous one, if you like&mdash;but it may be desirable to extend the power of the Minister in this by way of licence to cope with that problem.  If he did get representation from the Army or somebody that they wanted a particular piece of equipment, they could get it very quickly.</P>

      <P>Could I add just one thing on the other point.  I do not think this would go in any way against the Minister's powers under this if it were spelled out in this section that the Minister in making this order must specify the purpose.  It does not seem to me that is clear in this section.  It states: &ldquo;such other purposes as the Minister shall specify&rdquo; and then it goes on to state: &ldquo;he will make an Order specifying the goods&rdquo;.  It does not seem to me that there is a legal obligation on the Minister under the section to specify the purpose in his order although I accept that is obviously what he intended.</P>

      <P>I think there is a certain amount of disquiet amongest the radio and television dealers in relation to this enabling section which gives the Minister the power to give a list of all television transactions to RTE.  We know that RTE are engaged in a commercial aspect of television, piped television.  If at some future time RTE in their wisdom decide to go into the rental side of the business, which is a lucrative one, it would give them a very unfair advantage over the dealers inasmuch as they would have a list of all the rental transactions that would have taken place throughout the country and would have a list of all those who had hired television sets.</P>
      <P>I should like to hear the Minister's views on that because to my way of thinking this is a section that perhaps could have been omitted from the Bill, without the Bill losing any of its effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with some of the views of Senator Jack Fitzgerald in this regard.  A fair amount of disquiet was voiced by many people when RTE first went into the business of competing with private industry for the erection of communal aerials.  The fear is now being voiced about the comprehensive information which the <Col N="709" /> members of the rental association would have to supply to the Department, who are empowered under this section to pass this information on to RTE.  If at some time in the future RTE made a decision to extend their sphere of operations to the business of renting television appliances they would have quite a deal of information which would give them an unfair trading advantage over and above the people in the private sector of the industry.</P>
      <P>I know is sounds unlikely that Radio Telefís Éireann would themselves enter into the business of hiring or leasing television appliances, but one might have said two years ago that it was just as unlikely that Radio Telefís Éireann would enter into the business of competing with private industry in the business of erecting communal television aerials.  Indeed, as one who has had some experience, both in a personal capacity and as a public representative, with the operation of that section of RTE, who are supposed to be erecting communal aerials, could I suggest to the Minister that it might have been better for all concerned had they not departed from their original brief in this regard?  Not only was the principle of not interfering with private enterprise, where it was carrying out its operations in a fair way, violated, but we had the unfortunate situation of a semi-State body making extravagant promises in order to get contracts, which they apparently knew they could not fulfil because they certainly have not fulfilled them, and in that way getting a share of the market which, if it had been done by a private operator, might have left him open to legal action.</P>
      <P>I think the people in Donnybrook now are having second thoughts about their entry into this field.  I hope the Minister will have second, third and fourth thoughts before they are allowed to go into the field of renting out television appliances.  Nonetheless, under this section, if they make that decision they are empowered to get private information from the people who would be competitors and that seems to be a bad thing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I should <Col N="710" /> like to support the criticisms which have been made of the proposed amendment to the existing law which is contained in section 9.  Because of the extremely confusing methods by which we amend our legislation it is difficult to ascertain from the section the powers by which the Minister can by order transfer, because the section to which reference is made is not in the Act.  You find that this section has been introduced in a Schedule which is referred to in a section of a subsequent Act, that is, section 34 of the Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960, which introduced a new subsection, after subsection (1) of section 5, into the Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1926.  The Minister has these powers given to him now for 12 years, but he has not in fact exercised them.</P>
      <P>There is genuine and widespread apprehension in the trade, as to the dangers to the trade and to all whose employment is connected with it and to the capital invested in it that the amendment, the logic of which I understand, will expose them in the future to risk.  The point was made here in the debate that Radio Telefís Éireann, to give it its new name, has engaged in piping television.  I am not joining in criticism of the manner in which it is sought to do that or anything about that aspect of it.  I simply say that this is seen by the trade as engaging in commercial competition with certain elements who have set themselves up in business to do this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not clear, and I should like the Minister to explain when he is replying to this debate, how Telefís Éireann come to be engaged in piping television.  The powers of Radio Telefís Éireann are set forth in section 16 of the Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960. These were amended by the 1966 Act to introduce three additional powers which I do not think in any way would give the authority any power to do this which they may have lacked at the time of the introduction of the amendment Act of 1966.  I take it that the powers RTE are exercising in this field are to be found in the general provisions with regard to the relay of programmes. Perhaps they rely upon the amendment of section 5 of the Broadcasting <Col N="711" /> Authority (Amendment) Act, 1966.  Indeed that may have been what that amendment was conceived to achieve. Section 5 (b), as amended, states:</P>
    <P>To arrange with other Broadcasting Authorities for the distribution, receipt, exchange and relay of programmes.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (b) of subsection (2) of the original Act states:</P>
    <P>To provide by arrangements made for the purpose by the Minister and any other person for the distribution by means of relaying of programmes broadcast by the Authority.</P>
    <P>I presume it would be open to the Minister to say to the House today that the existing powers would not enable RTE to go into the business of renting television sets.  This does not come directly from existing powers and would not necessarily be conducive to the performance of its business.  Even if the Minister says this&mdash;and I would agree with him&mdash;it would not be sufficient to allay the fears to which I refer.  Even if we were to put down an amendment to this Bill today designed to limit the powers of the Minister to make this transfer of his fee collecting ability to RTE during such time as they were engaged in any activity which would be competitive with existing concerns, this would not allay their anxiety either.  During the period intermediate to their coming to the Houses of the Oireachtas to get the additional power to do these things they would have accumulated the information which would be thought by the people in the business, rightly or wrongly, to threaten their interests.</P>
    <P>There are substantial sums involved, as I need not remind the House.  We are not talking about anything small now.  Unless this is practically necessary as distinct from apparently logically desirable, I should think the Minister ought not to do this.  Businessmen attach great importance to these matters.  Competitors do not wish people to know what their gross turnover is.  This figure was required by statute in Britain to be given by limited companies for the benefits of an Act in 1967.  They had not merely to give <Col N="712" /> their gross turnover but a detailed regional breakdown of this turnover as it changes.</P>
    <P>If this information is received by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs as being necessary for the purposes of the collection of fees, the trade will be content that that Department should continue to receive that information.  But if the information is to be received by an authority which at the moment is engaging in what is more like commerce, that is piped television, it will be a serious step for this House to empower any Minister to be so organised that he can transfer these powers away from a Minister of State, where the Minister and his advisers are bound by official secrecy requirements and other protective provisions. If we are to have such a remarkable change it ought to be spelled out in very explicit language and should follow a very thorough debate, not merely in this House but in the other House, to which the Minister will be returning.</P>
    <P>I strongly urge the Minister to consider whether it is necessary to transfer the information.  It would be all right if we could limit the information by having a compilation or classification made up by the Minister's Department if he chooses to transfer the collection of fees.  This compilation should contain references only to places where people in default live.  The Minister may wish to preserve the right and may take the line: &ldquo;This is something I may want to do some time.&rdquo;  But he may take the view: &ldquo;Let us do without the power to transfer because we have no intention of transferring it.  We are going to do the collecting.&rdquo;  If he takes that view, it would be the most sensible one.  If the Minister does wish to preserve the power of fee collecting, let us see that the information which reaches him is sterilised of its commercial usefulness before it reaches RTE.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">
      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support the point made by Senator Jack Fitzgerald, Senator Boland and Senator Alexis FitzGerald.  This problem, which has arisen due to section 9 of this Bill, has caused considerable disquiet. The problem has arisen at this <Col N="713" /> stage of the passage of the Bill through the Oireachtas primarily because the passage of this Bill has been so hasty. The Bill was not printed until about the middle of February and issued towards the end of that month.  These things take some time to come through.  Members of the Oireachtas have a good deal of legislation to deal with and read and there has to be feedback from the public and from the people who are involved in the business.</P>
      <P>I feel strongly that the provision of transferring the register to RTE is one that should not be available to the Minister.  There should be no reason at any stage to take this course.  In the debate on the Committee Stage in the other House the Minister has stated and I quote from the Dáil Official Report of Wednesday, 8th March, column 1259:</P>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy in the House I am not considering the question of transferring this register to RTE, I am only making provision for it in case it might ever happen.</P>
      <P>This is something we ought to guard against, even thought the Minister may not be considering it.  He has the power, if the Bill is passed as it now stands, and we should not give him this power.  We should only give him this power if we have an absolutely clear idea of what an order such as this would entail.  I think it would entail a total change in the function of RTE and we should be clearly aware of the change in that function.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Senator FitzGerald has pointed out, we are not talking about a small industry.  There are roughly 1,000 people engaged in the manufacture and distribution of television sets.  We are talking in terms of the employment of 1,000 people.  This is a problem of considerable magnitude.  The people in the trade feel that if at any stage this register of sales and users of television sets was transferred to RTE and if RTE decided to go into the business of manufacture and distribution of television sets, this would give them a tremendous advantage over their competitors on a private enterprise <Col N="714" /> system.  They feel especially sore about this because by paying both private and industrial taxes the people involved in the manufacture, distribution and rental of television sets are paying taxes to the Government which are then used to subsidise RTE and which puts them in a position quite different from the average manufacturer, retailer and distributor.  This section could hide a type of nationalisation of the television manufacture and distribution industry.  With the unfair advantage of the register of sales and users of television sets, if RTE went into that side of the business they could easily dispose of their competitors.</P>
    <P>Although Senator Boland has made the point that it seems unlikely that RTE would go into the manufacture and distribution of television sets, he also pointed out that some years ago it seemed extremely unlikely that RTE would go into the piped television relay business.  We should be clear what is the mandate for RTE.  They must have a mandate to enter into the piped television business.  I should like to ask the Minister what that mandate is.</P>
    <P>We ought to be absolutely clear in our minds what we are doing.  Either we decide to allow RTE to go entirely into this field or they should not be in it at all.  I can see their point of view. The RTE people are labouring under a severe handicap, which is lack of money.  Because of lack of money their programmes, perhaps, do not compare with those of the BBC.  They have to put on more canned American programmes.  They have not got the resources, they claim, to do what they would like.  Anybody working in RTE sees at once a source of revenue.  Here is a great source of income, let us get into the TV distribution, rental and relay business.  There is money to be made there.  If RTE are going to go into this business we want to be clear about the position of their competitors in what, up to now, has been private enterprise, an industry which employs about 1,000 people.</P>
    <P>There is an argument for nationalising the television distribution business but one would have to take a <Col N="715" /> very long hard look at it.  It would require a great deal of debate and decision whether that would be the right thing to do.  The problem about this section is that it would give another Minister, another Department of Posts and Telegraphs and perhaps an aggressive RTE Authority, the opportunity of doing precisely this without any public debate or discussion. All it needs is an order by the Minister, RTE gets all these records, they go into the manufacture and distribution of television sets and, with the information at their disposal, they would be able to wipe out any competition from private industry.  This section gives this opportunity to RTE, to a Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and I feel, because of its hidden power, it should be opposed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I again draw the attention of the Seanad to the fact that an order made under this section must be laid before both Houses.  It is not quite true to say, as Senator West has suggested, that this power could be taken by the Minister without any publicity or discussion.  Anybody in either House who feels that the order which the Minister proposes to make is, in the circumstances, an unwise one is quite free to put down a motion to annual it.  It will certainly get publicity and discussion if a Member of either House does so.  It is not giving a Minister a final power which cannot be reviewed in the future.  It will be subject to review.  It will be subject to discussion and it will get publicity if any Member of either House wants it to get publicity.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>Notwithstanding what Senator Ryan has said, this section is undesirable for many reasons.  Even if RTE were never to go into the business of manufacturing or selling television sets it is undesirable that a Minister should transfer to a State body the powers which he holds at present.  The Minister is the political head of a Department.  He is elected by the people.  Any Deputy can put down a question in the Dáil in regard to the affairs of his Department and the Minister must answer that question. <Col N="716" /> If a Deputy puts down a question dealing with a State body, the reply invariably is that the Minister has no function in regard to such an institution or statutory body.  It would be very undesirable if the right of a Deputy, Senator or county councillor to question the Minister on anything they might regard as an injustice or something which should not be done in the name of the Minister was transferred to a statutory body.  It would be a step in the wrong direction.</P>
      <P>In making this statement I should like to point out I am fighting the case for the present and any future Minister to retain the right he has at the present time.  It may never happen that such power may be transferred to RTE, but if at some future date the Minister or his successor should think it desirable to transfer such a power of collecting or insisting on licences being taken out by users of television sets with the right of prosecution in the courts of the state, then he should think twice about it.  I should regret very much seeing that happen.  The power is being taken out of the hands of the Minister and his Department and is being given to the institution that is providing the service.</P>
      <P>In Dublin and on the east coast, if one is not satisfied with an RTE production, one can switch to BBC or UTV.  But in, say, west Limerick or in my own constituency next door to that of the Minister the person who is not satisfied with the RTE programmes has no option.  He cannot get any other channel.  In this day and age I feel it would be a wrong step.</P>
      <P>I would urge the Minister, as a politician and one who is answerable to the public, to retain this power and not to transfer it.  I see no good reason in the future why the Minister should transfer this power.  I do not believe that, all things being equal, RTE, would have any intention of going into the manufacture and distribution of television sets.  I am assuming they would never want to do that.  The Minister should however still retain the right to the enforcement of licences and to prosecute somebody who defaults under an Act of Parliament.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>When I first read paragraphs (a) and (b) of section 9 I thought what was required was that the list of dealers, which would be compiled under section 2, would be transferred to Radio Telefís Éireann. On re-reading this, it seems that under paragraph (b) power can also be given to RTE to collect licence fees.  I am inclined to agree with what Senator Russell has said.  I have not been approached by any of the commercial interests on the presumption that RTE may eventually go into the manufacture of television units.  I would much prefer to see the right of collecting licence fees being retained by the Minister in his own Department.  It has happened frequently that Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas have asked the Minister to make some representation to RTE in matters of public interest, where we were convinced that RTE were not acting in the best public interest.  We were told that it is not the business of the Minister to interfere with a semi-State or statutory body.  This apparently is accepted as the rule.</P>
      <P>I do not like giving more power than is necessary to people who are not answerable to Parliament.  There are certain powers which we must give them for the day-to-day functioning of the companies for which they have responsibility, but we should stop there.  Public interests must be safeguarded. If we give these semi-State and statutory bodies more power than they require to discharge the duties which we give them, then we are abrogating the power of Parliament. This is a section about which I am not very enthusiastic.  Maybe when the Minister is replying he will give some explanation of why he thinks this is desirable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already stated in the Dáil that I am not considering the question of transferring the register of television dealers to RTE.  I am only making provision so that it would be possible, without fresh legislation, to arrange at some future date that RTE could maintain the register, and that notifications about television set transactions could be sent to RTE instead of to the Minister. <Col N="718" /> This change would be made only if it were decided that RTE should take over the collection of television licence fees from my Department.  It does not of course follow that the register and notification work would automatically be transferred to RTE if licence fee collection were transferred to the authority.  All the relevant circumstances would be taken into consideration before a decision was made.  It would however be illogical not to provide for the contigency, when a provision in the Act of 1960 makes it possible for the Minister to arrange for the transfer to RTE of the more important work of collecting licence revenue, including the power to prosecute evaders.</P>
      <P>It has been suggested that, if this section is left in the Bill, RTE would have an unfair advantage in competition with television dealers because of the information that dealers will have to give them, and that this could lead to a situation where RTE would have the monopoly or virtual monopoly in the supply of sets.  I have already pointed out that this is merely an enabling provision and these particular functions may never be transferred to the authority.  Even if this particular provision were to be invoked some time in the future, there are no good grounds for the fears of the dealers that RTE would be in competition with them in regard to the sale and renting of sets.  I am aware that the authority have no intention whatsoever of entering this particular field.  Even if they had, they would have to convince me and my Department that they should be empowered to take on this novel function.  I do not think they would convince me too easily.  I hope that what I have just said has convinced Senators that television dealers need have no fear whatsoever that the inclusion of this particular section will be detrimental to their interests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One point was raised by Senator Alexis FitzGerald in connection with communal aerials and he asked me to deal with it when replying.  Because of their adverse effect on RTE's advertising revenue communal aerials with facilities for reception of external television programmes were initially restricted to single blocks of flats or ten <Col N="719" /> houses.  In 1966, the Government decided that in view of the special circumstances in the Ballymun housing scheme RTE should be asked to provide a multi-channel communal aerial service there.  This led to pressure for a similar service in other areas.  Early in 1970, the Minister announced that he was prepared to permit the erection, under licence, of multi-channel communal aerial systems, subject to a maximum of 500 outlets per system. Licences would be issued only to RTE, local authorities and interests directly connected with the housing scheme or area concerned.  The RTE Authority wished to engage in the business of providing communal aerial systems in order to compensate for the loss of advertising revenue which would follow from the expected decline in the viewing of RTE's programmes as a result of increased availability and improved reception of foreign programmes. A special section known as RTE Relays was established within the broadcasting organisation to handle the communal aerial business.</P>
    <P>I am assured that legal advice was obtained on this particular matter at the time.  It was to the effect that it was possible for RTE to engage in this business.  I hope this clears the point which Senator Alexis FitzGerald raised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator realises that that is completely out of order, with all due respect to the Chair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>By putting two discs on top of one aerial and calling them <Col N="720" /> two different aerials, RTE are getting away with the idea of connecting more than 500 outlets to one system.</P>
      <P>However, to revert to the original topic which was under discussion, the fear was expressed that RTE could be given a complete register of the sales and leasing arrangements of every company which was engaged in the business of selling or leasing television sets in this country.  If RTE entered into that business they would know the exact number and location of the sales and leasing arrangements of every company.  It was felt that this would give them an unfair trading advantage.  Perhaps I could put that in terms more easily understood by Members of the House.  It would be something on the lines of giving to one candidate at an election the complete register of electors and of giving to the other candidates only a partial register of electors of which they were already aware.  Consequently, the person who had the complete register and the knowledge of the sphere of activities of the others would have a distinct advantage over them.</P>
      <P>In the same manner RTE would have that type of advantage if they entered into the field of selling or leasing television appliances.  It is not good enough that the Minister should state that it is not being considered at present that RTE should enter this business.  We are all quite sure such a thing is not being considered, when one bears in mind the considerable difficulties RTE have run into in their first venture into the commercial field. That venture is RTE Relays, about which the Minister spoke.  Nevertheless, here we are giving very wide power to this organisation.  Obviously, the majority of the Members of this House do not favour giving this power. I suggest to the Minister that this is something which merits further consideration before we take the next Stage of this Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">
      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say that if I were a television dealer and if I received that reply from the Minister about a query I had put to him, it would not allay my fears; in fact, it would do the opposite.  It would make me feel that <Col N="721" /> my original query was being dealt with in typical departmental style and with the reply: &ldquo;Do not worry.  We will not do anything unfair.&rdquo;  In a couple of years time, perhaps with another Minister and perhaps with other officials in charge of RTE, the whole pattern may change and the powers contained here may be used.  The Minister said it does not follow, if he transferred the authority to collect licence fees from his Department to RTE, that he would automatically transfer the register.  How would RTE collect the licence fees if they did not have the register?</P>
      <P>I should like to back up Senator Boland's comments.  I think he hit the nail on the head when he said that the entry of RTE into the distribution and rental field is not being considered at present by the Minister or by RTE themselves primarily because RTE have not made a great success of their commercial venture into the field of piped television.  They are not geared for it so far as I can see.  The original RTE operation was not designed to go into this aspect of commercial television. The reason they have not been too successful in the relay television venture is that they have not the business organisation to make it successful. If they had made a success of it, we can be sure that they would have entered the manufacture and distribution side.</P>
      <P>One can see the pressures on them. We have a television service which everybody admits could achieve a great deal more if the authority had more money.  In the manufacture, distribution and rental of television sets they recognise an industry which is vitally connected with television and they say: &ldquo;Let us get some of this for ourselves.  Let us get in on the business and make more money by going commercial.&rdquo; They have gone commercial to a certain extent already, but we would like to know whether they intend to stay in the business, whether they are going to get out of it, or whether they intend to develop, thereby putting private industries in difficulties, as they could very well do if they had possession of the licence register.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to think <Col N="722" /> again about this section before we discuss the final Stages of the Bill.  I am quite happy that a register should be kept in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and that it be sterilised, in the words of Senator Alexis FitzGerald. The people in the manufacture and distribution trade probably feel quite happy about this, but I share their dis-quite at the thought, whatever the unlikely circumstance, that this register could be given to RTE by ministerial order.  Although Senator Ryan is quite right in saying that the Minister would have to lay the order before the Houses of the Oireachtas, he knows quite well that this is not the same as debating a major policy change in RTE.  People have talked in RTE about nationalising the commercial side of television.  We should be absolutely clear on this point and I should like the Minister to look at this section again and see if he can reserve the register for his own Department alone.</P>

      <P>I want to repeat what I said on the Second Stage.  There is in this section an undesirable principle which seems to be inserted for reasons of conveniencing the prosecution of persons found to be in possession of unlicensed wireless telegraphy apparatus.  Paragraph 10 of the Explanatory Memorandum sets out the reason very clearly.  It reads:</P>
      <P>Section 10 contains provisions to ease difficulties experienced in the prosecution of persons who are found to be in unlawful possession of unlicensed wireless telegraphy apparatus.</P>
      <P>In order to make it easier to prosecute them the section states, in effect, that a person is guilty until he is proved innocent.  I think that is bad in principle. I do not know if it is possible for the Minister to get round it some other way.  I know this is not the first Bill in which such a provision has appeared, but it is undesirable.  Every effort should be made by the Oireachtas to oppose this type of legislation.  I do not like it, and I do not think that the Members of the House in general like it.</P>

      <P>The purpose of this section is to ease difficulties experienced in the prosecution of persons who are found to be in unlawful possession of wireless telegraphy apparatus.  The obligation to have a licence for a radio or television set is imposed by subsection (1) of section 3 of the Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1966, which states:</P>
      <P>No person shall keep or have in his possession... any apparatus for wireless telegraphy save in so far as such keeping or possession is authorised by a licence granted under this Act and for the time being in force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some difficulty has been experienced in proving to the satisfaction of the courts that a defendant had possession of a TV or radio set found on his premises <Col N="724" /> during the course of an inspection, particularly where the defendant himself was not present when the inspection was made.  It has been the practice to bring the prosecution against the rated occupier of the premises or the head of the household, even though it may have been his wife or a member of his family who was interviewed during the course of the inspection.  The difficulties arising from the prosecution of the rated occupier or head of household have resulted mainly from a High Court judgment given in 1966 in the case of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs <i>v.</i> Christopher Campbell. Briefly, the situation there was that Mr. Campbell was prosecuted for having an unlicensed television set as rated occupier of the cottage in which the unlicensed set was found.  The district justice who heard the case was not satisfied that the evidence that Mr. Campbell was the rated occupier of the cottage in which the set was found was sufficient proof that Mr. Campbell had possession of the set.  He asked for the guidance of the High Court by way case stated.  The High Court shared the misgivings of the district justice and said that the evidence produced in support of the prosecution was not sufficient to establish Mr. Campbell's possession of the television set.  The Attorney General advised against an appeal to the Supreme Court and suggested instead that legislation be brought forward to remedy the difficulty and this is what is now being done.</P>
    <P>In subsection (4) of section 10 of the Bill there are two terms specifically defined; that is, &ldquo;occupier&rdquo; and &ldquo;premises&rdquo;.  These definitions are deliberately wide as they are necessary in the context of the section as a whole to offset the judgment of the High Court in the Campbell case.  If the Bill became law, a prosecution could be taken against any occupier of a premises in which a television set was found.  Premises, as defined, include a part of a building, such as a flat or apartment.</P>
    <P>As to subsections (1), (2) and (3) of section 10, the following comments are made&mdash;with reference to the judgment in the Campbell case where appropriate.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="725" /> Subsection (1): this subsection provides that once proof is given that a television set was in a particular premises on a particular day it shall be presumed that the set was in the possession of the person who was then the occupier of the premises.  In the High Court judgment the judge said that, although the evidence established that the cottage in which the unlicensed set was found was the defendant's dwelling-house, there was no evidence as to how the television set came to be there, how long it was there, or whether the defendant was ever at any time aware of its presence or existence.  This subsection would provide for the presumption that in such a case the occupier, as defined, was in fact in possession of the set within the meaning of section 3 of the Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1926.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) would place on a defendant the onus of showing that the set of which he has or had possession is or was licensed.  If he could not produce a valid licence, then the court would have to presume that he had none.  This would take away from the Department the job of proving that the set was not licensed.</P>
    <P>Subsection (3) relates to section 7, Subsection (3), of the Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1926.  Section 7 provides that the Minister may send by registered post a special notice in writing to any person asking him to state within 14 days (1) whether he has in his possession wireless telegraphy apparatus, (2) the kind of apparatus, (3) whether or not he has a licence, (4) particulars of the licence, if he has one, and (5) any other information that the Minister may require.</P>
    <P>Section 7, subsection (3), provides that a person who fails to complete the notice and send it back shall be guilty of an offence.  The procedure under section 7 is used frequently in cases where a former licensee fails to renew his licence.  Very often the former licensee does not bother to return the form of declaration, or he says that he has returned it, although it may be known that he has not.  It is not easy to bring a successful prosecution at present for failure to comply with section 7.  The result is that <Col N="726" /> extensive visits or inspections have to be made.</P>
    <P>Subsection (3) of section 10 of the Bill provides that if a prosecution is taken and if it is shown that the form of declaration or special notice, as it is called in the Bill, has been sent by registered post to a person, it shall be presumed, until the person shows to the contrary, that he has not complied with the requirements of section 7, subsection (3), of the Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1926.</P>

      <P>Certainly from what the Minister has said, it is a poor lookout for the Mr. Campbells of the future.  From the point of view of convenience it is an ideal arrangement, but the Mr. Campbells of the future have not a dog's chance.  However, I still think it is a bad procedure and that it is unjust.  The ordinary resorts of the law should be sufficient.  Even if an odd Mr. Campbell slips through the net, I think it is better than bringing in legislation of this kind.  As the Minister said, there are precedents for it, unfortunately, and I suppose there is nothing we can do.</P>

    <P>Section 12 of the Bill proposes to increase the maximum fine for a first offence to £50 and to provide for a maximum fine of £100 for a second <Col N="727" /> or subsequent offence, but in drafting it the provision for forfeiture of the apparatus was inadvertently omitted.  It is important that the provision for forfeiture of unlicensed apparatus should be retained and amendment No. 3 has this effect.  I might say that my Department normally presses for forfeiture only where unlicensed transmitting apparatus is concerned, or where a person has persistently refused to take out a licence in respect of receiving apparatus, and this will continue to be the position.</P>

      <P>The Minister agreed to reply to a point I raised on section 4, that is, in regard to the amount of information required partly under section 4 and certainly under the Schedule.  It seems to go beyond what might be regarded as reasonable requirements.  The Minister promised in the other House to have another look at the Schedule.  It requires what I would regard as a lot of personal or confidential information to be passed on to the Minister over and above the ordinary requirements of a sale or hire-purchase agreement.  It seems to go very much further in the field and to bring into the net, so to speak, people with quite a distant association with the transaction.

I might point out that there is provision in section 15 of the Bill for amending the Schedule by order, a draft of which would have to be approved by a resolution of each House of the Oireachtas before it could be made.  I would certainly consider making such an order after some experience of the operation of the measures in the Bill when my Department <Col N="729" /> would be in a better position to judge whether any of the items of information sought could be safely deleted without endangering collection of licence revenue.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Molloy) Robert Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is designed to do <Col N="730" /> two things.  Firstly it deals with the situation arising from the Supreme Court decision on the secrecy of the ballot and secondly it makes provision for assisting voters at the forthcoming referendum in relation to our accession to the European Economic Communities.</P>
      <P>As Senators are aware, a declaration was sought from the courts that certain provisions of the law relating to the election of Members of Dáil Éireann were contrary to the provisions of Article 16 of the Constitution which provides that voting at Dáil elections shall be by secret ballot.  The essence of the claim was that the practice of writing the elector's number on the counterfoil of his ballot paper taken in conjunction with the requirements that the ballot paper and counterfoil must bear the same serial number, that election documents must be retained for 12 months after an election and that ballot papers and counterfoils may be inspected on the order of the Dáil or the High Court made it possible after an election to trace the ballot paper used by an individual elector and ascertain how he voted and that this practice contravenes the constitutional provision in relation to secrecy. The Supreme Court ruled that the provision for marking the elector's number on the counterfoil of the ballot paper was contrary to Article 16 of the Constitution and the present Bill accordingly provides for the removal of this requirement from the law.</P>
      <P>Although the matter was not adverted to by the courts, I considered it desirable to remove also the requirement that the form of receipt signed by a postal voter should indicate the serial number of the ballot paper received by him.  It seemed to me that there was, in theory at least, a possibility of ascertaining, by reference to the form of receipt and the ballot paper, how an individual postal voter marked his ballot paper.  In future, therefore, a postal voter will simply acknowledge receipt of a ballot paper without specifying its number.  This change necessitates some minor consequential changes in the postal voting rules and these are also being made in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="731" /> The Constitution also provides that voting at Presidential and Seanad elections shall be by secret ballot.  A procedure identical with the Dáil election procedure for entering the elector's number on the counterfoil of his ballot paper is contained in each of these codes.  Although the constitutionality of the Presidential and Seanad electoral law was not questioned it is clearly necessary to make changes in these Acts corresponding to the changes proposed in the Dáil electoral law.  It was necessary to propose a further change in the law relating to the election of Panel Members of the Seanad.  The elector at an election of Panel Members is required to produce his voting papers to an authorised person&mdash;that is, Clerk or Assistant Clerk of the Dáil or Seanad, county registrar, city or county manager, county secretary or Garda superintendent&mdash; who witnesses the elector's signature on the declaration of identity and signs a certificate which is then attached to the envelope sent to the Seanad Returning Officer.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this arrangement is to make it impossible for anybody other than the elector to whom the particular ballot papers were sent to vote by means of these ballot papers. This safeguard will be somewhat weakened by the fact that the declaration of identity and the ballot paper envelope will no longer show the serial number of the ballot papers. Subsection (6) (e) of the Bill seeks to remedy this by requiring the authorised person to destroy each outer envelope&mdash;that is, the envelope addressed to the elector&mdash;produced to him and thus ensure that an elector, having already voted by means of his own papers, cannot subsequently produce his own outer envelope and another elector's ballot papers to a second authorised person.</P>
    <P>As Senators are aware, there is no specific provision in the Constitution requiring that referenda be conducted by secret ballot but I am sure they will agree that it is desirable that a vote at a referendum should enjoy the same protection of secrecy as a vote at a Dáil, Presidential or Seanad election, <Col N="732" /> and that the practice of writing the elector's number on the counterfoil should be dropped in the case of the referendum also.</P>
    <P>It will be seen that the Bill prescribes new forms of ballot papers for use at Dáil and Presidential elections and referenda.  These new forms are identical with the forms at present prescribed except that the space for the insertion of the voter's number on the counterfoil has been removed.</P>
    <P>While this Bill was before the Dáil, the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1971, which proposes to amend the Constitution in order to allow the State to become a member of the European Communities was passed by both Houses.  The Dáil agreed that the scope of the present Bill should be widened to provide for assisting electors at the referendum on the Constitutional Amendment Bill and the Dáil accepted a Committee Stage amendment proposed by me for this purpose.  The amendment appears at section 5 of the Bill now before the Seanad.  It provides that a special polling card containing a statement relating to the proposal for amendment of the Constitution will be sent to each elector, including postal voters.  The statement will also be displayed in and in the precincts of polling stations and presiding officers will be authorised to assist blind, incapacitated and illiterate voters by reading out this statement to them, where necessary, and asking them whether they wish to vote in favour of or against the proposal and then marking the ballot paper in accordance with the voter's answer.</P>
    <P>These arrangements are identical with those made by the Referendum (Amendment) Act, 1968, in relation to the referenda on the Third and Fourth Amendment of the Constitution Bills, 1968.  Similar arranagements had previously been made by the Rerefendum (Amendment) Act, 1959, in relation to the referendum held in that year. Under the law, the proposal which is the subject of the referendum must be stated on the ballot paper by citing by its Short Title the Bill containing the proposal passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  The Short Title, of <Col N="733" /> course, gives no real indication of what the proposal is about and, in the circumstances, I think the Seanad will agree that it is desirable that a statement relating to the proposal for amendment of the Constitution should be circulated for the information of voters, as was done in 1959 and 1968.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is one that will be welcomed by all Members of this House.  It has been introduced so as to comply with the recent ruling in the constitutional case in the Supreme Court.  Its effect mainly will be to stop the practice that obtained in all elections which have been held in this country so far whereby a number is entered on a ballot paper and another number is recorded on a counterfoil. The fear has been expressed many times in the past that because of the fact that the voter's number was also entered on the counterfoil it would be technically possible to trace in what way an elector had cast his vote.</P>
      <P>The effect of this Bill will almost one hundred per cent eliminate this doubt and this fear which existed.  Some of us have stood for election once or twice and the practicality of the thing is that suggestions were always made, or could always be made, that a person's voting pattern could be traced through the system.  Consequently, I think the House ought to welcome the decision of the Supreme Court and to congratulate the private individuals who introduced that action so as to have this matter clarified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although I do not think it is mentioned in the Minister's brief, I understand that other amendments are to be introduced by way of a new order or regulation in connection with the holding of local authority elections.  I think it would be as well if that point were clarified.  Concern has been expressed, I think, that the serial number should still be left on the ballot paper and it has been suggested that there is in fact no need to have a number recorded on the ballot paper.  I think the Minister's answer to that has been that it is necessary to have each ballot paper numbered so as to prevent anybody from placing illegal papers in the ballot box.  If there was a query after the count, he suggested <Col N="734" /> that it would be impossible to distinguish between the illegal paper and the genuine one if the genuine papers had not a number on them.</P>
    <P>However, I should like to suggest to the House and to the Minister that the stamp which is embossed or perforated on the ballot paper would be a sure method of verifying which was an authentic paper and which was not. In this day and age it is very easy to get a document printed virtually instantly and a copy of a paper could be made within an hour of the opening of the polling booths.  It certainly would not be as easy as that to have an embossed stamp and die made.  I suggest that the stamp itself should be sufficient without using any serial numbers whatsoever.  It was gone into in great detail in the other House as to whether the stamp should emboss or perforate.  The suggestion was rightly made that very often the embossing procedure is bad and the results faint and that it slows up the count to a considerable extent while the doubtful votes are being checked. May I suggest to the Minister that a system might be employed whereby the stamp would not only emboss but would also ink the paper?  This ought to make it very evident at first glance if the paper was a genuine one.</P>
    <P>Perhaps one of the most important changes which this Bill brings about is to eliminate to some extent the fear which has always existed in the minds of postal voters that their votes were readily traceable because of the strange method which has obtained whereby their votes had to be placed in an outer envelope and a number placed on that envelope.  I understand that the effect of this Bill will be that when postal votes are now cast they will be dropped unopened and unchecked and uncounted into a ballot box which will subsequently be counted in conjunction with the main count.  The Minister has stated that he has issued an instruction that postal votes should be counted face down when they are being opened.  This should maintain the secrecy of the vote.</P>
    <P>There seems to be some confusion in this regard.  If I have read his remarks correctly, the Minister stated that postal votes should be counted <Col N="735" /> face down and that all other votes should be counted face up.  There seems to be a contradiction in this.  Those who have been at election counts know that, while votes may be counted face upwards, often when the box is opened and the votes are being unfolded and checked in bundles of 50 or 100, they are usually counted face downwards. It might be better if there was a uniformity of approach to this.</P>
    <P>The suggestion has been made that in small polling stations, where serial numbers will still be embossed on the ballot papers, it would subsequently be possible to check in which way a person had voted.  A personation agent who had entered against his register the sequence in which the local people had voted and subsequently checked the sequence of numbers on the backs of the papers as they were being opened and checked and then checked the votes on the fronts of the papers as they were being counted, could find out how a person voted.  This, however, would be virtually impossible at most counts, but the Minister can deal with it when replying.</P>
    <P>It is incomprehensible that with all the resources of Government and with all the printing firms, the size of the number which is stamped on the back of the ballot papers cannot be made smaller than 14-point type.  Fourteen-point type is larger than is used in the Dáil or Seanad Official Reports.  It is larger than is used in the body of the text of any newspaper.  It is a larger type than would be used in the text of a hand circular.  It should not be technically impossible to have at least a reduction in the size of the print of the numbers, if the elimination of those numbers is found to be undesirable.</P>
    <P>I understand the Minister has in mind the introduction at some future date of a comprehensive review and reform of the whole electoral system. May I take this opportunity of commenting that it seems again incomprehensible that the count which takes place after an election should take so long and that it should all be carried out by hand?  In certain areas the returning officers are far less helpful to the candidates and their agents than they are in other areas.  There is a great <Col N="736" /> lack of uniformity in the approach towards the small details of staging an election and towards the very important details, both small and large, of conducting the count.</P>
    <P>The Minister should circulate to all returning officers a standard set of rules and procedures and copies of the relevant Acts and perhaps an explanatory memorandum as to what they entail, with also a directive that copies of that circular should be made available to the election agent of each candidate. There is nothing worse than having election agents in conflict for the duration of the count with the returning officer.  At such times everyone suffers enough tension without having the further annoyance of different people interpreting the election machinery rules differently.  This could be clarified and the clarification made available to the election agents on behalf of the candidates.</P>
    <P>The introduction of section 5, even at a late stage in the Dáil, was a good thing.  There is a definite difficulty relating to the holding of referenda.  The people may not be clear as to what they are actually voting about and whether by voting &ldquo;yes&rdquo; they are really casting their votes in the way they want to.  I welcome the Bill.</P>

      <P>I thank the Seanad for the reception given to the Bill. I should like to clarify the position relating to local authorities.  I referred to this when dealing with the Bill in the Dáil.  The law governing the holding of local elections can be changed by way of regulations and this will be done before the next local elections are held.  In this way the voter's number shall not appear on the counterfoil of ballot papers at local elections.</P>
      <P>The Senator referred to the practice of deciding whether a vote was valid or not by way of the stamp.  A ballot paper could be in dispute because of the mark itself and this has happened in many cases where the question of whether the paper had been officially stamped with the official embossing required was in some doubt.  In such a case it would be impossible to identify the exact vote afterwards unless the serial number was retained on the back of the ballot paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="737" /> The Senator mentioned the use of some ink on the mark as well as the embossing.  This may be a good suggestion and will be considered for future legislation.</P>
    <P>On the question of postal votes, it is true that with these changes it will not be possible to discover the trend of voting when postal votes are being opened.  This has been an undesirable aspect of postal voting and where only specific categories of persons are entitled to postal votes I have felt it was unfair that when their votes were being opened it could be seen which way they had voted.  This interfered with the secrecy of the ballot and the whole principle of secrecy in voting. With the removal of the voter's number on the register of electors from the counterfoil and the necessity to check the ballot paper against the number on the declaration of identity, it will not now be necessary for the returning officer to unfold the ballot papers when opening the ballot box containing postal votes.  This is a very desirable thing.</P>

      <P>No.  The Senator is a bit confused about the regulations governing the counting of votes.  The instructions are that ballot papers shall be counted face upwards.  The Senator seems to imply that this applies only in the case of postal votes.  It applies in the case of all ballot papers that the counting of them shall be done face upwards.  The numbers are not visible to persons watching the count. In that way the question of the number indicating the manner in which a person voted does not arise.</P>

      <P>The returning officer, in making arrangements for the counting of the votes, need not necessarily open the postal votes.  Before counting they must be mixed in with the other votes.  This is done in many places.  You still would not be able to discover the trend of voting among postal voters.</P>
      <P>The question of 14-point type was raised in the Dáil discussions.  I explained quite clearly that in the printing of ballot papers for the referendum, which it would be reasonable to assume will be the next election that will be held and which will necessitate the printing of the next lot of ballot papers quite soon, a practical difficulty has arisen in that arrangements have been made with a printer in Dublin already, although a firm contract has not been given for the work. This cannot be done until an order is signed.  At the same time I have made inquiries and the information available to me is that there is not any printer who would be in a position to print 2,000,000 ballot papers in smaller type in the required time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no printer with a numbering machine smaller than 14-point type.  It is not that big.  It is about a fifth of an inch, so I do not think we should let our imagination run away with us in relation to the size of the <Col N="739" /> number.  There was a lengthy discussion on this subject in the Dáil.  I accept the fact that the size is not small.  I indicated that I would have a look at this matter and, if necessary, see what arrangements could be made to ensure that smaller numberings were used at future elections, but I could not tie my hands with the holding of a referendum so imminent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator may have some knowledge of printing but the point system is a way of indicating the size of certain print.  There are also about 5,000 type faces.  With this type variety you can get a different impression from different size figures.  The thickness of the lines in the lettering has a lot to do with their legibility. I do not wish to go too deeply into this question.  For the time being I cannot do anything about getting a smaller type than 14-point, but I am anxious to try to reduce the size of these numbers for future elections.</P>
      <P>The Senator complained about the length of time it takes to count votes. The simple explanation is that we are operating under the proportional representation system which has its own complications and necessitates a careful and slow system of counting.  There is not much we can do to speed it up.</P>
      <P>I take the Senator's point in relation to publishing for the information of election agents, candidates and persons working at elections, a booklet or document setting out in some detail the laws and regulations governing the holding of these elections.  This would be very desirable and I will look into that point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 1 contains the amendments of the law relating to Dáil elections.  It removes the requirement that the elector's number be marked on the counterfoil of the ballot paper handed to him in the polling station or, in the case of a postal voter, issued to him through the post.  It extends to all ballot papers, whether they are valid or invalid, the obligation that, if the Dáil or High Court orders an inspection of ballot papers after an election, the mode in which any elector voted may not be discovered.  The section prescribes a new form of ballot paper for Dáil elections. This is identical with the form at present prescribed except that the space for the insertion of the voter's number is removed.  These amendments simply remove from the law the parts declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Paragraph (f) relates to postal votes and the Minister pointed out, before the tea break, that there was some confusion existing in my mind in relation to this.  Perhaps there is because the Bill is being taken very hurriedly and I did not have too <Col N="741" /> much time to check the Minister's earlier remarks.  My distinct impression is that the procedure now in relation to postal votes would be that the postal votes would be removed from their outer envelope and placed within a ballot box without being unfolded and checked.  It was this procedure which gave the political party agents the opportunity of getting either a rough or an exact calculation, depending on how good the agents were, as to how the postal voters had in fact voted.</P>
      <P>That will be changed and the postal votes will be dropped unopened into a ballot box, which will then be sent to the counting centre for the remainder of the count for that constituency.  As the Minister well knows when the box for, let us say, Clifden, is opened, the votes which are usually folded in four, are unfolded and counted.  Sometimes they are unfolded and placed face downwards, which means that the political checkers have no idea what way those votes are going.  They are often placed face upwards.  If they are, that gives the representatives of the political parties a fair opportunity of assessing what way Clifden voted. Following this the votes are placed with an amalgam of other votes and it becomes impossible for people at the count to see what way Clifden voted.  The opportunity presented to them to check on how the good citizens of the town of Clifden voted is when the ballot box is opened and the votes unfolded and checked off against the presiding officer's returns.</P>
      <P>With postal votes the objection was that they were opened and checked the night before and this procedure enabled the political parties to ascertain the night before how the postal voters had voted, in the same way as they would ascertain the following day how the voters of Clifden had voted. Now the Minister says that that should not happen and the unfolded votes of the postal voters should be dropped into a ballot box.  That ballot box would be sent along to the general count and would then be opened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want an assurance from the Minister in regard to this.  When the ballot box is opened at the general count it will contain a number of unfolded votes.  The tellers will have to <Col N="742" /> open up those postal votes and straighten them out.  In the same way that the political tellers will know that the ballot box for Clifden is being opened, they will now know that the box for the postal voters is being opened.  They will be able to check in the same way as heretofore, except that it will be one day later, what way the postal voters in West Galway have voted.  The precautions the Minister has built into the Bill will not help the postal voters to any great extent because the TDs for West Galway will still have a very clear idea of the approximate political affiliations of the Army and Garda in the constituency of West Galway.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>What I referred to earlier as being objectionable is the counting and checking of postal votes at a time and place before the counting and checking of the rest of the votes.  Because of this separate counting and checking the trend of Garda and Army voting patterns is available a day before the other ballot boxes are opened and the count proper begins. This happened in a certain constituency in a recent by-election when publicity was given to the voting trends of the postal votes cast by Army and Garda personnel.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>In other words, the Minister has come to terms with the problem.  Up to this the votes of the members of the Army and the Garda could be approximately ascertained the day before the count.  As the Minister will recall, before we broke for tea he pointed out that he thought it was a bad thing that the voting pattern <Col N="743" /> of a group of people, or people who were employed in a particular walk of life, in one constituency should be ascertained by the political parties. What I have said, and what the Minister's reply has confirmed, is that that voting pattern, unfortunately, may still be ascertained one day later.  In the course of the count, in the same way that the political party representatives can confirm or ascertain the approximate voting pattern for the town of Clifden when the ballot box for the town of Clifden is opened, when the box for the postal voters is opened they will also be able to ascertain the approximate voting pattern of the postal voters.  This still leaves the postal voters in a strange position in relation to the voting population of the country.  They are the only social or economic group whose votes and whose political preferences can be clearly ascertained.</P>
      <P>I am afraid, whether by accident or by design, the amendment which the Minister has introduced does not counteract that.  My assumption of what the Minister said earlier&mdash;he later told me I was wrong in assuming it&mdash;would have counteracted it.  That assumption was that the ballot papers which were extracted from the postal vote box should be counted face downwards, because they represented not a community where there was a disparity of social classes and employment&mdash;it is quite right that such votes should be counted face upwards&mdash;but people who are either members of the Army or members of the Garda force. Such votes should be counted face downwards to prevent the political tellers getting an indication of how those two extremely important groups voted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When one considers, especially in present times, the great importance of our Army and our Garda force in preserving and safeguarding national security it is important that their voting patterns should not become apparent to the political parties.  This is not a political point.  We all know what the voting patterns of the postal voters have been over the years.  Nevertheless, I think it would be better if we did not know their voting patterns in <Col N="744" /> the future.  That can be easily ensured by directing that the votes in the postal ballot box are counted in a face downwards position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotHonan" hpid="Mr. Honan Mr. Honan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>Great emphasis has been put on postal votes.  Unless I am greatly mistaken&mdash;and I have some experience of filling in those papers and representing candidates at the filling of them&mdash;there are various practices and various ways of dealing with postal votes.  If my memory serves me right, a man in the Army or in the Garda gets his voting paper, puts it into a plain envelope and then places that envelope in another envelope on which appears his number and the number of the ballot paper.  The returning officer sends for the agents for the count, usually the night before the election. He counts the number of papers and the number of envelopes.  He then opens the envelopes and takes out the plain envelopes.  If the count is not right they are put aside and are kept in the custody of the returning officer. They are not opened there and then. This has been my practical experience of it.  These papers are not opened until the count.  By that time the outside covering envelope has been destroyed so that it is impossible to identify who voted what way, whether he is a garda, a soldier, or anything else.</P>
      <P>It seems to me, from what I have heard Senator Boland saying, that there are other procedures working in different ways in other places.  We should aim at getting standard practices not alone for postal votes but for all the activities of the returning officers, so that everything is carried out uniformly throughout the country. Then we would not appear to have these suggested anomalies.  After an election many people are accused of illegalities, but from my experience of elections the returning officer has always acted in the most responsible way.  There may be differences in procedures, and it might improve matters if we had one set of procedures for the whole country.  So far as the postal vote is concerned, if the returning officer does his job properly there is not any way in which a vote can be identified.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think Senator Boland was making the point that you could identify a particular vote.  What he was pointing out was that you could identify the votes of two very important groups of people, namely, the Army and the Garda, who are charged with the security of the State.  After an election it can be bandied about the country that they are either &ldquo;pro&rdquo; or &ldquo;anti&rdquo; whatever party was elected to the Government in that particular election.  I think this is an important point.  It is a very simple procedure to guard against that charge by counting the votes face downwards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite right that where there is a mixed community of shopkeepers, farmers, teachers, unemployed, labourers, market gardeners, truck drivers, and so on, their votes should be presented, face upwards, on the counting table.  It is quite fair that the political parties and anyone else who wants to see those votes being turned out should know approximately what strength each party had in that area.</P>
      <P>I can remember a town in which I worked in a by-election where I was very pleased to go back afterwards and congratulate them on the fact that it was the first time in 30 years that that town had voted for my party instead of for the Government party.  I knew that because of the fact that the tellers on behalf of my party at the by-election count were able to see all those votes being turned out.  However, I was not able to go back and tell them that the publicans in that particular town had voted 60 per cent for my party, 35 per cent for the Government and 5 per cent for the Labour Party.  I could not distinguish the publicans as one social group from the farmers or from the labourers or from anybody else, because all of their votes were mixed together in one box and they had voted on one electoral register representing that town.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have had experience of elections around Dublin and of by-elections in rural areas.  The first difference I have heard about is Senator Honan's experience. If the method of counting votes in County Clare is strange, so also perhaps <Col N="746" /> is the voting pattern.  Perhaps it is not typical of the country.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>In the postal vote in most constituencies that I have come across, certainly in all of the Dublin constituencies the outer envelope is opened, the inner envelope is opened, and the postal votes, which are folded in four, are opened out flat, placed face upwards and counted one after the other.  This is to ascertain if there are as many ballot papers produced as there were outer and inner envelopes. In other words, the figures should correspond.  In the course of opening those ballot papers and placing them flat, face upwards, on the table the political agents who are watching are able to ascertain quite well what proportion of that vote went to their candidate. For instance, I know in my constituency what way the members of the Army and the Garda voted in percentage terms.  I know in what way they voted in the adjoining constituency. I know that the figures are available to me of what way they voted in every one of the city of Dublin constituencies in the last general election. I do not think those figures should be available to me.  In the same way, I think it would be very wrong if I knew the way in which all the farmers in the constituency of Clare-Galway had voted, or how all the shopkeepers in the same constituency had voted.  It is especially wrong when one realises that the two particular groups about whom we are talking are the people charged with preserving the security of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's amendment in section 1 goes a small way towards helping the position, because from now on the envelopes will be opened and the unfolded postal votes will be dropped into a ballot box.  That ballot box will then be consigned to the place of the count and opened on the following day in conjunction with the opening of the boxes from the various towns and villages.  Nonetheless, when <Col N="747" /> that ballot box is opened, the papers which are taken out will still have to be unfolded.  When they are being unfolded and placed face upwards on the table, the political teller will still be able to see them and will be able to ascertain the percentage voting pattern of the members of the Army and of the Garda.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to detain the House any further or to prolong the discussion, but the simple solution that I am suggesting to the Minister is that, when the votes are being taken out of the postal ballot box and unfolded, they should be unfolded and placed face downwards.  Care should then be taken that those votes which have been placed face downwards, after having been checked off against the total number of postal votes cast, should be placed into the bulk of the remainder of the votes and that nobody, whether they be the Fine Gael teller, the Fianna Fáil teller, or anybody else, should be able to say afterwards in what way the Army or Garda have voted in any particular constituency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we should be careful not to let our imagination run away with us here, because we could extend this into the realms of the ridiculous.  I am concerned about the counting of these postal votes, which are available to these two classes of persons, on a separate and a different day from the rest of the ballot papers. Therefore, it was open, up to now, for comment to be made on the trend. What will happen now is that they will all go into the count and they will be counted there with all the other boxes containing ballot papers, and will be checked in the normal way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Senator suggests that the postal votes should be counted face downwards, thereby exposing the number, which is the very thing we are trying to conceal.  I spent some time listening to arguments of his colleagues in the Dáil.  They were of the opinion that the numbers should not be seen and that they should be printed in the smallest possible print.  The suggestion is coming to me now that I should have these votes counted face downwards for postal voters only.  This runs contrary <Col N="748" /> to the other arguments I heard.  I am of the opinion&mdash;and the law provides for this&mdash;that it is better to have the votes counted face upwards so that the number is not exposed at any time during the counting and checking of votes.  The Electoral Act, 1963, section 41, reads as follows:</P>
    <P>The Returning Officer, while counting and recording the number of ballot papers shall keep the ballot papers with their faces upwards and shall take all proper precautions for preventing any person from seeing the numbers printed on the backs of such papers.</P>
    <P>When I said we should not extend this to the realm of the ridiculous, what I meant was that I know of islands where there are small communities and where the voting is carried out a few days before the voting elsewhere, but the votes are all counted on the same day.  When these boxes are opened and checked it is easy to determine the trend of voting on these islands.  This is so in any ballot box containing a small number of voting papers.  We should not try to extend the provisions too far, because we are anxious to maintain the secrecy of the individual ballot.  We want to keep secret the way in which any individual voted and that is being done under the present system. I do not see any great problem arising in this matter.</P>

We, the political parties, will still be able to ascertain to within 2 or 3 per cent what way the members of the Army and the Garda force have voted in any particular constituency. At any time that is a bad thing but when one realises how important those voters are from the point of view of preserving national security, it is particularly unfortunate the Minister would not see the merit in directing that those votes alone should be counted face downwards.</P>

      <P>This is the section which introduces the appropriate amendments regarding voting for the Seanad.  It is, of course, of particular interest to everybody here, with the exception of those who are lucky enough to be here without having to go through the process of standing for election.  One of the main changes is that the authorised person who now witnesses a Seanad elector's vote is obliged to take and destroy the outer envelope.  Could the Minister explain to us how he is satisfied that the obligation to destroy that outer envelope is a mandatory one or what penalties or sanctions can be imposed upon a person who does not take and destroy that envelope?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The same comment can be made about section 3 as was made about section 1.  I do not know what it indicates.  Does it indicate the social thinking of the parliamentary draftsman or of the Attorney General or of the Department of Local Government? When one looks at the candidates on the specimen ballot paper in section 3 one sees that they are the same candidates as appear on other specimen ballot papers.  Section 3 produces a specimen ballot paper for a Presidential election and the mythical candidates are the same ones as appear on the specimen ballot paper for a Dáil election in section 1.  One assumes that none of them was elected because they are all standing for the Presidential election.  When one looks at their occupation one sees the names of James Doyle, a builder, James Doyle, a chemist, and James Lynch, a grocer. There is Séamus Ó Briain, oide scoile, which I suppose is a schoolteacher.  It is not too long since I was at school and he was then a muinteoir, but now he is an oide-scoile.  The next fellow, of course, is a barrister and he is followed immediately by a solicitor, and after that there is a gentleman.  It is quite difficult to find these in an electoral panel sometimes.  He is followed by a farmer.  I do not know whether it is indicative of the thinking of the Parliamentary draftsman or not, but certainly the occupations which are specified for all of these mythical candidates are very comfortable ones.  There is neither a poor, honest-to-God working-man, nor a labouring man.  The candidates are all people who are of much the same social class.  I just wondered if this was in any way indicative of the thinking of the people who draft these Bills, or whether they think that these are the type of people for whom they should be catering when they are compiling legislation like this.</P>

      <P>Under section 5 what will happen is this.  Each elector presently on the electoral register, in advance of going to cast his vote at the coming referendum on entry to EEC, will get a card which will assist him by explaining to him what the casting of his vote will mean and whether by voting &ldquo;yes&rdquo; he is in favour of the EEC or whether by voting &ldquo;yes&rdquo; he is committing the country to staying out of the Community.  As I said on Second Stage, I think this is a very useful amendment to introduce.  Indeed, because of the strange legal technicalities which oblige us whenever a referendum is being held to phrase the ballot paper in very terse technical and legal jargon, which is not easily understood by the ordinary elector, it might be useful if, at any time in the future when a referendum is being mooted, a short Bill were introduced to permit the Government to send out informative cards such as this.  I know it has been done once before.  It would be a good idea in connection with any amendment of the Constitution.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>This is of course the change because the declaration of identity will no longer have the ballot paper serial number written on it.  In order to make it impossible for anybody other than the elector to vote in a Seanad election, we have devised this method.  It should prove fairly effective.  The outer envelope in which the ballot papers are forwarded to the elector shall be presented to the presiding officer or to the prescribed person, who shall thereupon destroy it, after the person has voted.  This is a precaution against persons coming into possession of ballot papers which are legally the property of another elector, thus voting twice.  It will act as a deterrent towards anybody attempting to vote twice in Seanad elections.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but I think we should take all precautions against it. Removal of the number does weaken the protection afforded.  Therefore, by insisting on this procedure, I think we are guaranteeing against fraud.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>What obligation or form of checking is there upon the authorised person to destroy the outer envelope?  The authorised persons are fine, upstanding people like county managers and other local dignatories. Is the Minister suggesting that any of them would wilfully decide not to destroy the outer envelope?  They could easily be discarded and retrieved again. It is just a small point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of persons before whom you may vote, as I have already mentioned.  They are the Clerk or Assistant Clerk of the Dáil or Seanad, the county registrar, the city or county manager, the county secretary or a Garda superintendent.  Such person will be obliged by law, once this Bill becomes law, to destroy the outer envelope.  That is the only guarantee I can give the Senator.  The prescribed <Col N="753" /> person is obliged to comply with the law.  A person has his ordinary rights under the electoral law to bring an election petition if doubt arises.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already explained it.  We are making it important now because each elector will receive his ballot paper in an official envelope, which will be sent to him by the returning officer.  When he goes before the prescribed person he is now obliged to bring the other envelope with him and the prescribed person must destroy that once the ballot papers have been duly dealt with by him.  This places an obstacle against any person attempting to vote twice in his own name, the second time with somebody else's ballot papers.</P>
