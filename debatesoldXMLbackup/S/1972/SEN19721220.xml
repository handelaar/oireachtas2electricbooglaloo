      <P>In reply to Senator West, I propose to arrange a time early in the New Year for the purposes which he has in mind.  With regard to Motion No. 19, the Senator will remember I suggested during a recent debate that the question raised in that motion might be discussed during the passage of the Bill on the European Communities and I do not see any point in taking it now.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. J. Fitzgerald Mr. J. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>While I do not give the Bill the welcome it received in so many quarters since it was first published, that does not mean that I oppose it.  However, during 30 years as a member of a county council, quite a number of rate collectors have been appointed.  If I were to applaud this <Col N="1424" /> Bill I would be false to myself and to those in whose appointment I took a part.</P>
      <P>I agree that the system was bad and that it was a responsibility that no public representative wanted.  At the same time, it was a responsibility that we all accepted when we went forward for election.  When a rate collector post became vacant, due to the retirement or death of a rate collector, a new appointment had to be made.  Every member on that local authority was under severe pressure not alone from the political party of which he was a member but also from friends and people in other organisations.</P>
      <P>The good thing about it was that when the appointment was made at a council meeting it was generally done in the open and if you made a promise to a person that you were going to support him you could not back out because the local papers would publish who so-and-so voted for.  That was one good condition of the appointment of rate collectors.  It is true to say that rate collectors were appointed on a political basis.  It is also true to say that 95 per cent of the members of the local authorities were elected on a political basis.  As a member of a small party, to be able to get a member of my own party elected as a rate collector, I saw nothing wrong with the system.</P>
      <P>While the accusation of political appointments and political graft were bandied around the place in many of the appointments that were made in my local authority I have seen members of the council from the three different political parties voting for a particular appointee and members of the three particular parties again voting for somebody who was the runner-up. Could that be described as a political appointment merely because those of us who are members of a local authority also happened to be members of political parties?  We could be accused of having appointed rate collectors on a political basis.  I make no apology for that.  The record has proved that no matter what basis rate collectors were appointed on they all have been a credit to those who appointed them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1425" /> As a member of a local authority who has taken part in a number of appointments, I am proud of all the people I helped to have elected.  I am also proud of those who were appointed in whose campaign I played no part. They are all giving excellent service and nobody can accuse any of them of ever having abused their powers as rate collectors in the interest of any political party.  I know of one rate collector in my own county whom I voted for and whom I knew was an active member of another political party who has stood in at least two or three general elections since he was appointed a rate collector.  He has given great service as a rate collector and nobody could ever accuse him of ever using his influence as a rate collector in any political way.</P>
    <P>It has been a difficult task for members of local authorities down the years. If I were to throw my hat in the air and applaud this Bill I would be saying we have taken part in a sham over the 30 years that I have been a member of a local authority.  This was the system of appointing rate collectors.  Why it was left that way I do not know.  It was a responsibility that every member of a local authority accepted and had to take part in.  If I were to applaud it now I would be saying that what I did down the years was not correct.</P>
    <P>An attempt was made to introduce the system of office collection in the county council of which I am a member. I and the majority of the members of the county council opposed it on the basis that a system of collecting from the office was impersonal.  The rate collector's task can be a difficult one. It may not be as difficult in 1972 as it was in 1942 or 1952 when money was scarce and people were finding it difficult to pay the small amount of rates. Rate collectors, knowing the circumstances of the people from whom they collected rates, adopted a very humane attitude.  They did not press people to pay up by the 31st March or 30th September so that they could have their percentage collected to qualify for the high bonus.</P>
    <P>It is well known to any Senator here who is a member of a local authority that in many cases the rate collector paid the rates out of his own <Col N="1426" /> pocket and, perhaps, had to wait one month to collect the money from that ratepayer afterwards.  In many cases you had a situation where a farmer might be compelled to sell stock in March so that he would have the money to pay the rates before the 31st March.  If he sold at that time, perhaps, he would be selling at a lower price than he would get in April or May. In many ways rate collectors helped that type of person.  If we were to have a system of collecting rates from the office, I doubt if that opportunity would have been given to any ratepayer. The rates must be available on the day they are due.  For that reason I oppose the office collection system.  It is fine to say that the ESB collect rents this way or to point out that annuities are collected in this way.  If you find at the end of the year that where the rate collector collects the rates you have a collection of 98 per cent to 99.5 per cent, this proves that it will be difficult to find a better way than the system of collection that has been in operation.</P>
    <P>About ten or 12 years ago on my council, shortly after a councillor was elected he found himself confronted with the problem of having to take part in the election of a rate collector. Being new to public life, he found that it was a difficult task because so many of his friends came to him and because it was an open ballot he could not promise them all number one.  He had a brainwave and put down a notice of motion at a council meeting that the best way of appointing the rate collectors was not by open ballot but by secret ballot.  A man should be prepared to put his money where his mouth is.  It would be very easy in a secret ballot to promise all your friends you would support them.  If they got one vote you were let off the hook.</P>

      <P>It was defeated at the county council meeting and the appointment remained at it was.  The passing of this Bill will make the appointment of rate collectors a managerial function.  Managers may not be <Col N="1427" /> too pleased with the extra responsibility but the members of the local authorities will be pleased at being relieved of the responsibility.  The reason for the change in the system appears to be that councillors are not to be trusted with this type of appointment.  During the year a few county councillors made the headlines as a result of their activities in the appointment of rate collectors. We should not think that one swallow makes a summer and if one or two appointments were wrong this does not mean all of them were wrong.</P>
      <P>Are we to have a change in the system of other appointments with which members of local authorities are entrusted?  County committees of agriculture make a lot of appointments, even though only temporary ones.  They appoint agricultural advisers, horticultural instructors and domestic economy instructors.  I have never heard any insinuations of anything wrong taking place in regard to these appointments yet there is a great similarity between the appointment of rate collectors and agricultural instructors.  The vocational committees are entrusted with the appointment of teachers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>There has never been any accusation made that the appointments made by vocational committees were in any way wrong.  I deplore some of the accusations made in another place during the discussion on this Bill.  Senator Boland stated these were made by people who were never members of a local authority and who would not offer their services as such.  They know nothing about what happens on county councils.  It was bad form on their part to make statements about members of local authorities.  No matter to which political party they belong they are giving a service and unlike us they get little <Col N="1428" /> reward for this service.  It is bad enough to hear that type of talk from people who are not in public life, the type of talk one hears in the pub or at the street corner, but when one hears elected representatives of the Oireachtas making these sorts of charges and insinuations it is very bad form.</P>
      <P>I and many of us here who have spent years on a local authority have been rewarded by being elected to the Seanad where we get an allowance.  It is only a small minority of members of local authorities who are fortunate enough to be elected either to the Dáil or the Seanad.  There are hundreds of members of local authorities who have given honest service to the people and it is a pity that charges of this kind should be levelled at any one of them.</P>
      <P>I am not opposing the Bill but I am not so enthusiastic about it as other Members of the Oireachtas have been. It is a relief to many county councillors to be relieved of the responsibility of appointing rate collectors.  No county councillor should be in any way ashamed or feel guilty for having taken part in the appointment of rate collectors.  They have done their job as they saw it.  It was not a pleasant task at any time and for the one you please ten are displeased.  As Senator Boland pointed out yesterday, where appointments were made by local authorities all the appointees have been a credit to the local authorities and whatever their policies I am proud of those elected in my county as they are serving the people well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill. I have spent many years as a senior official of a local authority. This has given me the opportunity of hearing the views of county councillors, managers and the public on the method of selecting rate collectors.  I agree with what has been said here, that when this was held as a reserved function of the county council it did create a certain amount of surprise and a great deal of embarrassment.  I have no hesitation in saying that through the years the county council, made up as my council was of members of the three major political parties, were most anxious to have this responsibility taken from <Col N="1429" /> them because it caused embarrassment. Nobody who has worked as closely with the county council as I did will disagree with what has been said. Excellent officers have been appointed and have given devoted service.  If the present system continued, the same thing would operate.  Times have changed.  Now there is an almost complete change back to county council management.</P>
      <P>Health services have been brought under the scope of the health boards. County managers are now dealing purely and simply with local government. It appears reasonable that county managers face up to the new responsibility of making those appointments, particularly as I believe the amount of work has been reduced by at least 50 per cent.  A shift of responsibility from those who were embarrassed by it to a paid official is a good thing, although I regret many things that have been said regarding this matter in another place.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senators J. Fitzgerald and Boland that appointments have been made on a political basis.  Human nature being what it is, this was unavoidable. In the future when appointments are made under a different system, as outlined in this Bill, the people appointed will continue to belong to one political party or another. They will not have been selected for that reason but they will naturally have their own political affiliations.  Criticism was made of the rate collectors that they abused their office as regards putting people on the franchise list.  This criticism is completely unjust.  The work of the rate collectors was reviewed by the revision courts when the provisional lists were circulated to every member of the county council and of the Oireachtas.  The members of the Oireachtas and the county council were advised to study carefully those provisional lists.  If they found some names which should not be there they came before the revision courts and objected. If they found names omitted it was their responsibility as public representatives to see that those names were put on the franchise list.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nobody could suggest that the wrong people have been appointed.  In an <Col N="1430" /> ordinary country district any one of 20, 30 or 40 people of any political party or ten, 20 or 30 of each political party might apply for a position as rate collector. If elected any one of those men would prove an excellent choice for the post because they were essentially honest and interested in the people.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator McGlinchey's point that it was not so much the fact that you had to support a political candidate but the fact that you had to disappoint ten or 20 of your own supporters and eventually select one to go forward for the support of your party that made the situation difficult.  It was an embarrassment.  Under the system now proposed we may not get people who are any better.  The rate collectors who were appointed were of a very high standard and this was proved by their work.  A motion was put down that this Bill should not get a Second Reading unless it was the intention of the Government that the appointments be made by the Local Appointments Commissioners.  This system of appointment was very severely and unjustly criticised.  I wish to put on record that the highest standard of integrity and honesty was the hallmark of the Local Appointments Commissioners.  Possibly very few people here have acted on selection boards.  I have acted on a number of selection boards and have experience of the approach of the people who were appointed on those boards.  Nobody could conceive of a more correct, honest or justifiable approach.</P>
    <P>It has been said in the other House that members of a selection board were known and approached.  I have never heard of any member of an appointment board having been approached or interfered with by a candidate or otherwise. I have never heard any complaint from those who were on appointment boards.  I do not believe any such approach was made but if it were it would be considered as a very serious matter and the candidate would bear the full consequences.</P>
    <P>The procedure with regard to the selection of appointment boards is that the appropriate officers of a local authority are asked by the Local Appointments Commissioners if they <Col N="1431" /> would be available to sit on an appointment board during a particular period.  If available they notify the commissioners accordingly and attend on the particular day in Upper O'Connell Street.  It is only then they meet the other members of the board. They do not know prior to that who will be on the board.  The board then decides on a certain line of approach and the qualifications which the candidate must have for the particular position offered.  If a person does not meet the minimum standard he is automatically disqualified no matter what other qualifications he may have. The board do not know who the candidates are.  Before a candidate is interviewed the board receive a copy of his application form with his qualifications and number but no name.  If at that stage a member of the board knows a candidate he will make this fact known to the other members and they will decide whether he should remain and interview the candidate or not.</P>
    <P>The type of office for which the appointment boards are particularly suited is in connection with professional people.  Most of the professional people will have university degrees. They may have a pass, first or second class honours degree, therefore they will not be on an equal level.  Before the interview the board must allot a certain number of marks, say, 90 per cent out of 150 marks for a pass, 115 per cent for first class honours and 105 per cent for a second class honours.  The candidate may have two degrees.  For example, an engineer could have a B.Sc. degree.  He will have a higher qualification.  Somebody else may have a master's degree.  He will have an even higher qualification and so on.  Therefore, the board are dealing with people whose academic qualifications range from a pass to a master's degree.  How will this system compare with that in which a boy coming from the country with an ordinary national school education is interviewed by the board having already been examined locally and placed according to his examination marks?</P>
    <P>The board also assess, in addition to <Col N="1432" /> degree qualifications, the knowledge a candidate has gained by experience and the efforts he has made to improve his knowledge since qualifying.  They consider the associations to which he belongs and the magazines and technical journals to which he subscribes.  He is also questioned on the contribution made to his experience by his employment. Finally the board takes into account the candidate's suitability for that particular position.  If a candidate has all the necessary qualifications but is not suited to, say, a post in Tourma-keady where he would be in contact with the local community, he would not be considered.  How can all these factors relate to the appointment of rate collectors?</P>
    <P>The present position in regard to the appointment of rate collectors is that a local board would be set up to examine the qualifications and to see that there is a minimum standard of education and suitability for the job.  I agree with the suggestion that it would be wise to limit the area for recruitment in the regulations.  It would be very undesirable to appoint a rate collector from Wexford to the Connemara area.  A local recruitment area would be desirable. In that connection, the examining board should be from some county other than the area in which recruitment is taking place.  Once the candidates have been examined by a competent board and a recommendation made to the county manager, it is his responsibility to select and appoint the best man, particularly in view of the fact that the officer appointed will be working directly under him.</P>
    <P>It is up to the county manager, even for his own personal ends, to select and appoint the best man.  I have no doubt whatsoever that the present system has proved an embarrassment.  I have no doubt whatsoever that members of local authorities of all shades of political thought are anxious to get rid of that embarrassment and I have no doubt that the present suggestion is a much better one.  It places the responsibility where it should be placed and for that reason the Bill is entitled to full support.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamOBrien1977" hpid="Mr. W. O'Brien Mr. W. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. W. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the introduction of this Bill we have heard a <Col N="1433" /> great deal of talk about the alleged corruption which exists in local authorities.  One would think that some new type of disease, called political patronage, had channelled its way into local authorities.  I wonder does it ever strike us that the vast majority of us sit in this House because of political patronage by the county councils. Eleven of us sit here because of political patronage by one man.  We have university people here who are not appointed on the same basis and they might be in a better position to talk on this subject than I am.</P>
      <P>People who are not members of local authorities do not fully grasp the present system of appointment for rate collectors.  When the job of rate collector is advertised, around 30 or 40 young men apply for it.  At that stage both parties get working from the political party point of view.  There may be 15 or 16 members on the local authority from one political party.  The local authority go through the list of applicants and if there is any doubt or suspicion regarding the honesty or integrity of any of the applicants, irrespective of whichever service they may have rendered to the party, they are not included in the final list.  When I entered Limerick County Council in 1960, the people on the other side of this House had a majority of one on the council.  Fair play to them, any job that became vacant was filled by them. As time went on, a power crisis arose within that party and one of the members decided to call a halt.  He took a different stand and at that stage we availed of the opportunity presented to us and we appointed 20 rate collectors in seven years.  I make no apologies for those appointments; we appointed very fine men who did a good job of work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sometimes we hear comments that rate collectors should have certain qualifications.  It may be true to say that they are not university graduates but time has proved that they all had one qualification which, in my opinion, was much more important than any other qualification, and that was honesty.  We have heard a lot about malpractices on local authorities, in newspapers, and the Minister referred <Col N="1434" /> to it in his opening speech.  I do not think the Minister is frightened or upset about those reports.  As a matter of fact, I read something in a Galway paper recently which placed a suspicion in connection with certain planning permits.  I am not suggesting that the Minister is corrupt in any way but that type of talk will go on.  If the Minister is really serious about eliminating this slanderous talk, he will need to undertake a complete restructuring of the present system of local government. Galway County Council recently appointed a rate collector.  In spite of what the Minister had described as an unsuitable system, the people in his own county availed of the opportunity to grasp the last plum.</P>
    <P>There are many other political appointments apart from the appointment of rate collectors.  I have the appointment of sub-postmasters in mind.  Recently there was a vacancy for a sub-postmaster in my county and the Fianna Fáil cumainn held a meeting and voted on the candidate for the appointment.  I am not sure whether or not the Minister accepted their nominee but it demonstrates the kind of thinking which is prevalent at present. The people have lost confidence in boards and individuals on boards. We might as well make the appointments out in the open as to make them behind closed doors.  Chief superintendents, court registrars and even peace commissioners are all political appointments.  Why pick out rate collectors from among them?  We all know they are political appointments, as we ourselves are political appointments. They have experience of registers; they have an added responsibility in the waiver of rates and they do a fine job of work.</P>
    <P>The argument against the system of appointment by four members of local bodies is that it does not lend itself to detailed procedures and controls which would ensure that the selection is made on merit alone.  We have members of subsidiary bodies and agricultural committees appointed by political circles.  In my opinion membership of those bodies is a very responsible job because, on the eve of our entry into the EEC, the farmers <Col N="1435" /> will be guided by the advice and instructions of those people who are appointed by the county councils.  It would be a tragedy if it could be alleged afterwards that the appointment was not made by the proper method.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to understand why we have singled out the appointment of rate collectors for special mention.  We are given to understand that the job is of great importance.  Where is the importance of it?  Many comments have been made on this subject in the other House and here.  Some people referred to the 1940 Act and asked &ldquo;Why change it now?&rdquo; It has been suggested that the people on the other side of the House have lost control of local authorities.  Whether we like it or not, it is very hard to convince the people that that is not the reason, because both parties would be prepared to avail of the opportunity of making appointments.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer now to the function of county managers.  I have had experience of only four county managers and in my experience of them I would have no hesitation whatsoever in accepting their decision.  I found them to be men of honour and integrity.  This additional obligation will not improve the degree of co-operation between the members of local authorities and county managers irrespective of whom the manager will appoint.  If, for instance, the first three appointments happen to be three members of the same party nothing will convince the members of that council that the manager is not partial to a party.  From that on his functions and responsibilities can be made very difficult.  Any Members who are members of local authorities know that in order to get the maximum co-operation, all parties including staff and manager, must pull together.  Let us hope that whatever happens this will in no way affect the great co-operation and help that already exists between members of local authorities and staff.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>As a member of a local authority I welcome very much the amendment in the Bill.  Any Member of the Seanad can only speak from <Col N="1436" /> the experience he has had in his own local authority.  I would not claim that the experience we have had in Donegal differs very much from that of most other local authorities.  The old system was a bad one.  Most members of local authorities will be glad to be rid of it. I want to make it absolutely clear that I support those who stated that the rate collectors who have been appointed by local authorities, including those in County Donegal, have been very energetic and honourable men and we have no complaints about any of them. Nevertheless, it has been very difficult for members of all parties.  Recent difficulties hastened the introduction of this legislation.  I support it 100 per cent.</P>
      <P>Sometimes members of local authorities may find themselves pressed to support a man who may be a good party man against somebody else who may be equally as good a party man.  I consider this system to be totally unfair.  I have found that some applicants for rate collector posts have absolutely no scruples with regard to the pressures they have exercised in order to secure the position.  I have known a case where three members of the one family expected that the three of them would get positions; when one resigned, another expected to be appointed to the vacancy.  This is quite common.  I have known of another case where a particular family considered the job of rate collector to be hereditary and that that family alone had the knowledge and the God-given right to collect the rates.  I also know that local authority members have the power to create a new rate-collector district.  No matter what party you belong to, this is wise legislation and will solve many of the problems of local authority members throughout the country.</P>
      <P>Last night I was listening to Senator Honan when he referred to the promotions of rate collectors.  I am afraid that he has not sufficient experience with local authorities to comment like that, because he should be aware that each local authority have a staff officer to deal with rates, and therefore that situation will remain as it is.  Therefore, it is not relevant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not keen on one amendment of the Bill.  This Bill leaves the way open <Col N="1437" /> at some future date to have appointments made by the Local Appointments Commission.  Senator Flanagan has expressed his confidence in the Local Appointments Commission, but while I do not question their honesty or integrity, I would not look forward to the day when we would hand over the appointment of rate collectors to the Local Appointments Commission.  In common with other local authority members, I have a good deal of experience in this regard.</P>
    <P>I should like to cite a recent case of an engineer in a particular county who had nearly 15 years' experience in that county under various services.  He applied for the post of county engineer in County Donegal, having had five or six years' experience in planning, road building and housing.  All members believed that he was the ideal county engineer, having had a wealth of experience which I would consider to be more important than the individual himself.  The members of the local authority met and unanimously requested the Local Appointments Commission to consider this man for the position of county engineer.  They refused the request and perhaps, in their wisdom, they were right.  To make the record clear, another county engineer was appointed who proved to be very acceptable, but less than six months later the first man was appointed county engineer in another county on the other side of the country.  That is totally inconsistent.</P>
    <P>There is a danger that that same procedure may be adopted by the Local Appointments Commission.  I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to consider that that could happen.  I urge that no consideration be given now or in the future to the appointment of rate collectors by the Local Appointments Commission.  There is the problem of uprooting an officer, such as a rate collector or an engineer, and of the cost to the State of transferring him from one location to another.</P>
    <P>I know that the Parliamentary Secretary, like myself, has differed with the county manager in County Donegal on numerous occasions and on numerous issues but I am 100 per cent <Col N="1438" /> satisfied that he will be absolutely fair and I have no reservations whatsoever. This is a very good Bill and I am satisfied that it will lead to smoother administration in local authorities.  It will do away with a lot of friction that did not help any party nor did it help general administration.  I recommend the Bill and request that before a decision is reached great consideration be given to it and I hope that there will be no difficulty in passing it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make a few comments on the Bill. This Bill is being introduced now to deal with something which has not been regarded as a problem up to now. There has been no great demand for a change in the system.  It is difficult for me to understand why the Minister has introduced this kind of legislation.</P>
      <P>In my county the system has worked well over the years.  We have consistently returned a 96.8 per cent collection. That is better than the Revenue Commissioners are doing with the income tax, and also better than what the Department of Finance are doing with the turnover tax.  The road tax does not measure up to it either and yet we have a proposal to change the method of selection of the people who carry out this service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two different problems here vis-à-vis the collection of rates.  I understand that in Dublin one has to either send in the rates or take them to the collector, whereas in the country the old system of the collector actually collecting the rates has always prevailed and I should like to see it continuing. After 16 years experience on the county council, and as a ratepayer, I want to pay a sincere tribute to the collectors.  Back in the thirties and forties when it was difficult for the farming community to meet the rates, the collectors were always honest and they helped some of these people over difficult months.  If we have a more sophisticated type of &ldquo;computer-machine-minded&rdquo; rate collector it is going to be difficult for a particular ratepayer to get any time to pay.  This has been the traditional way we have paid our rates in Laois.  With Kerry we have been the best rate-paying <Col N="1439" /> county for some years back.  It is difficult for me to find fault with the old system.  Among our 18 rate collectors we have people who have been appointed for many years.  Some of them have been appointed during the last two or three terms of which I was a member of the council.  Irrespective of which party proposed any particular officer over the years, they have given excellent service.  It just happened that they applied in accordance with the old system.</P>
    <P>If a person is proposed by a member of one particular party he should not be labelled as a member of that political party.  The system in my county is that we invariably support the candidate who resides nearest to us.  This works out reasonably well. Living in a rural community, when a job becomes vacant it is surprising all the relations each councillor finds contacting him from nearby parishes.  I regret to see this appointment being removed too far away from the ratepayers, because in the past we had collectors who were honest and men of substance.  In order to meet the five conditions to qualify for the couple of hundred pounds bonus, these people here had to pay the rates for honest ratepayers, perhaps for a matter of weeks.  There was nothing terribly wrong with that.</P>
    <P>It is true to say that in rural Ireland the incomes of farming ratepayers is changing somewhat.  They are not dependent as heretofore on the harvest or the spring.  Nevertheless, the old traditional system will more than likely prevail.  This is where the old rate collector got to know the individual ratepayer.  He knew the people he could trust and the people he would have to press for the money. I can only recall two court orders which had to be served on ratepayers during the past 16 years.</P>
    <P>In a small county like Laois the farmer is very much the predominant ratepayer.  From last year's abstract of accounts I find that 1,800 Laois farmers paid more than 50 per cent of the total rates collected.  The total amount collected was 96.8 per cent of the demand levied.  There are over <Col N="1440" /> 4,000 farmers in the county and perhaps it would be easier for some of them than for others to pay.  Sometimes the rate collector goes to a particular man and he says: &ldquo;I cannot pay my rates for two weeks&rdquo;.  Could we possibly expect the same service from some man with an urban background or who has done two or three years in a university and who is able to fly through an examination even though he has failed his university degree examination or in his university course?  From an academic point of view, these people would certainly be able to score on the ordinary fellow who has spent a few years working in a particular town. Will these people be as dependable? Will they be able to collect perhaps the £30,000 or £40,000 paid in various ways by the ratepayers?  I doubt if they will give the same service to the ratepayers.</P>
    <P>Everybody accepts now that he has to pay the rates despite the fact that the rates are a heavy burden on a small number of people.  It would have been better if the Department had sought ways to lighten the burden on the ratepayers. I have in mind widows living in towns where it is usual to find rates of £50, £60 or £70 on a modest house. These people find it difficult to pay this high rate.  If they set a flat or take in a paying guest they lose their non-contributory widow's pension.  There are a number of anomalies that the Department should have examined.</P>
    <P>There are people in the middle-income group who find themselves in difficult financial straits.  This is a recurring problem all over the country.  Last night the Minister for Labour spoke here of the difficulties he had and of the strides the Government were making towards meeting as many difficult cases as possible.  They have done a good job, but there seems to be a clash between the interests of the Department of Social Welfare and of the Department of Local Government when it comes to rates.  The system of the waiver of rates which we have had in operation for the last three seasons is a good one.  Many of the older people miss the advertisements in the local papers coming up to April or <Col N="1441" /> May.  When they do not apply in time there is little one can do.  One needs a conscientious rate collector who will make his own job easier and ensure he can meet his conditions.  These people are not overpaid for the amount of responsibility they have.  We need a good type of person who will take on this type of social service which is very important in rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to see how this will be done if the local authority members will not have a say in the appointment of these people.  No councillor enjoys the task of appointing a rate collector as it is difficult to vote in public for candidate A in preference to candidate B. Distant relationships and political affiliations crop up and yet the final result of these elections have proved to be very successful over the years.  Very few, if any, have betrayed their trust.</P>
    <P>I favour the appointments being made by the Local Appointments Commission provided that same exalted authority started to do a bit of work for a change.  I could not advocate that change, having regard to the deplorable way in which they are treating the agricultural committees in connection with the appointments of agricultural advisers.  It takes at least 18 months for an appointment to be made when the request is made to them.  Surely they could do better than that.  There is no point in having every section of the local services in chaos just because these people in O'Connell Street take 12 or 18 months to make up their minds.</P>
    <P>Their system is antiquated.  The candidates are allowed too much time to make up their minds.  If we are to have a new system it must be thought out carefully.  I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to tell us what regulations will be handed to the manager in order to fill these posts.  It is important that the collector should be residing in his collection area.  This would have built-in safeguards.  The manager would know the people with whom he is dealing.  Lots of people in our society need someone to keep an eye on them.  Irrespective of how he is appointed, the role of the rate collector should not change.  We should look for people with an active social <Col N="1442" /> conscience.  A local person with a good outlook will be able to advise the older generation of their rights, what they are entitled to and encourage them to apply for a waiver of rates in time.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary to give us some idea of the type of person our county managers will be looking for, or if the Department intend issuing or drafting regulations specifying the standards the Minister will be looking for when the county managers are filling these posts.</P>

      <P>We can welcome this change.  The people in the country have not been happy with the system of appointment of rate collectors. This was based very much on party political affiliations.  This Bill is a step in the right direction.</P>
      <P>We must be careful about the appointments committees, whether they are under the Local Appointments Commission or under the body set up to advise the manager.  I would hope that, in implementing this, the manager would be advised on the applicants by some committee.  I do not attribute any bias to the members of the Local Appointments Commission, but the system of selection favours the type of candidate who is well able to express himself and who is coached in what it takes to impress the committee.  This could be avoided by having committees which are not too small.  The committee advising the county manager should ensure that the county council or local body is represented on these committees. A person coming from a background of public affairs has a shrewder assessment of candidates than one who is the career-type of office holder.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Public representatives are not so easily impressed by the type of candidate who is the professional interviewee. I have seen this at all levels and the pitfalls are there.  Given the proper coaching, candidates going before any appointments committee could improve their performance substantially. There are hazards but we must recognise that the system we had, which was based on party affiliation and support, is not one we wish to have <Col N="1443" /> continued.  With those reservations I welcome what is offered.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to give us some idea of what steps he thinks the county manager should take before making an appointment.  There should be a regular board set up, which would be representative of the county authority, to advise the manager and their recommendations should be on record in the manager's office.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government (Mr. Cunningham) Liam Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government (Mr. Cunningham)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to refer briefly to some general points before getting down to some of the specific matters raised.  This is quite a small Bill which seeks to abolish the present method of county rate collector appointment.  The method proposed in the Bill is already in operation in respect of some rate collector appointments.  All we are doing is bringing the remainder of such appointments into line with what already exists first, in respect of some rate collectors in local authorities appointed by the method proposed in this Bill and, secondly, with other similar appointments made by local authorities.</P>
      <P>In the Dáil the debate on this Bill went on for ten hours.  We have had a lengthy debate here over the last two days.  I do not mean this as a criticism. It is a good thing to have a full discussion on any of these matters.  Some very useful points have been raised. This is the only remaining staff selection function remaining with the elected members of the county councils.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of the appointment of vocational teachers was raised by Senator J. Fitzgerald.  Hitherto such appointments were made by vocational committees, the members of which were also members of local authorities. Much stress was laid during the debate on the embarrassment caused to councillors. When I was a member of a local authority dealing with appointments of rate collectors and of vocational teachers I realised the terrific embarrassment caused to candidates. In the case of an applicant for a post of vocational teacher he had to contact <Col N="1444" /> 20, 25, 30 or more members of local authorities.  This was a hefty assignment. He or she had to plead, promise and go through this procedure.  This should not happen.  Where a person has the qualifications for the job and there are other applicants with similar qualifications perhaps a degree better, then the best qualified person should get the job.  Canvassing, lobbying and visiting of local authority members should be cut out.  This has been done with my full blessing.  I felt deeply for the canvassers and for the vocational committees.  I feel the same with regard to the number of candidates seeking appointment as rate collectors.  This is the main reason which influenced the Minister to introduce this legislation. I am glad the proposals in this Bill have met with the unanimous support of the Seanad.</P>
    <P>Senator McDonald suggested this change being introduced because the Government party had lost control of a number of county councils.  There has been a demand by members of local authorities, the various parties and above all by the candidates for appointments as rate collectors themselves, that there should be a different method.  While this Bill abolishes one method there are a number of other ones available.  One is that proposed in the Bill.  The other is one which exists in a number of local authorities and that is collecting through the office.  This method, where it exists, will not be affected by the Bill when it becomes an Act.  Neither will any local authority who intend to change their method of collection through the office be affected.  They are still free to do that.  If local authorities generally or individually are not happy with the method proposed in this Bill they are free to ask the Minister to have the appointment of rate collectors carried out by the Local Appointments Commission. The Minister will, in agreement with the Local Appointments Commission, do this, if he feels it is justified.  This should meet all the shades of opinion which have been expressed during the debate.</P>
    <P>I should now like to refer briefly to some of the points raised by Senators. Senator Boland said that what was proposed <Col N="1445" /> in the Bill was appointment behind closed doors.  The other method of appointment, by the Local Appointments Commission, could also be described as a behind-closed-doors affair.  To give it that nomenclature makes it sound suspicious and suggests an aura which does not exist.  Naturally a board, whether set up by the manager or brought together by the chairman of the Local Appointments Commission, will sit in a room; it will be behind closed doors and each candidate will be interviewed.  The remark &ldquo;closed doors&rdquo; could give it a bad name.</P>
    <P>Another point raised was the standard of education and the method of setting up the board.  There is nothing new in this.  There are at the moment regulations for the appointment of rate collectors.  Under the present system there were specific qualifications as to the standard of education and so on. These standards will apply in future, that is, that a person must have the required standard of education.</P>
    <P>It is not true to say&mdash;as Senator Reynolds said&mdash;that local authorities have already been notified of the regulations.  As a matter of courtesy, local authorities have been sent a document indicating the changes which will take place if the Bill is passed.  The boards to be set up will be on similar lines to those existing for other appointments. Quite a number of appointments are made in this way.  Senator Boland yesterday read the list of appointments made by a board set up by the county manager.  In order to show that the status of the post was much lower than the one of rate collector, he chose the gas slot meter collector.  It is true to say that this post is filled by a board set up by the manager but to choose this particular one and ignore the status of the other posts is unfair.</P>
    <P>For instance, the rate inspector is appointed by such a board as is envisaged in the Bill.  There is quite a long list of posts such as draughtsman, and staff officer, fairly important posts, which are filled on the recommendation of local interview boards.  Somebody mentioned that the home assistance officer should be included in this list. This is not so.  The home assistance <Col N="1446" /> officer post is controlled by the Department of Social Welfare.  Senator Boland asked why the rate collector appointment was originally left as a reserved function of the council.  We do not know the reason because it happened so long ago.</P>
    <P>Senator Boland also mentioned the delay in publishing the White Paper on local finance.  This has been promised by the Minister and quite recently he said it would be published very soon.  I imagine this will be before Christmas.</P>
    <P>Senator Boland raised a number of other points such as details of the method of appointment.  In the normal way, the manager will advertise the post for open competition.  There will be a standard of education prescribed. I am not sure what the present standard is but it should not be much different.  The board will be set up to interview candidates.  It may be that some applicants for the positions have more than the necessary educational qualifications.  They may hold certificates which will obviate the necessity for a written examination.  An interview to determine suitability, character and so on will be held.  The members of that interview board will be appointed by the manager.  It will be necessary that one of the members will be from the local area.  The case has been made that rate collectors appointed under the other system have knowledge of local conditions.  This is quite true.  A local knowledge is very desirable.  The other members would be from neighbouring local authorities. This is the procedure which will be suggested to the manager.</P>
    <P>Another matter, which was not raised here, is that the manager is not bound to accept the person placed first. The board will interview the candidate assessing educational standards and suitability.  A situation can exist where a person is the best qualified educationally and has the best personality on interview but the manager may know of some factor which could prevent this man's appointment.  He is not bound, although he will generally in the case of the long list of appointments already mentioned, appoint the person who is recommended as No. 1 by the board.</P>
    <P>Senator Boland and many other <Col N="1447" /> Senators paid tribute to the honesty and integrity of existing rate collectors appointed under the present system. I join with them in that tribute.  From my own experience of 20 years as a member of the Donegal County Council, we have not had one case involving a rate collector appointed by a vote of members of local authorities where we had to take court or any other action by way of suspension or dismissal because of irregularities by these people.  This is a record of which we in Donegal are proud.  I want to put on record that this Bill in no way casts any reflection on the rate collectors appointed by the method which has been in operation up to now.</P>
    <P>Senator Owens made a very logical case for this Bill, and I am not saying this simply because she agrees with the Bill.  Her contribution was logical and concise.  It was a fine contribution to the debate.  In winding up she said that she hoped the board would consider women as well as men.  I join with her in that hope.  In Donegal we have five lady rate collectors who are equally as good as the men and I hope this pattern will be adhered to by the boards when set up.</P>
    <P>Senator McGlinchey mentioned the question of canvassing.  I have already dealt with that matter.  He mentioned the embarrassment for candidates of doing the rounds of 28 or more councillors. Senator J. Fitzgerald mentioned the type of rate collectors we have as a result of the present system. He spoke as a member of a party which did not have the opportunity of making those appointments but he paid tribute to the type of men who were appointed in his county.  This shows that we all recognise that the best men were appointed.  I think Senator McGowan mentioned the creation or suppression of warrants, in other words rate collectors areas.  It was also mentioned by Senator Owens that there are some warrants which are small and, therefore, the remuneration for them is also small.  This is quite true in a number of local authority areas.  Rearrangement of areas is still a matter for the local authorities.</P>
    <P>Heretofore, if a rate collector's area <Col N="1448" /> became vacant and it was a large one, in some cases part of that area was utilised to bring up the area of a smaller rate collector and there was still enough left to make a new fulltime appointment.  I hope rearrangements like that will be made in the future.  It does not enter into this Bill and still remains a matter for agreement by the local authorities.  They may wish to abolish an area and even set up another area in the county.  This is desirable.  All rate collector appointments for the past couple of years and in the future have been and will be made on a salary basis.  They will get a basic salary plus incentive bonuses all on the same basis.  The changeover to that system was used and I hope will continue to be used to make the areas more workable and break up some of the very large areas.</P>
    <P>I think I have covered the main points made in contributions to the debate.  I would like to get all Stages of this Bill today.  Some Senator mentioned that an appointment of rate collector was made recently in one of the local authority areas.  I would like to have this Bill as soon as possible so that the new method of appointment can commence in the new year.</P>

    <P>SECTION 1.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1449" /> To add to the section the following new subsections:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(2)  The Minister shall make regulations for the purposes of an appointment under subsection (1) which shall set out the method of appointment of an interview board and the qualifications for appointment, including in particular qualifications in relation to age, education and local knowledge.</P>
    <P>(3)  Where regulations are proposed to be made under subsection (2) a draft thereof shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and such regulations shall not come into effect until a resolution approving the draft has been passed by each such House.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not think there is any need to go into the amendment in any great detail. The various merits and demerits of appointments either by the Local Appointments Commission, as was suggested, or by local interview boards were discussed fairly fully on Second Stage.  The merits and demerits of having a straight appointment made by the county manager, without consultation or reference to any interview board, was also discussed fairly fully.</P>
    <P>I expressed myself yesterday as being less than happy with the alternative method of referring the appointments to the Local Appointments Commission on the basis that, unless a special case was made for the appointment, the position would be open to applicants from all parts of the country and the essential qualification of local knowledge and experience would, consequently, be lost.  I also expressed serious reservations about the suggested method of appointment by a county manager even after an interview board make recommendations. Some of the Members of the House would be at one with me in this having heard the Parliamentary Secretary's reply on Second Stage when he was at pains to point out that there would be no obligation upon a county manager to accept the recommendation of an interview board which was set up to interview applicants for the post.  If the county manager felt that he had better knowledge <Col N="1450" /> of the applicants than the interview board it would be up to him to decide to appoint somebody else and that was all there would be about it.  The activities, time and recommendations of the interview board would count for nothing.  I do not see the merit of a system such as that and I do not think it would be an improvement on the existing method of appointment which, we are all agreed, is not a very good one and should be changed.</P>
    <P>Because of the various undertakings and suggestions made in the course of this Bill I thought that the Parliamentary Secretary might have been anxious to write into the Bill the type of regulations which would be set out in relation to the interview board itself and in relation to the qualifications of the applicants.  I had hoped that there would be imposed on the county manager an obligation to accept the recommendation of the interview board, but obviously that is not going to be the case.  In addition, it is not clear that there will even be an obligation on the manager to set up an interview board in the first place.</P>
    <P>The Bill is extremely short and the only guidelines that can be laid down under the terms of this Bill will be merely guidelines by way of circular letter from the Department.  If a manager chooses not to set up an interview board but to make the appointments himself, after having carried out interviews or having made his own tests, he will be perfectly free to do so.  I should like regulations to be set up which oblige the manager to appoint an interview board and to accept their recommendations.  If we are all agreed that the present method of appointment is not a good one, that it needs to be changed and that the change is going to be an improvement, it should also be seen to be better.  It can be made better publicly by ensuring that the interview board makes the choice and that the manager accepts that choice.</P>
    <P>If that is not to be the case, then I think it would be of extreme importance that the members of the local authority in question and the general public should be made aware of the fact that an interview board has sat and has interviewed applicants and that the <Col N="1451" /> county manager has, in his wisdom, subsequently decided not to accept the board's recommendations but has decided to appoint somebody himself. That would be a very important qualification in this suggested method of appointment.</P>
    <P>I agree with the parliamentary Secretary that some of the interviewers should be local officers of a local authority who have the individual knowledge peculiar to that administrative area.  It is important that some of the interviewers should have that knowledge.  Of course, it would be equally important that a number of them&mdash;I would imagine the majority of them&mdash;should be from outside the administrative area where the appointment is to be made.</P>
    <P>I believe that all of those things should be clearly set out in statutory regulations to be made by the Minister. They could be discussed in this House and they would then become a legal onus and obligation on the county manager.  Under the terms of this Bill I believe that that will not be the case: a circular letter will be issued of which the manager may or may not take cognisance.  It would also be important, in view of the discussion that took place here, that the particular qualifications for the position of rate collector shall again be clearly set out in statutory regulations, so that it would become apparent to everybody what were the qualities necessary for the position.  The proposed change could be made better than the present system if these suggestions were to be carried out now. It would be preferable if it was made clear to everybody that they were becoming a legal obligation as part of an Act of the Oireachtas or regulations made thereunder rather than the vague recommendations in a letter which apparently will emanate from the Department, if I understand the Parliamentary Secretary correctly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>The manager will set up the board.  He will be the employer of the new appointee.  It can happen that some members of the board will have no knowledge of the person.  The manager will not know <Col N="1452" /> which of, say, 20 candidates will be placed first by the board.  It can happen that Mr. E will be the No. 1 recommended by the board, but in respect of Mr. E the manager may have confidential information, for example, that this man had been convicted of embezzlement of which the board would not have any knowledge or he may have information that Mr. E was in some way not a suitable person for appointment to the position of rate collector, although recommended as No. 1 by the board.  Therefore, the manager cannot be blamed if he refuses to accept that recommendation. It is only in that very exceptional type of case that the manager would be right in refusing the No. 1 recommendation of the board.  This is not a matter that has cropped up very often in many of the appointments made by a county manager.  Moreover, I hope it is one that will not crop up in the cases of rate collectors.</P>
      <P>In regard to the amendment, there is nothing to prevent the appointment of a person from outside the county, and some rate collectors have already been appointed by this method.  In other words, rate collectors operating at the moment for a number of years have been appointed under this particular method.  I have found in respect of County Donegal that rate collectors appointed by this method are residing in the local authority area.  However, it can happen that in certain appointments this will not be the case.  As far as I am aware, rate collectors appointed by this method are resident in and natives of the locality to which they are appointed.</P>
      <P>I should like to refer to the educational standards mentioned in the amendment.  For rate collectors operating for some time who were appointed by this method educational qualifications are as follows:</P>
      <P>Each candidate must possess a standard of education sufficient to enable him to keep efficiently the required books and accounts. . . .</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where duties of the office are to be performed in the Gaeltacht each candidate shall possess a competent knowledge of Irish.  The actual setting up of <Col N="1453" /> the board is another matter covered in the amendment.  Boards operating for selections for other appointments listed here are set up by the local authorities. The officers regulations will be tightened to cover this and the amended regulations in connection with the setting-up of the board can be laid before the House.  I think that covers some of the points raised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to this amendment, and particularly in relation to the Parliamentary Secretary's concluding remarks on the Second Stage, it is not incumbent on the manager to accept the recommendations of the appointment board that he has set up.  If that is the case the position will be no better than the appointment of rate collectors is at present.  A situation might arise whereby an appointments board will sit down and interview 12, 15 or 20 candidates and appoint A, B, C, as 1, 2, and 3 in the order of preference and submit them to the manager, or perhaps recommend one to the manager.  The manager's hands might be tied in this because if the manager&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It has happened many times where a person was qualified in every way and recommended for the job and perhaps got the job but failed the medical test.  This is understandable.  However, it is the exception.  If a job is advertised and there are 20 applicants for it, they should be screened before their names go before that interview board because it would be wrong if there was a situation where it leaked out from the interview board that C had qualified at the top of that list but A or D is then appointed.  Questions will be asked <Col N="1454" /> and the manager will find himself under pressure and the same suspicions will be aroused after that appointment as there are at the moment.  We are not curing this problem, we are leaving it wide open.  A system should be devised whereby the manager must, subject to health requirements, accept the recommendation of the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>May I deal with that?  I would not accept the suggestion that any number of applicants should be screened on factors which are not going to be dealt with by the board. The board will deal with educational suitability and suitability of manner, experience and so on.  There are other factors which must be brought into consideration such as health, honesty and so on with which the board will have nothing to do but which the manager, as the custodian of the local authority purse and interests, must have regard to.</P>
      <P>The Minister said&mdash;</P>
      <P>Once a board make a recommendation, and it is only a recommendation, after having interviewed or examined applicants under the existing system and under the system that I am proposing the manager still has to get satisfactory evidence as to the health of the person being recommended and also has to make discreet inquiries as to character in order to ensure that he is not appointing, as a rate collector, a person who has a criminal record or some blot on his character which would be an obstacle to his appointment to a position of such responsibility which involves handling funds.</P>
      <P>This is the same point I tried to get across.  There will be a recommendation by the board only on what they are asked to recommend.  They are not asked to recommend on health, honesty or other necessary factors which could make the person, although suitable from an educational and personality point of view and from the point of view of his knowledge of his local area, a dead loss in other respects.  The manager must protect the local authority purse and the local authority ratepayers.</P>

      <P>In relation to the Parliamentary Secretary's reply, if A is appointed by the local Appointments Commission and the county manager is notified, what does the county manager do if he has some information of which the Local Appointments Commission are not aware?</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the Local Appointments Commissioners clear the health record and the character record of the person as well as doing what the manager's board will do.  The manager's board will do one job but over and above that the Local Appointments Commissioners clear the health and character record as well.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardMcGlinchey" hpid="Mr. McGlinchey Mr. McGlinchey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGlinchey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been associated, as a public representative, with four county managers in this county&mdash;Donegal, Sligo/Leitrim, Kerry and the new county manager for Meath. I am convinced that if the leaders of the three political parties were to go on their knees in front of any one of those men and ask him to make an appointment that was not recommended by an interview board he would not do so.  From my experience of them their integrity could not be questioned and I am satisfied that the same applies to every other county manager in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Parliamentary Secretary has stated, problems can arise.  Information can be received at the last moment which would necessitate the manager altering the recommendation of the interview board.  If this were to arise the manager should immediately contact that interview board and explain the position to them.  I put it to Senator Fitzgerald if he were a county secretary in Meath and was invited to Mayo to sit on an interview board for the appointment of a rate collector, if that board recommended Mr. X and a few weeks later Senator Fitzgerald as county secretary read in the newspapers that Mr. Y was appointed, I should imagine that he and the rest of the board would demand an explanation from that county manager.  If he failed to get it he would make it known publicly that <Col N="1456" /> the recommended person did not receive the appointment.</P>
    <P>Any local government official who sat on the board and who felt an injustice was committed would either publicly expose it or, through his own local government officials' association, take the necessary steps to have the matter rectified.  No official will stand by and allow an injustice of this kind to take place.  There may be occasions when information received at the last moment, of which I do not wish to give examples, would cause hardship to certain families.  We all know of appointments which should not have been made for this reason by interview boards.  The system proposed in this Bill has been practised for many years in the appointment of urban rate collectors. There were two such appointments made in my own town.  The interview board made the recommendation and the county manager made the appointment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Local Appointments Commission are bound by secrecy in this regard, and likewise any body appointed by the county manager will have the same secrecy obligation attached to them.  Once such a body have made a recommendation the body cease from that moment to have any existence.  There is no question of the county manager communicating with that board when he receives the recommendation from them.  A good deal of unease would be overcome if there was a regulation by which a county manager, if he did not accept the recommendation of the committee set up to advise him, would have to give his reasons to the Minister and get his agreement to appoint whoever he wished.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is far too arbitrary to leave information which may be casual to come to the knowledge of the county manager and this possibility may enable the county manager to alter the decision of the <Col N="1457" /> board without anyone being aware of his reasons for doing so.  This is almost getting back to the old system.  There should be a cross-check with the Minister on this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not necessary that the Bill should be changed to do this.  The Senator's suggestion is reasonable.  The House will agree there can be cases where the manager will find it impossible to agree due to private or confidential information which he has verified and found to be true.  Senator McGlinchey suggested it could be got over by informing the board but this is not the best way of doing it.  I would accept Senator Quinlan's suggestion that in such cases where the manager for good reason, having checked his information, would notify the Minister.  The manager must notify the Department that he is not accepting the No. 1 recommendation.</P>

      <P>Accepting that the candidate has the qualifications both medically and educationally, as applies in my own county or the county from which the Parliamentary Secretary comes from, or County Cork which one would describe as a big rambling county, could it be possible for the county manager to have authority from the Department that the candidate would be picked from that electoral division?  A rate collector from the locality would know the people in the area and would be aware of cases of hardship.</P>
      <P>When the Parliamentary Secretary stated the type of educational qualification one needed, I heard a snort from the Fine Gael benches.  I should like to ask them what qualifications do they think one needs to have?  It is not necessary to have a university degree.  There are some well qualified uneducated people.  If there are six candidates who apply, could the county manager ensure that the man from the local electoral division would get priority in that instance?  This would make the collection of rates more personal and there are hardships existing which the local man would know about.  This applies particularly to the larger counties.</P>

The best we can hope for is that, having an official of the local authority to which the appointment is being made on the board, he would know the qualifications of the applicant, point out these things and get them across to the other members of the board.  This is the only way the point could be met. I cannot undertake to do it by amendment of the legislation before us.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Instruct&rdquo; was the word I used.  I have grave reservations regarding Senator Quinlan's suggestion. It may not happen.  The suggestion has been made that because a county manager is so often in contact with the Custom House in relation to various matters, strong representations could be made to him in relation to individual applicants.  Various people in the Custom House might think these people were the best qualified.  The manager might decide that was the special information which he had and the interview board did not.  It would be ludicrous to say that, if a manager decides not to accept his interview board's recommendation, he has to explain the reason to the Minister. If the Minister agrees with him, everything is all right.  It would be a funny sort of a manager and application form and a beauty of an interview board who would manage to come up with a convicted embezzler, to quote the example given by the Parliamentary Secretary, as their recommendation for the position of rate collector. I cannot see why the decision of the interview board could not be binding and why they could not investigate the health and other qualifications of applicants in the same way as the LAC.  The Parliamentary Secretary referred to the regulations under the Act of 1955.  Did he say amendments will be made to these regulations which will be binding statutory regulations in relation to the setting up of interview boards for these appointments?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>

The usual procedure will be followed.  If any member of the Oireachtas objects or thinks the regulations unsuitable he can bring the matter before the Oireachtas by way of motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to speak very briefly on this motion dealing with the designation of delegates to the Assembly of the European Communities. I should like to express my deep dissatisfaction with the procedure which has been adopted, in so far as I understand it and in so far as it can even legitimately be called procedure, to bring this motion before the House.  I make my objection with no sense of personal pique.  I have more than enough to do in this House and outside it without wanting to be appointed by this Parliament to membership of the European Assembly. Anybody who studies the background, history and nature of the Assembly to which we are now being asked to send people will realise that it is not a case of &ldquo;all perk and no work&rdquo;.  There are a minimum of six sessions of the Assembly in the parliamentary year. There are usually at least two more. This adds up to approximately 50 sitting days.  In addition to these sittings there are also committee meetings.  Almost every member of the European Assembly is a member of at least one and possibly more committees which may bring his total of sitting days up by another 50.  When travel is added to the 100 days that one has already arrived at by this method of calculation one realises that it is a very substantial commitment.  Personally, I could not undertake such a commitment. I would like to underline the fact that my objection to this motion is based on no sense of personal dissatisfaction or a feeling of having been left out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to make a correction in something that I said earlier today. When I proposed that No. 19 be taken together with this motion, the Leader of the House informed us that the reason why it could not be taken was that it could be discussed with the European Communities Bill.  My recollection&mdash;unless it is very unsatisfactory&mdash;is that, when the same proposal was made during the debate on the European Communities Bill, the <Col N="1462" /> Leader of the House said it would not be appropriate to take No. 19 then.  I put his earlier remarks down to a faulty memory of the occasion, and, had my memory not been equally faulty, he would not have got away with it, but&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I had an immediate feeling of alarm when I first studied the list of names presented to us at the thought that you yourself, as Cathaoirleach of the Seanad, should be a member of this group of delegates.  I since learned from reading the newspapers that we may have a new Cathaoirleach of the Seanad in the New Year.  If this is true it considerably mitigates the force of my objection.  I felt that, unless this were the case, I could not in conscience vote for a delegation which included you, having already voted in favour of your being Cathaoirleach of this House.</P>
      <P>We have had no official intimation of the state of affairs which may exist in January.  The proprieties might have been observed had you resigned from your position as Cathaoirleach of the Seanad before the passing of this motion, so that in voting for it and for you as one of its members, I would have none of the problems associated with voting for a motion which names you at a time when you are still Cathaoirleach of this House.  This is a minor point but it should be made with reference to the priorities of the occasion.</P>
      <P>My main objection to this particular motion is not one aimed solely at the Government party, as Senator Mullins will be glad to hear, but one levelled at the procedure adopted to produce this list of names.  The relevant Article of the Rome Treaty is Article 138 which reads:</P>
      <P>The assembly shall consist of delegates who shall be designated by the respective Parliaments from among their members in accordance with the procedure laid down by each Member State.</P>
      <P>It seems to me, on a basic reading of Article 138, that what we are being asked here today is to designate the delegates in accordance with Article 138.  I have no objection to this House designating delegates.  It is important that the Houses of the Oireachtas should take part in this process of ratification.  I draw your attention again to the latter half of this particular Article:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Designation should take place in <Col N="1464" /> accordance with the procedure laid down by each Member State.</P>
    <P>I am not aware of any procedure laid down here for the nomination of delegates.  If one exists, it is obscure and has not been made public.  What I am given to understand, unofficially, is that this list is the result of an agreement between the Whips or other representatives of the three major parties represented in these two Houses.  If this is the case, it is quite obvious that what we have before us is not the result of a procedure laid down by the State but of a carve-up, an between the major interest groups in these two Houses.  It is a carve-up, an indelicate word for an indelicate operation and my criticism is aimed as much at the Opposition parties as it is at the Government party.</P>
    <P>I draw your attention again to the concluding words of the Article which refers to &ldquo;a procedure laid down by each Member State&rdquo;.  A constitutional lawyer might have difficulty in interpreting this section, but he would have no difficulty in concluding that it had not been complied with in the present case.</P>
    <P>I am sorry that Senator John Kelly is not here.  I would have been delighted to hear his definition of &ldquo;the State&rdquo;. Whatever definition he would give us, he would not regard a small meeting of persons from the three main political parties in a back room as in any way co-extensive with &ldquo;the State&rdquo;.  It is for this reason that I seriously doubt whether the appropriate procedure laid down under Article 138 has been followed.  I believe the procedure which was followed is improper.  It may even be, from the point of view of the European Assembly, invalid.  I would remind the House that the European Assembly is very conscious, like all assemblies, of its own privileges.  It has the right to check the credentials of all delegates sent to its organisation. I do not want to raise a hare about this matter, but I would not weep any tears if the Council of Europe sent back a very stiff reminder to this Parliament of the provisions of Article 138 and asked it to make sure that they were adequately followed in future.  It may be that the list of names which <Col N="1465" /> was produced by a more appropriate procedure&mdash;for example, that outlined in No. 19 on the Order Paper of today &mdash;would be exactly the same, but this is not the point.  If we are to have adequate representation in Europe and if people are to know what this involves we cannot have any more backstairs manoeuvring before the names are suddenly sprung on us.</P>
    <P>When Mr. Harold Macmillan resigned as leader of the Conservative Party in Britain many of us watched with some amusement, not unmixed with trepidation, the curious process of consultation which contributed to the eventual evolution of his successor, Sir Alec Douglas Home.  The processes of consultations which have resulted in this list are no more decorous than the processes in that case. This should be openly stated and the attention of the European Assembly should be directed to it.</P>
    <P>Having said that, it is only fair to state that we are not the worst in Europe in this respect.  If we look at some of the procedures which were adopted in other Parliaments they are, in some cases, more creditable and, in some cases, less creditable than ours. One thing the less creditable ones have in common is that they feature a binding together of centre parties, of consensus parties, against smaller parties, more especially against parties of the Left.  The classic example of this was in the case of Italy where the Italian Communist Party, although the second largest party in the Italian Parliament, was for many years, and until comparatively recently, excluded deliberately from the European Assembly.  A similar position obtained in France where at least one party, who have 7 per cent of the seats, are excluded by the centre parties from representation in the European Assembly.</P>
    <P>This shows that we are not the worst in the world.  However, if we were to adopt a similar way of nominating delegates it might be, for example, that the Labour Party might find themselves completely excluded.  That is a situation which nobody here would welcome.  I feel very strongly that we have missed an opportunity to <Col N="1466" /> show, by a public and carefully scrutinised method of selecting delegates, that we are really selecting delegates of the people and not delegates of the political parties.</P>

      <P>I wish to oppose this motion on the grounds that there is no Independent representation for Ireland in the European Parliament.  I should like to extend my best wishes to the delegates who have been chosen and whose names are listed on this motion but, like Senator Horgan, I am trying to avoid personal issues.  I believe it is a great pity that the Independents have not been represented in our delegation to Europe.</P>
      <P>I now wish to give the numerical facts.  We have ten representatives in Europe.  They were to be chosen from the 204 seats in the two Houses of the Oireachtas.  Of those 204 seats at present the Fianna Fáil Party occupy 101 seats so on a ratio of one seat in Europe per 20 Members they are entitled to have five Members on this list.  The Fine Gael Party have 66 Members in both Houses of the Oireachtas and they are, therefore, entitled to 3.3 seats in Europe.  The Labour Party have 21 Members in the Houses of the Oireachtas and they are entitled to 1.01 seats in Europe.  That is one seat plus the one-hundredth part of a seat.  The Independents have 13 Members in both Houses of the Oireachtas and Aontacht Éireann have one Member.  Consequently, the Independents are entitled to .65 of a seat and Aontacht Éireann to .05 of a seat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My protest is quite clear.  The Fianna Fáil Party and the Fine Gael Party are, mathematically speaking, represented correctly but the Labour Party have no argument for two Members in Europe. I would like to say that the two Members nominated by the Labour Party are excellent men who will do a splendid job but the principle at stake <Col N="1467" /> is the principle of representation.  There are 13 Independents in both Houses and I feel that they should have been asked to nominate a representative.  I know at least one Independent, and probably two Independents, who would have been prepared to go to Europe and to make the sacrifices and efforts involved.  Even if one recognises the fact that three of the 13 Independents might be classified as involuntary Independents, there are eight Independents in this House and that alone would entitle us to representation in Europe.</P>
    <P>The Independents in this House make a contribution to all the debates. It may not always please the other parties, but it is not meant to.  They are Independents and, therefore, they have a certain freedom which they are entitled to use.  I think they make a valuable contribution.  There is a type of consensus among them and I think that the effort the Independents make in Parliament, and particularly in this House, should have been recognised and rewarded by giving them a place on the delegation to the European Parliament.</P>
    <P>I am glad to note that the Seanad with its 60 Members has got three representatives on this delegation. That figure is exactly right.  I am also glad to note that the substitutes for the Members on this list&mdash; their names do not appear on this motion&mdash;also include Members of the Seanad but again I am disappointed that the Independents were not given the opportunity of nominating a Member to sit in the European Parliament or to act as a substitute.  This, as Senator Horgan has said, is a readyup between the parties.  The Independent's difficulty is that they are not in an organisational position to make much of a protest.  They have to rely on the goodwill of the parties something which is clearly not being extended to them.  I would ask that, when further European Committees are being appointed&mdash;for example, the committee which deals with the European Parliamentary business as far as the two Houses of the Oireachtas are concerned&mdash;Independents be represented on them.  There are Independents <Col N="1468" /> who have a special interest in Europe; there are Independents who are prepared to do the work, prepared to make the effort and who would certainly make a real contribution.  I hope that when these committees are being set up Independent representation will not be overlooked, and that the work which Independent Members do will be recognised and that they will obtain places on all these committees.</P>

      <P>I do not think there is any need for me to say much about this.  Independent Members of this Seanad should realise that there is such a thing as the rights of the majority.  We hear a lot of whining from Independents about the parties and about ready-ups between parties, but the Independents must realise that the parties represent the majority of the Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas; the parties represent the majority opinion of the majority of the electorate.  As such, the parties which are sneered at have rights; the majority have rights.</P>

      <P>That is the majority&mdash;an overall majority&mdash;Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Labour, as represented by organised groups.  If Senator Horgan and Senator West feel so far out in the wilderness about the role of the Independents, the way to get in on this act in a big way is to join political parties.  There are three very good parties in the Seanad.</P>

      <P>So far as the role of the Independents is concerned.

The Independents were represented on that international delegation.</P>
