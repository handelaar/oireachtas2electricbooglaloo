      <P>It is suggested that, in view of the fact that we are likely to have a long debate on No. 1, we should pass all Stages of the Bill today and debate it by way of motion after the Christmas recess.  We did that last year and it proved satisfactory to all Members of the House.</P>

      <P>I should like to take up the last point made by the Leader of the House that it was satisfactory to all Members.  It was not satisfactory that we were obliged to pass the Bill and postpone the debate. Last year, when the Bill was thrown to us within a week of Christmas, this side of the House agreed that it was better to debate a motion at leisure in January rather than to debate the Bill under pressure and in haste at the end of December.</P>
      <P>I should like to take this opportunity to protest once again that the business of this House is seriously impeded by what happens in another place.  I would ask the Leader of the House to make the strongest possible representations in regard to this matter. Because of the circumstances in which we find ourselves, we would once again be agreeable to pass all Stages of this Bill today without debate, but only on the understanding that the debate on the motion will take place during the month of January, 1973, and that three days will be allocated to this debate if required.  Those responsible for business in the other House should be informed that the business of this House is impeded by the way in which their financial business is conducted at present.</P>

      <P>I should like to ask the Leader of the House if any progress has been made on the request made last January to have the motion for the present year taken while the budget was still a live issue?  I appreciate that we are being afforded three days in January to discuss details of the budget.  This House could deal much better with the matters concerned <Col N="1329" /> in the budget, Department administration, <i>et cetera</i>, by way of motion in June instead of waiting until the Appropriation Bill is presented in December.</P>

      <P>I find myself in sympathy with Senator Dooge's point of view regarding the delay in receiving these Bills.  I have already made representations on this matter.  I will make further representations as requested.  I hope Senator Dooge will make representations to his side in the other House to be equally co-operative. The fault does not lie just on one side. With regard to the debate on the motion I agree that we should have three days in January if that is necessary. I should be only too glad to provide that facility.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. J. Brennan) Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. J. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>This measure is designed to make better provision against the loss of income suffered by insured workers and their families during periods of sickness or unemployment than is provided by the existing flat-rate benefits under the social insurance system. Down the years these benefits have been regularly improved in many ways but their main defect is that they are not flexible enough to provide adequately for the different needs of persons who, when working, had not the same levels of earnings and, as a result, had widely differing financial commitments related to their levels of earnings. In many cases, particularly at higher pay levels, the rates of benefit are not high enough to enable insured persons to maintain anything approaching their <Col N="1330" /> accustomed standard of living during longer periods of sickness or unemployment.</P>
      <P>To raise the flat-rate benefits to a level adequate for the higher paid workers would, however, involve increasing the flat-rate contribution rates to a level that would impose a heavy burden on the lower paid worker.  The answer in the scheme proposed in this Bill is to relate both the benefit and contributions to earnings to some degree. There is nothing very novel in the idea of pay-related benefit which exists in one form or another in many countries including Britain.  It has been my intention for some time to introduce such a scheme here but it has only now become a practical proposition.</P>
      <P>The basic requirements for a scheme of pay-related benefit are to be able to collect contributions based on pay and to have accurate, reliable, and readily accessible information as to annual income on which to calculate the benefit. In the PAYE and associated methods of collecting income tax from employees the machinery now exists by which these requirements can be met for the majority of persons employed in this country, but unfortunately it does not include some classes of employees to which I will refer later.</P>
      <P>If that machinery were not to be made available for the purposes of this pay-related social insurance scheme, then a separate system of collection and of record keeping would have had to be set up by my Department for these purposes but to do so would have been an unnecessary duplication of work in the public service and would have placed an intolerable burden on employers by requiring them to furnish the same information twice.  The Revenue Commissioners themselves have only recently reached the position where they could agree to undertake the collecting of pay-related contributions and, at the same time, furnish the information needed to pay benefit, and it has thus only now become possible to introduce the pay-related benefit scheme provided for in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The scheme of pay-related benefit in this Bill is designed to provide a new <Col N="1331" /> benefit, under the social insurance system, which will supplement the unemployment benefit payable where a person is unemployed and the disability benefit and maternity allowance payable where a person is incapable of work.  A person who is entitled to disability benefit may, because his incapacity is due to an accident at work or a specified occupational disease, be in receipt of injury benefit under the occupational injuries scheme in lieu of disability benefit and it is intended that pay-related benefit will be payable to him so long as he has an underlying entitlement to disability benefit.</P>
    <P>The existing flat-rate benefits mentioned, including amounts for adult and child dependants, will continue to be payable under the same conditions as at present.  The scheme will provide, for persons earning more than £14 a week where the incapacity for work or unemployment lasts for longer than a fortnight, for the flat-rate benefit to be supplemented by pay-related benefit, which will be at the rate of 40 per cent of that part of the claimant's average weekly earnings, in a previous income tax year, which lies between £14 and an upper limit or ceiling, yet to be fixed.</P>
    <P>I should explain that the level of 40 per cent of gross pay was chosen after an examination of the real value of various levels of pay-related benefit in terms of replacement of the actual loss of pay during periods of sickness or unemployment.  Very few workers take home the full amount of their pay.  Stoppages of various kinds are almost invariably made and these include statutory deductions in respect of social insurance contributions and income tax.  These statutory deductions, which arise out of payment of remuneration, are not made during weeks of unemployment or sickness and accordingly income replacement by way of benefit during such weeks, should properly relate only to the person's net or take home pay after these deductions have been made.</P>
    <P>As I have indicated the main purpose of having benefits related to pay is to enable the recipient to maintain, during periods when he is not at work, <Col N="1332" /> a standard of living reasonably comparable to that which he normally enjoys.  Children's allowances, where payable, are part of the family income and are paid whether the beneficiary is earning or sick or unemployed, and it is reasonable to add these payments both to the level of take home pay and to the level of benefit in determining the real value of the pay related benefit in maintaining the beneficiary's standard of living. The existing flat-rate benefit provides 40 per cent of gross pay up to £14. The 40 per cent of reckonable earnings in excess of £14 when added to the flat-rate benefit payable, therefore provides, in the case of single persons, replacement of at least 50 per cent of net pay at all pay levels while, in the case of married persons, the level of replacement is higher because of the addition of increases of flat-rate benefit in respect of dependants.  The level of replacement of net pay, for example, at average weekly earnings of £30 would be approximately 65 per cent for a married man, 70 per cent for a married man with two children, and 75 per cent for a married man with four children.  At earnings of £20 the level of replacement would be higher still, being 70 per cent for a married man, 78 per cent for a married man with two children and almost 90 per cent for a married man with four children.  It could happen in the case of persons with large families whose reckonable weekly earnings are low that, when the amount of pay related benefit is added to the flat-rate benefit, the total amount payable would exceed the average weekly earnings on which the benefit was based.  As the object of the scheme is to enable a person to maintain his standard of living it would seem illogical if the scheme were to provide for his income, during periods of sickness or unemployment, to be supplemented to a higher level than when he was working.  This can be prevented by putting a ceiling or wage stop related to a person's pay on the total amount of benefit that could be paid to him and there is provision to do this by regulations.</P>
    <P>As I have mentioned, the basic flat-rate <Col N="1333" /> disability and unemployment benefits for a single person, £5.55, represents approximately 40 per cent of £14 and a still higher percentage of normal take home pay in such a case.  A single person earning less than £13.88 receives by way of flat-rate disability or unemployment benefit more than 40 per cent of his earnings or more than 50 per cent of his net or take home pay.</P>
    <P>A married man in this category receives as flat-rate benefit for himself and his wife at least 75 per cent of his net pay.  If he has children he receives a considerably higher proportion by way of replacement income.  This varies from at least 95 per cent if he has a wife and two children, to well over 100 per cent if he has more than two children or has been earning significantly less than £14 weekly; and there is no wage stop in the case of flat-rate benefit.  There is, therefore, nothing discriminatory about adopting the floor of £14 a week on weekly pay for benefit purposes in this scheme.  It derives from the nature of the scheme, being automatic when regard is had to the continued existence of the flat rate benefit.</P>
    <P>The ceiling, or upper limit of pay, which will be taken into account for benefit and contribution purposes will be prescribed by regulations.  The level of this ceiling cannot yet be decided as the remuneration limit for the compulsory insurance of non-manual workers, which at present stands at £1,600 a year, affects the issue.  As I have already announced on more than one occasion, I am anxious to have this remuneration limit abolished and I hope to be in a position to introduce legislation for that purpose shortly.</P>
    <P>If this limit were to stand the ceiling or upper limit on reckonable weekly earnings for pay-related benefit purposes could not exceed the weekly equivalent of £1,600 a year, since if non-manual workers over that limit are excluded from compulsory insurance there would be no case for including the earnings of manual workers above that level for pay-related benefit purposes. When the limit is abolished, I will be able to prescribe a ceiling on reckonable weekly earnings for pay-related <Col N="1334" /> benefit purposes which will be related to the general level of wages at the time the scheme commences and which can be changed from time to time in line with changes in that level.</P>
    <P>The average weekly earnings which will be used for the purpose of calculating the amount of pay-related benefit payable to a person will be based on his actual gross earnings from his employment which are reckonable for income tax purposes.  These earnings will include all amounts paid by his employer which are taken into account by the Revenue Commissioners as earnings for income tax purposes.  The Revenue Commissioners will supply to my Department the necessary information regarding earnings, to enable pay-related benefit to be calculated and paid.  The information to be furnished in this regard will, of course, be restricted to the minimum necessary for our purposes.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that there may be some criticism of the use of earnings in a previous income tax year on the grounds that they relate to a past period and take no account of the rises in pay levels in the meantime.  In fact, as it will be some months after the end of an income tax year before records of earnings become available, the gross earnings to be taken into account for benefit purposes may not be those in the most recently completed income tax year.  However, power is being taken to prescribe by regulations the manner and the basis of calculation of reckonable weekly earnings for the purposes of pay-related benefit and it is intended that this power will be used to inflate reckonable weekly earnings so as to compensate broadly for the effects of the time lag.</P>
    <P>Since the pay-related benefit will only be paid where there is title to flat-rate benefit the existing claim procedure will merely be expanded to ensure that for pay-related benefit purposes whatever information is needed to ascertain the amount of reckonable earnings in the relevant income tax year is obtained.  In straightforward cases, and these should be the vast majority, all that the claimant will be required to supply will be his income tax registered serial number but in <Col N="1335" /> cases where difficulties arise he may be required to furnish further information. It is the intention that both the flat-rate and pay-related benefits will be paid together in one weekly payment.</P>
    <P>The pay-related benefit will be payable for up to 147 days of unemployment during any period of interruption of employment, provided the claimant is in receipt of unemployment benefit.  It will also be payable for up to 147 days in respect of incapacity for work during any period of interruption of employment, if the claimant is entitled to disability benefit. The payment in respect of incapacity for work may be made with occupational injury benefit, if the claimant would otherwise be entitled to disability benefit, or with maternity allowance.</P>
    <P>The pay-related benefit will, in the ordinary course, begin to be payable after the claimant has been incapacitated or unemployed for two weeks. And here I must emphasise that the new benefit is not intended for the really short-term periods of incapacity or unemployment, that is those of less than a fortnight, as normally these should not seriously affect the claimant's standard of living.  It will continue to be paid, for up to 147 days in either case, for as long as the beneficiary continues to be entitled to flat-rate benefit.</P>
    <P>In the normal course a person claiming flat-rate unemployment benefit has three waiting days of unemployment before benefit becomes payable and he may then draw benefit for a further 156 days of unemployment before being subject to a new contribution condition for its continued receipt.  The pay-related benefit with unemployment benefit for 147 days after a 12-day waiting period which will include the existing three waiting days for the flat-rate benefit, will bring the beneficiary up to the point where he has been paid 156 days flat-rate unemployment benefit.  Similarly payment of pay-related benefit with disability benefit will normally cease at the point where the person has been paid 156 days disability benefit.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1336" /> I should now like to say a few words about the financing and scope of the scheme.  It is provided that the cost of the pay-related scheme will be borne by contributions from employers and their employees.  The contribution will be pay-related and thus the cost of the scheme will be spread equitably over all pay levels between £14 a week and the ceiling to be fixed for benefit purposes.  I am not satisfied that the taxpayer, through the Exchequer, should be required to contribute to a scheme which is not of general application and is, in fact, designed to provide the greatest benefit for higher paid workers and from which lower paid workers are excluded. The pay-related contribution to be levied on employers and employees will be set at a level adequate to cover the total cost of the scheme.</P>
    <P>As I have already indicated, it has been arranged to have the pay-related contributions collected by way of the income tax machinery of the Revenue Commissioners and paid into the social insurance fund and the nature of the pay to be taken into account for pay-related contribution purposes will be the same as for benefit.  Instead of using the earnings in the preceding tax year however, the contributions will be based on and collected from the person's actual earnings in the income tax year then current.  These earnings will, of course, be the earnings which will be the basis of the person's entitlement to pay-related benefit in a subsequent year.</P>
    <P>It has not yet been possible to finalise the costings of the scheme.  Apart from the question of the ceiling on reckonable earnings yet to be determined, another problem still not fully resolved is that of financing the scheme in the initial stages.  It is not possible at this stage, therefore, to determine the rate of contribution.  Subject to what I have already said, the cost of the scheme has, however, been estimated to be of the order of £7 million to £8 million a year and the rate of contribution is expected to be about 3 per cent of reckonable earnings, of which 1½ per cent will be payable by the employer and 1½ per cent by the insured person. The contribution rate as finally determined <Col N="1337" /> will be prescribed by regulations as will also the ceiling of pay up to which contributions will be levied.</P>
    <P>The scheme will apply to all insured persons in respect of whom the ordinary full rates of flat-rate employment contributions are payable under the existing social insurance system.  The scheme will thus cover most persons who are in industrial, commercial and services type employments.  These are estimated to number about 680,000 persons at present.  When the remuneration limit of £1,600 a year for compulsory social insurance is removed, this number will be increased by an estimated further 30,000 persons.  As I have already mentioned, it is not possible, at the moment, to bring into the scheme all persons whose insurance at present covers them for disability and unemployment benefit.  The main groups thus affected are male agricultural workers, numbering about 38,000, and female agricultural workers and domestic employees who are estimated to number about 15,000.  The reason why they cannot be brought in is that it will not be possible within the income tax collection system at present to collect pay-related contributions from them or to provide the information regarding their earnings which would enable pay-related benefit to be calculated.  The Bill would provide for power to bring into the scheme by regulations classes of employees other than those in respect of whom the ordinary rates of employment contributions are payable.  It is my intention to pursue this matter with a view to extending the scheme to include those classes by regulations.  Any decision in this matter, however, would revolve largely on the feasibility of collecting pay-related contributions from the particular class being considered.</P>
    <P>The scheme will be brought into operation by an order or orders which will be made by me.  I am anxious that the scheme should be brought into operation as soon as possible.  The Revenue Commissioners are, however, unable to undertake the collection of the pay-related contributions from a date earlier than the 6th April, 1974 which is the start of an income tax year and also the date on which the <Col N="1338" /> collection of pay-related health contributions from various categories of persons including those insured under the Social Welfare Acts will commence. However, while the collection of pay-related social insurance contributions cannot start until 6th April, 1974, I hope to be able to start payment of pay-related benefit some months earlier and to this end I am consulting with the Minister for Finance with a view to determining the earliest date from which this can be done having regard to the usual budgetary considerations. The Bill, therefore, includes provision for advances for this purpose from the Central Fund to the social insurance fund, any such advances being on a repayment basis.  The amounts of the advances, the terms of repayment and the effect of such repayment on the level of contributions have yet to be decided.</P>
    <P>The proposals in this Bill represent a significant advance in the development of our social insurance system.  Not only are they important in regard to the increased benefits they will provide and because they constitute a major advance towards bringing our social security code into line with the social codes of the EEC and other countries, but they will pave the way for further appropriate developments in our social security code in the wider field of long term benefits and pensions.  As soon as this new scheme has got off the ground and is operating smoothly, I intend to use the experience gained and the basic machinery established under it to develop complementary schemes of pay-related pensions within the social insurance system.  I should sound a warning, however, that even with the best will in the world these proposed developments cannot be brought about overnight and any such changes must in the ultimate be considered in relation to general financial and economic circumstances and developments in other services.</P>
    <P>I hope that the explanations I have given here coupled with the information contained in the explanatory memorandum circulated with the Bill will give Senators a fuller understanding of the proposals in the Bill which are, of course, highly technical and <Col N="1339" /> specialised.  A great deal of the details of the scheme will appear in regulations to be drafted under the provisions of the Bill.  Development of the procedures for collection of contributions and also for the payment of the supplementary benefits has already entailed a great deal of work both in the office of the Revenue Commissioners and in my own Department but much still remains to be done.</P>
    <P>I have great pleasure in recommending this Bill to Seanad Éireann for early and favourable consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Fine Gael Party, I should certainly like to welcome this Bill.  It is many years since we, in Fine Gael&mdash;I think in the 1965 general election&mdash;clearly embodied a similar type pay-related benefit scheme in our Just Society policy.  It was also embodied in the Labour Party's policy in the last general election. In 1949 the Government in power and the Minister then dealing with social welfare published a White Paper on social security.  They proposed that social insurance should be extended to cover persons over 16 years of age who are in employment.  The Government Party themselves mentioned this in their Third Programme for Economic Expansion in 1969.  After a long delay we get the Bill today.</P>
      <P>As the Minister said in his opening statement, contributions will not be collected until 6th April, 1974, which is the commencement of the income tax year.  It is the intention of the Minister to grant pay-related benefit to people who are justly entitled to it.  Everybody knows that when people become unemployed or ill through no fault of their own, they are not able to earn and their incomes should be supplemented to almost the same extent as when employed. Social Welfare payments that have been granted as a result of the budget are usually paid in October or November.  It, therefore, looks as if it will be October or November of next year, or even January of the following year before this scheme will be put into effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most disappointing thing about the scheme is its short duration.  Pay-related <Col N="1340" /> benefit will only be paid for a period of approximately 5½ months. One wonders if the Minister is being fair to people who have been paying contributions and taxes generally for a long number of years.  I do not think that it is long enough and the Minister should extend it to at least a 12-month period.</P>
    <P>The only income mentioned is £14 per week.  What would become of people who have an income of less than that?  There are many people in this country in receipt of an income of less than £14: some with as little as £10 who may be apprentices.  But these are insured people who are paying income tax.  Are they going to be deprived of benefit under the pay-related scheme?  As long as a person is in insurable employment, he should qualify for benefit.</P>
    <P>There are a few other cases that must be mentioned at this stage.  Take the case of a widow whose husband was insured and after his death she finds herself having to maintain herself and the children.  It does not matter how many children, she will not qualify for pay-related benefit.</P>
    <P>This scheme is only piecemeal at the moment.  There are 53,000 widows in this country whose husbands were in insurable employment.  These widows who are in receipt of a contributory pension look after 18,000 children and I do not think any Minister could be serious in asking this House or the Dáil to pass this Bill without thinking of widows and their children.  I probably feel more aggrieved about this than any other Senator because I am the son of a widow.  There were seven of us in the family and I was only ten years old when my father died.  I know the hardship my mother and every other member of the family endured while she reared us and endeavoured to give us a fairly good standard of living.  We could not compare in any way with those whose fathers were still living.</P>
    <P>The flat rate of unemployment benefit to a widow and three children is £10.10 per week and that divided by four gives each person £2.52.  I do not <Col N="1341" /> think it is possible to live on that amount.  Not alone should the benefit be paid for a six month period but it should be paid to a widow with children until each of the children become of age.  I hope the Minister will have another look at this Bill.</P>
    <P>The agricultural workers are not going to be graded as second, third or fourth class citizens but as fifth class citizens.  People employed in industry will qualify for pay-related benefit but the agricultural worker will not qualify for it.  In 1971 we had 38,000 agricultural workers and the total numbers had been dropping for some years prior to that at the rate of 10,000 per year. There are about 28,000 agricultural workers at the moment.  The reason they are not being taken into the scheme is that their employers would have to make PAYE returns to the Revenue Commissioners, or some other reason.  Whatever the reasons they could be easily overcome by the Minister's Department.  Ninety-eight per cent of these people must be insured.  It would not be a big job for the officials of the Department of Social Welfare to check to see how many of them there are, to what benefits they are entitled and to give it to them just the same as their opposite numbers in other employments.</P>
    <P>Unemployment benefit for an agricultural worker, getting £20 per week, is £5.55.  An industrial worker who is single and earning £20 per week will get £5.55 unemployment benefit plus £5.80 pay-related benefit, which will give him an income of £11.35.  However, the same deductions will be made from them for income tax.  Admittedly the agricultural worker's stamp is slightly cheaper than the industrial worker's stamp.</P>
    <P>Often it does not pay to live in a rural part of the country&mdash;certainly it will no longer pay to live there&mdash;and instead of the figure dropping at the rate of 10,000 per year I am afraid it will drop at a much higher rate.</P>
    <P>The payment of contributions will be shared equally by employee and employer and the Minister said that 3 per cent of the gross wages would be paid.  That is not a surprising figure&mdash;I <Col N="1342" /> thought it might be higher&mdash;but it is acceptable enough.  It is a bit unfair to introduce a scheme like this and leave out a number of people who should not be left out.  It would not be unreasonable if the taxpayer was asked to make a contribution towards this scheme in order to ensure that widows and agricultural workers would be included in it.  It is not an unreasonable request to make and I doubt if anybody would begrudge the contribution. I welcome the scheme and hope that the ceiling of £1,600 will be removed shortly.  I can see this being a rather slow process because the figure of £1,600 income per year is used as a norm not only by the Department of Health but by the Department of Local Government, who use it in respect of the payment of supplementary grants by county councils.  The figure of £1,800 is used in determining loans for people in the middle income group.</P>
    <P>In my opinion it will be some time before the Minister can satisfy himself that this figure will go although he says that it will go shortly.  I hope he is right on that.  It is difficult to discuss a social welfare Bill and keep within its scope but if it takes as long to revise the £1,600 figure as it has to take steps to revise the non-contributory pension of £52.50 per year which stands since 1952, God help us.</P>

      <P>It amuses me when I hear members of the Opposition parties saying that they had this proposal in their election campaigns in 1965 and 1969.  However, we know what the people decided.  In framing a new social welfare scheme the Government must feel their way.  Senator Reynolds stated that 147 days was a short payment. Fianna Fáil have been responsible for all the improvements made in the social welfare benefits.  The contributions made to the social welfare benefits by the Opposition when in office were pitifully low.  The old age pensioners have got an increase in every budget under Fianna Fáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree that agricultural workers should be brought under the scheme but is Senator Reynolds prepared to go to the rural areas and tell the people they must have the tax inspector <Col N="1343" /> work out the tax they should have paid last year?  He might not be too popular in advocating such a policy.</P>
    <P>The agricultural workers will be brought into this scheme as soon as possible but the scheme has been designed to meet those who get a higher rate of pay but who suddenly drop to the social welfare level.  If a person who has £30 per week falls ill and cannot work for a long period, great hardship can be caused to his family.</P>

      <P>No.  This Bill is designed for those who are unemployed or ill for prolonged periods to enable them to have a reasonable amount coming in and which would be relative to what their actual earnings had been.</P>
      <P>I note it is being collected through income tax and that the benefit will be paid from that source.  From my experience with the income tax section it is difficult to obtain quick decisions. We have experience of this through the Board of Works.  There should be a system of assessing incomes quickly. I am sure the Minister will ensure that there will not be any undue delay in issuing those contributions.</P>
      <P>Forty per cent is a realistic figure. A total of 147 days unemployment should be more than ample for the present to give the person a chance of obtaining other employment or to be trained for a new job.</P>
      <P>This matter was included in the Third Programme for Economic Expansion and we have lived up to our promises in introducing this Bill.  I note that the Minister hopes at an early date to introduce an insurance scheme to cover all citizens, including the self-employed and those earning more than £1,600 per annum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>New Bills take time to come to fruition.  Care must be taken in their drafting to ensure they will be fair and will meet the idea put forward.  I was interested to read in a recent issue of a <Col N="1344" /> trade union periodical available in the Library that our social welfare benefits fall far behind those in Northern Ireland. Economic growth and social welfare benefits go together.  We have outlined that very forcibly over the years.  As our economic growth improves we must also increase our social welfare benefits and bring in new schemes for the less well-off people in our community. The Minister in his Second Reading speech mentioned that he hoped to bring in pay-related pensions in the years to come.  Our economic growth must continue to improve in order to provide schemes that will benefit our people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EileenDesmond" hpid="Mrs. Desmond Mrs. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>We, in the Labour benches, welcome any measure designed to improve the social welfare services.  We are concerned that so far schemes have not been brought forward to eliminate the poverty we all see around us.  I regard the Minister's proposal to introduce pay-related pensions as a step in the right direction. This is by no means a new concept.  It is already in operation in many countries. We all agree that it should be in operation here.  It would eliminate a great deal of hardship.  If our social welfare benefits are designed to provide security against illness, unemployment, or misfortune generally the rate of benefit must be as closely related as possible to the normal income of the family.</P>
      <P>At present we have a flat rate benefit of £5.55 for a sick person.  A sick person living alone is not an unusual phenomenon here.  All over the country there are sick people living alone who have to survive on this very small sum of money.  By virtue of the poverty imposed on them by this paltry rate of sickness benefit their recovery must be slowed down.  The rate of benefit for married couples is also inadequate.  All flat rates are inadequate.  Therefore we welcome any supplement that this measure provides.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister stated that the scheme will be financed solely by the employer and employee and no contribution will be made by the State.  One could accept that in so far as the scheme is limited to people on higher rates of income <Col N="1345" /> One might use the word &ldquo;higher&rdquo; when referring to incomes in excess of £14 per week.  With its limited application a contribution from the State would not be acceptable at this stage.</P>
    <P>I should like clarification from the Minister on one point.  He stated that the rate of contribution would be roughly at the rate of one and a half per cent from the employer and the same figure from the employee.  This would be based on reckonable income. I do not know if by &ldquo;reckonable income&rdquo; the Minister means the total income or the difference between £14 and whatever income the person might have.  If the total income is reckoned it would discriminate against the lower paid worker.  Proportionately he would have to pay a higher contribution.  I hope the Minister regards the &ldquo;reckonable income&rdquo; as the difference between £14 and the actual income the employed person has.  That would be fair and equitable.</P>
    <P>We have all heard criticism of the benefits people receive for their contributions which increase every year. The optical, dental and appliances benefits are limited.  They are limited, first of all, in the contribution made towards them in respect of the employed person and also in that they are not extended to the employed person's wife and family.  The expense incurred by the employed person in regard to these services is covered only to a very limited extent under the social welfare services.  An increase in contributions needs to be justified before it is accepted by the workers.</P>
    <P>The Minister made the point that there was nothing discriminatory in maintaining the percentage.  The system as it applies at present is discriminatory towards women workers. Women in general pay a lower rate of contribution than men but when it is applied to their rate of pay they are in fact paying more.  I make that point to put on record my approval of a pay-related scheme of contributions and benefits.</P>
    <P>Senator Reynolds raised the point that there is nothing in the scheme to assist those whose incomes are under £14 per week.  They are numerous.  The <Col N="1346" /> average woman worker's income is still under £14 per week.  There are, I am sure, men whose income is also under this figure.  We are very concerned about those people.  We speak of maintaining standards but these people have never had standards.  I ask the Minister to ensure that the aim will be to improve their position.  He should also ensure that any system of benefit, such as this, is not a substitute for reasonable flat-rate benefits for people whose income is under £14 per week.  This would make life easier for them.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Reynold's view that in principle all workers should be included.  Some difficulty may be experienced in collecting contributions from employers of farm workers, domestic workers <i>et cetera</i>, but this should not exclude them from the Bill.  The Minister should have included every category of worker in this measure.  If difficulty arose in operating the scheme he might have to defer it until an acceptable, workable system of collecting contributions could be worked out.  To exclude workers in principle is very wrong and unjust.  That should not be written into a Bill of this nature.  In this connection I am speaking not only of farm workers but also of domestic workers.  It is discrimination to distinguish between these two sections of workers.  They have been left out of many measures which have come before the Houses of the Oireachtas in the past.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke of extending the scheme to include other categories of social welfare recipients such as old age pensioners and widows.  I agree wholeheartedly that this should be done but I was disheartened to discover that the Minister will not be able to make the provision under this measure or in the immediate future. The Minister spoke of when the scheme is operative but it will not start until 1974 and one can imagine the delay before the Minister can extend it to old age pensioners and widows.</P>
    <P>I am not making light of the problems of old age pensioners but I want to make a particular plea on behalf <Col N="1347" /> of widows.  All the reasons which make such a system as this necessary are also applicable to the case of widows.  To maintain a standard of living is very difficult for women when they become widows.  Their commitments at the time of becoming widows are enormously heavy.  They may have large mortgages on houses and young children to rear and educate.  They are being asked to do this on half their former income.  Very many of them are asked to do it on a third of their former income under what we grant them in the present scheme of social welfare payments.</P>
    <P>All the other difficulties of widowhood are greatly increased by the financial burden they have to bear.  When we know people personally we realise the enormous hardship they have to suffer.  The husband may have had very good wages and even worked overtime in order to provide extra luxuries for his family and then he is no longer present.  The wife must shoulder all the burden because we have no adequate scheme of social security for widows. Therefore, I cannot see the reason for introducing such a scheme and excluding widows.  I hope that before the Bill is finally passed provision is made for widows.  It is poor consolation for them to hear that when this scheme is operational in 1974 the Minister in charge will then consider extending the scheme to include them.</P>
    <P>There is also a need in respect of deserted wives.  Their case could not be made better than was done by the programme on television last Saturday night.  Through that programme, the various women's organisations and the AIM group highlighted the particular problems not only of deserted wives but of women generally.  I am saddened that, in a Bill such as this, domestic workers and women workers generally are excluded.</P>
    <P>While I welcome this measure, it is certainly no substitute for a new code of social welfare, new and radical thinking on social welfare and on the needs of those who must depend on social welfare.  We welcome it as a first step only but there are other steps urgently needed.  The measure is vague <Col N="1348" /> in so far as the ceiling of contributions and the total cost of the scheme are concerned.  It is limited in its application. However, the principle is good and on that account we welcome it but we hope that it will be extended very shortly to include the categories I mentioned.</P>

      <P>This legislation is the start, we hope, of a whole new scheme which will make the lot of the worker much easier.  Senator Reynolds found many faults with the scheme and did not give it much praise.  He said it would take a long time for the scheme to become operative.  He must not have read the Minister's opening statement very carefully.  The Minister said he hoped to start the scheme early in 1974; since it would not come into operation until 6th April, 1974 the collections would not have started but he would borrow money from the social welfare fund to finance it in the meantime.</P>
      <P>Senator Reynolds also took exception to the fact that it would take a long time to go from £1,600 upwards. I draw his attention to the fact that the limit was £1,200 in 1968.  In three years it went up to £1,600.  There is nothing to say that we will not accelerate this progress and have a higher income ceiling very shortly.</P>
      <P>There are many claims now in regard to socialism.  Fianna Fáil is now being dubbed as a conservative party.  Anybody who takes the trouble, especially young people, to examine the legislation put forward by Fianna Fáil will realise that they are not a conservative but a very socialistic party.  They are very concerned with workers.  They have introduced many benefits for them.  Since we are supposed to be ridden by employers, I am disappointed that there is no cover in this Bill for any employer who might be disabled or out of work.  All the benefits in this Bill are for the workers. In the Bill we read:</P>
      <P>The contributions will be from employers and their employees.  The pay-related contribution to be levied on the employers and the employees will be set at a level adequate to cover the total cost of the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1349" /> This is only just.  But when we talk of employers have we visions of people who employ 400 or 500 and who are chauffeur-driven or are we thinking of employers, who are known to so many of us, who employ two and three people on whom the burden of paying all these contributions is a very heavy load?  Most of them would welcome these benefits if they could be applied to themselves.</P>
    <P>Many employers at the end of the year do not have £1,600 to call their own.  If they become unemployed, they are not entitled to any benefits. If they are sick, they cannot get their expenses for hospitalisation unless they are contributing to the Voluntary Health Scheme or the new £7 a year health scheme.</P>
    <P>I believe this Bill fell short in that it did not take cognisance of small employers who would avail of such a scheme.  Self-employed people are often forgotten altogether.  Many workers dream of the day when they will become self-employed but when they become self-employed and employ one other person they then become employers and have a very heavy burden placed on them as a consequence. This is a matter to which the Department should give serious thought when drawing up this type of legislation.</P>
    <P>If this money is to be collected in the same way as PAYE, I can see difficulties arising.  Anyone with experience of dealing with PAYE cards knows that, after the 5th April any year, cards are received for employees setting out two different types of tax free allowances for people who have sent in exactly the same kind of returns.  About four months afterwards, for some strange reason, one can get as many as four more cards for the same employee.  This is continually happening in the Revenue Commissioners office.  If the same type of confusion arises with the collection of social welfare benefits, it will create a lot of work and trouble for employers.  Our good and socialistic party, Fianna Fáil, think nothing of asking employers to undertake this work of collecting taxes for them free. Employers get nothing out of it except trouble.  I am sorry the Minister is not <Col N="1350" /> here to take note of my remarks but I am sure they will be conveyed to him. Employers would not mind collecting this money if they were allowed to join in the scheme themselves.  We need to do something for our employers.  Too many of our small employers are being victimised.</P>
    <P>I join with Senator Desmond in saying that I should like to see widows catered for a little better than they are at present.  I know that all schemes have to make a start somewhere and the greatest possible number of people must be catered for first.  The amount of money available for schemes such as this is very limited.  I am sure the Minister would like to become Santa Claus and give every class and category of person the amount of money we would like to give them.  We have travelled a long way in our social services over the last few years.  We are bringing them upwards very swiftly, indeed, much more swiftly than was envisaged ten years ago.  Of course, the more we get the more we want and no matter who is served or how well he is served there will always be someone who will not be getting the benefits he deserves.</P>
    <P>Even though I may appear to have taken the employers' side in speaking on this Bill, I should like to congratulate the Minister on this very welcome addition to the social welfare services.  I hope the implementation of this scheme will not place too great a burden on employers or employees. The scheme has a great future so long as it does not weigh too heavily on any particular sector.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamOBrien1977" hpid="Mr. W. O'Brien Mr. W. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. W. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill but it strikes me as strange that its provisions will not be implemented until late in 1974.  We must take into consideration the value of the contribution in 1974.  I can see amending legislation being brought in here in 1974 asking to delete the £3.60 in some cases and the £5.80 in other cases and bring the figure up to a more realistic level.  At the rate the cost of living is increasing today, if the Minister wishes to increase any benefits he must do so as soon as possible because within a few months they are no longer realistic <Col N="1351" /> because of the continuing reduction in the value of the £ sterling.</P>
      <P>Some Senators referred to people under £14 not being included.  This is something that should be reconsidered by the Minister.  The Bill was designed to maintain a certain standard of living when the weekly income is not available because of illness or unemployment but a reduction from £13.95 to £5.55 in weekly income would make a tremendous difference to a person's standard of living.  There are quite a number of people in this country earning less than £14 a week.  Many hotel employees earn only a basic wage of £12 because tips from guests are taken into account.  If our cost of living continues to increase at its present rate, I fail to see how these people can survive on such wages.</P>
      <P>Reference has been made to agricultural workers and their position is alarming.  It has been rightly stated that it is not possible to bring all sections of our people into the scheme but the fact that our people working on the land are deprived of the benefits of this scheme will, in my opinion, do untold harm to our economy.  We read in the newspapers almost every day reports of meetings of the IDA pointing out the number of people being placed in industry and which paints a picture of the future five-year plan.  The number of people who have left agriculture during the past five years has exceeded by far the number of people who have been placed in industry.  That fact alone should force the Minister to think again.</P>
      <P>Every incentive possible should be introduced, to encourage people into industry.  In view of our entry into the Common Market and of the great prospect agriculture holds for us in Europe, we should in no circumstances do anything that would remove the workers from the land.  It is something that should be taken very seriously because our exports play such a large part in our economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be unreasonable to ask the Minister to cover all fields but I think widows should be included.  To me this Bill is a greater advantage to the highly paid workers than it is to the poorer <Col N="1352" /> sections.  We must forget about high standards and should talk about ordinary comforts and about existence.  We ought to make sure that all sections of the community have enough to live on. For that reason the lower income group should get priority.</P>
    <P>As I looked at the figures something tempted me to ask: what would be the prospect for a single man with £30? If he becomes ill he gets £11.95.  As a single man at the moment, he would not qualify for any health services.  If the income which he derived from the scheme were to be taken into consideration at the moment, he would be denied a free doctor, according to the present standards of the health authority.  Somebody may tell me I am wrong.  I am open to correction.  I sincerely hope that the Minister will have a consultation with the Minister for Health and notify all health boards that it is the intention to raise the ceiling necessary to qualify for a health card.</P>
    <P>When I read the Bill I understood from it that pay-related benefits were paid on the previous income tax year. Should that be the case, what would the position be if, for the first six months of the year, a man worked in England and came to Ireland for the second six months?  Would there be cooperation between the two countries to make benefit available to that man?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to welcome this Bill.  It brings in a principle of which we all approve, that is, helping families in times of distress to maintain their standard of living, or at least it makes an effort in that direction. As the Minister has said, these schemes are not in any way novel; they exist in many other countries, including England.  We can therefore welcome what the Bill contains, and we can quite rightly advocate the inclusion of those other groups who we think should be included.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most disturbing feature I find in it is the rather casual way in which half the scheme is loaded on to Irish industry and the other half on to the workers.  It may be said that, as far as the workers are concerned, it is a type of insurance for them and that <Col N="1353" /> they are getting something from it. However, as Senator Farrell has said, there is nothing comparable for Irish industry, especially at a time when industry is having a hard fight to survive. We cannot casually load additional costs on to Irish industry with a stroke of the pen.  One and a half per cent increase in the wage bill for the classes covered by this is, to many industries, quite a sizeable addition. It is one that could affect considerably the competitiveness of many industries. It is a wrong facile approach that we have been using much in all sorts of schemes; that is, putting one half of the cost on to the group concerned, and the other half on to industry.  It is not as if Irish industry was strong and sturdy and capable of facing such burdens.  I suggest that schemes that do not add to the cost of Irish industry should be made available, but they should not add to the burden on the taxpayer.  If you want to raise the additional 3 per cent from Irish industry, why not arrange that the industries concerned would, with the agreement of employees and management, work an additional 15 per cent or one and a half hours in the week?  That one and a half hours could be devoted to the provision of this worthwhile social fund.  Indeed, if we adopted such an approach, it would be quite easy to extend the scheme so as to include the widows of former workers in those industries. It would help the workers and industry if idle machinery were used to generate the money necessary.  By those means you would maintain both the wage packet of the workers and the competitiveness of industry.</P>
    <P>In the time ahead we are likely to have many further claims of the nature mentioned in this Bill, types of insurance funds for worthwhile social purposes. I would therefore suggest that the contributions from the extra hour or two worked in the week is the way to meet that, and not simply to keep on loading cost on to Irish industry which is already overburdened.  When examined in the European context, our industries could afford to carry this, because, by and large, the work week in this country is shorter than the work <Col N="1354" /> week in Germany, France and most continental countries.  We require a greatly modernised and revolutionised social code, with all these pay-related and other benefits, but let us get that by increased work and increased utilisation of the machinery and the premises of Irish industry and not merely delude ourselves into the belief that by legislation we can simply put on another 2, 3, 4 or 5 per cent on to Irish industrial costs any time it pleases us to do so.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Desmond on the necessity to extend those provisions as soon as possible to the widows who should have been included from the start.  She also mentioned deserted wives.  We have seen television programmes about this and what keeps the Government from legislating on these matters.  We saw how quickly the Government got the Offences against the State Act and other legislation through when it was required.  What is keeping them from bringing in a proper code in relation to deserted wives? Surely the Minister's Department should be able to draft the legislation in a week, and I guarantee him that every Member of the House would agree with me in saying we would put it through in a short time if we got the opportunity.  I cannot understand why we are so remiss in this.</P>
    <P>In addition, I should like to make a plea for the self-employed and for the salaried workers who are outside this scheme and who are beginning to feel what unemployment means.  In the United States the professional groups are now figuring very much in the unemployment lists.  That is bound to affect us here.  There should be some help given to such people, such as schemes that may be advanced through insurance or otherwise to help them over such periods.  The State might help in this regard by allowing the proceeds of such schemes to be classed for earned income allowance in the income tax code.  This would greatly help those people who would be either unemployed or have serious illness thrust upon them.  This is common justice.  When they have made their contribution under the income tax code down the years, they should get <Col N="1355" /> help when their incomes have dropped much below that level.</P>
    <P>With those reservations I commend the Bill, but, again, I ask the Minister to find some other way to finance these in his future legislation rather than breaking the back of Irish industry and also depleting the wage packet of the worker.  Let them work an extra few hours to get the money to provide the wherewithal for all those necessary social schemes that they rightly want.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>In case anything I might say in the short speech I intend to make here this afternoon would confuse the position, I should like to say that I certainly welcome the pay-related social welfare scheme, even if I find it coming late and in a form I do not find adequate.  I do not share the attitude of people who are constantly engaged in running down the nature of the Irish achievement and who do not measure adequately or fairly the nature of the social welfare provisions we have, having regard to the nature of our social and economic structure and the comparative wealth of our people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a few rather obvious points which are worth making if I can make them coherently.  It is symbolic enough that in this week before Christmas we have a Social Welfare Bill which does not contain a single provision which is designed to benefit the worst off of our people. This is a Social Welfare Bill designed to benefit those rather better off than the worst off.  It is a social income distribution Bill to benefit people who are outside the category of the worst off.  For clarity purposes it is worth emphasising what the Minister made clear in his introductory speech that not one penny of the cost of this operation&mdash;apart from the administrative cost, if there is any which is not charged on the social insurance fund&mdash;will come from the Exchequer. This is a redistribution of incomes between peoples of a particular income range.  It is worth noting that this does not benefit at all and may ultimately worsen, if it has any inflationary consequences, <Col N="1356" /> the position of anybody with less than £14 per week.</P>
    <P>It does not benefit agricultural or domestic workers.  It does not provide for pay-related benefits in the form of pay-related retirement pensions, pay-related old age contributory pensions, pay-related mortality benefits, pay-related contributory widows pensions nor pay-related invalidity pensions. It does not affect the position of non-manual workers with more than £1,600 per year unless they have voluntarily continued their contributions.</P>
    <P>When considering the slowness, one should remember just how slow.  It is a party point if you like, but it is still a point.  This was the declared policy of this party as far back as 1965.  It was announced as a Government decision in March, 1969 and it will come into effect in the beginning of 1974.  It has reached this stage slowly and there is much yet to be defined before we know where it will finally reach.  The upper limit is not fixed yet to reckonable earnings for the purpose of determining what is to be the pay-related benefit.</P>
    <P>I am not saying that all the judgments which I discover as involved or implied in this legislation are wrong. Some of them are right, for example, the statement by the Minister with regard to the undesirable effect of high flat-rate benefits.  I accept that, but if I understand correctly the Minister's statement in the Dáil, the existing flat-rate benefits have already some of the undesired effects in that in particular situations these yield to persons benefits higher than their incomes.</P>
    <P>This is a social evil which should be cured by appropriate legislation such as a Social Welfare Bill.  One suggestion was made, that some particular fiscal relief might not be given in such cases; the other might be to accept a new notion, that where one discovered such a situation there would be a legal statutory minimum income payable. This may be wide of the mark from one wholly inexperienced in this field, but it is an example of the situation which must be faced.</P>
    <P>It has been stated here today there is no provision for the employer; there <Col N="1357" /> is no provision for the self-employed. There was a mention of comprehensive social insurance which would have the effect of making possible the abolition of the means test.</P>
    <P>Could the Minister give us some idea how soon such a scheme might be conceived as practicably possible?  I cannot make judgments without some guidance as to what is involved.  The Minister's advisers should enable him to give some indication of how imminent a decision by the Government might be with regard to such a matter.</P>
    <P>Am I correct in thinking that the effect of abolishing the £1,600 maximum for the compulsory income of the non-manual worker would be to add only 30,000 to the number of persons who would come within the scheme, pay-related and otherwise?  If this is correct, I make the percentage of the total of the employees who are covered by the existing scheme as less than five.  If the Minister contemplates introducing this legislation soon, what are the factors which make it impossible for him to offer us this legislation now?  Why, if it is imminent do we need legislation on the point?  Why does the Minister not ask us to give him power by order to abolish that limit if abolition rather than extension is what is intended?</P>
    <P>With the development of exporting industry and the tax reliefs available for exporters; with our membership of the EEC and the effect of that membership on our farming community, significant economic development has taken place or can be foreseen which would change the nature of our economy to one making possible that kind of comprehensive scheme without which we will remain dissatisfied with the progress which we have made.</P>
    <P>We are not just speaking about social progress here today or a desire to harmonise our code with those of the other EEC countries.  We should query whether proportions of 50/50 as between employer and employee are correct.  Are the proportions different in the other EEC countries? We are also talking about taking steps which make possible future economic progress as well.  The two are intimately <Col N="1358" /> linked and it is no longer possible for wise men to think of personal wealth accumulation without being conscious of the necessity, for their own enjoyment, of such social progress as will generate social stability.</P>
    <P>Though dissatisfied with slowness of progress and not happy with all I see here today, I see enough to be prepared to welcome the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. J. Brennan) Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. J. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted that all those Senators who have spoken welcomed the Bill.  This is a new dimension in our social welfare code. It will be written into the code as another scheme, different from any we have ever had.</P>
      <P>Before dealing with specific points, I should like to state that I have introduced the Bill as an opening to many new schemes in social welfare that were not possible before.  We are all agreed on the desirability of a pay-related scheme.  The difficulty of implementing it must be obvious to all. We have not tabs on everybody's ear such as we have with cattle but we must have this on the people we deal with in relation to this pay-related benefit scheme.</P>
      <P>This is the first time we have been able to get machinery prepared to take in 680,000 persons which though small in number is too many to leave out until we are ready to take in everybody as was suggested by Senator Desmond. The Revenue Commissioners have computerised the earnings and what the pay-related contributions and the pay-related benefits will be.  Having got that under way we will have opened the road to giving consideration to long-term benefits some time in the future. The sooner the better.  When I say long-term benefits I mean pensions.  This is a different kettle of fish altogether.  We can extend the scheme to any type of insured person so long as we are prepared to calculate the cost.  That brings me to the criticism of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every Bill I have had the pleasure of introducing in my short time as Minister for Social Welfare was welcomed, <Col N="1359" /> but heralded by complaints that it did not go far enough.  Each year saw something else added.  The schemes climbed and spread, improving in depth and scope.  But no sooner had one a new scheme on the books than there was a clamour for its extension to this, that and every other section.</P>
    <P>When I first introduced free travel arrangements they were only applicable to old age pensioners.  They have been extended to all persons over 70 years of age and to British pensioners.  Appeals have been made to me to extend the scheme to widows and invalids.  There is hardly a section of the community which has not been suggested.</P>
    <P>When I introduced the relative allowances for persons taking care of old age pensioners who otherwise would be alone, they applied first to persons who had to give up insured employment. Under pressure that all sections be brought in we extended the scheme to non-insured persons.  We further extended the scheme to male persons.  I am under continuous pressure to extend it even further.  Like this scheme, it was the beginning of a good scheme that was capable of being developed and extended in the right direction.  In bringing in any scheme, one must make a beginning.</P>
    <P>We have had social welfare for a number of years.  It is relatively new in any country.  It was after the last war that social welfare schemes began to be developed anywhere in a worthwhile manner.  We always seem to be of the opinion that we can have this, that and the other scheme at no cost to anyone.  Everybody must know that the only thing that sets a limit to my social conscience is the ability of the people to pay for these schemes.  It is a simple thing to bring legislation through both Houses of the Oireachtas; by merely bringing in legislation we could give £25 a week to widows if somebody could only produce the money for me and show where the priorities lay.  Widows are lobbying and putting up a strong case for improvements in their pensions.  However, no lobby will make me change my priorities.  Widows are one of the top priorities, but there are many <Col N="1360" /> others.  As I said in the Dáil, a woman with an invalid husband is in a worse position than a widow.  She has not, perhaps, the numbers to make a strong lobby for her case.  I have a conscience and I know she is in an equally poor position.  A widow without dependants is little different from a single girl.</P>
    <P>There are a great number of things I should like to do.  Widows with dependants take top priority with me, but they are only one of the many sections. There are invalids, old people and the blind.  These people cannot be cast aside in order to give all the benefits to one section.  If we had sufficient money we could bring them all in.  Thank God, every year seems to make it possible to get more money. To give one shilling per week to the welfare classes would cost a few million pounds.  It is only a drop in the ocean.  Nobody would feel he had got anything.  It is the taxpayer who pays, irrespective of which way it is levied.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinlan made the extraordinary suggestion that the costs should not be levied on industry or on the taxpayer.  I throught the Senator would leave it at that, but he further suggested that workers be asked to work a quarter of an hour per day longer.  We must discuss practical things here.  As Minister for Labour, I am under pressure from workers to shorten their hours.</P>
    <P>This legislation, which opens the way to new dimensions in the social welfare code, is levied at first on the people who will benefit and that means people who draw more than £14 per week. They will pay approximately 3 per cent of their earnings above £14 up to a figure that will be fixed later.  At the moment we have the insurability limit of £1,600.  They will draw approximately 40 per cent of what they earn above £14 up to this particular ceiling. It is to enable people who have become accustomed to certain standards and who are geared to a way of life through a certain income not to suffer undue hardship when they have long terms of sickness or unemployment.  The new scheme will not apply for the first two weeks, but the workers will get the flat-rate benefit for that time.  It will not <Col N="1361" /> extend beyond the six months laid down in the Bill which, I am not ashamed to say, corresponds with the British system.  If we want a better scheme we either increase the cost of the stamp or ask the taxpayer to pay. It is immaterial.  The people who produce will pay.</P>
    <P>I agree with the last speaker who said that social welfare has to be thought of in isolation and not tied to economic planning.  It is an important part of the whole economic set-up.  We must always have regard to the ability of the people to pay.  The people who pay are those who produce.  The resources available to us depend on the extent to which we can go in redistributing the wealth that section of the community have.  We are moving rapidly.  People anticipate that we are going to save a few million pounds as from January next.  Figures of from £20 million to £40 million have been quoted.  I am sending a submission to the Minister for Finance in relation to the preparations for the next budget and £30 million will not work a miracle for our welfare classes.  I have put down proposals that would cost three times that amount.  We cannot expect to get all that money.  People will crib.  We will have people standing up here saying the new taxes are too severe, the stamp is too costly and that we are putting a load on industry.</P>
    <P>Someone made reference on television last Saturday to the plight of deserted wives.  There was a reference to the &ldquo;miserable pittance&rdquo; given.  Up to two years ago deserted wives got no allowances.  I thought it was a great help when she was put on the same level as a widow.  How did she manage in the past?  At least she is getting some allowance now.  She got nothing prior to this.  As soon as some allowance is given somebody will refer to it as &ldquo;a miserable pittance&rdquo;.  We should not be so ready to denigrate the amounts we pay in social services here&mdash;in this island of a couple of million people, only a small number of whom are producers.  The rate at which social welfare allowances have grown in the last ten years is greater than any other country in Europe.  If we are able to keep up the tempo in <Col N="1362" /> the next ten years we cannot be adversely compared with any of the European countries.  We have schemes which other countries do not have. Some of our schemes are just as good as those in other countries.  We have not brought the widows, the old age pensioners and the blind pensioners into this scheme but I hope to have pay-related pensions in the near future.</P>
    <P>I agree with those who say that agricultural workers should be included in the scheme.  The only reason why they have not been included is that we were unable at present to provide the machinery to collect the contributions and compute the reckonable earnings. The Bill will become operative before contributions commence.  The collection of pay-related contributions will not commence before April, 1974, but in order to finance the benefits up to that time I will have to borrow from the Exchequer.  Senator O'Brien said it would be 1975 before the scheme became operative.  The Senator probably was not present when I was introducing the Bill.  In the interim, I will study the possibility of having the contributions collected from the agricultural workers.</P>
    <P>I have been asked when the limit of £1,600 will be abolished.  I must have regard to the limits laid down by the Minister for Health.  The Department of Local Government also use these limits as a guide for giving certain loans.  The Department of Education use them in regard to certain educational scholarship grants.  Some time ago I asked the different bodies to have their own yardstick for their own schemes so that we can be independent of the £1,600 limit.  The abolition of the £1,600 limit will bring in another 30,000 people.  However, it will also open the way to a new social welfare scheme in which we will be able to include the self-employed and the unemployed in a contributory scheme where means-tests will no longer apply and where payments will be based on social insurance.</P>
    <P>This is the real significance of the Bill before us.  It is not perfect.  Everybody can mention what is not contained in it and criticise what it contains.  It is <Col N="1363" /> a very important beginning to a most important new dimension in social welfare.</P>
    <P>The £14 was selected as the floor because the flat rates at present are approximately 40 per cent of £14. What we aim at getting in addition, by way of pay-related benefits, is 40 per cent of amounts over £14.  The person earning up to £14 is not suffering under the terms of the Bill.  He is getting 40 per cent, the amount at which we aim. Where there are dependants and married people the benefit can be 95 per cent.  One of the cardinal principles in all social welfare schemes is that nobody should get 100 per cent of what he earns.  There should not be an incentive either to unemployment or sickness.</P>
    <P>Many people come to me and say they are paying social insurance for 40 years and never received a penny back. My answer to them is that they are very lucky.  Insurance is only an insurance against certain contingencies arising. A man who has not had to call on insurance has never been sick, unemployed or suffered an accident.  These are the contingencies against which he is covered.  If he is lucky to retire he will get the benefit in his retirement pension, which is also an element to which he contributes.</P>
    <P>The worker at present is insured against accidents on the job.  He is insured against sickness and unemployment. Insurance covers maternity grants, survivor's death grants, invalidity pensions, wet time and for practically every known contingency. There is also a health element which is not my Department's business, but we collect it for the Department of Health.  If a person does not have occasion to benefit from the money he contributes he is a very lucky person in that he has not had to contend with any of the contingencies against which he is insured.  When one pays for insurance that does not necessarily mean it should be drawn upon.  This is the reason why, when we abolish the limit, we will be able to give greater cover.  The people in the higher income bracket have the best records for continuity in employment.  The people <Col N="1364" /> who pay most and draw the least amount are the most useful people to the scheme.  They will make up for those who are intermittently employed, such as people who work for a few months and draw benefit for the rest of the time.  Those people are of no use to the scheme.  They are the worst risks.</P>
    <P>Most people do not like the waiting period of two weeks.  This also applies in Britain.  If we abolished this waiting period we would have to readjust our costings on the scheme.  If we extend the period of 147 days we would have to adjust our costings again.  It is a matter of what we think as equitable. We must decide what amount we should collect for returning in benefits at a particular time.</P>
    <P>I should like the House to accept the fact that I am sincere when I say that we will include the agricultural workers as early as possible.  In the interim before the scheme becomes operative, we will continue to examine the possibility of collecting their contributions. With regard to female agricultural workers, we are at present studying the equalising of their benefits with those of the male agricultural workers.</P>
    <P>I should like to have had all Stages of the Bill today but the Leader of the House has conveyed to me the fact that the Bill is too technical.  If we do not get all Stages, we will have to make a slight change in the last section which refers to the Bill being a collective citation of Social Welfare Acts, 1952 to 1972.  That would have to be changed to 1973 in that section, and in any other place in which it may occur in the Bill.  I do not intend to press for all Stages to be taken.</P>

    <Title>Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Bill, 1972: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrennan" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. J. Brennan) Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. J. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel that at this stage in our social development the House will welcome this piece of legislation and I am pleased to be able to present the Bill for consideration.  We have our social welfare code and our redundancy payments legislation and I think it is a logical sequence that we should now give legislative backing to the concept of minimum periods of notice in respect of the termination of employment. As a first step in this area, the Bill, as I have indicated, provides for minimum standards and I would expect that these standards will be reviewed periodically in the light of experience.  In anticipation of this, provision is made in the Bill for variations in the periods of notice by way of affirmative order.</P>
      <P>The Bill sets out to do two simple things.  The first is to prescribe a minimum period of notice which must be given by an employer who wishes to dispense with the services of an employee, or by an employee who wishes to leave his employment.  The second is to give any employee who is in doubt about any of the more important terms of his employment the right to have the terms confirmed in writing by his employer; new employees must be given such a statement without having to ask for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1366" /> Under the Bill an employer will be entitled to a statutory minimum of one week's notice but the entitlement of an employee will vary with his service.  He will be entitled to one weeks notice if in service for at least 13 weeks but less than two years, two weeks notice if in service for two to five years, four weeks' notice if in service for five to ten years, six weeks' notice if in service for ten to 15 years, and eight weeks notice if in service for over 15 years.  I should like to emphasise that this legislation should not impose any financial burden on employers.  Where an employer proposes to dispense with the services of a worker, he notifies him in one form or another.  It should not cost anything to bring this notification into conformity with the minimum period requirements laid down in the Bill, where such is not the case already. There is, of course, nothing to prevent an employer from giving better terms than those provided for in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Bill will not interfere with the rights of employers and employees who may wish, by mutual agreement, to dispense with notice of any kind. Neither will it interfere with the rights of one party to terminate employment without notice in the event of serious misconduct by the other party.</P>
    <P>In addition to the minimum notice question, I am providing in the Bill that a worker will have a statutory right to get from his employer, on request, written particulars of the main terms of his employment: in the absence of better terms the statutory minimum periods of notice would, of course, form part of the terms of his employment.  A new employee must be furnished with such a statement within one month of commencing work.</P>
    <P>Senators will have noted that disputes under the Bill will be dealt with, in the first instance, by the Redundancy Appeals Tribunal but that there will be a right of appeal to the High Court on a question of law.  This provision has been prompted not only by the desire to provide readily accessible machinery for resolving such disputes, but also by the high degree of acceptability which the tribunal's decisions in other fields have won from the employers and workers alike.  I hope that this piece of legislation will be conducive <Col N="1367" /> to good employer-employee relations, and I commend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has indicated, in his opening speech that there are two simple principles in the Bill, namely, the principle of minimum notice in section 4 and the principle of written terms of employment in section 9.  Both of those principles are quite acceptable to the Fine Gael Party.  I hope I do not distress Senator Crinion by saying they are acceptable to us because they have long been part of our policy.</P>
      <P>We support what the Minister proposes because we believe in what he proposes.  We would be a poor Opposition if we accepted, automatically, whatever came from the Minister and from Government representatives just because it came from them.  We would also be a poor Opposition if we automatically opposed everything that came from the Minister or from the Government spokesmen just because it came from that quarter.  We support the two principles proposed by the Minister because we believe in them and because we believe they are urgently necessary for the improvement of the general industrial climate in this country.  But it cannot be taken that we think that what is proposed here is an answer to all the problems in the area of industrial relations or that we think that the extent of what is now proposed is adequate to meet the needs of the present time in Irish industry.</P>
      <P>The Minister was able to make a fair defence in reply to the Second Stage debate on the Social Welfare Bill, discussed early this afternoon, by saying that the distance to which he could go in regard to that Bill and similar measures was limited by financial considerations.  That is not true of the extent to which it is possible to go in regard to the principles which are put forward in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have in this measure two proposals and it is up to the House to examine them on their merits.  Quite frankly, we would have been happier if the Minister had done this a little differently and, perhaps, gone deeper <Col N="1368" /> in certain regards but these are points which can be teased out on Committee Stage.  For the present we can welcome the fact that the Minister has done something in this regard.  What he has done is largely to enshrine in our legislation what the British Tories introduced ten years ago.  I agree with what they did ten years ago and I agree with what the Minister is proposing now.</P>
    <P>The basis of my support for the Bill is that it should make a small but real contribution towards the reform of what we might call our industrial condition in this country.  We have been slow in social reform.  We have been slow to look at the position of industry in other than traditional terms. I think we have been foolish in this. In the present instances we certainly have every incentive to look at this as the beginning of a new departure. There are cases in regard to the management of industry, in regard to legislation and industrial relations, in which there are conflicts between what we want to do on the grounds of humanity and what we want to do on the grounds of economy.  However, this conflict is in many areas much more apparent than real.  There is a growing realisation that efficiency is always as much a function of human factors as of technological and financial factors, and very often efficiency under modern industrial conditions is primarily dependent on human factors.</P>
    <P>In the particular area with which we are dealing here, employers may be irked by what they would be made to do under this legislation.  I think if they do it in a proper spirit, this will not be something which will impair their economic effort or affect the efficiency of their organisation.  It will, by changing the industrial climate, actually be not only to the humane benefit of the workers, but to the economic advantage of the employers.</P>
    <P>What is the Minister asking us to do?  Under section 4 he is asking us to make it obligatory for a minimum degree of notice to be given before cessation of employment, and fixing that minimum degree of notice on the basis of length of service As I indicated <Col N="1369" /> earlier, he is proposing to enact into our law section 1 of the United Kingdom Contracts of Employment Act, 1963, as amended by section 19 of their Industrial Relations Act, 1971. I am glad that, in introducing the British provisions if 1963, the Minister has included the amending benevolent amendments&mdash;section 19 of the 1971 Act&mdash;although I am sure our trade union movement would not welcome his going very much further in the adaptation of the 1971 Act to Irish conditions.</P>
    <P>Why is this something that we must support in principle?  Why is it something that could make a marked improvement in the industrial climate? A person who works for a long period in an individual enterprise has made a substantial investment in it.  It is on that principle that I support wholeheartedly what is proposed in section 4.  Somebody who works year after year in a single job has invested a large amount of that precious property&mdash;his own life: the passing years of his life &mdash;in this enterprise.  In social terms this is a very real investment.  It involves a degree of commitment for greater than that of many a casual financial investor in the enterprise.  Just as in the various pieces of legislation in regard to companies we give certain rights to those who invest their money, so too we must give rights to those who invest not only their labour, but a substantial part of their lives.  It is along these lines that we should look at enactments such as have been made elsewhere, and such as we are now making here.</P>
    <P>I should also like to refer to section 9 in which the Minister asks us to approve that notice of terms of employment be given to new employees and that notice, in writing, of the terms of employment be made available at any time, on request, to any employee.  This enactment, too, is something which has its own justification. The worker is often at a serious disadvantage in regard to the employer in that he may be unclear as to the nature of the contract of service which he has entered into with that employer.  This is a reflection of a development which applies not only to the employee in industry but is <Col N="1370" /> beginning to apply throughout the whole of our society.  There is arising now, with increasing education, with increasing awareness, with improved communication, a new right that was hardly thought of as a right until recently: the right to information.  I think the Minister might have gone even further in this particular area. In these days of rapid technological change, of even more rapid organisational change in private enterprise, we must take very seriously indeed the right to information about what is going on on behalf of those who are employed in these enterprises.  Unless this is the atmosphere or the climate in employment, we will never be able to reach the degree of productivity in industry which alone will enable the Minister to put into effect the various social welfare plans which he mentioned to us earlier this evening and which he would like to see put into effect but cannot, because of limitations of finance.  It is only by a reform in the whole attitude, not of individual employers but of the whole of society, to industrial employment that we will be able to produce the degree of social reform in all areas which we would all like to bring about.  Unless these changes can be made we will not be able to do these things.  If we cling to an outmoded view of the employer/employee relationship, and if we continue to look on this as a matter of conflict rather than a matter of confidence then we will have no hope of bringing about worthwhile social reform through democratic action. That is the objective of all political parties in this House.</P>
    <P>On this Stage I am talking about these points of principle, not just because they would be out of order on any other Stage, but because on a Bill of this type it is something we should advert to.  On Committee Stage we will be able to talk about the details of what the Minister has proposed, about the ways in which he has proposed to do it and to discuss the immediate meaning of the various sections of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I should like to emphasise at this stage the reason why I say that I would be happier if there had been <Col N="1371" /> more in this Bill: it is not just because I am speaking on behalf of the Fine Gael Party on a Bill proposed by a Fianna Fáil Minister, but because I believe if we are complacent about these matters and if we accept the little that is now being done as enough to allow us to forget about the particular situation that gives rise to these problems for a few more years then we are adopting a very dangerous attitude. If we just pass this Bill and say that things are much better than they were before, then we may be leaving ourselves in a dangerous situation.  The Minister indicated earlier that it had been his experience that he got most complaints after he had done something. This is a truth of history.  It is never in times of greatest repression that a revolution comes; revolutions only come after there has been a relaxation of the repression, and just as a little learning is a dangerous thing so too a little reform can be equally dangerous, in the historical context.</P>
    <P>We should be clear about what our objectives are.  We should make up our minds about the degree of our dissatisfaction with the social fabric of our community and, having made up our minds clearly about our degree of dissatisfaction, we should then see if we cannot, within the constraints&mdash; financial and otherwise&mdash;which are upon us, achieve the major part of the reform that is desirable.  Partial reform is the food of revolution.  We may pooh-pooh the idea of social revolution in this country but we may wake up one day to find out that we were wrong.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I have strayed from the immediate provisions of the Bill but I wanted, particularly in view of what was said on the previous Bill by Senator Crinion and, to some extent, by the Minister in reply, to give the underlying ideas behind the attitude which I take on this Bill of wholesale welcome of the provisions in sections 4 and 9 for what they do, coupled with a doubt as to whether this is an adequate response to the situation at the present time.  There are many details we can discuss on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of minimum <Col N="1372" /> notice, there are going to be considerable problems in a number of areas.  I am concerned with the problems of the civil engineering and the building industry.  I feel there may well be particular problems in this regard. I am also concerned that the powers of the Minister in section 4 to vary the provisions of that section are too wide and not adequately hedged around. With regard to the question of notices of employment there are other things here in regard to the notification of changes as they occur, matters in regard to the question of the provision which allows an employer to refer an employee to an accessible document, which might be subject to abuse.  All these can be discussed on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>On this Stage I would prefer to discuss this Bill and the proposals in it as part of a larger problem.  We would be foolish to think that because we have provided for redundancy and a notice in regard to dismissal that this is all that needs to be done.  We are wrong here.  We will have to get down to the question not just of provision for redundancy but of avoidance of redundancy.  In the establishment of the Department of Labour we had a start made in regard to manpower planning and much good work has been done, but it is now time to see if a great deal more could not be done.  We have been obsessed, perhaps rightly so, during the past year with the question of adjustment to Europe in terms of European institutions and practices, but we can only adapt to Europe and survive in Europe if our own social fabric is sound.  So in regard to labour relations we need, from now on, a much more intensive investment of energy and thought in fields such as manpower and planning. This Bill may help.  If an employer is forced to give notice he is forced to anticipate redundancy.  If he must do this in this way it is a smaller step for him to go into such questions as manpower smoothing.</P>
    <P>The time is right for an effort by the Department of Labour in this regard.  Many of our firms have been doing far more than is in this Bill in regard to notice before a dismissal and redundancy.  It would be worthwhile <Col N="1373" /> for the Department of Labour to put down, in booklet form, the good practice of certain Irish firms and disseminate widely this practice of the best which might then be an encouragement to those who have not thought of the problem, not for lack of goodwill but perhaps because of lack of knowledge and lack of turning their attention to the problem.  If such firms can see the practices of firms they know to be profitable and successful, they may well ask themselves what, then, can be so wrong in this.  It does not seem to cripple these organisations to have a decent policy in this regard.</P>
    <P>Regarding notice of conditions of contract, a project which the Minister's Department could take up would be one of disseminating throughout industry not just the question of procedures and rights but of prime examples from Irish industry of positive employment policies&mdash;bringing to the notice of other employers what is good practice.  Because the humanitarian and the economic are not in conflict in many cases these examples of first-class practice on the grounds of good industrial relations come from what are recognised as the most profitable firms.  The legislature, the Minister's Department and industry need a move towards positive policy and information and an acknowledgement that in the modern, technological age in which we live access to information is so often the difference between success and failure.</P>
    <P>For these reasons I express some reservations about the extent of the Bill.  Looked at in isolation and on their merit, the proposals the Minister has made are unexceptional.  The question we must ask is whether this is too small a contribution at the present juncture.  Is this a sufficient response to the problem?  I should be glad to have my doubts in this regard resolved. There is an indication that the Minister's Department from now on will be pursuing a more positive policy in regard to industrial relations, not just regarding legislation but in regard to the provision of a good information service, in the provision or the dissemination of model schemes which have been proved in practice.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for what he <Col N="1374" /> has done but should like to see more being done.</P>

      <P>The Minister may think Santa Claus has come six days too soon when I state that, like other Senators, I welcome this Bill. On previous occasions the Minister has told this House he is introducing pieces of legislation as they arise rather than taking a comprehensive view of the whole industrial relations situation.  So far he has honoured that statement as we have had a number of small but important steps forward in the industrial relation scene. I do not want to be niggardly in paying tribute to him and to his Department for what they have achieved in the last two years.</P>
      <P>I agree with what the Minister stated in relation to the operation of the Redundancy Payments Tribunal. They have been a wonderful asset in industrial relations, have worked exceptionally well and seem to be the obvious group to deal with problems which may arise under the Bill before us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When this Bill was circulated a number of people who were not directly involved in the situation wondered why it was necessary to have such a Bill.  There was a traditional concept that you got and gave your notice in relation to the manner in which you received your wage or remuneration. If you had a weekly wage you received a week's notice, a monthly wage, a month's notice and so on.  This system has not been operating and I am glad to see this type of legislation going on our Statute Book.  I think it will lead to a better relationship between employer and employee and this is what industrial relations are about.  Many firms go further than the terms set out in this Bill.  It is a minimum standard that is being required now.  Some of the larger firms, not in industry or manufacturing business, but in the services, some semi-State bodies, have been known to dismiss young employees after 12 months' employment on three hours notice.  This has happened in my own field of employment. <Col N="1375" /> It has rebounded on employers too because when a person finds some favourable employment he has no inhibitions about giving three hours' notice to his employer.  As we expand industrially we are getting greater mobility in our employment and, therefore, the requirement of a minimum notice from both sides is important.</P>
    <P>There are aspects which I should like to raise on Committee Stage. There are some explanations and clarifications which I require from the Minister as to why, for example, he has exempted the Civil Service, and why, fortunately, local government and the health boards staff are covered by the Bill.  There are traditionally two areas which seem to follow in line and I should like to know what particular reason there is for the exemption of the Civil Service.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see in the Bill as it is at present an alteration in connection with the giving of information. It is difficult for those who are not directly involved in dealing with disputes to understand how seriously lacking in information workers can be.  Many of them have not got a notion as to what their contract of employment is.  Very often indeed one could hardly say there is such a thing.  This had led to a great deal of industrial unrest.  We have all seen pickets outside a factory owing to the dismissal of an employee the reason for which may not be very clear.  I do not think the Bill will help out his point but often the reason has been the lack of proper notice, and the Bill obviously helps there.</P>
    <P>Reverting to the question of information, I suggest to the Minister that, while he has gone some way in the other House by stating that every new employee should be given particulars in writing, we may have to look somewhat further.  There could be changes in the conditions and, under this Bill, there is no requirement that the employee should be notified of these changes.  There may be cases where major changes in the conditions take place and the employee should be notified.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1376" /> I should like to ask the Minister to indicate if pregnancy leave is covered in the contract of service.  If there is no formal agreement with the employer, will pregnancy leave be included in sickness or injury benefit? If it is not already covered I will be tabling an amendment. I welcome most of this Bill and I look forward to further Bills of this type.  We should not look towards Europe to find our solutions. Many of the European solutions could not be translated into our circumstances. What happened recently in Brussels is something we would not welcome here.  Europe has quite a lot to learn from us in the way in which we conduct our trade union business. When we join the EEC next January this may be one area in which we can give a lead to other countries.</P>
    <P>I do not know what are the intentions of the House but I would hope that the Committee Stage of this Bill would be taken after the Christmas recess.</P>

      <P>The Bill is a short one and has been well received by the House. Originally it was the intention to have an omnibus Bill covering legislation dealing with industrial relations.  Instead we are introducing separate Bills to cover certain matters as we get acceptances from the social partners, as the two sides of employment are now called since we are entering the EEC. I agree that a firm which has good relations with its employees will have better conditions than we are providing in this Bill but we must legislate for those who still stick to the old method whereby, no matter how many years the employee has worked, it is quite common for him to get a week's notice. The Bill will do away with that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1377" /> I should point out that there are many details which Senators may wish to have explained more fully.  As it is not proposed to take all Stages of the Bill tonight I will deal with them on Committee Stage.  With regard to employers, the fact that they are compelled to give notice to new employees within a month may give Senators the impression that we are putting them to a lot of trouble, particularly in the construction industry where people shift from one employer to another.  It may be felt that the necessity to give written notice and conditions of employment could be awkward.  That is not so.  The firm may have a general set of rules or conditions of employment posted up on the walls of their factory, workshop or office and they need simply direct the attention of their employees to that notice.</P>

However, that is not relevant here.  Any criticisms Senators may have of the Bill and any amendments they may contemplate putting forward may be based on the fact that they may think the week's notice is too short on the lower end of the scale.  Employers may think that the eight weeks is too long at the top of the scale.  We tried to get an optimum that would be reasonable.  We will have a further opportunity to discuss the Bill on Committee Stage.  While I do not wish to appear difficult, I must say I should like the Bill to go through in its present form.  I cannot accept any amendments as was the case in the other House.</P>

      <P>That Seanad Éireann approves the following Order in draft:</P>
      <P>Housing Act, 1969 (Continuance) Order, 1972</P>
      <P>a copy of which Order in draft was laid before Seanad Éireann on the 23rd November, 1972.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government (Mr. Cunningham) Liam Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government (Mr. Cunningham)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Housing Act, 1969, is a temporary measure which will expire on 31st December, 1972, unless continued by an order made by me after it has been approved by resolution by each House of the Oireachtas.  The object of the draft order is to continue the Act in force for two years ending on 31st December, 1974.</P>
      <P>In a developing economy, investment in industrial and commercial building is essential to provide the resources for further development including the construction of houses.  It is inevitable that some houses have to be demolished or put to other use to make way for other forms of development.  However, housing policy considerations demand that the demolition or change of use should be controlled by the housing authority. The Housing Act, 1969, provides this control.</P>
      <P>The Act became law in July, 1969, and the number of applications for permission received by all local authorities from then to 31st March, 1971, was 312.  Of these 66 were granted without conditions, 195 were granted with conditions and 51 were refused.  The number of applications for permission made to Dublin Corporation up to 31st March last was 367. Of these 255 were granted and 112 were refused.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where permission is refused, or granted subject to conditions, there is a right of appeal to the Minister against the decision of the local authority. Up to end of last month 137 appeals were received.  Of these eight were invalid because they were not received within the statutory period, 19 were withdrawn, 54 were determined <Col N="1379" /> and 56 were under consideration.</P>
    <P>The operations under the Act indicate that it has provided local authorities with a control that is both flexible and effective in reducing the loss of habitable houses to the housing stock.  Apart from these operations it is clear that the very fact that such statutory control exists helps to reduce the loss of habitable houses.</P>
    <P>While satisfactory progress has been made in achieving, ahead of schedule, the house-building targets set by the Government, I consider that it is still essential to retain for a further period the controls provided by the 1969 Act.</P>
    <P>I commend the motion to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>This draft order provides for the continuance of a worthwhile Act introduced on a temporary basis in 1969.  As the Parliamentary Secretary said, the intent of the Act is that houses may not be demolished to provide for redevelopment, save with the approval of the housing authority, who are, in effect, the local authority, if there is one, operating in that particular area at the time.</P>
      <P>Obviously, development will often be impaired or prevented if the removal of certain housing cannot be effected.  Nonetheless, it is important that the houses removed should be replaced by adequate accommodation of a similar or better standard. One of the main considerations when the Housing Act, 1969, was first introduced was that occupied habitable houses removed to make way for commercial development should be replaced with similar accommodation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Certain points occurred to me when reading this measure.  They were probably argued during the debate on the Act at the time.  While I appreciate the need, on occasion, for the removal of housing to provide for redevelopment, care should be taken by the housing authority to ensure that new houses will be provided in an area contiguous to the former one. It is not fair for a developer to remove houses from a certain area to make way for redevelopment and replace them with houses in an area <Col N="1380" /> 20 or 30 miles away, which might well happen to be within the same local authority administrative area and consequently the same housing authority administrative area.</P>
    <P>My attention was drawn also to section 2 (3) of the 1969 Housing Act which specifies the fines which shall be payable by anyone who contravenes the obligation to obtain permission to demolish housing for the purposes mentioned.  The fines are on summary conviction a sum not exceeding £100 together with, in the case of a continuing offence, a further fine not exceeding £10 for every day on which the offence is continued, or at the discretion of the court, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months.  This may be somewhat hypothetical, but it would appear to me that in a small number of cases at least, certainly in areas of major urban population or urban redevelopment, it might very well be a profitable exercise on the part of a developer, who fell foul of the housing authority and was unable to obtain permission to demolish housing so as to allow commercial development to go ahead, or who felt sure that he was bound to fall foul of the housing authority and consequently did not even bother to apply, to demolish habitable housing and replace it with massive commercial development and be prepared to pay the fine of £100. Indeed, if the full rigour of the law was imposed upon him, and he was liable to a continuing fine of £10 a day, he might well feel that the £10 per day fine was money well spent when compared with the amount of rent he might derive from the replacement commercial property.</P>
    <P>The only real deterrent to such an unscrupulous individual would be the suggestion of six months imprisonment which can be enjoined with the initial and continuing fine.  I feel that the continuing fine, while it may be realistic with regard to the replacement of one habitable dwelling by a relatively modest replacement building, is not a realistic fine if viewed in the light of replacing not so good or rather old dwellings by a fairly lavish and high-priced commercial development with a leasing income of many <Col N="1381" /> pounds per square foot.  I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that in any subsequent review of this particular piece of legislation he might well consider the idea of revising the continuing penalty, not so as to make it a financial burden on somebody who genuinely transgressed the terms of the Act mistakenly, but to make it instead a preventive measure which would inhibit the more unscrupulous redeveloper from carrying on regardless and being quite happy to pay what would be to him a nominal recurring fine.</P>
    <P>In reading the Act, I also notice that it differs from its local government counterpart, the 1963 Planning Act, in regard to the manner in which planning appeals have to be determined. As most Senators and, indeed, the general public know, in applying for planning permission one is obliged to publicise the fact in one or other of the national newspapers or to erect a notice, which is supposedly visible, though we all know it very often is not on the site.  The idea of this was that the general public, who might be affected by the general terms of any planning application, would have an opportunity of lodging their views with the appropriate planning authority. Not so in this Housing Act because, while there is a right of appeal to the Minister in the event of the housing authority refusing the idea of a habitable dwelling being demolished, there is no obligation in the first instance or, indeed, in relation to the appeal on the applicant to publicise the fact that he is making either the application or the appeal and, as far as I can determine, there is no right on the part of a third party who feels aggrieved at a, to him, unfavourable decision on the part of the housing authority.  The third party has no right to appeal to the Minister against that decision to demolish.</P>
    <P>I freely admit that the occasion on which those sorts of appeals or objections might be made by third parties would be rather minimal in relation to this particular aspect of local government law and, as we would all agree, they would almost certainly take place in the greater Dublin area. <Col N="1382" /> Without going into specific cases, most of us here know of several instances in the greater Dublin area in the last year or two where members of the general public and members of interested groups and societies have felt aggrieved because of the intention and, indeed, often the actions arising out of the intention of a redeveloper to demolish property they felt had historic, or architectural, or aesthetic merit.  As far as I can ascertain, this Housing Act does not allow those interested bodies or members of the general public the right to appeal to the Minister against the housing authority's decision to grant permission, if such permission has been granted.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary can answer this very quickly by standing up and saying: &ldquo;I know the cases the Senator is talking about.  The housing authority never granted permission in the first place so that is the answer to that.&rdquo;  It is not because the housing authority might just as easily, in ignorance or innocence, have granted permission and then we would be left in the position where the only person who could appeal against that permission would be the very person who wanted to knock down the dwelling in the first place.  It is hardly likely that he will do that.</P>
    <P>However, the nub of the 1969 Housing Act, and this is the reason why I asked last week that it should be left over until today for discussion, is that in its appeal terms it holds certain comparisons with the 1963 Planning Act.  The main comparison is where a housing authority, which is the counterpart of a planning authority, both of which are, in effect, the local authority in the area, decides that aggrieved persons may appeal to the Minister against that decision; it is our contention, as it has been since 1963&mdash;it has been repeated at various times since and again in the debate on this Act in 1969&mdash;that it is wrong that the dreadful onus and responsibility of deciding on planning appeals or Housing Act appeals should be left to any one man.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary can answer that criticism very easily by saying that there is a Bill on the stocks to amend the Planning Act, to remove <Col N="1383" /> the power of appeal from the Minister and to appoint an independent inquiry board or tribunal to look into appeals. But it is not that easy to answer because that Bill has been there for the last three or four years.  We will all believe it, accept it and work it when that Bill becomes an Act.  It has not become an Act in 1972 and it is not going to become one.  It languished on the Order Paper during 1970 and whether it will become an Act in 1973 will depend largely on electoral results.</P>
    <P>There is no Bill on the stocks to remove from the Housing Act, 1969, the same power which now lies with the Minister, that is, the power to determine the Housing Act appeals which may be brought to him.  Those appeals materially differ in that they may be brought only by the aggrieved original applicant and not by a third party.  If third parties wish to enjoin themselves in an appeal, they must first approach their local authority and persuade them to act on their behalf in any appeal which may be heard.  That would be quite a difficult operation for any aggrieved party who happened to live in an administrative area where a democratically elected local authority did not at that time exist.  I would suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that he should, in his reply to this motion, be prepared to say that at the same time as the appeal's method in relation to the 1963 Planning Act, is being amended&mdash;if he wants to give us a bonus he may tell us when he expects that to happen&mdash;there should be introduced a similar piece of legislation or procedure to remove from the Minister the same power personally to determine appeals under this Act.  If he does that all of us, who are in favour of the Act in principle as it stands, would feel happier with the Act in operation.</P>
    <P>I have one final point.  The figures given by the Parliamentary Secretary are remarkably similar to the figures given by the Minister in another place. From them it is quite apparent that virtually all of the housing demolition applications were made to the local authority in the Dublin city area.  The Parliamentary Secretary gave the figures in relation to appeals received <Col N="1384" /> by the Minister in a particular period and a breakdown of the numbers which were invalid, withdrawn, determined or under consideration.  The Parliamentary Secretary ought to be in a position to tell us, especially in view of my previous remarks in relation to the personal determining of appeals by a Minister, how many of the 54 determined appeals of the 137 received in that period were determined in favour of the applicant and how many were refused.</P>
    <P>Again, it would be very simple for the Parliamentary Secretary to tell us that he has not got those figures.  I hope he has them because the same question was asked in relation to the same figure in another place and, unfortunately&mdash;probably because it was sprung upon him at short notice &mdash;the Minister was unable to give the breakdown.  Because of the passage of time, and because we debate such matters here in such a cool and quiet fashion, I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will now be able to give us the breakdown and a better statistical analysis of how the whole procedure operates.</P>
    <P>I would also be grateful if he could give us a percentage figure of the number of applications made to Dublin Corporation as against the 26 or 27 other local authorities.  While accepting that a great number of housing redevelopments take place in Dublin city, there seems to be an imbalance in the proportion of applications being made to Dublin Corporation in relation to the rest of the country.  I wonder if there is a blind eye being turned, not deliberately of course, to housing demolition in rural areas as against the city.  I do not accept those figures as being completely accurate even accepting the great amount of redevelopment that takes place in Dublin city.  In my area of Dublin County the figure, taken in conjunction with the other rural local authorities, ought to have produced a slightly different picture from the figures the Parliamentary Secretary gave us.</P>
    <P>Finally, any Senators who read last Sunday's newspapers may very well have read of the considerable annoyance and difficulties being caused to <Col N="1385" /> the staff and patients of a Dublin city centre hospital because of redevelopment and reconstruction works taking place on a site adjoining the hospital. The point was made by the newspaper, with quite an amount of justification, that it was wrong that redevelopment should be allowed to take place indiscriminately beside a hospital where seriously and critically ill patients are being treated without any controls being imposed to ensure that the amount of noise or interference to the patients is kept to a minimum.  It is particularly appropriate that the article should have appeared in last Sunday's newspaper, a few days before this debate, especially as the site in question is a site that was sold by a State Department to a private developer. One might have thought that, even at that initial stage of contract there might have been some restrictive clauses.  Certainly, when the application for demolition was made to the local authority, that is, Dublin Corporation, there should have been some restrictive clauses to provide for the quiet continuance of the operation of the nearby hospital.  In relation to that, section 11 of this Act reads:</P>
    <P>Section 66 of the Act of 1966 is hereby amended by the insertion of &ldquo;including conditions requiring the taking of such reasonable steps as will ensure that the works, either while being carried out or when completed, will neither cause injury to any adjoining or adjacent building nor interfere with the stability thereof after conditions in subsection (7)...</P>
    <P>That referred to a quite substantial section of the 1966 Act in relation to conditions which can be imposed.  I do not know if the Parliamentary Secretary has taken particular notice of this case, but because it has been brought to national notice, perhaps I may be giving him the opportunity of pointing out what the circumstances were in relation to that case.  I would have thought that, if controls were not introduced in that case, it is about time that we ensured, either by recommendation to the housing authorities or by legislation if necessary, <Col N="1386" /> that where demolition or reconstruction works of a major nature which had a high level of noise nuisance, were to take place beside public buildings there should be special steps taken to ensure that they were protected, and that their patients, or students or users, were allowed free use of the building.</P>
    <P>If the Parliamentary Secretary would reply to those various points, I should be very grateful.  I am pleased to see this Act being continued but I still hope that the appeals provision may be modified at the same time as the 1963 counterpart is.</P>

      <P>I should like to support the motion.  This order specifically relates to cities and large urban areas and has served a useful purpose.  If this Act were not in operation many houses would disappear due to the operation of the developers who would be more concerned with their profits than they would with the housing problems they would be creating for the local authorities and the Department.</P>
      <P>As I read it, it is specifically intended for built-up areas.  In his introductory speech, the Parliamentary Secretary, said:</P>
      <P>The Act became law in July, 1969, and the number of applications for permissions received by all local authorities from then to 31st March, 1971, was 312...  The number of applications for permission made to Dublin Corporation up to 31st March last was 367.</P>
      <P>From July, 1969, until 31st March, 1971, the number was 312.  Are any of Dublin Corporation applications included in that?</P>

      <P>I accept that, but it would indicate that a great proportion of them are in relation to the Dublin Corporation area.  Therefore what I am saying is correct&mdash;it is more applicable to the cities and larger urban towns than to the rural areas.  I am a Senator from a rural area, a county not blessed with many big towns, and we are not affected so much by the problem of house demolition. However, we have another problem in relation to that.  It arises where a local authority houses an applicant in a local authority house. If that successful tenant comes out of a substandard house, which may be unfit for habitation or incapable of being repaired or unfit for habitation and capable of being repaired, and if another tenant occupies that particular house, subsequently when houses become available that applicant is statute-barred from qualifying for a local authority house.  This has happened in a town&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>This is fine. &ldquo;They know that before they go into it&rdquo;.  There is an old saying that beggars cannot be choosers and there are people who need a house so badly that they are prepared to go into a substandard house.  We must have a certain amount of sympathy with this type of person, because they are glad to have a roof over their heads.  When a house becomes available in an area, it is unfair that that type of applicant should be statute-barred from qualifying for such a house.  I know that the Parliamentary Secretary may say that need not happen if the local authority are prepared to accept him on the one-third subsidy.  The fact remains that if you house a person out of such a house, the local authority will lose the subsidy.  When he is replying would the Parliamentary Secretary please enlighten me on that?</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary will be replying and it is not necessary for Senator Honan to interrupt or to try to confuse.  He will have time to make his contribution, if he wishes.  I am just pointing out this anomaly and it is an anomaly that we should try to get rid of.  As I pointed out, anybody who occupies a house of that kind does not do it with the intention of qualifying for a house next week or the week after.  Unfortunately, it may be two, three, four or even five years before houses will become available in that area.  It is very unfair that that type of person should be victimised and that this should operate against him when he applies for a house.  On the one hand we are passing a motion to continue a Housing Act of 1969 so that we can prevent people from demolishing houses we think might be capable of repair and capable of housing tenants. On the other hand, where a family does occupy a house out of which somebody has been housed by the local authority, they will not qualify for a local authority house.</P>
      <P>I appeal to the Minister to do something about that anomaly.  We cannot be trying to prevent people from demolishing houses even though they are substandard.  I am sorry to see anybody having to live in those houses, but the fact remains that there are people who are glad to live in them and if they have to do that I do not think it should be held against them when local authority houses become available.</P>

      <P>I have spent some years dealing with the housing situation and I know as much about housing as any other Senator.  The whole effort of the Department of Local Government has been directed towards taking people out of houses which were not suited for habitation and putting them into houses which were suitable.  There is no complication in that.  The Department should be prepared to give two-thirds subsidy to the people they were taking out of those old houses to put them into good houses.  I know people who were taken out of derelict houses and put into good houses and then other people went to live in the dilapidated <Col N="1389" /> houses which were unfit for occupation and were charged fantastic rents and Senator Fitzgerald knows that.</P>

      <P>As regards people moving into houses, which are not fit for habitation, when a two-thirds subsidy has been paid to the previous tenant as far as I know the Department need not pay even a one-third subsidy at that stage.  Most county managers are as charitable as possible and try to provide a vacated house&mdash; not a new one&mdash;for the person who goes into a condemned house and in that case there would be no subsidy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCrinion" hpid="Mr. Crinion Mr. Crinion">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>This rule on subsidies is needed.  I came across a house where a person was letting flats and people getting flats were guaranteed houses in two years.  There was a big turnover of tenants in this house because they knew they would get a <Col N="1390" /> house.  When the local authorities have issued a notice saying that certain houses are condemned they do not ensure that nobody goes into them.  They could prosecute the owner for letting the house or point out to the tenants that they have no hope of getting a house by living there.</P>
      <P>If a person living in a derelict house has qualified for the higher rate of grant and if other persons live in that house then they are debarred from getting a local authority house or they only get the one-third subsidy. Something could be done there by the local authority, if the person is on their housing list.  In most counties people are on the waiting list for a couple of years before they get a house.  If the authority know that a person is on the list and has moved into a house from which some other tenants has moved to a higher grant house, it is only fair that this should be pointed out to him and avoid having him dissatisfied afterwards when he is turned down.  It is hard for a member of a local authority to tell a person living in a bad house that he is not eligible to qualify for a higher rate of grant.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government (Mr. Cunningham)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Senators who contributed on those important points.  We are inclined to tie up the 1969 Act with the Planning Act.  The purpose of the 1969 Housing Act is to conserve, as far as possible, the stock of habitable houses.  The 1969 Housing Act and the 1963 Planning Act do not run along parallel lines.  It is not necessary that they should because the responsibility for providing houses is one for the local authorities and the 1969 Act gave them powers to prevent the demolition of habitable dwellings.  It refers only to habitable dwellings and the planned or permitted demolition of some of them and/or the change of user of such houses.  We are inclined to tie it up with the Planning Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1391" /> Senator Boland mentioned the question of replacing of houses the demolition of which has been permitted by the local authority.  There are two things involved here: one is that the local authority can put in a number of conditions of which they have a choice one being that the applicant may be asked to wholly or partly replace the accommodation which it is intended to demolish or use otherwise than for human habitation. The local authority may determine where such houses are to be located.</P>
    <P>As a second option they can specify a sum of money to enable the local authority to carry out the replacement rather than the applicant for demolition.  If the local authority feel there are loopholes in imposing as a condition that the demolisher be asked to provide a similar number of habitable dwellings and they feel this is not practicable or that the houses may be built where they do not replace location-wise the dwellings which have been demolished, they can say: &ldquo;We will not have it that way: we will demand a sum of money to do the same job.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Another important matter raised is the question of the £100 fine and the continuing fine of £10 per day, or the six months prison sentence.  These are stated in the Act and continued by this motion in order that cases of this kind can be heard and dealt with in the District Court.  If the fines were higher it would lead to litigation in higher courts which can be a lengthy business.</P>
    <P>Senator Boland made a strong case that a demolisher could suffer the penalty of £100 fine and the continuing penalty of £10 per day over a long period.  This is a logical argument but we must also consider that the demolisher afterwards becomes a developer and for this purpose he must apply under the 1963 Act.  If he demolishes a habitable building without getting planning permission or demolition permission from the local authority, he is heading in the right direction for a refusal when it comes to the operation of the Planning Act. <Col N="1392" /> If he still persists, having defied the 1969 Housing Act and also the 1963 Planning Act, he is heading for very high penalties which are laid down in the 1963 Act.  If he decides to cut his throat in one place he must also cut it in another, and I think he would not have a hope.</P>
    <P>With reference to the publication of a notice and the right of third party appeals, the interested parties under this Act are local authorities and the Act applies to the conservation of the pool or habitable dwellings. Planning does not enter into this.  In the case of the Planning Act anyone who is interested in planning and the safeguarding of the environment has a right to object.  In this case all that is involved is the conservation of housing.  The case of the noise factor referred to by the Senator was not one where habitable dwellings were being demolished.  I think this was an office block or something of that kind and not houses and this Act does not apply to that type of building.  It is only where habitable dwellings or units are being demolished that one must seek permission.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not got that information.  Senator Fitzgerald suggested that a large proportion of these were Dublin cases.  I would say up to 90 per cent of the 312 would be from the Dublin area.  Taking the Dublin figure of 367, the percentages are as follows: granted, 70 per cent, refused, 30 per cent.  These are all Dublin cases.  There are 86 cases awaiting decision.  He then went on to discuss subsidies, condemned houses in rural areas and the law which states that if a tenant of a condemned house is rehoused by the local authority no subsidy will be paid in the case of another deserving tenant. It does not come under this Act.  The 1966 Housing Act, which makes the subsidy provisions, deals with that.  I just wish to say this is a continuation of the Act and we feel that it is necessary.</P>

      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to repeal subsection (7) of section 16 of the County Management Act, 1940, so that the selection and appointment of county rate collectors will be made in the same way as other appointments in local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present selections for appointment to posts as permanent officers in local authorities, with the exception of county rate collector appointments, are made in one of two ways. The first method is that the local authority itself following public advertisement, holds a competitive <Col N="1395" /> examination or interview; the candidate who is placed first in this competition is normally appointed provided he passes a medical examination and the customary character inquiries which any employer makes. The majority of selections to local authority offices are made in this way, that is, by the local authority itself. Examples of offices which are filled in this way are clerk-typists, library assistants, clerical officers, staff officers, rent collectors, storekeepers, clerks of works, rate inspectors, rent inspectors, draughtsmen and, of course, rate collectors other than county rate collectors.</P>
    <P>The second way in which offices in local authorities are filled is to utilise the services of the Local Appointments Commission.  Examples of offices which are filled on the recommendation of the Local Appointments Commissioners are the chief executive officer of every local authority, offices for which the qualifications are professional, such as engineers, architects, planners, and a limited number of other senior offices, such as county secretary and county accountant.</P>
    <P>An exception to both of these two systems I have mentioned was made in the case of the county rate collectors. The reasons for this exception are not now clear but the arguments against the system are well known&mdash;a system of appointment made by vote of elected members of local councils does not readily lend itself to the detailed procedures and controls which ensure that selection is made on merit alone.  As the law now stands, members of local authorities must operate this system as best they can.  While many allegations have been made in the press from time to time regarding these appointments, I think it fair to say that the fault lies in the system and not with the individual councillors.  The aim of the Bill is to change the system and to relieve councillors of their involvement in individual staff appointments. The Bill, as it now stands, provides that in future the actual appointment of rate collectors will be an executive function to be carried out by the <Col N="1396" /> manager rather than a reserved function to be exercised by the council.  It is the Minister's intention to have new regulations prepared which will require that, except in cases of internal promotion, all appointments will be made by open competition and a circular letter will be issued to local authorities on this matter as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The Bill leaves the way open at some future date to having the selections made by the Local Appointments Commission should that be found necessary.  It is my view that selection for the post of county rate collector would best be made by competition conducted locally by the local authority in the same way as the majority of local authority appointments are made.  It is important in the case of rate collectors that, if at all possible, the person appointed should have a knowledge of local geography and conditions and that a local dimension be preserved.</P>
    <P>Many other offices are, as I have said, filled in this way and so far as I know the selections are made fairly and conscientiously.  However, if this should not prove to be so in the case of county rate collectors, then the option will be there of resorting to the Local Appointments Commission.</P>
    <P>Everybody will agree that appointments to public offices should be made strictly on the basis of merit.  I believe that the time is now opportune to change the law in relation to the county rate collector appointments so that the appointments will be made on the fairest possible basis and will be seen to be made on that basis.  It was for this reason that the Minister had the matter covered in a separate Bill which I now commend to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to remove from local authority members the rather odious requirement of having to appoint individuals to the position of rate collectors to their local authority.  I doubt if the removal of this task will be regretted by many members of local authorities. From time to time local authority members have complained about this obligation but they have never <Col N="1397" /> refused to carry it out.  When people stand for election to a local authority they do so knowing that there may be obligations placed on them which they will not like.  They will accept these obligations if they wish to achieve some of the measures which first prompted them to stand for election. Therefore, they will not be upset at losing this dubious privilege of being allowed to appoint rate collectors to their local authority area.  However, they will be upset in certain areas of the country about the proposed method of appointment.  One procedure which is calculated to arouse the suspicion of every local authority member is the behind-closed-doors activities of the officials.</P>
      <P>We should look at the anomalous position of the rate collector in the local authority service.  He is the only official who operates in the local authority&mdash;and perhaps in the public service&mdash;on a bonus system.  Public servants generally know how much they are paid weekly and that it will be increased only through national wage rounds or negotiated increases. Officials are appointed on a salary basis with annual increments and occasional national or negotiated salary increases.</P>
      <P>The rate collector, however, occupies the strange position whereby he is paid a flat rate of salary to carry out a duty, and he is also paid, at certain times during the financial year, a bonus depending on whether he has achieved a certain percentage return of his total warrant for that financial year.  I imagine what makes the position attractive and lucrative to rate collectors is the aim that they should try to earn together with their salary all of their bonuses in any one financial year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know why the appointment of rate collectors was left separate from the other two systems which the Parliamentary Secretary outlined&mdash; appointment by a managerial order or by the Local Appointment Commissioners&mdash;or why rate collectors alone occupied this unique position.  It could have been because one of the few real powers left to elected members of local authorities is that they should adopt the estimates and strike the rate <Col N="1398" /> for their local authority for the coming year.  The thinking may have been that, having given them that power, they should also be allowed to appoint the officers who would be directly responsible for the collection of the warrant to finance that adopted rate. Whatever the reason, the rate collector's position stands unique within the local authority service and rather strangely within the public services as we know them in this island.</P>
    <P>Because of the unusual duties and strange methods of collection which a rate collector is obliged to carry out, the qualities required for this position&mdash;it is the last job that I personally would consider&mdash;should include a local knowledge and the collector and his family should be known locally in the area.  His integrity and personal standing in the community should be known and respected.  He should have the qualities of understanding and compassion so that he can appreciate the very real difficulties confronting those from whom he is expected to collect money at certain times during the year.  Not only from the point of view of achieving his bonuses but also of keeping the local authority solvent, he should have the quality of endurance.</P>
    <P>The question has been asked why we need rate collectors, why the method of collection of rates for any local authority cannot be carried out through an office in the same way as other public services.  I do not propose either to defend or to criticise the system.  I should just like to make the point that, next to paying tax, probably the most objectionable thing for any member of the community to be asked to pay rates.  I do not think it is just as simple as sending an ESB or telephone bill to a client and asking him to pay up, because he knows very well that if he does not pay the electricity bill or telephone bill in due course the services will be disconnected and he will no longer be able to avail of them.</P>
    <P>I do not think anybody, certainly not the officials of the Custom House, has yet devised a system whereby one can be deprived of the use of public lighting and the public highway and footpaths and various other services <Col N="1399" /> which our local authorities provide.  If there is merit in having a personalised collector service it is (a), that it is personalised and (b), that because of the bonus incentive, the collector realises that it is personally lucrative and worth his while to follow up his warrant and to endeavour to achieve as high a percentage collection rate as possible.</P>
    <P>Perhaps if the system of financing local authorities were to be changed and based on some form of local income tax it might well then be levied by means of an office collection, but until such time as the long promised and now much disbelieved white paper on local finance is published I presume it would be wrong of us to go into that aspect of the service in any great depth, although I understand the white paper which is to be published will say absolutely nothing new about anything in relation to the financing of local authorities.  However, I hope I will be proved wrong in that prediction although I would be prepared to lay a small wager that I will not.</P>
    <P>The system which is being proposed to replace the present method of appointment is that each county manager should be allowed to appoint his own rate collectors.  It has been suggested in the Parliamentary Secretary's speech this evening and in another place that what in effect will take place is that an interview board will be set up composed of some outside members and one or perhaps more local officials of the local authority, who will interview applicants and grade them on a laid-down scale of educational standards and ability and integrity and various other things.</P>
    <P>The great difficulty with promises such as this is that they are merely promises.  As has been pointed out at other times in this House, nothing that is not contained within an Act is enforceable no matter what promise may be given by a Minister or Parliamentary Secretary here or elsewhere. This will count for nothing unless it is written into an Act and is therefore part of the law of the land, in this case part of the local government <Col N="1400" /> code, and consequently leaves an obligation on the country manager or whoever else may be obliged to perform the function to carry it out in accordance with that Act.</P>
    <P>What we are instead presented with is a very short two-section Bill which merely changes the reserve function of appointing rate collectors from the members and hands it over as an executive function to the county manager. We have been promised regulations which will dictate to the manager the method he should use to set up his appointment board, the type of people who should be on it and the sort of conditions which the board would be obliged to seek from applicants. It is my honest belief that it is unfair to this or any other House to present a Bill such as this in the form it has been presented without providing that very necessary ancillary information as to how exactly this new method of appointment is to work.</P>
    <P>It seems to me there has been far too much loose and glib talk on the part of public representatives, perhaps often acting more in their role of politicians, members of the press&mdash;I hesitate to add the same rider to that description as I added to the first one, although I am tempted&mdash;and other people criticising the public method of appointment.  I am a member of a local authority.  I have voted and taken part in the appointment of rate collectors under the present system.  I do not like it but I accept that it is currently, until this Bill is passed, my responsibility to do it and I am prepared, as many other members of this House have been prepared, to face up to that responsibility.  I honestly and genuinely believe that the vast majority of members of local authorities down through the years have faced up to that responsibility and have undertaken that task, however much they disliked it, to the best of their ability.</P>
    <P>It is of course fair to say that the majority of appointments made under that system were made on a political basis.  It is probably fair to say that when the appointment method was first set up under the 1940 Act it was intended to be a political appointment. It was known at that time that it was <Col N="1401" /> to be a political appointment.  There were no great objections or there was no enormous public outcry about it despite the fact that the majority of us now might feel that it is distasteful and personally dislike it.  But it was a system of open public vote.  If a man was appointed and if his political affiliations were taken into consideration, as undoubtedly they were by every party that is currently represented in this House, but that may have been in the past and may well be in the future.  All of these parties have participated in that system, so let none of them criticise it or play sham or hypocrisy or stand up now or again in any other place to say, &ldquo;Hand me my finger bowl and let me wash my hands of the affair&rdquo;, because it is just not true.</P>
    <P>All political parties participated in it, and the general public to a large extent, understood the machinations of the system.  No one particularly liked it.  Mostly the people who had to carry out the voting at the end did not like it but they did it.  Perhaps they often did it because they knew darn well that if they did not go in and cast their vote in relation to a particular appointment the other political parties who were members of the local authority would cast their votes very quickly and take the appointment for their own appointee.</P>
    <P>But the one saving grace, and the thing that deserves to be said and should and must be said in praise of those local authority members down through the years, irrespective of which party they were from, is that in the vast majority of cases their appointees proved to be efficient, loyal and, above all else, honest and dedicated servants of the local authority to which they were appointed.  The number of cases of rate collectors defaulting with portions of their warrant is infinitesimally small.</P>
    <P>It is worth repeating here what has been said in other places.  The local authority of which I am a member, Dublin County Council, down through the years appointed hundreds of rate collectors and fewer of them than the number of fingers on one hand ever went wrong.  Those who were tempted <Col N="1402" /> and fell were all appointed in one short three-year period during which Dublin County Council was abolished and commissioners appointed to carry out its functions, as happened to Dublin Corporation.  To my knowledge&mdash;and I have made exhaustive inquiries about this&mdash;no political appointee to the position of rate collector in that local authority area has ever been accused of doing away with one penny of the ratepayers' money.</P>
    <P>That is a proud record.  To a great extent it serves to justify my contention that, while the members of local authorities might have been faced with the unenviable task of making those appointments, they did not make them in any haphazard confettilike form.  They made them carefully and judiciously.  They took political affiliations into account&mdash;we would all be less than honest if we did not admit that fact&mdash;but nevertheless the appointments were made carefully and judiciously from within the ranks of their political parties.</P>
    <P>I took grave exception to, and was personally hurt by, the remarks made by a reputable public representative in another place in relation to the activities of members of local authorities in connection with those appointments.  I do not think it fair or good enough that any public representative elected to Dáil Éireann should have the gall, in relation to the appointment of rate collectors or the activities of the selfless, unpaid, dedicated members of the local authorities, to pass the casual, offhand remark that: &ldquo;They will all be mourning tonight for the loss of their income&rdquo;.  I am quoting from a document from which we are not allowed to quote in this House and it is contained in a debate on this Bill which was held in another place.</P>
    <P>The contribution of the man who made that remark, and who continued his remarks by alleging that he knew of malpractices and of financial bribes taking place, lowered him in my estimation because, if he knew of such malpractices he should have taken action when he first heard about them. To my knowledge they did not take place in the local authority of which I have been a member for five and a half years, or in any other local <Col N="1403" /> authority with which I have come in contact in that time, or in any local authority on which any of my colleagues have served and with whom I have discussed the matter.</P>
    <P>It is a deplorable state of affairs that any public representative, who has not taken the time or regarded it as his duty or his training, to even stand for election never mind serve on a local authority, should make a remark such as that.  I could go through that debate and pick out the remarks of people such as Deputy Foley whose remarks were just as contentious, just as unfair and just as unfounded, in the light of his own inexperience and failure to stand for election.</P>

      <P>Senator Boland on the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to point out again that the position of rate collector varies from county to county.  The attitude to the idea of collection by collector, as against office collection, varies from county to county.  Some counties have already favoured the office collection system but others have not.  I can only relate my own experience.  I am sure other Senators, at the invitation of the Leader of the House, will subsequently give theirs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For a number of years my council decided not to appoint rate collectors and we left three positions vacant.  We appointed nominally, instead, an official of the council and gave him a staff and office facilities of the council to exercise the warrants.  We discovered at the end of three years that, while our politically appointed collectors were collecting all in excess of 97 per cent, and most in excess of 98 per cent, and some up to 99 per cent <Col N="1405" /> of their warrants, our office collection was returning between only 70 and 80 per cent.  Our recovery rate through the courts and other methods were not entirely successful.</P>
    <P>Because I knew this Bill was coming up some time ago, I took the trouble to inquire what the collection costs of the warrants for the current year would be in County Dublin.  The warrant in the county is approximately £10 million in the current year.  The cost of the rate-collector operation and the backing up office staff and computer service that go to service the collectors' activities will amount to 1¼ per cent of that warrant.  As usual it is expected that between 97 and 100 per cent of the warrant will be collected.  I am not in business in any big way, but if anyone in this House who is can tell me of a method whereby he can collect a sum of that size, for a percentage collection rate so low, the gentlemen who are operating takeovers for large public companies would be very interested to avail of his professional advice and services.  However, I am not defending the collection system and perhaps in the White Paper on Finance, when it issues, there may be not only a new method proposed for the financing of local authorities, but that method may be such as to eliminate the rather odious task of going around collecting the warrant from door to door.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary what the criteria for these appointments will be.  As is already established, the regulations for the appointment of the rate collectors by managerial boards have not been published.  What are the educational qualifications which, it has been decided, are necessary for rate collectors? What is the minimum age and the maximum age?  Is it intended that the newly-appointed collectors should be drawn from the ranks of previously serving members of the local authority in a particular area, or will it be open to those who qualify otherwise on all other grounds and happen to be living in, or be natives of, that area?  Will the manager be bound and obliged, by law and regulation, to accept the recommendation of his appointed interview board, or will it be open to <Col N="1406" /> him to decide that he does not like the recommendation made by the interview board?  Consequently will it be open to him to decide not to accept the recommendation and instead to appoint someone he himself feels is more suitable?</P>
    <P>It is an important fact&mdash;and this has been said extensively in other places&mdash;that there is in the minds of many members of local authorities a certain apprehension and holding back in their trust of all the activities of the county manager.  It is perhaps understandable that the managerial system, as it stands, is designed to a large extent to provide in the manager a Custom House representative in each local authority area.  Unless the manager is very good, very understanding and very careful, he will fall foul of at least some of the members of his local authority.  I do not think it unfair to say that quite a number of local authority members do not trust their manager in at least some of the things he does; some of them do not trust him in any of the things he does; and others trust him in just a small amount.</P>

      <P>The alternative method of appointment that has been proposed is appointment by the Local <Col N="1408" /> Appointments Commission.  I can only speak personally in relation to this, but I have some reservations in relation to appointments by the Local Appointments Commission to this position, which other people have expressed as well.  One of the prerequisites for the appointment of a rate collector is that he should have a fair local knowledge of the area and be known fairly well in it.  Unless special regulations are introduced, collector appointments for any particular administrative area will be thrown open to people from the whole country.  At the same time, I share, to some extent, in the apprehensions of my political acquaintances and colleagues in relation to the behind-closed-doors decisions which city and county managers can make.</P>
      <P>I understand that the Committee Stage of this Bill will not be taken until after the recess.  An attempt should be made during the interval to publish the regulations to be used by a manager in making his appointments.</P>

      <P>That is the first I heard of it.  If there was anything objectionable in the regulations we could, on Committee Stage, discuss further the idea of the Local Appointments Commission, with some modifications to the ordinary regulations, being asked to take over the function of appointing the collectors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1409" /> The position of rate collector has been described as a junior one within the local authority service.  I would have thought that people who were collecting warrants of up to £500,000 or £750,000 and who were being handsomely reimbursed for collecting those warrants on the basis that they collected a high enough percentage of it, would be considered to be occupying senior positions.  In a recent discussion with some rate collectors who are rather long in the collecting tooth, as it were, they maintained the interesting theory that, if the county manager and secretary were both to die without delegating their authority to anybody, under the local government code the senior appointed rate collector within the administrative area, and not the county accountant, would then be the senior official remaining within that administrative area and would take over the duty of running the local authority until such time as a substitute was permanently appointed.</P>
    <P>In at least one local authority fairly near the Dublin area I understand that happened sometime during the past few decades.  Perhaps it is an interesting point and one which might make the Parliamentary Secretary and Minister think again.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotHonan" hpid="Mr. Honan Mr. Honan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator is a more innocent man than I thought.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish I could say Senator Honan was innocent.  It might make the Minister think again on the basis of allowing rate collector appointments to be made by managerial board rather than by the Local Appointments Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Local Appointments Commission appoint senior officers such as managers, secretaries, accountants and so on, and managerial committees appoint staff officers, second fire officers, clerical officers, library assistants, clerk typists, rate collector, other than county rate collector, rent collectors, wholetime and part-time post, gas slot meter collectors, store keepers, law and conveyancing clerk, clerk of works, referencer, rate inspector, rents inspector, section officer, assistant section officer, senior section officer, <Col N="1410" /> development officer, draftsman, draftsman grade 1, work study and organisation and methods officer, personnel officer and quantity surveyor's clerk.</P>
    <P>I do not think that any of us can say that men who are at present engaged in the country, and who will be appointed in the future in the country apparently, to collect warrants of up to £750,000 can be graded on the same level as a gas slot meter collector.</P>

I do not agree that a rate inspector or rent inspector or collector, or any of those people will be responsible for anything like the amount of money these people will be responsible for.  They are not completely similar because, as we agreed earlier, the rate collectors get special bonuses for meeting that percentage of their warrants at certain times.</P>

      <P>Did Senator Honan ever read the local government code? Because of the strange position which they occupy I do not think that either the ordinary managerial method of appointment or the Local Appointment Commission's method of throwing it open to the whole country is satisfactory. I hoped that some method of appointment might be devised which compromised between the two.  The simple answer to that is that there is no point in having a third method of appointment to a local authority position. Unfortunately, we had a third method of appointment.  The unfortunate members of the local authorities had to appoint these people.  If there is a separate method at present why can we not now devise, because of its special nature and peculiar arrangements, a particular and suitable method of appointing the collectors in a less contentious and just as acceptable way?</P>

      <P>I welcome this Bill for the reasons that have been mentioned. The position has been referred <Col N="1411" /> to here tonight as a rent collector job. It is no longer a rent collector job; it is a rent receiver job.  Any man who sits in his office all day and waits for people to bring rents to him is not a collector; he is a receiver.  These jobs should be done away with entirely. They are a thing of the past; from days when transport was not available.</P>
      <P>I regret that the Bill does not go far enough.  It does not provide something which is necessary because of our entry into EEC.  It does not provide remuneration for councillors, who have been described as unpaid dedicated members of local authorities.  It should provide provision for them rather than for the so called rent collectors who are rent receivers.</P>

      <P>One of the few things which Senator Boland said with which I agree is that there has been too much loose and glib talk on this Bill.  In his opening statement, the Parliamentary Secretary said that it is fair to say that the fault lies with the system and not with the individual councillors.  I intend to speak on the system.  What individual councillors did in the past is a matter for themselves, and I do not intend to criticise the way they performed their functions over the past 32 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the dying days of 1972 all I can say about this Bill is that at long last we have got it.  The reason why the <Col N="1412" /> appointments of county rate collectors were left to the elected representatives rather than being put with the other appointments in the local authority, as has been said, seems to have been rather obscure and none of us has been diligent enough to go over the basis of the passing of the County Management Act of 1940 to try to find out what was the reason.</P>
    <P>It seems to have been sought by the existing councillors who felt their powers were being diminished by implementation of the county management system.  This measure removes the last obvious area of political appointments in the public sector and is welcome for that reason.</P>
    <P>There is one small area remaining within the ambit of local authorities although not directly within the ambit of the Department of Local Government. I am referring to the appointments of school attendance officers in the county boroughs which are of a political nature.  I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to draw the attention of the Minister for Education to this situation and have it sorted out in the near future.</P>
    <P>We have been well served by our rate collectors who have been most dedicated and loyal.  I do not agree that the job is one which can be adequately carried out by an office system.  Senator Boland indicated that this has been tried in a specific area but did not prove successful.  When we examine the nature of the job it is obvious that it will not be so successful as when there is direct individual involvement.  Our standard of rate collection has been remarkably high, in most areas being between 97 and 99 per cent.  Taking into account the colossal increase in the burden of rates in the last ten years great credit is due to those people who have achieved these remarkable results.</P>
    <P>I should like to correct Senator Boland by stating this is not the only area of appointment in the local authority in which there is a bonus. Many rent collectors work on a basic wage plus bonus based on their percentage collection.</P>
    <P>The rate collectors in the nature of their warrant are left with some discretion <Col N="1413" /> as to how they implement it. This is something which no office system could deal with.  It will not have a computer which will be sensitive to the particular needs of an account and know when to enforce an arrears notice.  I know of many cases where rate collectors suffered in their percentage bonus rather than implement some of their powers under their warrant because they believed it would be inhuman in the particular circumstances.</P>
    <P>There appears to be considerable doubt about the method by which people are appointed to local authority staffs.  In this context, as a member of a local authority staff, I should like to say that we are raising a lot of hares. No city or county manager would appoint an individual to the post of county rate collector without some form of competition.  I assure the House that if any of them did so, the staff representatives would be at their door immediately.  We have fairly sophisticated methods of competition and appointment within the local authority service.  This has evolved over quite a long period going back to the 1943 regulations through many Local Government circulars of which the Members of the House are aware. From the staff point of view this has worked reasonably well.  There is no perfect system for making appointments. I was perturbed by a remark made by the previous speaker when he referred to &ldquo;behind closed door activities of local officials&rdquo;.  We were all grouped in that statement but as a representative of those officials I resent that remark.  He did not elaborate any more so I cannot take him up any further but I hope he did not mean there is any sort of nasty activity taking place among local officials.</P>
    <P>We are public servants paid out of the public purse and we do as good a job as we can.  A number of local authority officials are very dedicated and I include in this many county managers. I have negotiated across the table with almost all city and county managers.  We have fought many hard battles but I would not accept that there is anything underhand taking place in the city and county managers' <Col N="1414" /> associations in the manner in which they appoint their staff.</P>
    <P>In the normal manner the regulations would be issued under this Act as to the method of appointment.  I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary some of the matters which might be considered in these regulations.  I would insist that we retain the right of appointments for the reasons I have given.  Apart from the local knowledge we could consider people who have previous experience of some sort in the local authority service.  This would achieve two things.  Firstly, you would be ensuring that the successful candidate would have some knowledge of existing local government legislation. Secondly, you could be providing a very important avenue of promotion in some areas for people who are not necessarily in the officer grade but who are in what is unfortunately still termed the employee and service grade.  This could be a great incentive to some of these people who can never get an office job.</P>
    <P>The amount of work involved in some areas does not give an adequate return.  The man involved is part-time and must have another job.  To remedy this would mean doing away with some posts and creating others.  It could be made into a normal salary grading structure which would eliminate a lot of the problems in making appointments.</P>
    <P>Regarding the local interview system no manager will appoint somebody simply because he likes the colour of his hair.  People must be appointed on merit alone and not because they are male or female.  One criticism I might make of the existing and past councillors is that they did not think fit to appoint women rate collectors.</P>
    <P>In many areas already in local authorities we are used to laws being introduced.  Generally speaking, personnel departments and establishment sections have tried to maintain the law so that not alone is justice done but is seen to be done.  This is the important thing.  Justice was not seen to be done under the existing system. Appointments were made on a political basis; it was not on the basis of <Col N="1415" /> the best man for the job, although in some cases this may have happened. It appeared to be political jobbery. This was a reflection on the whole staff of the local authorities.  People got tired of this and it has been mentioned in the passage of this Bill through the Dáil and today in the Seanad.  I welcome this Bill and I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will take into account some of the suggestions I made on the regulations.  In areas where the local interview board system is in operation it has proved to be reasonably satisfactory.  We cannot be entirely satisfied with appointments made under any system.  We must aim to make it as near perfect as possible.  Local interview boards are held in higher repute than the Local Appointments Commission. This may be because one is more aware of the local set-up.  The local interview board system operating under the regulations existing at the moment which are issued from the Custom House is perhaps the best one.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to speak on this matter as one who has had 38 years' experience as a member of a local authority, and having been a member of a local authority for a two-year period before the Managerial Act came into force in 1940.  I have seen the method under which rate collectors were appointed.  I welcome the Bill.  It did lend itself to a certain amount of unfounded abuse of members of the local authority from time to time.  Let us consider how rate collectors have been appointed up to now.  One would think from listening to the debate that a political party went out into a field and lifted up some member of that part who had a majority in the local authority and offered him the appointment.  That is far from the truth.  The procedure was that the job was advertised, the applicants were interviewed by the county manager and they had to have a certain educational standard before they were recommended to the county council.  The county council then voted on them.  Naturally in a county council where Fianna Fáil members had the majority the supporter of that <Col N="1416" /> party got the job.  The same position applied to Fine Gael.  I can see no crime in that.  Generally speaking the people appointed proved to be satisfactory.</P>
      <P>In the county council of which I happen to be chairman Fine Gael hold the majority.  At our last meeting a proposal was put forward and seconded by both members of the Fianna Fáil Party that we request the Minister for Local Government to hand an appointment to the Local Appointments Commission. This was agreed unanimously without any amendment being made.</P>
      <P>One could pick a few holes in the Parliamentary Secretary's speech.  He stated that:</P>
      <P>The majority of selections to local authority offices are made in this way that is by the local authority itself.  Examples of offices which are filled in this way are clerk-typists, library assistants, clerical officers, staff officers, rent collectors, storekeepers, clerks of works, rate inspectors, rent inspectors, draughtsmen and of course rate collectors&mdash; other than county rate collectors.</P>
      <P>One section omitted from that list is home assistance officers who are usually appointed by the county manager.  Some councils have handed over that function to the health board but in my county we still hold it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a matter for a different Department.  It is now dealt with by the Department of Health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Not necessarily.  The local authority have the option to keep them.  The home assistance superintendent in my county is ill at the moment. When an assistant had to be appointed there was nobody available from the staff already recruited by this system that is being recommended to us.  They had to get somebody from outside.  If the rate inspector fell ill one of the rate collectors would be quite capable of filling his job.  One must be wary of appointments made in this manner.  I should now like to quote again from the Parliamentary Secretary's speech where he stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1417" /> An exception to both of these two systems I have mentioned was made in the case of the county rate collectors.</P>
    <P>The reasons for this exception are not now clear but the arguments against the system are well known&mdash; a system of appointment made by vote of elected members of local councils does not readily lend itself to the detailed procedures and controls which ensure that selection is made on merit alone.</P>
    <P>I am not convinced of this.  In 1940 when this power was left with the local authority the Government party of today controlled 90 per cent of the local authorities.  They do not enjoy that position at the moment.  I believe that is the reason for the change.  Perhaps I am wrong.  May I quote a further part of the Parliamentary Secretary's speech which stated:</P>
    <P>As the law now stands members of local authorities must operate this system as best they can.  While many allegations have been made in the Press from time to time regarding these appointments I think it fair to say that the fault lies in the system and not with the individual councillors.</P>
    <P>If the fault lies with the system surely it will still lie with the system.  The county manager will carry the blame now instead of the members of the county council.  Under this Bill he will set up an interview board for applicants. From my own experience as a member of a local authority let me say how hard it is to convince people who have not got through the appointments board set up, that there was fair play.</P>
    <P>I quote further:</P>
    <P>The aim of the Bill is to change the system and to relieve councillors of their involvement in individual staff appointments...</P>
    <P>I am an employer but must I apologise to anyone for appointing staff?  Must I get my bank manager&mdash;with whom I have an overdraft&mdash;to appoint staff for me?  I do not think the reasons given are convincing.  The Parliamentary Secretary continued:</P>
    <P>...all appointments will be made <Col N="1418" /> by open competition and a circular letter will be issued to local authorities on this matter as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>For the information of the House that circular letter has already been received by my council and was read at our last meeting.  One of the members objected to it saying that it had not been passed by this House and should not be accepted.</P>
    <P>My last comment refers to this statement by the Parliamentary Secretary:</P>
    <P>Everybody will agree that appointments to public office should be made strictly on the basis of merit.</P>
    <P>I agree with this view.  I do not wish to cast aspersions on anyone, but are judges not appointed by a vote of the Cabinet?  Is it then a crime for county councillors to vote for rate collectors? I do not think so.  There are other forms of appointment which could be questioned, for instance, the appointment of people to Telefís Éireann. They are probably appointed by a vote of the Cabinet also.  If it is correct for one section of the community it should be correct for others.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardMcGlinchey" hpid="Mr. McGlinchey Mr. McGlinchey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGlinchey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am somewhat surprised by the attitude of Senators Reynolds and Boland.  I thought they would have welcomed this Bill as a step in the right direction.  If I interpret Senator Reynolds' remarks correctly he says that one should appoint his own staff.</P>
      <P>If instead of the present Bill, another Bill was introduced proposing that the Government should individually appoint every civil servant in the country, there would have been an outcry from these Fine Gael Senators.  It would be just as logical for the members of the Government to appoint every civil servant as for these Senators to suggest that this system of appointing rate collectors should continue on the grounds that members of a local authority should appoint their own staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like many Members of this House, I have over the years been involved in the appointment of rate collectors. <Col N="1419" /> The evening the Minister made his announcement I was sitting in the back of a car listening to the news and my delight was so great that I clapped the person in front of me on the back.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary has recovered.  It was particularly delightful news for me because I was faced, along with the other councillors, with the appointment of two collectors at that time.</P>
    <P>Senator Reynolds said that candidates canvass.  If Fianna Fáil had the majority one of their supporters would be elected and the same procedure would follow for Fine Gael.  I never had any objection to a Fianna Fáil candidate canvassing me for an appointment.  What I objected to was 15 Fianna Fáil candidates canvassing me for the appointment.  It then became a very unpleasant and difficult task for me as a councillor.  Apart from that, the successful applicant had to go through the humiliating experience of touring the county appealing for this appointment.  If successful, he felt under an obligation to councillors for the rest of his life.  It is a procedure in which a change is both necessary and desirable.</P>
    <P>Senator Boland said the regulations should be published before we take the Committee Stage.  When the Parliamentary Secretary offered to read them for him, he said if they were satisfactory to everyone, the passage of the Bill would be assured.  The only place in which regulations are satisfactory to everyone is in Heaven but perhaps if we ever get there we may find them unsatisfactory to somebody.  It is practically impossible to draw up regulations which will be satisfactory to everyone.</P>
    <P>In the past I have voted against proposals to abolish the appointment of rate collectors on the grounds that there was a danger of some young person with the leaving certificate getting the appointment.  Then, when he had improved his position, he would resign and take up another appointment. There is the danger that there could be five or six vacancies at the one time in any county.  I have asked the Parliamentary Secretary to consider <Col N="1420" /> that point before Committee Stage.  I understand that, under the terms of the present Bill, a county manager would be obliged to advertise a post nationally so that an applicant from any part of Ireland may apply.  If this is so, it is a pity.  The appointment should be confined to people resident in the county in which the vacancy occurs.  If a Cork person is successful in an appointment in Donegal, he will naturally try to get employment in his own county as soon as possible.  Therefore, the grave danger would exist of there being too many resignations and vacancies at the one time.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, the one point I should like to make is in reference to the use of the Local Appointments Commission in filling these posts.  It was referred to by Senator Reynolds and from the Dáil debate it is clear that it was in the minds of many people.  Anyone who has any experience of the Local Appointments Commission will be entirely opposed to this.  Members of local authorities and particularly members of health boards are only too well aware that it takes the Local Appointments Commission up to 12 months to fill vacancies at the present time.  I, personally, have experience of appointments with the Local Appointments Commission for over nine months. It would be disastrous for the Minister to hand this appointment over to them. The method of appointment which he proposes is one which has been in operation for urban rate collectors since the County Management Act.  It has been found satisfactory and so, too, will this one when the teething troubles are over.</P>
