      <P>Having listened to Senator O'Higgins yesterday evening attacking the Government, I would ask him to cast his mind back to when he was in the two inter-Party Governments.  When they had disunity the Government ran to the country so that they could get out of office quickly. A result of strong Government today is that if somebody disagrees with the Government they will not change their minds on a policy which they know is right. The Senator should remember what happened in his own Cabinet on such occasions. The Fianna Fáil Government are as strong today as ever they were and are carrying on their policy as they set out to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Senator mentioned that some Members voted against the Government.  I would ask him to think of what has happened in other countries. Look at what happened in England on the vote on the Common Market when something like 70 or 80 Members crossed the floor, while some of the Opposition voted with the Government some of the Government members <Col N="100" /> voted with the Opposition. That has happened on many occasions in the United Kingdom Parliament and it has happened in other parliaments in Europe also. This has happened here recently for the first time since the setting up of the State 50 years ago and that is why it is such a great wonder. Members have always voted consistently with their parties and when anybody stepped out of line it was a seven-day wonder.</P>
    <P>The Senator did not press too hard on unemployment. I know the reason why. He did, however, upgrade the unemployment figures by about 4,000.</P>

      <P>There were a few other items which the Senator mentioned to which I should like to refer. The Senator asked for a re-alignment on the beef subsidy scheme or the beef payment to the factory. We would all like to have that but one must remember why there is a discrepancy at present between the Irish payments and the British payments to the factory.  The figure was arrived at to try to encourage farmers and beef producers not to flood the market in November, <Col N="101" /> December and January but to dispose of their beef in the scarce periods in March, April and May when prices are exceptionally high and when it would pay them to do so. We had the same payment as the English had two or three years ago and there was a flood of cattle into the factory. The factories were not even able to take them during November. We were blamed for dumping beef on the English market and bringing the price down for English producers also. Our farmers were trying to make our factories take more and more. It took at least two to three weeks before one could get the cattle into a factory. The same happened last week but there was a smaller differential then than there is now. Even at that they were getting the higher subsidy and the factories were making about £8 per head on every beast. Not one penny of that was going back to the farmer because they were getting too many cattle. They dropped the price by 1p and 2p per lb. so as to discourage farmers. That fact should be recorded. The Senator should remember that point.</P>
      <P>The Senator mentioned Ministers making announcements at functions they attend. This is a very old complaint of the Opposition parties. They know, since they were in Government once, that a Minister is not able to make every announcement in Parliament because there is no time and no facilities, unless two hours were set aside each week when Ministers could get up one after the other and make announcements. A lot of other business would remain undone. The time of both Houses of the Oireachtas is fully taken up with debates and Ministers cannot find time to get in. Naturally they have to avail of opportunities when making speeches outside to announce decisions that have been taken. Such decisions or announcements will eventually come to the Dáil and Seanad to be debated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Senator raised the matter of the so-called uniforms that are worn at funerals by members of illegal organisations. Being a lawyer, he knows the law exceptionally well. He knows how difficult it is to legislate against that sort of thing. Even in <Col N="102" /> Northern Ireland at the moment the British are not able to enact a law to enable them to arrest people of that type and to charge them with wearing a particular type of uniform, if it could be called a uniform. If they could arrest such people they certainly would. Even though they have enacted a great deal of legislation and made orders they are not able to do it. How then could we do it?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Kennedy mentioned the unemployment situation and referred to it as a crisis. There is no denying that it is bad, but he and Mr. Carroll on the &ldquo;7 Days&rdquo; programme adopted a very negative attitude towards it. They suggested stopping overtime and productivity schemes in the factories. They know only too well that, if you follow that line, the cost of production will be higher and what chance will the factories then have to sell abroad? It would just mean that there would be more people out of work. It is a case of cutting down the costs of production. I am not advocating a reduction in wages by any means, but there are other ways of reducing costs. One of them is to increase production, particularly where you have a market for that production. Senator Kennedy referred to the closure of Denny's bacon factory as a calamity. It is serious, but I should like to point out that it was well known in the pig industry that there would be rationalisation. Even the trade unions have agreed that rationalisation is a <Col N="103" /> good thing. I believe they knew that Denny's was likely to close down due to rationalisation. Denny's closure is not as serious as the Senator is trying to make out because there is another factory in the town that will absorb quite a number of the people who will be unemployed as a result of the closure of Denny's. Naturally the pigs will now be going to the other factory and that will mean more work in that factory.</P>
    <P>I should like to see the trade unions as well as the general public trying to encourage a &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign. In the past two weeks I have been in quite a number of shops and I have been taking note of what has been happening. In the clothing trade, particularly in women's clothing, the amount of foreign garments on sale is staggering. I am not talking of one shop, but of ten or 12 shops which I visited. The amount of Irish goods which I saw on sale was very small. This is an industry which has been faring badly for the past year. Irish suit lengths and Irish clothes are not being sold. From what I could see, the trade seems to be pushing more English goods than they should be. I was buying a suit myself and I was shown about ten or 12 different types of material to see if I would be interested.  I asked if they were Irish and was told that only one of them was. I said I should like to see some of our Irish materials. The man had to take a book of patterns from a shelf to show to me. He was showing everybody English-made materials. That was in Dublin, not half a mile from this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator should have come to Limerick where we have excellent suit lengths.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCrinion" hpid="Mr. Crinion Mr. Crinion">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>I was in the Senator's city last week and the previous week and the same was the case. I was in four shops in the main street. They were the principal ones, from what I know, and the materials there were 70 per cent English. From inquiries I have made I think the reason for this is that there is dumping here from the English market. I gather that people <Col N="104" /> are getting an extra 2½ per cent discount from the English manufacturers, plus longer credit time. This is something which the Department should examine, it is true, in order to see if our Irish manufacturers could be given the same terms and the same facilities. Many people could be kept in employment if Irish people were buying Irish products. The trade unions could play a big part in advocating this policy.</P>
      <P>A lead should be given by those in the executive field. There are people in this class who prefer to buy their clothes in Paris or London. These are the people who have benefited from the policy of the present Government and they have made their money through Irish workers and Irish firms. Therefore, they should help to keep the money they have made in this way in the country by buying Irish products.</P>
      <P>In a neighbouring county to mine a man engaged in the electrical field has had to go into the retail trade to keep his factories open. He has had to cut down on the high profit margins which were obtainable on all electrical products.  These products are now going from manufacturer to retailer, thus keeping the cost down to a minimum. There are large amounts of foreign products coming in. I saw a recorder bearing the name of Philips, which I associated with Irish products. On close scrutiny however I discovered it was made in Austria. Firms manufacturing here are allowing their subsidiaries to come in and sell their products. Many of our difficulties could be overcome if people realised that our products are better than or as good as those coming in with fancy names from other countries.  The faraway hills are green and the Irish people still do not realise that we can produce good merchandise at home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Countries which have been held up to us as examples would never buy foreign produce if they could obtain the same article at home. The Danes, for example, export all their first-class goods. They use second-grade products or something which they cannot sell outside the country. Rather than sell their milk products in their own country they have a tea specially blended which is palatable without <Col N="105" /> milk. This is a sacrifice the people have made, and it has helped to build up the dairy industry there.</P>
    <P>When England was developing her industries years ago her people bought home products in preference to any others. The same applied to the USA or any other country developing its economy. People support industries to help them and to keep the jobs going. Senator Kennedy was wrong in saying that the Government would not give any assistance in this direction. The Government were hoping the trade unions would give assistance by encouraging their members to buy Irish.</P>
    <P>Since the last war Germany has had a system of wage increases based on output and productivity. I was speaking to a German industrialist and mentioned the small number of strikes which take place in that country and that their products were selling well. He agreed but said that after, say, six months of profitable trading the unions, through their auditors or accountants, knew that an industry's income should have reached a certain figure and they expected the staff of that industry to benefit by increased wages. This often hits the owners hard but it keeps the factories going. Germany can put a tax on exports, but we have to give tax concessions to people who are exporting. We know what our position was in 1945 and also what Germany's position was then.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Higgins stated that the Government were not anxious to help in any way. That is not true. The Government realise that an increase in unemployment will mean a loss of money for the Government.</P>
    <P>The Government lose money in social welfare benefits and through redundancy payments. Secondly, there will be no income tax payable by those who are unemployed. Any Minister for Finance would feel worried to see unemployment figures rising. The Minister for Finance has taken steps which will have results in the months ahead.</P>
    <P>In October last an extra £20 million was put into the economy in an endeavour to stimulate employment. The <Col N="106" /> Bill we passed in this House yesterday is another step in that direction. If any industry cannot get the money from the normal channels and if there is a possibility that it can be made viable, Fóir Teoranta will assist in keeping it going and will give it the necessary financial aid needed to bridge it over the few years until it gets back on its feet again.</P>
    <P>There are two things the present Government has done. Other steps may have to be taken to create employment.  Many people who are on the dole would accept employment if it were available. The Department could develop a scheme that would give employment in the provision of amenities in towns, improving laneways and roads leading to houses in rural areas. These people have been there for generations.  A few counties have been carrying out improvements over a period. County Meath has taken over every lane with two or more houses in the past number of years. In Kildare, to a certain extent, if the locals themselves do work on the road then the county will take it over. Westmeath takes over a certain number every year. Some counties are very slow in doing it. Maybe if a scheme was formulated and a certain amount of money was allocated something like that could be done, improving roadways, undertaking small drainage schemes that would not be covered by arterial drainage, taking over the work that is normally done through local improvement schemes, which is quite small. This could create a certain amount of employment. It would have the further advantage that it would be helping quite a number of people as well.</P>
    <P>We have seen in the newspapers gloomy reports on the tourist industry. From some of the headlines in the newspapers one would think it was gone and that a national calamity had come. Only a few years ago I heard the Opposition expressing the view: &ldquo;Ah, it is only the Irish coming back,&rdquo;&mdash;the Irish that they ran out of the country. They wanted to run down the industry completely. The income was only about £40 or £50 million at that time. It is £105 million this year. It just did not keep pace this year with <Col N="107" /> the extra costs. It went up £5 million when normal costs went up £6 or £7 million. This is regarded as a calamity. It is a lot of money coming into the country. It does not cost the country that much to give support to it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>I have known a few hoteliers who have gone out with special offers to encourage people to come to their hotels to keep them ticking over during the slack season. They are not sitting back waiting for a car to drive up. In any business one must go out and sell the product. On a TV programme the other night I saw <Col N="108" /> one person who has taken the initiative of going to France and Germany to meet tourist agents there to attract people to his hotel. From what one could gather from the discussion he seemed to have been a livewire. He said he ran an ordinary family hotel, but he knew he could not compete with the big hotels in providing facilities. He brought in all the other hotels in the area and made it a community effort. In that way they were able to compete against the big hotel people in providing the facilities needed and it seemed to be paying off.</P>
      <P>With all the crying and weeping about the tourist industry no mention was made of the overall figure. No mention was made of the large number of people going out of the country each year to spend their holidays in Spain, France and other countries. Now is the time to get some of those Irish people to spend their holidays in Ireland. We might not be able to provide the sun one would get on the beaches of Spain, Italy or France but there are other compensations. They are near home and there is no language problem. Often abroad they are not familiar with the language. Some years ago I was in Spain.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>At the country's expense, representing the country, and I hope I did some good. Travelling along a road, which was bumpy, we came across a notice, in English, in a foreign country: &ldquo;Sorry for the discomfort but we are doing it for your benefit.&rdquo;  I said there is a country going after tourism in a big way. The tourist industry should be trying to encourage Irish people to spend their holidays here even if we got only 40 or 50 per cent. It would be a very big jump and those hotels Senator Kelly mentioned would be in a much better position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the number of hotels being sold, it is very easy to get figures. <Col N="109" /> There are always farms being sold. In business there are always shops being sold. In the hotel business there are bound to be hotels up for sale. I do not believe the number of hotels up for sale this year is that much higher than in previous years. There are various reasons why hotels may have to be sold. The owner may not be a good businessman and decide to sell or he may die and his relatives may decide to put it up for sale. I know of some new hotels that started up in business during the last few years and they seem to be earning a profit and are prepared to continue in business. In most of those cases they know the odds and have made it their business to attract customers. Many of them can offer better service and value than their foreign counterparts.</P>
    <P>Most of our people who holiday abroad are office personnel and members of trade unions. The trade unions could be of great assistance to the tourist industry by encouraging their members to spend their holidays at home. We need only about £5 million out of the £40 million to put us on the road to recovery.</P>
    <P>Another problem that has come to my notice&mdash;and perhaps the Minister could do something to rectify it&mdash;is related to the income tax code. At holiday times people are paid all their holiday money in one week. They are taxed on that particular week.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I remind the Senator that we are discussing administration not taxation? A discussion of a general nature will be allowed on expenditure and financial policies but details of taxation do not arise on this motion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCrinion" hpid="Mr. Crinion Mr. Crinion">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>It was on the administration of the Finance Act.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is a matter of administration it is in order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCrinion" hpid="Mr. Crinion Mr. Crinion">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, it is administration.  If the tax free allowances covered the two or three weeks, the whole holiday period, it would relieve a good deal of heavy taxation. I know the Department will tell us that the workers will get the benefit when they go back, that <Col N="110" /> they will not have as much tax to pay for the following three or four weeks because the extra allowances have built up while they were away but that does not satisfy the man who gets approximately £60 and has perhaps to pay out £20 of it in tax. I know the Department have the power to allow extra time in certain cases for the payment of tax. It would not cost the Department anything but would create a great deal of goodwill. At present if a married man is allowed £12 tax free and obtains £60 in wages and holiday pay he will have to pay tax on the difference to cover the three weeks. He should get the tax free allowance for the three weeks which would bring the figure to £36 and he would then only have to pay tax on £24. It is a matter that could be looked into by the Department.</P>
      <P>A good deal remains to be done in the agricultural field. Farmers do not seem to be equipping themselves in the educational field to deal with what lies ahead irrespective of whether we enter the Common Market or not. For posts in the trades and in industry it is usually necessary to complete a five-year apprenticeship and for executive posts a university education is required. A farmer apprenticeship scheme came into operation in 1963 or 1964. I remember being at the meeting at which it was first mooted in 1955. It took nine years to get it off the ground and the number of people availing of it today is still very small indeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us take the example of a person who is going back to work on a farm; whether he inherits it or just works it is immaterial. He usually gives up his job and tries to pick up the work at the point where his father left off. If he is progressive he may attend an agricultural college for one year where he may obtain a degree. He then returns to the farm, but his experience is still very limited. In the agricultural college he will be given a broad education for a particular type of farming. He may spend a few weeks on the rearing of cattle, pigs and poultry, but the time he spends on those subjects is insufficient.  The colleges have the most modern machinery and methods available, but when this young farmer <Col N="111" /> returns to his farm he will not have modern machinery and facilities at his disposal to carry into practice what he has learned at the college. He may be hampered because of the ideas of older members of the family who are not impressed by new-fangled ways. It is a very short course and has the redeeming feature that it will not take up valuable acreage nor a large proportion of the capital needed for other improvements; at the same time it will allow the young farmer to help out with other duties on the farm. The farming organisations and the Department of Agriculture should make an all-out effort to train the young farmers of today for whatever tasks they may have in the future.</P>
    <P>Denmark, as I said, is a country which is often held up to us. During my stay there I never heard of a farmer who had not undergone a training period of at least five years before taking on his own farm or helping in the management of one. If he did not take the apprenticeship course he would have gone to university and taken a degree in some field of agriculture which would be of benefit to him. In my experience, the percentage of our young people at agricultural colleges who are returning to the farms is very small. I was very discouraged to find that it was less than 20 per cent. The other 80 per cent were seeking positions outside the farming community. One group, in their final year, were applying for positions in the Department of Agriculture; a second group were in their practical year for a B.Agr. degree; a third group felt they needed this education to enable them to secure positions as travellers or salesmen in companies supplying goods to the agricultural community.</P>
    <P>We are not giving as much attention to the training of our young farmers as we give to the youth in other sectors of the community. This attention is urgently required especially as the number of farmer-ownerships has decreased rapidly in the last few years. A farm will no longer be set for a period of time, due to the influence of the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="112" /> Over the next few years there will have to be a large capital investment in agriculture. However, this investment should be linked with an educational programme for agriculture. The ACC have set a headline in this respect, as they will not consider an application for a loan unless accompanied by a farm programme drawn up by the local agricultural instructor. It is only in this way that the farming community can prosper.</P>
    <P>Any changes in the structure of farming can only be brought about very slowly; they may even take years to accomplish. Therefore, long-term planning in agriculture is of much greater importance than in industry. To be qualified to do this type of planning one must have training.</P>
    <P>We have an exceptionally good B.Agr. degree in this country which was designed simply as a degree in farm management. I am not quite sure of the exact figures, but I think less than 1 per cent of the graduates return to farming after taking this degree. Before anyone takes over the management of a farm he should have a degree in agriculture. The Department of Agriculture would not give the management of one of their own farms to anyone who did not have a degree. One of the stipulations, if the farm was 200 or 300 acres, would always be that he should have a degree in agriculture. When the Department consider it is economically important that a person should have a degree it is much more important that the farmer with 200 or 300 acres should have his degree in agriculture and they should be encouraged by way of financial and educational grants to take a degree in agriculture.</P>
    <P>Very rarely will the professor in charge accept a farmer's son without requiring him to do a practical year. It used to be accepted that a farmer's son had his practical year done and only a person coming from a town would need to do a practical year. Evidently the professor has found since he took over, perhaps ten years ago, that even the farmer's son has not as good a grasp of farming as he would like to see and he requires almost everybody to do a practical year. He <Col N="113" /> sets out the agricultural school or college to which they must go. That is a fair indication of what a professional person thinks.</P>
    <P>The Agricultural Institute are doing a survey to take in every type of farming and get accounts from farmers. It was quite successful the last time and gave a fair insight into what incomes should be gained from different types of farming. I am glad they are doing it again. I was disappointed that they did not take in poultry farming. My colleague Senator Farrell would be able to deal with that in greater detail. Although there is a fairly high capital involvement I still think that if a farmer wanted a farm plan and wanted to know what income he could expect from the poultry industry the Institute would be able to give that figure to him. The Institute were set up to give guidelines to farmers and their agricultural advisers. That covers the whole field of people who are employed by committees of agriculture. There are at least one or two such farmers&mdash;there are plenty of them in Monaghan and Cork&mdash;who would be able to provide the facilities for the necessary research in the particular field.</P>
    <P>Beef is, of course, our largest industry.  The support payments that England gives to a certain extent govern the market we have here. If we do not get it directly we get it indirectly as it more or less controls the prices we have. We will be going away from that to a free market which will mean that the prices are kept at a certain high figure without a quota. The people will have to pay a higher price. If the price is too low it will put the tariff barriers up, literally no beef will come in and supply and demand will bring the price up to what it should be. If the price goes too high they will drop the barriers and let a little in. Instead of paying the money to the Government in taxation they will pay for the support payments, as in England. The people will be doing it directly in paying a higher price for beef and mutton.</P>
    <P>On any major change of this kind it is impossible to foresee all the snags that may happen. Any change like that <Col N="114" /> will always create some unforeseen problem. I could visualise that beef would price itself out of the market. It is at present more or less a luxury food. Some of the cheaper foods, like poultry, will possibly take a certain amount of the trade. Twenty or 30 years ago, when I was a young lad, I would have considered chicken a luxury food. It was always considered something special when you had a chicken for your dinner; now it is the reverse. With modern methods they have been able to produce the chicken so cheaply that it is the cheapest form of meat that is available at present. Chicken and ham used be the main dish at dinner but now a beef steak is the main dish. The wheel has turned a complete circle. Entry into the Common Market is bound to be of great benefit to the farming community and also to industry. There will be higher prices available to the farming community and it will not be merely be pence or pounds. There will be very big increases which will put more money into agriculture and give the benefit of increased incomes to the agricultural community.</P>
    <P>In industry, where there is free access to a market of 200 million people, it will be easier to sell there. At present most of our go-ahead industries are selling there despite the high tariffs operating against them. What will they be able to do when those tariffs come down and they are able to compete freely? Of course it has a double edge. More imports will come in here. I would like the Irish people to realise, as I said in the earlier part of my speech, that they owe it to the country to buy the product of the country in which they are living.</P>
    <P>In the other fields of agriculture, the Government have been doing quite an amount of work to get people to come back into sheep production. Instead of the numbers increasing, they have been going down a bit. The ewe subsidy scheme is bound to have an effect where a person can get the extra £2 per ewe lamb to enable each female to reproduce before it goes for mutton. It is bound to increase our sheep numbers in the country.</P>
    <P>One of the things that is holding <Col N="115" /> back the sheep industry is that sheep numbers on any farm cannot be increased dramatically. There is an old saying that the worst enemy a sheep can have is another one. It is very true in that you can keep maybe one sheep per acre with cattle, but bringing in all the sheep that could graze that particular acre or farm can worsen the position. Worms are causing the trouble. Even with modern methods intensive sheep farming cannot be done. I know people who have tried to have really intensive units of sheep. Their products are not the best. Maybe in time this will be overcome. It is 12 years since I went to see a farmer who, along with a friend of mine, was doing intensive sheep farming. They were able to get six ewes and their lambs to the acre and it seemed to be working all right. But difficulties arose after a few years and our own institute are trying at the present time to overcome them. The produce of intensive sheep farming do not improve in the way they should when they are carried on to other farms. Maybe in time the difficulties will be overcome and we will be able to get increased numbers. The old idea was that mixed farming was better. If one thing failed another was sure to prosper, so that overall they kept on an even keel. People tend to go more now into specialised fields and to concentrate on one or two particular lines of farming.</P>
    <P>Some incentive could be given to encourage people to come back into the pig industry. It has a great deal to offer on a small farm. It is not taking up any land as it is a farmyard enterprise.  It would increase the output of the farm considerably. It is very important that some incentive should be given because it is one item which would really increase farm output and the income of small farmers. It is hard to get extra land for various reasons. By producing pigs farmers are not using the land and are able to get an increase in income from the farm. A bigger effort should be made in that direction.</P>
    <P>There are parts of my constituency in North Meath where a number of <Col N="116" /> small farmers are pleased that they have gone into pig production in a reasonably big way. I am talking in terms of keeping 100 to 300 pigs at a time. Some of them are increasing the numbers further, but it is not upsetting their normal work pattern on the farm. They are able to do that with modern housing and lay-out. It would help these people if a scheme of credit were brought in along with the existing grants to enable them to build the most up-to-date pig houses. Pigs have not much covering on them and they need warm and efficient houses. There is no use going into the industry unless you have really top-class housing. If the house is cold the pig will not make a profit, so it must be really first-class. The only way to encourage production is by good grants and loan incentives so that people will get increased income from the farm.</P>
    <P>To conclude, I repeat that some of our difficulties can be overcome by buying Irish and by having our holidays at home. In those two ways alone we could reduce unemployment significantly.  This is not a political issue, but a national one, and we should make a united effort.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>So far the debate on this motion could be described as wide-ranging. I will endeavour to narrow it down a bit. Most of us will agree that the past year leaves few pleasant memories, certainly not on the national, economic or social scene. I should like to make a few remarks regarding the national scene. I hope what I have to say will be regarded as being helpful and constructive but it is something on which public men should exercise extreme caution and care. During the past year the crisis in the North of Ireland continued to monopolise the scene, with the rising tempo of violence and destruction of life and property. Saddest of all, the year ended with little hope of any end to the trials of the six northern counties, notwithstanding the hopes and the efforts of men of goodwill on both sides of the Border.</P>
      <P>I have no wish to join the ranks of the self-appointed pundits in talking about the situation in the North of Ireland but I should like to refer to a speech which Senator Brugha made yesterday in this House. I agree with almost everything Senator Brugha said. He made a very realistic assessment of the background to the history of Partition and his analysis of the historical events leading up to that sad event in the history of our country was fair and accurate. Nobody on either side of this House could disagree with much of what Senator Brugha stated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is only one point, however, which I must disagree with. During the course of his concluding remarks he <Col N="118" /> stated, as I understood him, that there was no blame on anybody in the South. In the Republic, both the Government and the general public must accept a large measure of the blame for the current deplorable situation in the North of Ireland. This is mainly because over the past 50 years, apart from a measure of economic co-operation during the period of inter-Party Government and the historic visit of the late Seán Lemass to the then Premier O'Neill, virtually nothing has been done to prepare the ground for the eventual reunification of this country. We have now reached a stage when the unity of the country is probably closer than ever before and we are almost completely unprepared for the full consequences of this.</P>
    <P>In recent years we have spent tens of thousands of pounds employing consultants, setting up commissions, and investigations of all kinds to tell us how to run the country. We paid vast sums of money to foreign experts, real or alleged, on such matters as regionalisation, transport, growth centres and so on. We have invited outsiders in to tell us how to organise our own affairs. I do not object to that. Possibly there are people living outside this country with greater expertise and greater experience than we have, although I doubt this. But the one sector of Ireland in which we have done no study in depth, so far as I am aware, is the six northern counties: no effort has been made to assess the social, the economic and, above all, the human implications of the reunification of the country.</P>
    <P>We, of this generation, and past generations have failed to harness the greatest moral force of all in a great national movement and that is the enthusiasm and idealism of the young people over the past 50 years. It is no wonder to see them now being carried away, by emotional issues and false attractions, from the path of peace, goodwill and amity. We are all reaping the whirlwind of our neglect and apathy over the years as men of violence seek by the gun and the bomb to settle the question once and for all. Unfortunately, and tragically, such means, even if successful, will not settle the question, <Col N="119" /> because if by unity we mean lasting unity based on goodwill and on mutual respect with the differing backgrounds and traditions of the two main communities who inhabit this island, force is not the answer.</P>
    <P>We all believe Partition must end and I believe it will end perhaps sooner than we think. If we want it to end in a lasting peace in our island, peace between the communities in our island and between us and our neighbour, Great Britain, urgent initiatives must be taken, first of all by Great Britain, to be complemented by a united national effort both north and south of the Border. I hope others share my view that, freed from the threat of violence, intimidation, internment and military pressures, properly constituted tripartite negotiations could be got under way which would bring about a settlement based on mutual trust and goodwill and lead to lasting peace and prosperity for this island and its nearest neighbour in a context of a united Ireland.</P>
    <P>Time is passing and this opportunity must not be lost now. I believe our Government have a fundamental and primary part to play in this. No opportunity should be lost inside this country, but particularly outside, to press on with the initiatives I have outlined and to do everything possible to bring pressure on the British Government, whatever its content, to take the first steps in bringing about a lasting peace in a united Ireland.</P>
    <P>The past 12 months on the economic front have been ones of continuing inflation, falling profits of industrialists and businessmen, falling investment and rising unemployment. I do not want to overplay the question of unemployment.  I know there have been causes over which the Government or, indeed, anybody else has had no control.  It is quite true, as the Minister and the Taoiseach himself said in a recent speech, there has been a worldwide recession and we are now facing increased competition because of the lowering of those tariffs which protected <Col N="120" /> many of our industries over the past 30 or 40 years. But, and this is the important point, the Government knew this would happen when the Anglo-Irish Trade Agreement was concluded five or six years ago; they must have known that agreement would result in greater competition for certain sensitive industries. They must have realised that there could not be a smooth evolution from an economy protected for 30 or 40 years to a free trade area without some hurt to industries and, consequently, to industrial employment.</P>
    <P>Where I take the Government to task is not because they have no control over external forces but because knowing, as they must have known with the information at their disposal and with the reports coming in to them from the CIO and other agencies, what the evolution would be, they took virtually no steps to cushion the redundancies and the disemployment occurring as a direct result of the negotiations carried out and the treaties implemented by the Government. They must stand accused on that score. Irrespective of what may be said&mdash;it is now becoming a popular cant in my part of the country that this is a worldwide recession&mdash;had steps been taken in time a great deal of the consequences of this recession on the Irish economy and its impact on Irish industry, commerce and employment could have been forestalled. We can look forward to 1972 with some ray of hope. Some of the difficulties which beset the economies of various countries in the world during 1971, and earlier, now appear to be passing. It is likely that the steps, however ruthless, which have been taken by the Conservative Government in Britain may begin to pay off in 1972. Although their unemployment stands at a fantastically high figure, the highest for something like 20 or 25 years, the investment policy which they are now pursuing and the disinflationary policy, which has unfortunately resulted in heavy unemployment, may begin to pay off. If it does our principal export market should recover.</P>
    <P>One constituent above all others which people in charge of industry, in charge of business and in charge of <Col N="121" /> farming require is confidence; confidence that the Government know what they are doing and where they are going, confidence that in spite of temporary setbacks and problems of transition from protected industry to free trade, the Government will have a clear-cut policy to prevent recession and consequent unemployment and confidence also that the Government will pursue a reasonable policy of taxation.</P>
    <P>Senator Crinion referred to the question of taxation. I should like to support him in that regard. Nothing has inhibited confidence in industrial expansion as much as the Minister's own action last October 12 months in increasing corporate taxation from 50 to 58 per cent. That had a damping effect on business confidence and the desire to invest funds in the expansion of industry. I should like to think that the Minister's recent decision to reverse that policy was taken as a result of the failure of this step. Industry cannot expand without investment. The best investment and the one that costs the economy and the taxpayer least is the investment that comes out of profits retained in industry and commerce. I am sure the Minister would agree that every encouragement should be given to entrepreneurs and to business people generally to save and reinvest the profits of industry in the further expansion of their industries. Where an industry is a sensitive one and in danger of recession or closing down, due to changes in habits or for some other reason is likely to be seriously affected funds saved out of profits should be reinvested in other types of industry. Every possible encouragement should be given to this and the Minister, as a short-term measure, could do a lot worse than to give a further reduction in corporate taxation to provide every encouragement he possibly can for the reinvestment of funds in industry. This would not cause inflation. Funds saved because of lower taxation and reinvested in industrial expansion would not be inflationary. That would be the best possible type of encouragement and also the best way of providing increased employment.</P>
    <P>The Budget last year showed no <Col N="122" /> recognition of the gathering storm which rising competition and galloping inflation were to bring. A promise was made at the time to cut Government expenditure but I am not aware of the success of that intent. Unfortunately, it now would appear that it must have been abandoned as the Minister recently announced, and rightly so in the circumstances, that he was proposing to pump an extra £20 million into the economy. At the same time he did announce his decision to restore corporate taxation after the end of this financial year to its former level of 50 per cent. If I might make a suggestion to the Minister, he could go a step further. If he could have done that right away it would have been a psychological encouragement to the business community to expand and to invest in their businesses and enterprises.  Perhaps it may be too late now, but any encouragement to reinvest is one that should be pursued by the Minister.</P>
    <P>On the question of the economy and employment generally, the Taoiseach made a speech a couple of days ago. Reference has already been made to it, but there are one or two points in that speech to which I should like to refer. They are very relevant in the context of this debate. The Taoiseach said, according to a supplied script, that he intended to hold further meetings with employer and union representatives in the coming weeks to establish the basis on which further concerted action might take place. He dismissed the scare stories that unemployment would rise to 100,000 over the next few months. He went on to say, and this is sound comment in the present circumstances&mdash;</P>
    <P>In part the present difficulties are due to international events. Economic slow-down in the UK and the US has brought difficulties for some exporting industries and increased competition from imports on the home market...</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach also said:</P>
    <P>We have added to these difficulties by our own behaviour. Many managements have been slow to adapt to increased competition, despite the many exhortations and <Col N="123" /> financial incentives offered to them to do so. Employees and unions have pushed up pay levels at an excessive rate and this has made it harder both for existing firms to maintain employment and for new firms to be established.</P>
    <P>He went on to say:</P>
    <P>For its part the Government has already taken action aimed at safeguarding employment. Increased capital spending of £20 millions was announced in October...</P>
    <P>He concluded his speech by saying:</P>
    <P>If the normal seasonal pattern is continued, some further increase in unemployment may be expected in the coming weeks. But there is certainly no basis to the scare stories which suggest that unemployment will rise to 100,000 over the next few months.</P>
    <P>On the contrary, unemployment should start to fall in the spring. To the extent that further action by the Government is needed to achieve this result, it will be taken.</P>
    <P>I should like to suggest, with the greatest respect to the Taoiseach, that the pattern in the coming 12 months may not follow the pattern of the past years. Most of us have experienced a situation where you have had recessions followed by booms and then recessions again. These things have been cyclical in past years, but conditions last year and this year, I would submit, were completely different from conditions in previous years.</P>
    <P>We have a situation today, both internally in the economy and externally due to our decision to apply for membership of the Common Market, due to the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement, due to changes and advances in technological education, due to the replacement in many industries of workers by sophisticated modern machinery, that all these factors are comparatively new in our economy. Certainly the problem of free trade is one which has not faced us for many years. In the context of such a changed situation I certainly cannot share the Taoiseach's optimism that <Col N="124" /> the coming spring will see a substantial reduction in the very high unemployment figure, a figure which the Taoiseach himself anticipates will grow to even greater proportions before the seasonal fall in the spring. The Government will have to take stronger action than that taken up to now if we are to overcome this problem. The Minister's primer into the economy of £20 million may well be insufficient to bring an end to the recession and to get the wheels of industry and the economy generally in motion again.</P>
    <P>I am a strong advocate of this country joining the Common Market. Notwithstanding the difficulties we will encounter in the short term, in the long term it will be best for this country. It will be best for this country not only economically but nationally and socially too. However, in the interim period we will go through a very difficult and sticky time. I am concerned that the Government are not prepared for that interim period. I am concerned that the Government, in talking about the advantages of the Common Market price support system for agriculture under which our economy will undoubtedly benefit, are not aware that before that begins to percolate through the economy, before we have this saving of £30 million in subsidies to spend in the economy, there will be an interim period in which there could be great distress, with many businesses going to the wall and in which there could be an almost catastrophic level of unemployment. I would like to think of this as a short-term problem and, therefore, the Government will find it necessary very shortly to pump a further substantial sum into the economy.</P>
    <P>I would suggest that the means of spending that sum on a regional basis already lie to hand. As the Minister is aware, the country is divided into a number of regional development areas. I think the mid-western area, Limerick, Clare and north Tipperary, was the first of these to be established. They have already drawn up a five-year development plan.</P>
    <P>The Corporation of Limerick were the first&mdash;I think I am correct in saying this&mdash;to pass a development plan <Col N="125" /> in 1967 or 1968 and they have available a plan to begin a number of important capital works as soon as funds become available. The plans are ready and all that is required is the necessary finance to get them under way. The best possible way to introduce much-needed capital into the economy would be through the aegis of the regional development organisations and through the urban authorities outside of Dublin.</P>
    <P>Any emphasis on spending, at this critical juncture of our history, should be placed on our western and southwestern counties which are the regions where the highest rates of emigration have always occurred and where some of the industries are of a highly sensitive nature. Spending on major capital works would not alone save potential unemployment but would also prepare the infrastructure for the development of those regions when we go into the EEC. I think the Minister will agree that it will be far too late after we have gone into the EEC to provide the necessary infrastructure. Industry and development tend to follow the establishment of an infrastructure.  Whether it be roads, industrial estates, the provision of electricity, or gas, or whatever; once those facilities have been provided industry tends to follow them. If a major capital programme were undertaken right away it would breach the critical period between now and when the advantages of membership of the EEC will begin to flow into the economy, particularly in regard to agriculture.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will agree with me when I say that schemes and prognostications have an unhappy tendency not to work out as originally planned. A person starting in business who anticipates that he is going to make a profit at the end of the first year is generally regarded as a fool. It takes one, two, or often three years before an industry is firmly established due to conditions which could not have been foreseen at the time. It is very likely that if we succeed in getting into the EEC on 1st January next it will take at least several years before the benefits of trading in the wider <Col N="126" /> free trade area will begin to be felt in our economy. That period will be the critical period for us and it is the period in regard to which the Government must take action now and not later when the axe has fallen.</P>
    <P>One of the encouraging feats last year was the increase in total exports in spite of the recessions outside the country. It is only right for us to congratulate the good work which many exporters undertook during the year in spite of very difficult conditions. The bulk of those exports were carcase meat and cattle; approximately 50 per cent of exports were manufactured goods. If we can continue to maintain and to increase that ratio above 50 per cent, the outlook for this country is very bright indeed. However, we should remember, going back to what Senator Crinion said about the importation of textiles and clothes, that under free trade conditions such goods can be imported from many parts of the world.</P>
    <P>Under free trade conditions goods can come in and compete against our own and we can only hold our own, not only in export markets but also in our own home market if our goods are equal in quality and competitive in price. In other words, the EEC is no bonanza unless we, as a nation, are prepared to strip ourselves of any surplus fat, of any unwillingness to work, and get down to producing first-class goods at competitive prices. If we are prepared to do this there is a bright future for us in the Common Market; if we are not prepared to do it, we are in for a very rude awakening.</P>
    <P>I should like to draw the Minister's attention, in the context of what I have described a minute ago as large-scale schemes of public works&mdash;he is already aware of this from deputations he has received&mdash;to the tremendous potential of the Shannon estuary in the context of a united Europe. Here we have a wonderful natural asset which so far has been left dormant. This was not due to any fault on the part of the local people, as the Minister will confirm, because every effort was made to sell the advantages of that unique estuary to interested industrialists all over the world. I have always held the belief <Col N="127" /> that if we could just get one major installation in the estuary others would rapidly follow. I can think of no better way of ensuring the prosperity of the south and west of Ireland than by exploiting to the full the unique advantages of the Shannon estuary.</P>
    <P>Because of the size of ships being built now very few ports in Western Europe will be able to take the bulk carriers of the future. Some of the ships planned will not be able to go up the English Channel. One of the few ports in Western Europe that could take these, and even bigger ships, is the Shannon estuary. I hope that the Government, when planning major works, such as petro-chemical works or further oil refineries, will take into consideration the unique advantages of the Shannon estuary and what its development could mean to the economy of the south and west of Ireland.</P>
    <P>On a somewhat similar plane, I should like to decry the meagre assistance which successive Governments have given to Irish ports over the years. The total amount of money given to the ports&mdash;we are an island nation&mdash;over the past 50 years is only a fraction of what has gone to industry and agriculture. Yet we pride ourselves on being a maritime people. In the context of the EEC, we will require efficient and modern ports to transport the products of our farms and our fields to the Continent of Europe, to Britain and elsewhere.</P>

      <P>I am optimistic enough to believe we will have the products. I do not share the Senator's pessimism in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one final point I should like to make in relation to the EEC. I have the gravest fears that the Referendum to change the Constitution to comply with entry into the EEC may not be carried. I say this, not for any of the reasons of the various organisations opposed to our entry, but because there is, in my experience, a wide measure of apathy and ignorance <Col N="128" /> about the implications of joining the EEC. I mentioned this on a motion discussed in this House a few weeks ago, when the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Hillery, was present; he did not accept my point of view. I want to reiterate it now because it is what I believe and I understand there are others who hold the same view.</P>
    <P>There has been too much loose talk about a bonanza. Sufficient simple literature has not been produced to spell out in simple language for the man in the street and the housewife what the advantages of EEC membership are and what the disadvantages will be if we stay out. I know, like every other Member of the Seanad, that sheafs of literature have been published. Indeed, I find it hard to keep up with the volume. I just wonder how the ordinary man in the street or the housewife can hope to keep up with it. Many people do not understand the implications of the EEC. Between this and the date of the Referendum I would suggest to the Minister that he should urge the Government to bring out literature in simple terms, stating the advantages of EEC membership and, more important, the disadvantages if we do not secure membership, so that the ordinary people will understand all the implications.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Local Government recently produced a White Paper, or a green booklet, outlining plans for the reorganisation of local government. If these plans are implemented in their proposed form they will lead to greater centralisation. They will lead to a greater extension of bureaucratic control over local government and will kill local initiative at community level. What we require, and various Government Ministers have stated this, is less and not more centralisation. I understood that, when these regional development organisations were set up, they would be regional in every sense of the word. In other words, I understood that they would be a breakaway from centralisation. So far they have not been that. Control is still exercised at the centre. It is about time that the central authority and the central Departments transferred, where practicable, some of their power. I do not <Col N="129" /> talk of transferring whole Departments.  I think that is a cockeyed plan and I have the gravest doubts now that it will ever go through; but there is no reason why sections of Departments could not be transferred to regional centres like Limerick, Cork, Tullamore and Galway. Local people would then feel they were visiting Government Departments by going to the nearest city or town instead of having to trek up here to Dublin to get in touch with a Minister or a higher civil servant.</P>
    <P>We are a rural people and, instead of seeking to wipe out the smaller local bodies, we should be seeking, where practicable, to extend and add to them. Some of them are small and mere talking shops, but it is far better to have people coming together to talk about providing a new light in a street, or sweeping the streets, or some other mundane thing, than not have them come together at all.</P>
    <P>We should have three tiers of local government, the county council, or city council, as the case may be, with smaller urban centres in between; and finally we should have community councils, based on a voluntary and not on a statutory basis. It would be a disaster for the statutorily elected public representatives and the voluntary workers to be put together in the same organisation or on the same local board. They are two entirely different categories. A lot of the effectiveness and enthusiasm would go out of the work of the voluntary workers if they were to sit side by side with the elected representatives of the people.</P>
    <P>Finally, I presume that, following the census of last year, there will be some changes in some of the constituencies.  We had an experience of the changes, four or five years ago. I do not want to go back over what happened as a result of that. The time has come when any changes in constituencies, either local or Dáil constituencies, should be a matter for an independent board. I can remember when a proposal to change the method of voting was proposed in 1961.</P>
    <P>At that time it contained a proposal to set up a completely independent body presided over by a Circuit Court <Col N="130" /> judge or judge of the High Court to decide on the revision of the constituencies.  This is sufficiently important to be taken out of the hands of the political head of the Department of Local Government and put into the hands of an independent body presided over by members of the Judiciary.</P>
    <P>If I might refer back for a moment to the Taoiseach's speech, in reference to his statement that he proposed to call a meeting of employers and workers together at an early opportunity, I hope that out of that meeting will come a further national wages agreement. I should like to give the Minister credit for taking the initiative in stabilising the wages situation a year or so ago. If this country is going to advance in the years ahead it must have stable economic conditions. It must cut back on the devaluation of money and inflation must be contained. I do not think there is any hope of abolishing inflation; in the 20th century we must learn to live with inflation, but we should be able to contain it within reasonable limits. The sooner the Taoiseach or the Minister for Finance brings both sides together again and opens negotiation on this very important matter the better for the economy, the better for the workers themselves and the better for all concerned.</P>
    <P>What is most important in any negotiations is an appreciation by each side of the other's point of view. It is fashionable in socialistic circles to decry the profit motive. I would certainly agree with that contention if the profit motive were to be the only motive but, as any businessman will agree, profits earned in a fiercely competitive society are profits well earned. Any man who can run a business in fair and free competition and, through his own hard work, efficiency and capacity to save out of his profits, expand his business is entitled to those profits and good luck to him. At the same time it is absolutely necessary that the worker should appreciate, and it should be demonstrated to him, that as the economic cake grows his standard of living and his rewards for the products of his labour which is all he has to sell, grows with it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="131" /> It is also important to realise that increased wages and increased salaries do not always mean an increased standard of living in a situation of galloping inflation. As I said, if the Taoiseach, or one of his Ministers&mdash; the Minister for Finance himself possibly&mdash;can, in the forthcoming employer-labour negotiations work out a formula whereby inflation can be contained and industry and commerce and farming earn reasonable profits in free and fair competition and if the worker can be seen to have a fair reward for his labour then we will be getting somewhere. Certainly, as one public representative, I should like to wish such a conference every success.</P>

      <P>I have been listening since about five o'clock yesterday afternoon to a most interesting debate on the Appropriation Act, as it now is. I have listened to these debates on several occasions before and I have been wondering during last evening and this afternoon what is the good of these debates. I can remember many questions being raised in former years and I do not know what exact effect these questions have had or what has happened as a result of these questions being raised either in the mind of the Minister for Finance or in the mind of any other Minister or in the operations of any of the Government Departments.  I am a little at a loss to know the practical value of this very interesting but rather prolonged debate that we are having in this House and which possibly will not end today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having said that&mdash;perhaps the Minister will tell me what does happen as a result of what we say here on this <Col N="132" /> occasion&mdash;I have noticed that most speakers divided their remarks into two separate sections. Most of them referred at some length to the two great crises which are facing this country at the present time, namely, the situation in Northern Ireland and unemployment.  I, like the other speakers, have no answer to either of these. I do not think I am even able to make suggestions as sensible as those I have heard from previous speakers but I should like to say something about each of them.</P>
    <P>The situation in Northern Ireland is terrible but I do not see how it can be resolved. I have talked with people on both sides, the majority and minority in Northern Ireland, and I have found what I had not suspected before&mdash;a terrible, deep gulf between them. This gulf has become emotionalised and I find it very difficult to see how it can be bridged very easily at least in a short time. Basically I suppose it goes back to the division that occurred in the Christian Church in the early part of the 16th century and the decision that a certain English King, in order to solve his personal and domestic difficulties, took on that occasion. Up to then our problems had not been so serious. We had, of course, a couple of centuries previously, been invaded by troops from England. They were Anglo-Norman; in fact, at that time they were mostly Normans. But we are told that they became pretty well assimilated into this country. We are told they became more Irish than the Irish themselves and I never heard that their presence in this country presented any serious problem. Indeed when a large number of them left the country as the &ldquo;Wild Geese&rdquo; in the 18th century everybody agrees that this was a loss to the country.</P>
    <P>It is quite different since the 16th century because then a certain different situation arose. I think it was on that account and on account of, I am sure, as I see it now, the ineffective steps that were taken by successive British Governments to try and get over this difference that we are now in the situation in which we find ourselves.</P>
    <P>That is, as I see it, how the thing came about, but it is another matter <Col N="133" /> to suggest what can be done about it. I thoroughly agree that successive British Governments have made great mistakes in dealing with this country over the last 300 years. I do not think that the withdrawal of the British troops or the withdrawal of the British influence from the North of Ireland now would solve the difficulty. We have had in the last 20 years examples of the result of withdrawal of a power from a country where there were internal disturbances. Belgium withdrew from the Congo, Britain withdrew from India. In both cases the result was extremely bad. I should like to know what arrangements any British Government could make in the North of Ireland to ease itself out of that situation, so that we would not be left with an even worse situation than we have now. I do not know what we can do in the Republic about it. I firmly believe that we cannot hope to receive the North of Ireland into the Republic, or into any association with us perhaps on a federal basis, except on the foundation of goodwill. I see no place for violence on either side in building up that situation. This violence is bound to lead to increased bitterness and make it increasingly difficult for us to get together. We know all too well in this country how long the bitterness that is engendered by such violence can persist. How much longer will it persist if there is a division, say, of religion as well as of emotion on such an occasion?</P>
    <P>I think also that this situation we have here now is not only affecting us, and may affect us worse than it is doing at the moment, but it is affecting our relations outside. I think those of us who have to go elsewhere, particularly to England, experience this, not in any very serious way, but by remarks which might easily be slanted somewhat differently if we were not there. I think that the atmosphere is not doing us any good at all. Again what can we do about that either? It looks to me as if internment were, at the moment, the most important issue separating the parties and preventing discussions taking place. I do not know what I would do about internment if I were a Minister in the North of Ireland. <Col N="134" />  Would I release a large number of people, some of whom might well have designs on upsetting the Government of the country? Could I persuade the majority that this was the right thing to do? Would I be letting myself in for greater problems than before?</P>
    <P>On the other hand, it is clearly wrong&mdash;and I agree that it is clearly wrong&mdash;to keep people in prison without trial indefinitely. We all know the reasons that have been advanced in support of this, but could the Government not perhaps bring some pressure on the British Government to ensure a trial even of a sample&mdash;a small sample, perhaps&mdash;of these internees? Maybe this suggestion has been made and tried and found ineffective, but I would think that if even half a dozen, taken perhaps at random from the several hundred imprisoned, were tried, and if it were found feasible to lay on a trial and reach a verdict, then you could with fairness demand that the North of Ireland Government try the remainder of the prisoners or release them. If, on the other hand, such a trial is found to be not feasible, then I think something else would have to be considered.  I just make that suggestion as to whether the Taoiseach could possibly attempt to bring about this result.</P>
    <P>We all get literature from people in the North about their situation. The more I read of it, the more depressed I become. I read just recently a circulation from Mr. Brooke. He sent me, and I suppose he sent to every other Senator and probably to Deputies as well, a copy of the White Paper that came out last August, of the Green Paper that came out last November and of the Prime Minister's speech. I read these very carefully. One thing that I noted was that the Prime Minister claimed to have made suggestions away back last June about legislation in the North in order to enable him to nominate certain people to the Senate of the North of Ireland Parliament in the same way as our Taoiseach nominates people to this House. I thought that would have been an excellent suggestion. It would have enabled him to bring in at that critical time before there had been such a wide division as there is now, perhaps a dozen, perhaps fewer, <Col N="135" /> people from the minority in the North of Ireland and to have set them down in the Senate with the other representatives as part of a single Chamber to work together. That suggestion was made in June, he referred to it more than six months later and nothing apparently had been done about it. That six months was a very long six months and an enormous number of things happened in that time, some of which are pretty nearly irreversible.</P>
    <P>I thought then, and I said so in reply to that letter, that if that was the kind of way they were going on, and if that was the kind of approach they made to people like me, then I could see no hope at all for having any help from them in resolving the situation. Reference has been made many times to the constitutional issues in this regard, I mean in relation to our own Constitution in the Republic. I think we are inclined here to minimise the importance of these considerations because the members of the church to which I belong, and other Protestant churches here, have never raised any serious outcry and never complained of any serious disability from any of these considerations. I think that because of that we tend to minimise the importance of them. I think from my conversations with people in the North either they are important or they are made to appear important. In either case, I do not think the issue differs very greatly; it is a disadvantage to us that that situation should be allowed to persist. We have been talking about this for some time but very little has been done in this side either. I do not know if the Government have any plan for making a change in these matters. I should like the Minister to tell us whether or not they have. If they have we should know about it as it would reassure us and strengthen the hands of those of us who have to talk with people in the North of Ireland from time to time. The Government should grasp this nettle. If they did grasp it, it might turn out not to be a nettle but only a dock.</P>
    <P>The other issue debated here on this occasion is unemployment. There has been a steep rise in unemployment and <Col N="136" /> this is likely to worsen. We are in a very weak position in dealing with such a matter for two reasons&mdash;we have so few natural resources and we produce so many more people than can be accommodated in the industries and other activities in the Republic. Our greatest natural resource is farming but in all countries the trend in farming is to employ fewer people per acre rather than to employ more. The more effective and economical the farming, the fewer people will be employed on the land and the less important farming becomes as a contribution towards employment.</P>
    <P>Our population largely seeks a living elsewhere. Considerable numbers go to England and where there is full employment there this is satisfactory at least from the economic point of view. But when there is a recession in England the position is quite different. We have to compete in our industrial output with these other countries and when they are in a position of recession, our industries find that competition more difficult. I do not see how the Minister proposes to deal with this situation but I gathered from certain observations he made during Senator O'Higgins's speech that there were some ideas in the Minister's mind and I look forward to hearing these when he is concluding the debate.</P>
    <P>The Appropriation Act is what you might describe as the Government's shopping list for the current year. It contains a large number of items in two parts of the Schedule and the total bill is impressive. Various Senators have referred to areas in which these expenses are being incurred and made observations about the efficiency of these areas. I have only one or two items to which I should like to refer and the remarks I am going to make are, in general, not going to suggest any lower cost to the Minister; in fact, they will probably cost more though they are not really expensive items.</P>
    <P>The first item I wish to mention is pensions. The word &ldquo;pensions&rdquo; occurs under three headings in this document. In the Department of the Minister for Finance, in the Department of the Minister for Defence and finally in the last item which comes under the Minister <Col N="137" /> for Health, but I do not know whether it is meant to be part of his Department. It is for the payment of increases in certain pension allowances and retired pay in respect of the public service and for payment of allowances to widows and military service pensioners.  Is that really meant to come under the Minister for Health or is it an entirely separate item?</P>
    <P>There are three items out of the 50 here which refer to the word &ldquo;pension&rdquo;.  The Department of Defence are entirely concerned with service pensions, Defence Forces, military organisations, <i>et cetera.</i> It devolves on the Minister for Finance to take care of superannuation and pensions in all other areas. I have been impressed by the approaches made to me on many occasions, principally by retired civil servants whose pension arrangements seem to be far from satisfactory. They contributed to the pension fund, they bought a pension on the basis of their contribution, but there was no provision made for adjusting that pension in relation to the cost of living as time went on. This question was not so serious before inflation became so formidable but we have now a very serious problem where pensioners are expected to continue their way of life, their standard of living, when the money they get purchases much less than it did when they retired.</P>
    <P>Some assurance was given a couple of years ago that this matter would be considered and put right and I understand that nothing has yet come of that assurance. I urge the Minister to give it his earnest consideration. It will not be a very big bill. It will help a number of people who have served their country well and who deserve to be treated well.</P>
    <P>Speaking about pensions I should also like to know what the position is regarding widows of retired civil servants. I know of one or two instances where retired civil servants died very shortly after retirement and left widows. In one case, so far as I can find out, the widow has not been able to get any reasonable reply to a request for help from the Department in which her late husband had been employed. He had contributed towards <Col N="138" /> his pension all through his working life. He had only drawn a very small amount of pension when he died suddenly and then the widow was left in this situation.</P>
    <P>From the actuarial point of view she has no argument. The level of pension a person gets is based on an acturial calculation about the average expectation of life. People who die early in life make it easier for the insurance companies and others to fulfil their obligations in giving pensions. If everybody lived to the age of 90 then the insurance companies would be in a bad way. But that does not help the person in the rather sad personal situation to which I referred. We are all aware of the increasing mortality that there is from heart disease, particularly among males around 60 years of age and in the early stages of retirement.</P>
    <P>Here again I should like to know from the Minister if anything can be done about this situation. I have in mind one widow of a teacher who taught mathematics in an Irish-speaking training college. He died suddenly after two years retirement and I do not think any provision has been made for her.</P>
    <P>The next item on this list that I should like to refer to is education. There is a small item there under the heading of higher education of approximately £10 million in grants-in-aid to universities and colleges. The various universities and colleges get substantial amounts of money both for capital expenditure, running expenditure and current costs from the Minister for Education.</P>
    <P>As far as my university is concerned, I should like to express our satisfaction with the fairness with which the Minister has treated us when application has been made to him both for capital sums and for the costs of running the college. Perhaps I might refer briefly in this regard, because it is a sum of money in his budget of approximately £1½ million, to the current controversy about our Arts building. It is said that this will be an ugly building. It will be situated in a place where it will take away from the amenities of the citizens of <Col N="139" /> Dublin. They will not have this nice open space to look into any more. When they are coming down Dawson Street they will find this blank wall in front of them and, it is said, it is being put up without any proper plan for the site of Trinity College.</P>
    <P>To take the last item first, this has been repeated many times in letters to the Press. It is not true. For the last six or seven years we have had a plan for the college site and a distinguished town planner, namely Professor Myles Wright of Liverpool, has acted as our consultant during this period in developing that plan and making sure that it was properly related to the requirements of the college. Broadly, all the area to the east of the college will be given to the science buildings and they will need it all. They would need more if they could have it. We want to keep the open space for the college park and that only leaves the present proposed site for the Arts building.</P>
    <P>As far as the need for a building is concerned, the first thing you have to realise is that the numbers in the college have to rise to at least the level of 5,500 to 6,000, which is proposed. This is what the Government expects from us as a contribution to the educational requirements of the young people. If we are not prepared to face up to that and take that share of this educational burden then we do not deserve to continue and it is very likely we would probably not continue for very long. If we are going to continue, the next point to be realised is that Trinity College has never had any Arts teaching accommodation. I would like to repeat that because when you look into that vast complex of buildings in the front of the college it is difficult to realise that they do not contain a single lecture theatre in which an Arts teacher can take a class of, say, even 50 or 60 students for a lecture.</P>
    <P>In the old days we had 1,000 or 1,500 students in the college. Half of these were medical students, a fair number were science students, and the number of Arts students was small. They were taught by the Fellows of the college and other teachers in their <Col N="140" /> own private sets of rooms in the college.  Every Fellow had a sitting room, bedroom and lecture room and the lecture room was capable of taking perhaps 25 or 30 students as a class. The only equipment the teacher needed was a blackboard. That was the way in which the distinguished mathematicians, classical scholars and philosophers of Trinity College were taught throughout several centuries and certainly up to the middle thirties.</P>
    <P>After the last war the number of people taking Arts courses increased remarkably. Industrialists found that an Arts qualification, even though it was not at an honours level, was a good one and the demand for graduates increased. The demand for undergraduate education therefore increased.  The professors of History, French or English and of some other Arts subjects now have classes of 150 or 200. They can only be accommodated in the lecture rooms down at the science and medical school end of the college. These people have to walk down there for all their classes, bring all their books, have whatever audiovisual aids they require laid on, and so on. The alternative is temporary hut type accommodation.</P>
    <P>This has meant also an increase in staff accommodation because with the increasing numbers staffs of departments have to increase. They must have offices. They are sharing two or three to a small room at the moment. We have had to dispossess students from their own rooms in the college in order to convert these into departmental offices and into offices for teachers.</P>
    <P>The number of students in residence is so reduced in relation to the total number in the college that very shortly we can no longer claim to be a residential college. Only by providing accommodation for the Arts faculty of the college can this situation be reversed.  If that accommodation is forthcoming, then we will be able to take the Arts teachers out of the students' rooms, put them into a building, give them offices in that building, and give those rooms back to the students for living quarters. We will be able to have proper lecture room accommodation close to the library where proper work <Col N="141" /> can be done. That is the requirement for this building.</P>
    <P>In further relation to the item of £10 million here for universities and colleges, I should like to refer briefly to the future of the university colleges in Dublin in a more general sort of way, but in particular to a special aspect of that future. I know this has been studied very carefully and, as we all know, at great length by the Higher Education Authority. There is a general feeling abroad that that Authority may have presented a report to the Minister for Education and that report may become public property, possibly in a month or so. Perhaps we have seen in the newspapers speculation about what that report may have recommended.  I should like just to refer to one speculation I have read about the future of medical education in Dublin in that context.</P>
    <P>It is supposed that this report suggests that there should be two pre-clinical schools in Dublin, one in University College and one in Trinity College, and one clinical school based on St. Jame's Hospital and governed by a body jointly made up of equal representation from University College and Trinity College. This suggestion comes from a report which was furnished about two years ago by a group representing the four university colleges in the Republic. This group, which incidentally had no medical person on it, met at the request of the Senate of the National University of Ireland. Its meetings were concluded, as far as I remember, in quite a short time, a matter of a month or five weeks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Jessop</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, three months then. Out of the two years in which this matter was being considered it was a very rapid piece of work. There was an opportunity for an <i>ad hoc</i> group, which was composed mostly of the deans of the medical schools, to consider certain suggestions. We met twice to consider these suggestions, for most of one day and on the following morning.  There was no opportunity for us to reflect on these suggestions, to consult our colleagues, or to make any <Col N="142" /> other kind of assessment of the situation that was presented to us.</P>
      <P>In the report that that group, representing the four colleges, furnished to the Higher Education Authority, it is suggested that this solution to the difficulty originated. I regard this as being a solution which will be a relatively expensive one. There is the impression abroad that the clinical section of medical education is enormously expensive and that the duplication of extensive clinical departments in medical schools would ruin the country. This is a misunderstanding of what is meant by a clinical department in a medical school.</P>
      <P>A clinical department in a medical school must be based in a good hospital.  In most of the good teaching hospitals in the country attached to medical schools there are expensive specialised units. These expensive specialised units exist primarily for the care of patients and not for the purpose of medical teaching. They can be enormously expensive and the duplication of them in a country such as this would be ruinous. In fact, the Minister for Health has taken precautions in the Health Act, 1970, against this. He has got authority to set up a hospitals council, Comhairle na nOspidéal, which will rationalise the specialisation to ensure that duplication does not occur in future, that we have a distribution of specialities between certain hospitals so that various areas of the country and the country as a whole have a proper spread of specialisation without expensive duplication.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Compare that with what is meant by a clinical department in a medical school. A clinical department in a medical school consists of certain teachers, their offices and the laboratories which they use for teaching or, more likely, for research. During the last year or so I have had occasion to compare the cost of the clinical departments of the Trinity College medical school with an Arts department.  I found that if I take the combined cost of the five clinical departments of the Trinity College medical school&mdash;medicine, surgery, paediatrics, psychiatry and obstetrics&mdash;it is only marginally more than the cost of one <Col N="143" /> fairly typical Arts department. Everybody knows the Arts departments are the least expensive departments in the college as far as equipment and so on are concerned. If I took the department of biochemistry as a typical pre-clinical department the position would be that the cost of all the clinical departments put together would only be a fraction&mdash;I would think perhaps 30 per cent or 40 per cent&mdash;of the cost of running that single biochemistry department. I mention this to make it clear to the Minister that the duplication of pre-clinical departments in order to justify a single clinical school is something which cannot be justified on financial grounds.</P>
    <P>There are, of course, other difficulties which are likely to arise. As I have the Minister for Finance here I shall talk about finance. If I had the Minister for Education here I would tell him that trying to run a course which would be integrated longitudinally throughout, when you have the departments of the pre-clinical sections run by two independent universities and students going from them to a clinical section over which each university has only a partially controlling voice, is going to produce educational difficulties of a very serious nature. However, I want to stick to the financial side here because it is something on which there is likely to be some confusion.</P>
    <P>One may ask why are the clinical departments in the hospitals so cheap to run. There are several reasons. First of all the principal &ldquo;material&rdquo; the clinical teacher uses for the teaching of his students is the patients in hospitals.  Of course, that does not cost the medical school anything; the patients are there for treatment and their doctors demonstrate the situation to the students. It is a very economical way of teaching. Furthermore, as far as the teaching is concerned, a large number of the teachers are doctors in hospitals. They get quite well paid by the hospitals so the college merely makes a relatively small contribution, perhaps a few hundred pounds a year, towards their income in recompense for their teaching activities.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="144" /> There are, of course, laboratories in properly equipped professional units. Some of the equipment of laboratories is expensive but the extent of this is marginal compared with the corresponding commitment of a full-scale department such as biochemistry or physiology, and if you go back into the basic sciences of chemistry or physics it is of a different order. The proper solution is along the original Government decision for one medical school. In one medical school the body controlling it would have complete authority to organise the distribution of expenses and keep a proper balance between the pre-clinical and clinical departments.</P>
    <P>Under education, I want to refer very briefly to the question of community schools. Again this is something with which the Minister for Education would be more directly concerned than the Minister for Finance. I do not view with any degree of complacency the steps being taken by the Minister for Education to set up community schools and to replace the previous vocational schools by community schools under a different form of control.  It has been said that community schools have been used almost entirely by people belonging to the majority religion, by the Catholic boys and girls of this country, and that the Protestant section has no real cause for complaint. We are only 4 per cent to 5 per cent of the total population and I do not know what percentage of Protestants there would be among the pupils who have been attending vocational schools in the past. I have a family of four and one of them went to a vocational school in Dublin, but I am probably not very typical.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, I think that where we have the present set-up and when we have to look forward to trying to integrate the North of Ireland, to bring them into a closer association with us, to take large schools which were, basically, non-sectarian, non-denominational in their structure and in the structure of their governing bodies, and replace them by schools which have a definite association with a particular religious denomination, would be unfortunate.</P>
    <P>I have referred on previous occasions <Col N="145" /> in this debate to research. My particular interest of course is medical research but I am not going to plough that furrow very deeply again. The Minister was here when I mentioned it last year. I should just like to say that the Medical Research Council is running into debt now. It will be considerably in debt at the end of this year if something is not done to relieve the financial situation. This is forecast in the current report of the Medical Research Council, the foreword of which I wrote for the council. The position will be very difficult unless we can get some help. Of course, at present the Minister for Finance does not give us any money at all. We get our funds from the Minister for Health and from the Hospitals Trust proceeds.</P>
    <P>This leads me to observe that in the whole of this list here, from beginning to end of this second part at any rate, the word &ldquo;research&rdquo; is not mentioned at all. We all know that research is done at least in relation to certain of these Government Departments. Excellent research work is done by the Agricultural Institute, who get support from the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries. The Institute for Industrial Research and Standards do excellent work. The Institute for Higher Studies are predominantly a research institute under the Minister for Education. There are activities in all the universities which are, of course, pure research.</P>
    <P>It would be a salutary thing if many of these Government Departments had a research arm, a kind of research and development section which was mentioned specifically in this Appropriation list, so that everybody knew that the Department concerned were keeping the situation under review; were not just letting things drift and paying &ldquo;salaries and expenses&rdquo; and so on, for almost every item on this list. We should have some indication that the Department are actively engaged in reviewing the activities in the area over which the Minister is supposed to preside so that advances can be made, to ensure that inefficiencies are spotted and remedied and the best use possible is made of the contributions the country gives in the Appropriation Fund.</P>
    <P>This brings me to the end of what I <Col N="146" /> have to say. I look forward to hearing from the Minister what, if anything, happens in his mind or in the mind of any other Minister as a result of all we say here in this debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NevilleKeery" hpid="Mr. Keery Mr. Keery">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keery</NameTxt>
      <P>As Senator Jessop said, we have before us in this debate a very wide and extremely varied and interesting canvas. In speaking in previous years on the Appropriation Bill I have endeavoured, even though it has been a rather slender chain, to give some thread or theme to my comments on the work of particular Departments as administered under the funds which we are discussing in this debate. I am glad to say that the thread I have chosen this year for my remarks will bring further variety into the debate.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that the major characteristic of this year and the years immediately ahead of us is going to be change on an extremely large scale&mdash;change in the whole context of national affairs, possibly, by entry to the EEC, and a change in our stance and position in the world. Even though we are a small island on the periphery of Europe, nevertheless we cannot isolate ourselves from the major problems facing the whole world in the near future&mdash;problems of environment, problems caused by pollution and overpopulation.</P>
      <P>These are the major changes which are going to influence us in the years ahead. They are changes which hold enormous challenges for our country and for our people. They can only be met if the institutions responsible for meeting change&mdash;the institutions of the State, of Government, of Parliament and the other representative institutions in local government administration and the judiciary&mdash;are geared to meet the new challenges which we will face.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At any time of change, one must look out for the possible victims of change, people who, through no fault of their own, may be overtaken by events and suffer in some way. Again, apart from discussing the change itself, from discussing institutions, I hope at the end to pay some attention to the problems of weaker sections in our community. These are the problems <Col N="147" /> of the poor, the unemployed, the problems of those on the housing lists of authorities throughout the country; indeed, more basically, minority problems, problems of human rights which will face the various minorities in our community. That is the framework in which I wish to make my remarks.</P>
    <P>I will begin, looking at this future context in which we must work, by looking beyond the way in which the EEC debate has been conducted. So far, when people debate the EEC, they talk in very basic economic terms about what it means for our industries and industrial employment, what it means for our agriculture and what the problems may be in relation to specific matters such as the purchase of land by foreigners. Although this is very important in bread and butter terms, it is a rather pedestrian and unimaginative way to look at the challenge which faces us.</P>
    <P>The European Economic Community, particularly as it develops in the future, will be a major force in the whole world. It will be the largest trading group in the world. Again it will be a trading group which will link together for the first time countries like Britain and France&mdash;countries which have been traditionally hostile, countries which have had empires which went their separate ways. The Europe of the future will be a major force in the world, with the power to influence that world for good.</P>
    <P>We will be members of that Community, on an equal footing in the major deliberative institutions of that Community, with those great countries like Britain and France, Germany, Italy and so on. In the Council of Ministers, Ireland will have an equal voice with those countries. That is no small thing. As a country which has a proud and valuable record in its previous contributions to international assemblies and international institutions that presents a major opportunity and challenge for us. We must be prepared to make sure that our voice is heard in those communities in a constructive way which will help to build Europe as a power, which will not only benefit all its citizens equally but spread <Col N="148" /> its benefits out into the former colonies which now, so badly, need the help of the world's developed countries. There is a real challenge here if we can only grasp it and if we can teach ourselves to think in the way international statesmen should think and should approach matters of international relations. This is something that people tend to ignore.</P>
    <P>Certainly there is not a great deal of interest in the actual machinery of international relations in our newspapers and television coverage, for example. Our present Minister for Foreign Affairs has made a major contribution to his Department, not only in negotiating the terms of Ireland's accession to the European Economic Community but also in changing the stance of that Department in their contributions to foreign affairs generally, and particularly in our role at the United Nations. As this is something which often has had unfavourable criticism in the immediate past, I should like to draw the attention of those critics and the attention of our community generally to what seems to me important policy changes which Deputy Dr. Hillery has brought to the Department of Foreign Affairs. May I say that I think he has done it in the spirit that General de Gaulle, for example, looked for in small nations. He said small States should throw their spiritual weight about. That is what we should be doing in matters of international relations. I certainly thought it was extremely encouraging when another living French statesman, Maurice Schumann, the French Foreign Minister, came to Dublin in October last. He pointed out that in his view Ireland as a militarily neutral country inside the EEC could maintain that neutrality and make an extremely important contribution to the political future of the Community.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NevilleKeery" hpid="Mr. Keery Mr. Keery">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keery</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the tea adjournment I was talking about the need for us to realise when we become a member of an enlarged European Community that there are tremendous implications <Col N="149" /> in that step and that, even though in terms of gross national product and population we are a small country, we can have a tremendous role in influencing the future development of Europe and, indeed, of international relations generally if we have a proper awareness of our political responsibilities inside the enlarged European Community. I was anxious to open then in more detail in discussing this motion by pointing to what is, to my mind, the re-establishment of an outward-looking foreign policy in the Department of Foreign Affairs, a policy which seems to me to be correctly conscious of the aspirations of the Third World and, indeed, of the remaining colonial countries, a policy also dedicated to the rule of law and recognising the importance of individual freedoms and human rights throughout the world, and also a policy anxious to speak out against the continued escalation of the arms race and militarism everywhere.</P>
      <P>The points in the recent actions of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and his Department which I should like to mention go back to, I think, 1970, when Ireland alone of the countries of Western Europe voted in support of the declaration on the rights and freedoms of colonial people at the United Nations, and re-established its position in relation to the remaining colonial countries. That slight change of stance back to what I think was in former years a radical stand in foreign affairs was also reflected in the Government's decision to cancel at that time a trade mission to South Africa. I certainly welcomed this re-establishment of a very positive and definite stance in foreign affairs. I am glad to say that in the past year that stance has been carried on very creditably at the United Nations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to point, for example, to the disarmament field and the field of nuclear weapons where again, under Deputy Aiken's leadership, we established a very responsible and constructive voice on matters of this kind. I, for one, was extremely saddened when the American underground nuclear test on Amchitka Island in the Pacific took place last autumn. When it was headline news we heard about <Col N="150" /> the protests made by Japan and by Finland against this serious underground nuclear test. In fact, on that occasion the media were advised that the Irish Ambassador in Washington visited the State Department to express Irish concern in this matter, because some Irish scientists, like scientists all over the world, were seriously concerned at the possible dangers of this underground nuclear test in an area of substantial seismic activity off the coast of Alaska.</P>
    <P>People may then say: &ldquo;Oh, that is just another odd sign of this fashionable anti-Americanism.&rdquo; At least I will say this for America in international affairs: Because, relatively speaking, it is a free and open society we hear about the planning and proposals for American tests and we have an opportunity to study the documents and the material on which the decision to go ahead with such tests is based. Where the Soviet Union and China are concerned we do not hear in advance of the tests and it is only due to outside monitoring of them that we know that such tests have taken place. As someone who is most concerned about the American test, I now want to go on record as saying that I condemn equally the subsequent Russian underground test and, worse still, the test that took place recently in the atmosphere in China.</P>
    <P>On that point, may I again remind this House that another indication of our changed and progressive stance in foreign affairs was our decision to support the admission of China to the United Nations. The fact that subsequently a nuclear explosion has taken place in China underlines the importance of having a Chinese presence at the United Nations, because China is a nuclear power and, when the problems of nuclear power are discussed, it is absolutely vital that China should be fully involved in those discussions in the world's premier international forum. I certainly welcome Ireland's vote in bringing about the admission of China to the United Nations.</P>
    <P>Since the admission of China to the United Nations and since Ireland's expression of concern about the American underground nuclear test, last month the Irish representative, speaking <Col N="151" /> on a draft resolution dealing with matters of disarmament at the United Nations, again stressed the importance of keeping public opinion throughout the world informed of the problems of the arms race and disarmament and, indeed, pressed for conferences of experts to lead to further studies of this crucial area affecting us all. He stressed the need for further research in universities and academic institutions in all countries which might lead to findings which would help us understand the full ramifications of the arms race, and help us to find ways of reducing this awful pressure of militarism without subsequent major political or economic disruption.</P>
    <P>I should like to see our contribution there backed up at home, as part of this process of educating Irish people in the importance of international affairs and international problems of this kind by, perhaps, Government support for some kind of independent institute of international affairs or, indeed, for courses on international relations in our universities. As our involvement in international relations and international affairs grows, the pressure on the staff in our Department of Foreign Affairs will increase, and it is a small and hard-pressed staff at the moment. There will be a need for some outside body with the time and facilities to carry out research and studies in important areas of international relations. This could be a major force in informing public opinion about the implications of our future greater involvement in international affairs and, even if it does not turn out to be a matter of prime governmental concern, perhaps some independent organisations or foundations will see the need and in recognising it establish a body that will be of great assistance to us all in the future.</P>
    <P>In this same area I am glad to note as we enter Europe that the Department of Foreign Affairs have already indicated Ireland's commitment to the process of <i>détente</i> in Western Europe and that Ireland welcomes the European Security Conference which I hope will take place shortly embracing all the countries of Europe and leading to a realistic appraisal of the <Col N="152" /> security position in Western Europe as a whole.</P>
    <P>In his last contribution to the General Assembly at the United Nations the Minister for Foreign Affairs looked forward to the major United Nations Stockholm Conference on human environment, which is to take place later this year. We have been through one conservation year, with not as much success as I had hoped for and now that the nations of the world at the United Nations are indicating the great political and urgent pressing international importance of problems of environment, of pollution, population control, and so on I hope that this message will finally communicate itself to all responsible Governments throughout the world and that urgent steps will be taken to combat threats to our environment.</P>
    <P>Here at home there is nothing complex or mysterious about tackling the problem of pollution. It is simply a matter of the will to tackle the problem and of recognising the priority and making financial provision for it and of bringing together in one administrative unit the powers to deal with this situation. We have been too hesitant about making practical and realistic regulations and controls to deal with pollution. We have fought shy of making the generous, forward-looking financial commitment to deal with pollution. I am very disappointed that, on the institutional side, matters of conservation are still spread over too many Departments and that legislation on matters related to pollution and conservation has been far too long delayed. I hope that our participation in the Stockholm Conference on the human environment and a constructive contribution by Ireland there will simply be the outward international sign of a commitment to political action at home.</P>
    <P>Another important aspect of the work of the United Nations which is often treated in an uninformed way, and something which could be used much more to assist this country in dealing with its problems, is the role of the United Nations in the field of human rights internationally. The present institutions and machinery at the United Nations for dealing with <Col N="153" /> problems of human rights are largely formal, and are quite inadequate to deal in any proper or direct way with breaches of conventions of human rights in any particular country. We will see no major advance in this field until the United Nations appoints an actual human rights commissioner with a brief and with the responsibility to investigate and follow up any complaints made to the United Nations. I am glad to say that the Irish Government have been supporting at the UN every proposal aimed at leading towards the establishment of this important post.</P>
    <P>Having said this, I do not underestimate the educational value of documents such as the United Nations declaration on human rights and the various conventions on human rights. It would help somewhat towards the long-term solution of many of our national problems if our community as a whole had a much greater appreciation of the international aspirations in the field of human rights. For example, I would be very glad if the Government provided a copy of the United Nations declaration on human rights to be placed on the wall of every school beside the Proclamation of the Republic. Something of this kind could be a contribution towards building up in our community an appreciation of the problems and difficulties of human rights which, in the long term, will be crucial in relation to community harmony on this island of ours.</P>
    <P>There are many facilities available through UNESCO which has a secretariat in our Department of Education. I should like to see that secretariat taking a more positive approach and encouraging many more schools to take part in the various UNESCO projects aimed at educating children in matters of human rights and particularly educating them so that they will have an understanding of what is involved in the tragedy of racial discrimination and matters of that kind. I take this opportunity to make this point in a general educational context and also to remind people, as we are moving into a new international forum, that under the leadership of the present Government and particularly with Dr. Hillery in the <Col N="154" /> Department of Foreign Affairs, we are seeing a new live approach and appreciation of the future that lies ahead of us in this field.</P>
    <P>When talking about the changes and the new horizons which face us it is important that our institutions should be prepared to deal with these new horizons and to cope with any problems or discussions that might arise in this context. We will have an opportunity to deal with this sort of topic in the near future when discussing the Bill in connection with the Referendum which will be necessary to change the Constitution to facilitate entry to the EEC. We must look to a future when this Legislature will have to cope with Government policy as it will be expressed in decisions of the Council of Ministers and the EEC. It should be a major spur to consideration of parliamentary reform to ask ourselves are we, as a Legislature, equipped to scrutinise adequately the activities of the Government inside the EEC?</P>
    <P>I for one was glad of the opportunity provided by the setting up of the committee on the reform of Dáil procedure to make certain proposals to that committee and to ask them to look into this matter of the implications of participation in the European Parliament by Deputies and Senators, and of the implications of Oireachtas control of decision-making in regard to the EEC in the course of their examination of parliamentary reform. This is a priority. I regret that this committee's brief appears to cover only the reform of Dáil procedure because I do not understand how, in any examination of the Oireachtas, one can separate the Dáil from the Seanad. I would hope we may see a further widening of this examination and have an early report from the committee.</P>
    <P>Another item in this present year which may emerge to cast some light on the business of parliamentary reform is the work of the review body on higher remuneration in the public sector. This review body which is at present looking at the salaries of&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair is not sure that the question of parliamentary reform has any relation to Government administration. In so far <Col N="155" /> as the working of Parliament may be affected by Government action, that is all right, but I think parliamentary reform, as such, hardly comes under this motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NevilleKeery" hpid="Mr. Keery Mr. Keery">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keery</NameTxt>
      <P>I trust that the Chair will appreciate that the work of the committee on the reform of Dáil procedure and this review body on higher remuneration in the public sector and their secretariat are directly financed from funds made available under the Appropriation Bill. I would have thought that in this way their work and activities were relevant to the matter under discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>It may well be that their work and activities can be made relevant to the matter under discussion.  I hope the Senator will make them relevant. In other words, a discussion limited to potential Dáil or Seanad reform would not be relevant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NevilleKeery" hpid="Mr. Keery Mr. Keery">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keery</NameTxt>
      <P>I have noticed that it has been taken to be relevant that discussion of general economic policy is appropriate on this motion. I was just going on to point out that any report from this review body on higher remuneration in the public sector could have important repercussions in the field of economic policy. As the Chair will be aware, we had a report some time ago from the Economic and Social Research Institute which showed that popular understanding of an increase at that time in the salaries of Deputies and Senators had an effect on the public attitude towards inflation.  I anticipate that there may well be a report from this review body in the course of the present year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would hope that that report will recommend a major increase in the salaries of Deputies and Senators. If we are ever to combat the existing cynicism about our parliamentary institutions, and if we are to make sure that we have committed full-time legislators of the calibre which our people will demand and require in the much more complex future which I have described in the opening part of my speech, it is absolutely vital that we have adequate and appropriate salaries <Col N="156" /> for our legislators. I am making this point because now is the time for parliamentarians and particularly for trade unions&mdash;and I am glad we have trade unionists as Members of this Legislature&mdash;to begin to prepare the public and the community generally for acceptance of the need for increased salaries for our legislators. I would also hope that the review body would make a recommendation which would allow for the regular increase from that point on of the salaries of Deputies and Senators in line with the cost of living because, unless we have some general clause of that kind, we will have the old story of constantly postponed increases in salaries for Deputies and Senators leading to irregular major increases which could, unfortunately, lead to a popular attitude toward inflation which could be detrimental to the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Senator will pass from this topic at this point because it would involve legislation which may not be advocated on this motion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NevilleKeery" hpid="Mr. Keery Mr. Keery">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keery</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelYeats" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NevilleKeery" hpid="Mr. Keery Mr. Keery">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keery</NameTxt>
      <P>I was advocating a recommendation. If I could move from talking about the institutions of Parliament to talking about the actual administration and the preparation of the administration to deal with the problems which will be faced in the years ahead, I should like to refer briefly to a Bill which has already been circulated, the Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries (Amendment) Bill, 1971. This Bill is aimed at implementing some of the proposals of the Devlin Report on our public service. It is aimed at establishing a Public Service Department and setting up a public service advisory council. I do not think there will be much controversy about this Bill. By and large it will be acceptable to all parties. I have not heard any criticism of it. For <Col N="157" /> that reason I hope it will be taken as soon as possible. I very much regret any delay in taking this Bill. I realise that there have been problems of time in dealing with it. The public service is urgently in need of change and adaptation to meet modern requirements.  Should there be any delay in providing a proper framework for this, the civil servants will tend to take their own initiatives which may create new problems and make it more difficult for this legislation to be effective when it is dealt with.</P>
      <P>Senator Russell dealt with other aspects of administrative reform in discussing the White Paper on local government reorganisation. To my mind he has the same blindness about that White Paper that I have found in members of his party in the local authority area with which I am most familiar, namely, the Dún Laoghaire borough council area. It seems to me &mdash;and I do not know for what particular reason though I suspect in my own area it is purely for crass political reasons&mdash;that the Fine Gael Party are quite blind to what is contained in several chapters of that White Paper and, indeed, to what the Minister has made crystal clear to all the local authorities in the Dublin area in the letter he sent to each of them following his meeting with the bodies concerned.</P>
      <P>The White Paper on local government, as I understand it, does not amount to more centralisation. What it does amount to is dividing in a much clearer way than heretofore the two important roles of local authority work, namely, on the one hand, largescale planning and long-term development, the sort of thing that can only be thought about and dealt with on a broad regional basis, and the actual administration of particular areas, the actual business of dealing with the human problems of people in as intimate a way as possible, more directly on a much smaller area basis. The White Paper adequately covers this matter and the two roles of local government are quite clearly separated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have said time and again that I look forward to the day when local government will move closer to the people, when there will be local area <Col N="158" /> offices to which people can readily go and when there will be local community councils. They may be, as some people allege, talking shops but, nevertheless, they provide a genuine local opportunity for all people, whether in voluntary organisations or otherwise, to have a voice and a say in the coordination of the services in their area and in the important local problems of community development, community facilities and so on. It seems quite clear that it is the Minister's intention in the Dublin area that there should be a Dublin area council to deal with the broad, long-term matters of planning&mdash;and, goodness knows, coordination is needed in the Dublin area&mdash;and that there should then be the more local direct grassroots job of meeting straightforward bread-and-butter community problems which would be dealt with by area committees and local community councils served by small area officers. That to me is decentralisation, not centralisation.  As regards the Dublin area, I am very glad to welcome the approach in this White Paper towards preparing local administration to deal with problems in future.</P>
    <P>I should like to say a few words on some of the issues raised by other Senators and particularly regarding employment. First of all, there was some criticism of the Taoiseach as being soft-spoken and trying to create the impression that problems of employment were everyone's responsibility rather than the responsibility of the Government. I should like to reject that type of allegation completely and to point out that anybody who understands how a complicated economy works at the present time must realise that the events which take place in an economy are a combination of the contributions made by a wide variety of people and that economic prosperity is a matter of partnership in which everyone is involved.</P>
    <P>I should like to remind Senators&mdash; and I think it is one of the signs of the excellent Seanad we have at present&mdash; that we had a debate in this House in June, 1970, on the Report on Full Employment produced by the NIEC. We were ahead of our time in a sense in dealing with this topic which is now <Col N="159" /> so popular. I should like to remind the House of some of the points I raised on that debate. I pointed out&mdash;and again I am not quoting the Taoiseach, I am quoting detached academic observers such as R. C. Geary and J. G. Hughes&mdash;that in paper No. 52 published by the Economic and Social Research Institute they looked at the problems of full employment and commented on the NIEC report. They were of the opinion that the NIEC had probably underestimated the situation facing the country and that even what would seem to be a modest target of an annual rate of increase in real GNP of 5.5 per cent was unlikely to be sustained over a 15 year period. That was the rate of growth they envisaged over that period of time as being necessary to bring about full employment. They had a footnote to their paper which I quoted at that time. It said:</P>
    <P>If, to achieve full employment, Irish people would be prepared to sacrifice a part of the increase in their standard of living otherwise attainable, full employment might transpire at a much lower rate than 5.5 per cent per annum.</P>
    <P>The tragedy is that everything that has happened since the publication of the NIEC report has made the prospect of full employment more remote because people are not prepared for sacrifice and are not prepared to face up to the challenge and realise the contribution which they can make towards solving the problem.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that our future depends on building up manufacturing industry in order to step up our growth rate in the years that lie ahead. In view of some of the things that have been said in this House&mdash;and, of course, memories are short and conveniently short where Opposition politicians are concerned&mdash;I should like to remind Senators that between 1969 and 1971, for example, the decline of 22,000 in the numbers at work in agriculture was offset exactly by increases of 14,000 in industrial employment and 8,000 in the services sector. This was almost in line with what had been the much earlier NIEC manpower projections <Col N="160" /> that 11,000 extra jobs would be required annually in order to achieve full employment by 1981.</P>
    <P>We know we have been falling behind in this regard and that there are difficulties. Nevertheless, at a time when people have been wailing I should like to remind the House, and Senator O'Higgins in particular, of the report by Mr. Michael Killeen, manager of the Industrial Development Authority, which was his new year message on 1st January. He pointed out that 7,500 to 8,000 jobs had been provided in the year 1971 in new manufacturing industry, giving a net growth in manufacturing employment of approximately 3,000 jobs after deducting, of course, the record 4,500 to 5,000 redundancies. Put that achievement in its international context and what do you find? You find that Ireland is singled out as one of the few countries in Europe or elsewhere to have shown an upward trend in manufacturing employment during 1971.</P>
    <P>I am sorry that Senator O'Higgins was not in the House this afternoon to hear his colleague, Senator Russell, pointing to the increase in exports during the last year and accepting generally that our economy is basically sound and has a future potential.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Senator suggesting that I denied that?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NevilleKeery" hpid="Mr. Keery Mr. Keery">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keery</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator certainly succeeded in giving that impression.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The economy is fundamentally sound but I do not go along with the idea the Senator seems to be endeavouring to propagate that there is not an unemployment problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NevilleKeery" hpid="Mr. Keery Mr. Keery">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keery</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not endeavouring to propagate any such views but I might remind Senator O'Higgins of something which he said last night. He read out, from paragraph 26 of the Third Programme for Economic and Social Development, the following sentence:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government's aim is that the end of the programme period will see Ireland economically much stronger, socially more concerned and <Col N="161" /> psychologically more prepared for membership of the European Community of Nations.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Higgins rejected that statement out of hand as being nonsense and completely false.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Not at all. The point I was making was that that was the Government's aim and they have fallen down on that aim.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NevilleKeery" hpid="Mr. Keery Mr. Keery">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keery</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Pay more attention to what I say in future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NevilleKeery" hpid="Mr. Keery Mr. Keery">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keery</NameTxt>
      <P>I think, through the Chair, that that underlines the difference between myself and Senator O'Higgins because it implies clearly that he does not think that Ireland, at present, is economically much stronger than it was three years ago. I do not see how he can get out of that unless he is admitting that there was some kind of self-contradiction in what he said last night. If that is the case, he is absolutely wrong. Our future depends on being more competitive. Everyone admits that there will be casualties in Irish industry in the process of free trade. It is vital to remember that even when faced with redundancy and unemployment problems our economic base is much stronger than it was, because every day the stronger industries are becoming even stronger and every day other industries are becoming better and better geared to the new situations which will face them. It is in that sense that Senator O'Higgins was absolutely wrong and misleading when he tried to give the impression that in some way the economy was not much stronger than it was at the start of the Third Programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the same way, it directly follows from what Senator O'Higgins said he rejected the idea that our community at the moment was socially more concerned than it was at the start of the Third Programme. Again, I should like to remind him of some of the steps that have already been taken to deal with the type of situation he was talking about. We have seen social welfare benefits increased in successive <Col N="162" /> Budgets; we have seen the legislation dealing with redundancy payments, and indeed, more recently, we have read of the proposed introduction of a new scheme of wage-related benefits to deal with unemployment and so on.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>Another adoption of Fine Gael policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NevilleKeery" hpid="Mr. Keery Mr. Keery">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keery</NameTxt>
      <P>Never mind whose policy one may look at. The job of the Government in power is to take what is best in a realistic way to meet present economic problems. This present Government, to my mind, have been doing it in a continuous and constructive way and their record demonstrates the social concern which Senator O'Higgins has denied exists.</P>
      <P>I shall move on somewhat from that point to talk a little about some of the people who are likely to be casualties of the process of change and development in our society. I am certainly aware that, despite the increases in benefits and despite the concern, poverty in a real sense exists in our community. I was very interested to attend the Conference on Poverty in Ireland, organised by a Committee of the Irish Hierarchy in the autumn. I am glad to say, of course, that representatives of the Department of Social Welfare attended that conference as did the representatives of other Departments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a problem of poverty that will require our attention in the future. Particularly, as we develop to meet free trade and the resultant industrial problems, we must be aware of the need for further increases in social welfare benefits. We need to look constantly at the relationship between different classes in our community. Because of the way we organise our social welfare services at present, poverty can often be obscured for a number of reasons. Means tests can be extremely complicated and may overlap in peculiar ways. In the same way, income tax and other taxes can hit people in different ways. For example, due to a combination of means tests and taxation, at a time of wage increases, at a time of increased family or social welfare payments, or at a time when there is a <Col N="163" /> change of the levels of entitlement to different benefits, certain categories of the community could be left out of the general pattern of prosperity, thus giving us a new kind of poor.</P>
    <P>This is an extremely complicated matter, one that requires careful examination and research by all the Departments concerned, particularly those involved with taxation and social welfare benefits, to make sure that when we do have increased prosperity and progress it is genuinely spread in a fair way throughout the community. We have to ensure that the needs of families are considered first; that we do not have a situation where, for example, benefits or wage increases go entirely to single people, people without the same responsibilities.  We must ensure that certain types of wage earners do not, perhaps, suddenly stride ahead at the expense of everyone else.</P>
    <P>It is for this reason that I was very disappointed in the contribution made last night by Senator Kennedy. Certainly trade unionists in Britain, for example, are very much aware of this type of problem. There is quite a lot of discussion going on there at the moment concerning ideas like the relation of increased social welfare benefits to any increase in earnings which a union may be seeking. In other words, in trade union circles they are aware, as any Government should be aware, of the responsibility to see that the lower paid man has first call in any wage demand.  He is the man who needs to be lifted most. I do not pretend for one moment that they have mastered this problem in Britain or elsewhere. I was very disappointed to detect in Senator Kennedy's speech the feeling that he was not prepared to admit to the responsibility which trade unionists have in this field. He gave me the impression that it was for the Government to do all this type of adjustment and to recognise this type of problem. Of course it is an important Government responsibility, but the Government cannot deal with the matter without the co-operation of the trade unions. In a number of recent wage rounds the lower paid workers have rather tragically and disastrously gone to the wall <Col N="164" /> at the expense of certain rather powerful sections in our community.</P>
    <P>Another type of casualty that I am very concerned about in our society is the sort of person who is on a local authority waiting list for housing, particularly in the Dublin area. This is another problem, which again I spoke about at length on the Housing Bill, 1970, in this House. While steps are being taken to deal with the matter I do not think it has been entirely solved. If I could relate this matter to the points I was making earlier, I think we have a situation now where many young white collar people, who might in some past years, have had a reasonable expectation of providing housing for themselves, now, because of inflation and disastrous increases in the cost of housing, find it extremely difficult, particularly in the Dublin area, to do so. This still remains a matter of urgent Government priority.</P>
    <P>I am not claiming the credit but I am certainly glad to say that some of the points I made in July, 1970, seem to be followed up in some of the policies of the Department of Local Government. I refer particularly to the model bye-laws recently circulated to help &ldquo;deal with the problem arising for families living in multiple dwellings&rdquo;; more particularly I would like to refer to the announcement last November of the Minister for Local Government's plan to use a special type of dwelling with a shorter life span than normal, a dwelling designed by the National Building Agency to try to cope on a much larger scale than usual with the problems of certain smaller families, particularly in the Dublin area. I would like to repeat a point that I made in 1970. I cannot understand that at a time of such technological advances we have not seen much greater technological advances in the building industry. It must surely be profitable for modern science to devise cheaper methods of providing housing for the community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesDooge" hpid="Professor Dooge Professor Dooge">
      <NameTxt>Professor Dooge</NameTxt>
      <P>It has done so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NevilleKeery" hpid="Mr. Keery Mr. Keery">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keery</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming to that point. It has been done to some extent although I am just quoting from a newspaper rather than from a journal <Col N="165" /> and I have no familiarity with the technical advance myself. Certainly in <i>The Irish Press</i> of 29th December, 1971, there was a heading &ldquo;Era of Test-Tube Houses&rdquo; with a report of what seems to be some sort of technical breakthrough in the United States aimed at dealing with their massive housing problem. I certainly hope that this is the sort of development we will look at very urgently because we are probably far shorter of capital than the United States and it is a much more pressing problem for us. If in the United States with their technological background they have at last made a breakthrough in this regard I hope that with all possible speed we will get hold of this new breakthrough and use this to step up our housing programme on a very large scale.</P>
      <P>In talking about various categories of difficulties created by change in our society I said I would conclude by mentioning what I call some minority problems of human rights at home. It is very important to realise that in dealing with problems of human rights at home we tend to think of them&mdash; particularly at the moment because of the difficulties in the North&mdash;solely in terms of Catholic and Protestant, Unionist and Republican in this island of ours. But there are all sorts of minority problems in our society. Some of our people living in the Gaeltacht, for example, believe they are a minority with a particular problem. There are other people who believe they are the victims of other kinds of discrimination based on attitudes of snobbery and so on. I would simply like to finish with the point that it seems to me that major advances in all sorts of social problems, and not just in our pressing national problem of creating a united harmonious community on this island, depend on our having a proper attitude towards the future and depend on our having an understanding of what is involved in living with our neighbours, whether they are of a different religion, of a different colour or speaking a language which is different to ours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is the attitude which is absolutely crucial. Although in a superficial <Col N="166" /> sense in the Republic at the moment the attitude of the whole body politic is an attitude of republicanism in the sense that there is a very substantial groundswell that is looking for the reunification of our country now, I do not believe that attitude is matched by a real understanding of what is involved.  For example, it seems to me that many of the people who have this republican feeling may well be devout Roman Catholics with very strong ideas on matters like divorce and contraception.  It seems to me that whatever the future of Ireland may be, certainly a united Ireland of the future will have to be a community in which, for example, divorce is possible. I would simply ask people who have an attitude which says to them we cannot permit divorce in our country on any terms to set that attitude parallel with their republican attitude, their attitude in which they would like to see a united Ireland and ask themselves are these two views compatible. We must get the necessary adjustment of attitudes, the necessary acceptance that everyone on this island is going to have to change his attitude, change his outlook in some way, if we are going to advance. I certainly regard present political developments as extremely important in the moves being taken by the Government to get under way inter-Party discussions which will have to consider questions of this kind in the Republic. In a rather complicated pattern of events, a pattern in which, as Senator Jessop has indicated, it is very difficult to see any solution or any advance the advance of these inter-Party discussions is just one piece in a jig-saw but a piece that coming together with a whole lot of other pieces may represent an important step towards the solution of our great national problem and national difficulty.</P>
    <P>On that note I would like to conclude and simply remind Senators again of my general plea that we are facing times of change. Our institutions must be prepared for that change. We must be aware of the problems which are likely to be created by change and be flexible enough ourselves in our attitudes to meet any eventuality that may lie ahead.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>In common with the other Senators I welcome this opportunity for a general look at the activities of Government Departments as provided by the motion put down by the Leader of the House. It is a development to be welcomed that this opportunity is provided in this way. For the past three years or so we had the very frustrating experience of finding this debate sandwiched in between our Christmas cards. The newspapers gave it the coverage that you might expect to get at Christmas. In other words, words of sound and fury were spoken here and as far as the newspapers went they signified nothing. However, January being a slack month for news I am delighted to see the coverage that was given to this debate yesterday. I hope the newspapers will continue the good work over the next two days of the debate.</P>
      <P>Now that we have taken this step of accepting a motion to initiate a discussion of this type rather than await the formal presentation of the Appropriation Bill we should adopt this policy in future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Up to four years ago the arrangements were much more satisfactory than they have been since in that the Appropriation Bill always came before the House in July, at a time when the Budget was still fresh in the minds of the people and therefore the dissatisfaction with various appropriations could be voiced at a time when it meant something to the people, and also when there was a chance, perhaps, of influencing the following Budget. That was changed when the Order of Business in the Dáil dealing with the Estimates was changed and the Appropriation Bill was taken in December. I would suggest to the House that at the slack period of our year, in, say, next June, we might have a motion similar to the one now before the House to deal with what will be covered in the forthcoming Book of Estimates. Given that opportunity to discuss it, we would then give the Appropriation Bill just a formal reading and acceptance as we did last December. That would improve the opportunity for discussing Government administration at a time when a distinct contribution could be <Col N="168" /> made. I commend this to the House and hope that we may, through the Committee on Procedure and Privileges or otherwise, persuade the Leader of the House to adopt this approach next June.</P>
    <P>The motion before us presents a bewildering series of opportunities for a discussion on all facets of Government administration. The debate so far has ranged very widely over almost every facet. I wish to confine myself to about four or five facets. I will begin where I intended to end. Seeing that Senator Jessop is in the House I had better take up his strictures on the university proposals, which I think were less than generous in the spirit in which he gave them. The work of the two universities, NUI and TCD, the hard work put in over a solid three-month period at the beginning of 1960, was the most important work that was ever accomplished for the university system. For one thing, it brought harmony and it brought goodwill between the universities.  That legacy is there for any proposals and any reorganisation which we face in the future. As one privileged to be a member of the team taking part in this, I found it illuminating to see the distrust gradually disappearing and in its place to see being laid a solid foundation of mutual understanding, mutual acceptance, mutual co-operation and mutual sharing of the responsibilities for the future. That was what was accomplished and it was the most important thing we accomplished. The members of that committee, especially the chairman, Dr. M.D. McCarthy, have carved for themselves a very important place in the history of the development of Irish university education.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamJessop" hpid="Professor Jessop Professor Jessop">
      <NameTxt>Professor Jessop</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not question that at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>The solution arrived at may not have satisfied everyone, but, after all, any committee have to balance pros and cons. We had to balance the sharing of responsibilities in the best interests of the community as we saw them then. The fact that the proposals concerned were accepted afterwards by all the university <Col N="169" /> bodies concerned, by an overwhelming majority, is proof of the soundness of the proposals contained therein.</P>
      <P>I was especially surprised at some of the statements made by Senator Jessop on medical education because, after all, we were pretty well briefed on that right through. The statement in particular at which I saw the Minister for Finance pricking up his ears was the statement that clinical education and clinical medicine were relatively inexpensive, whereas any figures which we have seen showed this to be very expensive. The only comparison that can be made is obviously in relation to the cost of treating patients in a hospital that is not a university hospital, as contrasted with one that is a teaching hospital. These figures have been published in England and in the States and they show an enormous difference. In other words, treatment in a teaching hospital is, of necessity, superior to what the State, unfortunately, can afford to provide in the other hospitals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamJessop" hpid="Professor Jessop Professor Jessop">
      <NameTxt>Professor Jessop</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of fact, I drew attention to that fact. I said that that was treatment, it was not teaching; it was not part of the responsibility of the medical school. It was not what the medical school had to pay for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not matter what it has to pay for: it is what the taxpayer has to pay for that really matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamJessop" hpid="Professor Jessop Professor Jessop">
      <NameTxt>Professor Jessop</NameTxt>
      <P>He has to pay for that anyway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>If the taxpayer were suddenly to convert the Regional Hospital in Limerick into a teaching hospital and to provide in that hospital a professorial unit and the advanced diagnostic and research units and all the rest that should be provided in a teaching hospital, then there is absolutely no doubt that the cost of that hospital would double, or perhaps treble. That is not saying that the service provided there at present is not excellent and the best that can be provided, but equally we must face the fact that if it were a teaching hospital <Col N="170" /> it would have to be on a much more enlarged and a much more costly scale.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamJessop" hpid="Professor Jessop Professor Jessop">
      <NameTxt>Professor Jessop</NameTxt>
      <P>Again on a point of fact, Comhairle na nOispidéal are there specifically for the purpose of seeing that that does not happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickQuinlan" hpid="Professor Quinlan Professor Quinlan">
      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Anyway, in this we have been briefed as to size and so on and we have been briefed at all stages. I would just cite some of our own chief briefs&mdash;the Dean of the Medical Faculty in University College, Cork, the Professor of Surgery there and many others. I do not want it to be thought for one moment that we were without briefs, that we were acting in a slipshod way, or that we underestimated the problem in any way. Indeed, I cannot see for one moment why, in this fair city, such free clinical facilities as, say, the teaching of physics and chemistry, botany and biology to pre-medical students should be concentrated in one institution more than in another. I cannot see that there is any case an economist could make for any economy arising out of that. The places concerned will obviously have to have good departments of these subjects, as they have now. Likewise, biochemistry has always been one of the top departments in University College, Dublin. It was a department made famous and built by Professor E.J. Conway and is a lasting monument to him. Its work, teaching and research are not just for medical students. The products of its department, in biochemistry-trained people, may be found in almost all the science departments in University College, and in all the universities; in fact, they are to be found in the department of engineering in University College, Dublin. There is no question of that facility being in any way a duplication of the facility in Trinity College which has a first-class department in biochemistry.  That does not say there are not great opportunities for cross-registration at clinical level. Cross-registration would be an advantage in some subjects such as anatomy, physiology, <i>et cetera,</i> and a course might be given in one of the universities and carry credit in both.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have confidence that every sharing, <Col N="171" /> if it is academically beneficial, will go forward. I cannot see any insuperable difficulty in two pre-clinical medical schools coming together in the one clinical school. The co-ordination of these courses is a routine matter in, say, the United States, where the early pre-clinical work leads to a degree of Bachelor of Science in medical science. The holders of that degree go to medical schools wherever they can get an opening and, therefore, in every medical school you have incoming students to clinical medicine who are from quite different backgrounds but who have got the basic essentials and the basic requirements as laid down for the acquiring of the degree. It is no more difficult than having people coming to graduate school in other disciplines from various universities where they acquired bachelor degrees, often in slightly different areas.</P>
    <P>These are all matters which create no real problems today since we have mutual trust and goodwill. That is the foundation on which we build and I welcome the news that the HEA have now concluded their detailed examination of the proposals. My reading of the reports would indicate that the HEA have been sufficiently wise to capitalise on the foundations that were provided by the joint universities proposals. A positive advantage which has flowed from this joint agreement has been the very close co-operation in all matters connected with the university between the four university colleges since then. We are proud of what has been achieved and we offer it to the State in working out the final solution which we hope will not be long delayed.</P>
    <P>We in the university colleges are not quite as happy as Senator Jessop about the allocation of funds for last year. Our financial position is in a pretty bad way and the same applies to Galway University and, I understand, to both the Dublin colleges also. The increases in the grant have not in any way kept pace with the increase in numbers much less provided adequately for the devaluation involved. There has been no effort made to bridge the gap between our standards here and, <Col N="172" /> if you want a yardstick, Queen's University, Belfast, where the resources per student are twice what we have. That fact is known to the authorities here. It has been stressed time and time again in debates in Seanad Éireann and elsewhere. We got vague promises about bridging the gap but so far no effort has been made to do so.</P>
    <P>I hope it is not too late to appeal to the Minister for Finance to do something about this in the coming Budget. It is disheartening to those of us who believe in non-violence that the Government refused to make the necessary legitimate adjustment in the grants to students until the disturbances which took place in October. This was indefensible.  A student grant of £300 which was adequate three years ago was certainly not adequate in September, 1971, when, since the previous adjustment, the value of money had depreciated over 20 per cent.</P>
    <P>Why can a Government Department not show initiative and foresight and see that distributive justice is done rather than present the spectacle of being forced into giving justice by methods which we all deplore? The Minister for Education got quite angry at the suggestion that the student protest had any influence on his decision. If the decision had been arrived at to make the adjustment then it was very bad political sagacity not to have done it before the protest took place. There was ample time. The universities had been stressing since early July that they had no option but to increase student fees, otherwise they could not keep open as the banks were pressing. The Government had not in any way alleviated the position. Yet we were told by frantic telephone calls to wait for another week for a decision and this went on and on almost like Jimín Máire Thaidhg's asal. Surely the Government does not expect the presidents of the councils of the university colleges in furtherance of their grievances to take to the streets, or do we still believe in rational consultation?</P>
    <P>It is very important for the country that there should be adequate staffs in universities. Adequate staffs in universities mean that you will have available a pool of men who can be involved <Col N="173" /> in national and community problems on an advisory or a more active basis. All governments have to call on this type of advice and support from outside. I am not saying that it comes completely from the university sector anywhere. Business people, trade unionists, <i>et cetera</i>, have their roles to play in modern government, on committees, in an advisory fashion, and in secondment. The university is one of the vital factors in that and with the present low staffing we have in the universities it is impossible to contribute adequately in respect of those commitments. I should like to see the whole structure of our administration move far more along the lines of the Devlin Report and, indeed, away beyond that, to involve other viewpoints and other sectors of our national life in Government decision-making rather than keeping it confined as it is at present within Civil Service preserves.</P>
    <P>We are all deeply concerned with the employment situation for our young people. Those leaving secondary school have a difficult time. Those graduating from the universities have had it very difficult in the past year. The outlook for the coming year does not show any real improvement. It is aggravated by the fact that other countries are in a similar position. The English employment market is almost worse than our own; so also is the American market. On the one hand, that may be regarded as being to our advantage in that it turns the ideas and thoughts of young graduates towards the idea of working at home. The attractions are not there from the outside. I wonder are we conscious of the great opportunity this presents to us to seek every possible way of involving such graduates in our national development? The stage has been reached where the primary university degree has almost the role of the leaving certificate some 15 or 20 years ago. It is a certificate of a broad general education which should equip the holder to tackle a wide variety of jobs. In the past, people holding the leaving certificate were not put into any special classification. They entered a variety of jobs where they grew up and developed with the job opportunities. The same approach <Col N="174" /> could very profitably be made to the graduates of today. Likewise, on the university side we should lose no opportunity of trying to get across to our graduates that they must be prepared to diversify and tackle whatever comes as a challenge to them as people who have received a certain level of training.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask what is the delay about setting up the HEA on a permanent basis? We pushed the Bill through last July. At that stage there was a note of urgency in the Minister's approach. Yet six months later we still have the same <i>ad hoc</i> body and we are left wondering why have the permanent appointments not been made. I appeal to the Minister to treat it as a matter of urgency and put the body on a more solid foundation.</P>
    <P>I also ask the Minister for Finance to speed up payments coming from his Department, especially payments on the capital side. We have had considerable difficulties in the past year in the university, and perhaps the same applies to other bodies, in extracting what was legitimately due and fully certified from the Department. We received the impression that obstacles were being put in the way to prevent a speedy payment. I cannot understand why the State should set such a headline.</P>
    <P>I should now like to touch very briefly on the problem that is uppermost in all our minds, the question of the Six Counties and efforts to try to achieve a lasting peace. I agree with everyone present that the root cause of the present situation has been, first, internment and, secondly, and even worse, the methods adopted in putting this into effect. It has come as a great shock to everyone to realise that these barbaric methods of interrogation are practised and now openly condoned by the British Government and even by a large section of the British public. I should have thought that the revelation of these methods in the Compton Report would have caused such a revulsion in British public opinion that they would have to be withdrawn. I am puzzled at present about the calls for ending internment and putting those against whom charges can be preferred <Col N="175" /> on trial. In the present situation I do not think it would contribute a great deal to have a whole series of trials which would be based largely on membership of various organisations advocating violence and on some of the events arising therefrom. In every country where violence takes place eventually when you get to the conference table and a solution has been arrived at there is a fairly wide amnesty for what one would call either political offences or offences of violence. They come in every country under that banner and the North is no exception. When a settlement has been reached surely that settlement will carry with it the usual efforts to wipe the slate clean, carry the usual amnesty that is associated with such settlements.</P>
    <P>At present, where the urgency is to reach a settlement, the demand should be more for a standstill or a type of truce rather than be for trials or anything of that type. In other words, there would be no further arrests, and no recurrence of this revolting and barbaric type of interrogation. At that stage we should be able to get some kind of conference going. If we look at any country in which there was a revolution or violent methods used we realise that any conference, to be a success, must be representative of all the people involved.</P>
    <P>One of the most urgent necessities in the northern scene is to find out who really represents whom there. I suggest that there should be an election there, at the earliest possible opportunity, based on proportional representation. Such an election would sort out the representation and the support that all the various sectors have, whether they be the Alliance Party, the IRA, the UVF, the SDLP, the Nationalists or any others. It is vital to find out where the support lies. Likewise, the various strands of opinion within the Unonist Party would be clearly identified. If it happens that there is a very large right-wing in the Unionist Party it will be an unpalatable fact that we will have to face. That can only be shown by elections, but the elections would have to be based on proportional <Col N="176" /> representation where right-thinking people support one another by the exchange of their No. 1, No. 2 and No. 3 votes, and so on.</P>
    <P>Setting up an election based on proportional representation could be very easily done. There is no need to start re-drawing boundaries. There is already a system of constituencies there. You have the constituencies that returned the 12 Members to Westminster and it would be a matter of having each of those return five, six or seven Members under proportional representation. Alternatively, the present constituencies, I think 52 in all, that return Members to Stormont could be grouped in twos to return three Members, or three to return five Members.</P>
    <P>However, if you wish to have all shades of opinion represented it would be better to have at least five Members in the constituency. The registers for both of those possibilities are available and it should be quite an easy matter to get on with the election. I suggest that, far from avoiding elections at the present time, we should see in the elections the means of selecting the representatives that would then go to the conference table. I put forward those ideas as being a prerequisite for success of negotiation.</P>
    <P>The other question that is agitating us at the moment is the question of our entry into the Common Market. As an independent observer I think that our negotiators have done as well as, or indeed better than, most of us expected.  They deserve our sincere congratulations on their achievements. I would single out the much-criticised agreement on fisheries. It is, in effect, far better than any of us expected at the start of the negotiations. I agree with the Minister that it gives almost full protection to our fisheries industry. It covers 92 per cent of the catch at a much higher price. Outside our limits conditions can be imposed which are for the conservation of the fishing potential and, of course, they would be conditions that would apply equally to all members.</P>
    <P>On the question of farm produce, worthwhile results were achieved. It was an achievement to begin our participation <Col N="177" /> from 1st February, 1973. The recent controversy over the sugar beet industry has been blown up out of all proportion because this year, which is a record year, we produced an estimated 177,000 tons and that is a long way from the 240,000 tons that was sought in the negotiations. If we are right in our expectations from the Common Market, we see in it greatly increased prices for dairy products and beef. Those products will become much more attractive while the offer for sugar beet is only marginally more than what we have at present and it will undoubtedly be accompanied by higher costs of production here. The profitability of sugar is bound to decrease somewhat while the profitability of dairy products, beef and other commodities, by the figures known to us, is likely to increase very considerably.</P>
    <P>For instance, the return from dairy products should be up almost 50 per cent on what it was last year. Consequently, the small farmer who up to this has been depending quite a bit on three or four acres of beet, and a cash return from that, would now be far better off, according to most agricultural economists, by adding three or four extra cows to his herd. He would certainly have an easier labour problem.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the call for increased beet acreage is likely to come from those who are going in for farm mechanisation on a large scale, who are likely to get around 30 or 40 acres or more. At that level it is in competition with beef. Agricultural economists would agree that a good job has been done in regard to producing beef as compared with beet. For that reason I think we aimed too high in regard to beet but this need not necessarily be a setback.</P>
    <P>In regard to dairy products and beef we are sure of a substantial increase.  Last year's figures, released by Córas Tráchtála recently, showed our total exports as £120 million from cattle, £60 million from beef and £45 million from dairy products, all adding up to approximately £220 million. If these exports were exported at current <Col N="178" /> Common Market prices there would be an additional £100 million to this total. The economists take a more cautious figure of £70 million. Costs will, however, rise accordingly but it would still be a large increase.</P>
    <P>The real attractiveness of what has been achieved is the opportunity it now opens for development of our agricultural potential. Only today we have a report in the newspapers on the study carried out by the Irish Grassland Association and presented by their president, Dr. Carrick. In it he shows that in a five-year period we could expect an increase of about 10 per cent per annum, giving an increased return of what he worked out at approximately £150 million, that is a yearly return after five years, or an increase of £30 million each year taking it on a gradual basis. The amount of capital involved would be approximately £250 million. This is an alarming amount but taking the returns into account this is a situation in which foreign borrowing could play a large part and indeed could be engaged in enthusiastically on a short-term basis.</P>
    <P>We must emphasise that our major industry has not been able to develop in the post-war years to the same extent as agriculture has developed in the rest of Europe. We can put the blame for that on the variability of market prices and on the difficulties of planning ahead. England, on the other hand, had a very high subsidy rate for agriculture. The Continent likewise profited from the post-war period. In all cases the average increase since the war has been of the order of 4 per cent, whereas we have been only marginally better than 1 per cent. They have increased their pre-war production by 150 per cent while we have increased ours scarcely by 50 per cent.</P>
    <P>Yet the potential is there. We should insist strongly on recognition of the fact that the development of our potential has not taken place and this should be appreciated when we come to sign the Protocol so that if in the future there was a glut of dairy products in Europe which necessitated some form of quota restrictions, our special position would be honoured. <Col N="179" /> This I consider only just and in keeping with the spirit of the Community, that all areas should develop their potential and not be a drag on the other members.</P>
    <P>We cannot develop unless our main industry is given full scope. I am not alone in this view. It is perhaps a milder version of the expansion proposed by Dr. Michael Walsh from Moorepark, about six months ago. Also there is a report in today's newspapers by a Dr. Jones, head of the advisory service in Britain, in which he sees even further greater possibilities for expansion in British agriculture. Dare we fix a figure of an increase of £250 million a year after five years? The general attitude there, as stated by the British Minister of Agriculture in his New Year's message, was that for England the EEC offered the green light for farming expansion.</P>
    <P>In this respect, there is quite a lot of hope for us. If we take the difficulties of the small farmers, for whom all are concerned, we realise that so far there has been no effective Government answer to them. The Government do not seem to be grappling with the situation. They have faced, on the one hand, the problem of encouraging production but they have not so far given any realistic help to the small farmers to plan for their survival.</P>
    <P>The first thing we have to acknowledge is that by European standards we have very few small farmers of the type who are termed small farmers in Europe. The average acreage here is almost double what it is in Holland and is more than three times what it is in Belgium and in Germany. But the need is quite pressing here because the small farms are not developed. Take, for instance, a farm with something of the order of 30 to 40 acres where at present the standard in dairying is somewhere around ten or 12 cows. A living cannot be made from that level. That acreage has to be made to carry what it is capable of carrying under modern intensive agriculture methods. It means that in place of carrying ten cows it has to carry double that. That adjustment has to <Col N="180" /> be made quite rapidly; I would suggest in a matter of five years.</P>
    <P>One can see then the necessity for a capital injection there, a capital injection that will enable that farmer to put on the extra stock. The rewards are so good&mdash;and it is a question of the difference between survival or not&mdash;that it might be legitimately expected that a certain amount of the capital could be paid back. Therefore it would be good investment by the State to give as much as possible by way of outright grant. We cannot afford to lose those small farmers from our economy. Above all, we cannot afford to lose from the nation the stock that they represent in our community.</P>
    <P>Senator Keery mentioned the NIEC and their work. Is it not sad to think that that body are still functioning without any agricultural representative despite the fact that there have been calls from all sides in relation to the necessity for broadening the NIEC to include some agricultural representatives?  These calls have been made for the past eight years. So far no action has been taken. While figures can be given to show the potential and to show what can be done in given situations to develop farms we must never forget that we are dealing with human beings. Therefore we are depending a great deal on a certain initiative on the part of the people concerned. In that regard the change from low level to medium level production involves a certain number of buildings. It involves silage lay-out and it involves some milking facilities. The planning of these is a specialist activity. Their erection is something that the ordinary farmer cannot cope with. Consequently I am suggesting that in attacking the future we need units of contract services available who will go in and carry out those jobs, just as for the land project in the past we had contractors who carried out the work involved in that project.</P>
    <P>So also the question of farm development should now figure in exactly the same way and we should encourage, by every means possible, the development of teams to carry out this work. It could be amalgamated with land project type work and every <Col N="181" /> encouragement should be given to get on with that work.</P>
    <P>Agriculture has suffered quite a bit by comparison with non-agricultural employment by virtue of the five-day week, in other words, the matter of leisure which is a hallmark of our time. That can only be provided in the case of agriculture by organising pools of relief work from regular centres like co-operative centres. The ordinary farmer does not worry about milking his cows but he gets very tired having to do it seven days a week without any relief. Likewise there is inability to take a holiday when he sees others taking time off. This facility can be provided in our context very easily from the co-operative centres by simply having in those centres trained operators who, on receipt of a telephone call, will do the milking for an evening, or for a couple of days, or for whatever length is required. That to my mind is even more essential than capital to put the small and medium farmers in a position to go ahead with the developments they must carry out if we are to meet the opportunities of the Common Market. Of course it has the advantage that it provides for an opportunity of really worthwhile employment for many of our people.</P>
    <P>I calculate that at present in any reorganisation of our farms, with increased stocking, to give just one day per week relief service on all farms engaged in milking would provide employment for about 5,000 people. In our context that is quite a sizeable figure. Indeed, to put up industries to cater for 5,000 people would require about £3,000 capital per worker, in other words something of the order of £15 million. The State, by way of capital and so on, would be prepared to put up £7 million or £8 million of that. That gives some idea of the potential full employment that is available in agriculture at present.</P>
    <P>At this stage I want to turn to the unemployment situation where we have this very frightening total of 70,000 unemployed and increasing quite a bit. I accept the fact that this figure, or part of it, is occasioned by the drop in emigration due to the poor employment situation in England at present. <Col N="182" /> Nevertheless, we now have brought home to us a task which previously we passed over to Britain. We have to face the fact of 70,000 unemployed and we have to ask what short-term or long-term measures can be resorted to do something about this.</P>
    <P>At the top I would put the question of our service industries. If we expand and go ahead as we hope we will, the service industries will become more and more a feature of our lives. Indeed, they are becoming that in any case. Also, there is general dismay at the low standards prevailing in these industries.  I was at a meeting recently in Cork of a Soroptomists group and their condemnation of the ESB for their low standards of servicing and the lack of satisfaction given to customers in the area was very damning indeed. I think it is in line with what many of us know. This is not confined to the ESB; it seems to permeate all our service industries.  I suggest that in the present situation where we have a number of people available for work we could use this opportunity to do a great deal of retraining in our service industries, beginning with those that are State-controlled.  I should like to see a determined effort being made in the service section of the ESB to retrain their workers by allowing, say, about 20 per cent of the present workers time off to do retraining, whether in the local technical school or by any other arrangement that can be made. This programme could be carried out over several months. This would involve replacements being made. We would hope, however, that in the period ahead the service industry would expand to absorb those replacements.</P>
    <P>The question of the training of apprentices applies at the other end of the scale also. Most apprenticeship-training, whether it is in the electrical or garage apprenticeship sphere, is very valuable for many facets of future work, whether on the land or in an office. The training with equipment, whether for a garage or otherwise, is highly valuable. At this stage, realising the number of people we have available in the 18 to 21-year-old group, we should open recruitment into the various trades as a matter of urgency. We <Col N="183" /> should seek the full co-operation of the trade unions to achieve such opening. There is too much of a &ldquo;closed shop&rdquo; about apprenticeship in this country. If we have any confidence in the future we should show that confidence by boldly training apprentices in excess of what conservative thinking at present would regard as normal recruitment into those trades.</P>
    <P>The time has come to reflate the economy. In fact, the deflation carried out by the last Budget was much too drastic. It compares with the deflation that was carried out in 1957. Admittedly, the economy was not in as bad a condition and, therefore, the damage is not quite as bad but the effect has been very similar. It has been a case of over-cautious Ministers for Finance going along too much with the doctrinaire economic advice given at the time. They were afraid to take a chance. That is very characteristic of the present Budget and of the great deflation that was occasioned by it.</P>
    <P>The English Government corrected their position last July. So far we have made no sizeable correction of our position. We have the people available and it is time to get programmes of public works going quickly. The advantage in dealing with public works is that they are already planned&mdash;and indeed super-planned in many cases &mdash;and have been awaiting sanction for one, two, three or four years. If the green light were given for many of those projects they could be under way in a very short time. We know that there is a great deal of unemployment in the ranks of skilled tradesmen, carpenters, plumbers and so on. Therefore they would be available at very short notice to get on with those tasks. That is the greatest method of making an immediate impact on our numbers of unemployed.</P>
    <P>I was also talking about agriculture and what I outlined there about relief services could very well absorb at least 2,000 people, rising to perhaps 7,000 or 10,000 over five years. An imaginative approach by the Government for the first year or two could make the project completely self-supporting.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="184" /> Senator Crinion referred to the question of farm apprenticeship. It has been discouraging and disheartening to many of us who spent a lot of time and energy in the late fifties trying to get this scheme going to see the ridiculous mini-scheme that emerged. The numbers turned out in the current year are of the order of 40 or 50 apprentices when we should be talking in terms not of tens but of thousands. We should at least be capable of turning out anything from 2,000 to 3,000 of our young people trained in this way. The openings are there. In rural areas we have youths leaving school at 16 and 17 years who are at present unemployed and who would be excellent for such a scheme.</P>
    <P>If we believe in the forecasts that are made about the development of agriculture, the one thing we can say for certain is that in the future it is likely to suffer from a scarcity of skilled labour. Therefore, if we go ahead now and train those young people and place them as apprentices on farms of an acceptable level, then not alone will we be reducing the ranks of the unemployed but we will also be carrying out very vital training for the future.</P>
    <P>Regarding the question of buildings, silage units, <i>et cetera,</i> if these are encouraged by something akin to the land project scheme they will provide a useful means of absorbing a large number of our people.</P>
    <P>In regard to the question of unemployment, I suggest that we seriously consider reducing the age limit for the old age pension from 70 years to 65 years. Why are civil servants, university professors, <i>et cetera,</i> compelled to retire at 65 and get their pensions whereas ordinary workers have to wait until they are 70? In the present situation in which there are many redundancies it would be a suitable time to take this step. The cost involved would not be excessive because a pension is paid in place of unemployment relief. At the same time it is more dignified for the person concerned if he can retire at 65. His pension is more acceptable than unemployment relief at that stage. People in the higher age group are not easily trained to new techniques and despite their best efforts find it hard <Col N="185" /> to adjust to new conditions. Therefore, why should we force them in this way? Reducing the age to below 65 might be considered. I offer these as means by which we can endeavour to make some impact on the unemployment situation. The impact must be constructive, viewed in the light of our future prospects and our future hopes.</P>
    <P>We cannot be happy with the lack of progress in reform in the country. The Devlin Report is gathering dust as are all the other reports that went before it. We are expert at setting up committees, getting reports and then, once the first impact is over, we calmly forget about them.</P>
    <P>The Devlin Report offers many worthwhile ideas on the reorganisation of the public services. I urge the Government to take positive steps to implement these ideas and give value to the taxpayer. This should begin here in Leinster House where we operate in the same way as Parnell operated in his time. We still have the same procedures, the same approach, the same lack of consultation with the Government Departments and those who make the real decisions.</P>
    <P>We are facing, as Senator Keery put it, a time of rapid change and uncertainty about the future and in shaping the future in the Common Market or in the northern situation a united effort is called for. It is rather hollow to call for a united effort in the North to solve their problems without giving the lead from here. The time has come for a national Government. The type of party politics we know and which we have at present is outmoded and outdated.  Only a national Government, drawing on the best efforts of all, can give the positive leadership we need in the five-year period ahead. If we can ensure that national government does not become national dictatorship and resort to the provision in the Constitution for having referenda on various matters of major policy we can make the transition. At the same time we can sit down and calmly plan for the future and see what shape of political development or political structure we need. I do not envisage that a national Government should be anything more than a type of an emergency measure <Col N="186" /> for a period of five or seven years. After that, we should have some modernised parliamentary system.</P>
    <P>The fully developed committee system must come. We, in Seanad Éireann, would be giving a better return to the people and would be far more deserving of our allowances if we had a properly developed committee system. There is nothing new or revolutionary about a committee system. We all talk about committees. We take part in committees in various ways but if we want to see how the committee system works at parliamentary level all we need do is go to the small countries in western Europe. We can go to Holland and see a very well-developed committee system there. Attached to the Parliament there are the committee on agriculture, the committee on primary education and the committee on university education. There are probably a dozen committees. On those committees there are people of different political backgrounds but all having in common some particular competence for the work of the committee of which they are members and something particular to offer.</P>
    <P>The initiative for changes in legislation, or similar developments, could come from such committees. They could report to the Minister concerned that they thought legislation along certain lines should be initiated. If a Minister were about to introduce legislation he could consult the committee first and work it out with them before issuing a White Paper. If we had some system like this we would not have the awful muddle which the Government have got into in the present constitutional amendment situation. If there had been consultations with the parties concerned this Civil Service omnibus measure would not have been brought in. I feel certain that had the two political parties been consulted in advance of this constitutional amendment a much more acceptable form of question to be put before the public would have been evolved and the arid controversies that it has caused would have been avoided.</P>
    <P>It is essential that we get on with political reform if we are to cope with some of the worst features of the <Col N="187" /> Common Market. It is a very bureaucratic structure where the Commission in Brussels wield extraordinary power. We will have to make representations to that Commission on many matters of vital concern. That raises the question: who is making those representations?  Are we going to have a repetition of the beet fiasco where we had a Minister who had not got the opinion of the organisation concerned? The Minister accepted something and then returned and it was only at that stage that the organisation concerned made their views known and so the negotiations have to be reopened. We cannot do very much reopening when we are in the Common Market permanently. The local government machinery and the Civil Service Departments will have to be in much closer contact and consultation with our various national organisations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Quinlan</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot, but I question why the Minister went looking for so outlandish a figure. We need both political and administrative reform.  Above all, we need a very distinct liberalisation of our Civil Service approach. We seem to have taken too much from our past history in our Civil Service approach. We have taken the attitude that the Government Departments know what is good for the people concerned. Consultations have not been properly conducted at any level.</P>
      <P>In regard to the whole educational structure, there is grave dissatisfaction everywhere at the lack of consultation. This has to be put right even at this 11th hour, otherwise we are going to find the ordinary people in the hands of the Dublin bureaucrats who are in the hands of the Brussels bureaucrats. At that stage I do not know where democracy will be.</P>
      <P>The Devlin Report offers some possibilities for achieving this consultation.  As a first step let us know what is the Government thinking on that report. I have asked the Government if before implementing it, or bringing in legislation on it they would consider setting up a select committee from both Houses of the Oireachtas to consider the whole question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is just one other topic left and that has to deal with secondary education.  We are all rather dismayed at the bad relations that prevail between the Department of Education and the various educational bodies throughout <Col N="189" /> the country. It is wrong that any Department should be at such absolute variance with the groups that it is supposed to represent. The fault cannot be all with the outside organisations.  A great deal must rest with the Department themselves.</P>
    <P>The community school muddle is only part of what has emerged from unquestioning acceptance of what is happening in the United States in education. These ideas on community schools have come from the United States over the years. Unfortunately our amateur educationalists in the Department of Education have gone to America and swallowed their ideas, hook, line and sinker. The result is this ridiculous idea of trying to fuse the vocational and the secondary educational institutions and trying to make each do the work of the other. We had a very fine vocational education system. It should have been strengthened and developed. I am afraid <Col N="190" /> that diverting energies and talents to acquiring paper certificates, whether leaving certificates or intermediate certificates, is something we will bitterly regret in time to come. We do not seem to value manual work sufficiently in our community. We seem to think that the man pushing the pen is far more valuable to the community than the man using his hands. That idea is outmoded but it is at this very juncture we rush in and maintain that the man who works with his hands is in some way or other inferior to his white-collar colleague. This has happened at a time when the vocational schools were really establishing themselves.  Why are we imposing the leaving certificate on the vocational students? The establishment of community schools is the cause of it.</P>
