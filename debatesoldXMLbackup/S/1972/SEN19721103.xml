      <P>Senators will have read reports of the debate in Dáil Éireann on the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1972.  Many Deputies contributed to the debate and during its course the Bill and its subject matter were looked at from many viewpoints.  Some critical comments were made about the Constitution as a whole and about particular provisions of it, apart from the two sections of Article 44, the deletion <Col N="720" /> of which is proposed in the Bill before this House.</P>
      <P>Our Constitution is nearly 35 years old.  In 1966 the three main political parties set up an informal committee to review the &ldquo;constitutional, legislative and institutional basis of Government&rdquo;. In 1972 the parties agreed to the setting up of a committee &ldquo;to establish the common ground between the parties on the constitutional, legal, economic, cultural, social and other relevant implications of a United Ireland&rdquo;. We have the advantage of having available the interim report of the earlier committee.  In addition, the members of the current inter-party committee are maintaining continuous contact with their parties in relation to their deliberations.</P>
      <P>In line with the preponderance of opinion on the subject, I feel that a general overhaul or rewriting of the Constitution is preferable to piecemeal amendment of its provisions.  Amendment must be effected by way of referendum. It would be a costly and long drawn-out process to carry out a series of such amendments.  The deliberations of the present inter-party committee have, however, not been completed.  In the present conjuncture, an important question is whether it is timely to consider a revised Constitution for the Twenty-six County state.  It would be impossible to carry out an appropriate Thirty-two County constitution through the Twenty-six County electorate.  It would be presumptuous to do so.</P>
      <P>A constitution acceptable to Thirty-two County opinion must reflect the attitudes, opinions and views of the people of the Thirty-two Counties. The accuracy of that reflection could only be checked by reference to a Thirty-two County electorate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why, then, tackle now the amendment proposed in this Bill?  Religion, or rather the fears of a section of the Protestant community in the North about their future status or those of their faith in this island, is a basic factor in the origin and continuance of the Partition of this country.  The reference in Article 44 of the Constitution to specific churches and in particular the special position of the Catholic Church, recognised in subsection <Col N="721" /> (2) of section 1 of that Article, has been criticised as an obstacle to Irish unity.  Although the cause for the deletion of the special position seems to come mainly from persons who say that people other than themselves are aggrieved at the maintenance of this subsection of the Constitution, the deletion of subsections (2) and (3) of section 1 of Article 44 was unanimously recommended by the 1967 all-party committee.</P>
    <P>The point has also been made that the deletion of the subsections would be an indication of an outward-looking approach of the Government and the people of Ireland in relation to unity.  Whatever one may feel about the merits or otherwise of the two subsections, there has been in recent years a growing feeling that the general provisions of Article 44 in regard to religious liberties are sufficient in themselves, and that the specific listing of churches is neither desirable nor necessary and should be deleted.  Consequently, since there is common ground on the matter among the three main parties since we have the opportunity of combining a referendum on that issue with a referendum on the issue of votes at 18, and since the other parties have indicated their desire to facilitate this procedure, the Government are now putting forward this Bill with our close commitment to promoting the amendment of Article 44 of the Constitution.  I was glad to find similar commitment expressed by the spokesmen for the other parties in Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>The passage of this Bill will serve to refute the allegations sometimes made that we intended to utilise the controversial provisions of the Constitution as bargaining counters in negotiations with the majority community in the North.  I wish to emphasise to this House that the free profession and practice of religion will still be guaranteed by the remaining provisions of Article 44 of the Constitution, if the amendment of that Article proposed in the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1972, is approved by the people.</P>
    <P>In the main, Article 44 of our Constitution is a charter for the free profession and practice of religion.  In <Col N="722" /> this respect, I would suggest that it is second to none in any part of the world.  It gives, for example, the following guarantees:</P>
    <P>2.  1º Freedom of conscience and the free profession and practice of religion are, subject to public order and morality, guaranteed to every citizen.</P>
    <P>It goes on to guarantee that:</P>
    <P>3º The State shall not impose any disabilities or make any discrimination on the ground of religious profession, belief or status.</P>
    <P>These two fundamental guarantees are the basis of religious freedom in the civilised world.  They are to be found in the United Nations' universal declaration on human rights and in the Council of Europe Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.  Article 44 gives further guarantees &ldquo;not to endow any particular religion nor to provide State aid on a more favourable basis to one religion more than another.&rdquo;  If safeguards to every religious denomination its right to manage its own affairs and its rights in regard to property.</P>
    <P>In the years since the adoption of the Constitution, it has been widely acknowledged that there was full and ungrudging recognition of every one of the churches mentioned in subsection (3) of section 1 of Article 44 regardless of their numerical strength.  The report of the 1967 committee mentioned that subsection (3) gave rise to &ldquo;doubts in regard to other denominations&rdquo;.  In practical terms, the listing of existing churches did not inhibit the setting up of other religious bodies <i>de nova</i> by the coming together of existing churches.</P>
    <P>Constitutions and their makers are traditional targets.  More than 2,500 years ago Solon produced a democratic constitution to serve the city-state of Athens for 100 years.  He induced the Athenian people to swear solemnly that no change would be made in the constitution for ten years so that it could be given a fair chance of working. Very soon he was so pestered by criticisms of the constitution that he left Athens for ten years so as to make <Col N="723" /> it more difficult for the critics to have the constitution amended.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make three quick comments before dealing with the matter in more detail. The first is that the Fine Gael group in the Seanad, as with the Fine Gael Party in the Dáil, are supporting these proposals.  The Fine Gael Party here will certainly honour any timetable arrangements which may have been agreed in order to facilitate the passage of this measure so that this referendum and the referendum on the question of votes at 18 years may be taken on the same day.</P>
      <P>Speaking as a Senator, I wish to say that Members of this House ought to be consulted in relation to any timetables which may be fixed regarding legislation of this kind.  I do not think it should be automatically assumed that Members of this House will feel themselves obliged by decisions taken elsewhere.  We have, as an independent arm of the Legislature, a responsibility imposed on us under the Constitution, which we are now amending, to arrange our own rules and our own Standing Orders and to make our own arrangements to ensure that Members of this House will be able fully and freely to contribute to discussions on legislation without interference from any other source.</P>
      <P>I am saying this even though my party may bear some responsibility for arranging the timetable.  I think it right to say, as a Senator, that if we are to discharge our obligations under the Constitution we cannot relinquish the right to fix our own rules with regard to debate in such a manner as to ensure that, no matter how long or how short the discussion may take, any Senator who wishes to contribute to the debate will be able to contribute as fully as he may wish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Thirdly, I personally am not entirely sure or satisfied as to the value of what we are about to do.  There are dangers, no matter what the result of the people's decision may be, that the result of this referendum may be misinterpreted or misrepresented no matter which way it goes.  We should face up to the fact that that risk <Col N="724" /> exists both in relation to the question of national unity and in relation to the feelings of people South of the Border as well as North of the Border.</P>
    <P>We should all be clear that in relation to any amendment of the Constitution our function as legislators is merely to initiate the proposal. In real practice, under the referendum procedure, the people themselves are the lawmakers.  They decide whether the proposals which are initiated in Parliament are to have the force of law.  In relation to this referendum, I hope that the people will accept that responsibility, because it is their responsibility, and discharge it fully.  I hope the fact that all three political parties find themselves in agreement on this question will not inculcate into the electorate a sense of complacency or the attitude that a decision has already been taken for them.  Probably the worst outcome of this referendum would be if a large number of the people remained away from the polls and thereby showed that they were not interested, one way or the other, in coming to a decision on the question which this legislation will submit to them for decision.</P>
    <P>It can be said that the Bill itself is commendably simple and easy to understand.  The second Bill with which we are concerned in connection with this referendum puts the position quite clearly to the people.  It shows exactly what is entailed in the proposed amendment and gives everyone an opportunity of knowing what they are doing and of casting their votes in a situation where there is no ambiguity about it.  It is only right to commend the draftsman of these two Bills for the manner in which they have been drafted.</P>
    <P>There is a danger arising from the fact that the political parties find themselves in agreement on this measure.  I am not sure that that is entirely an advantage.  There are definite disadvantages.  It may very well mean that we will not see on the occasion of this referendum the kind of in-depth examination which we carried out in previous referenda.  I am thinking in particular of the referendum associated with the effort to <Col N="725" /> change the voting system and the referendum carried out in connection with EEC membership.  In those cases there was a balanced presentation of the case to the people and there was an in-depth examination which enabled the people to see all the arguments that could be unearthed on one side or the other and to consider them and, having considered them, they could come to their decision.</P>
    <P>I do not think we will have that exercise in connection with this referendum. The Minister has made it clear that so far as the Government are concerned they regard themselves as under a commitment to work in favour of getting this referendum carried by the people.  I do not know if there will be any group in the State who will have sufficient interest in the matter to oppose the referendum; I think it is unlikely.  If that is so, I feel that there is a danger that the people will regard the decision as already having been made for them.  They will therefore feel that it does not matter particularly whether they vote in this referendum. To a certain extent that also applies to the referendum which is being carried out in conjunction with this one.</P>
    <P>I do not know if my views will be at variance with the view generally taken by the three political parties in relation to this.  However, if the situation is that there is an unbalanced presentation of the case and the three political parties find common ground on this matter, I wonder if there will be some kind of credibility gap as between the politicians on the one hand and the electorate on the other.  Are we going to create the opinion that this whole matter is so completely one-sided that there is nothing at all to be said against the proposal?  It may be that that is the case.  If that is the case, the first question that must raise itself in the minds of people both north and south of the Border is why on earth have the referendum at all?</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear the Minister's introductory remarks today.  I think possibly the opening paragraph of his speech was prepared on the assumption that there would be adequate time for Members of the Seanad to read and <Col N="726" /> consider what was stated in the Dáil debate.  In fact, the Minister will appreciate that Senators have not had an opportunity of reading the Dáil discussion on this except to the extent that they were reported in the daily newspapers. I got the impression&mdash;and I only give it as an impression, because I did not hear what the Taoiseach had to say yesterday and I did not get an opportunity of reading the full text of his speech&mdash;that the Taoiseach was attaching a very secondary importance to the placing of this question in the context of national unity.</P>
    <P>I got the impression from the Minister's speech here today that the predominant argument in favour of carrying this proposal at the referendum is the question of national unity.  If there is any degree of conflict or contradiction as between the Taoiseach and the Minister, then the Minister's line is probably the right one.  I say that deliberately because I know the case has been made, and it was made as far back as 1967&mdash;the Minister has referred to the Committee on the Constitution which reported then&mdash;that these particular subsections in Article 44 were divisive.  The argument is that, being divisive, it is right for us to remove them anyhow, regardless of any question concerning national unity.  I have no doubt that every Senator here would go along with the view that, if it is right for us to do something for ourselves, then we should do it again regardless of the question of national unity.  If the matter is put on that basis, I think it is right to say this.  I say it merely as an individual, but I say it as an individual who has had the opportunity of hearing publicly expressed the views of members of the religious minority in this part of the country.</P>
    <P>If it is put purely on the basis of divisiveness, then I do not think that in practice this Article has proved to be divisive.  It may be that the words, the placing of the two subsections, in the Constitution would automatically create in the mind of some neutral observer, for instance, the suggestion that here is something divisive that should be taken away.  In practice, these two subsections have not proved <Col N="727" /> to have been divisive and we ought to recognise that.  It is certainly recognised, as far as I know, by members of the religious minorities in this part of the country.  I have heard some of them say&mdash;and I think only yesterday in the Dáil this was borne out by one Deputy&mdash;that these particular subsections have never caused the religious minority in this country a moment's worry.  I think that is a tribute to the tolerance that, generally speaking, has prevailed in the Twenty-six Counties throughout the existence of this State.</P>
    <P>If we argue this referendum question purely on the question of whether these sub-articles are divisive, it will be generally accepted by the people, regardless of their religious views, that whatever about the theoretical divisiveness of these sub-articles, in practice they have not proved to be divisive.</P>
    <P>Therefore, whatever the strength of that argument, there is greater strength in approaching this question from the point of view of national unity.  It is relevant to say that we would not be having this discussion today at all if these sections had not been put into the Constitution in 1937.  But, once they are in it and once the matter has come up for discussion, we must try to see the basis on which the people should be asked to remove these two subsections.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether I am committing political heresy in saying this but I am going to say it anyhow. There is a point beyond which the people of this part of the country will not be prepared to go, even for the sake of national unity.  The proposal before us now is not anywhere near that point.  The question I want to put to the Minister and, through him, to the Government is whether or not the exercise we are now undertaking would be better served if at this stage we tried to ascertain where that frontier lies.  If we do not ascertain that, it seems to me that we will be inadvertently misleading the people both North and South of the Border.</P>
    <P>If we allow things to dribble along, where we take a bite at the Constitution <Col N="728" /> now and another bite later without knowing the extent to which the people south of the Border are prepared to go, eventually we may find ourselves in the kind of mess where we have taken things out of the Constitution that people south of the Border would have liked to keep in, and that we have done so on the basis of trying to bring about some contribution towards national unity. We may find that we will come to a full stop, where people are not prepared to go any further and that the whole exercise has become valueless.</P>
    <P>There is some merit in the Government coming out courageously at this stage in connection with this referendum, putting the cards on the table and saying to the people: &ldquo;This is only a step in the direction.  The full length we want you to go to eventually may entail&rdquo;&mdash;as many people feel it ought to entail&mdash;&ldquo;the complete scrapping of this Constitution and the bringing in of a new Constitution.&rdquo; Would it not be better if we tried to establish that frontier at the beginning of the exercise rather than in the middle of it?  I believe there is such a point, probably a different point for different people.  There may be a number of my colleagues who would be prepared to go beyond the particular point to which I would be prepared to go.  There may be other people who would not be prepared to go as far.</P>
    <P>I do not want to cause any controversy or disharmony in connection with a particular proposal which is, so far as the political parties are concerned, an agreed one.  But when we are considering the question of constitutional changes in the context of national unity and when we are considering the length to which people south of the Border are prepared to go it is relevant that we should remember that the Fianna Fáil attitude has been that this Constitution is the ultimate and that this is as far as people could be expected to go to meet the viewpoints north of the Border.  I am not exaggerating when I say that that was the basis on which this Constitution, which we are now amending, was presented to the people.  As an <i>aidememoire</i><Col N="729" /> to the Minister and to the Senators on the other side of the House it is no harm to refer to one of the speeches of the then Leader of the Fianna Fáil Party when this Constitution was being considered in draft form for submission to the people.  He put his own point of view and that of the Fianna Fáil Party fairly and fully to the people in his speech made on the 14th June, 1937, columns 429 and 430 of the Dáil Official Report.  In fairness I should quote at length from it, but that is not in accordance with practice so I will just give a few short extracts from it:</P>
    <P>There is, therefore, this balance between what the majority can concede and what the minority are seeking. I say that you cannot go farther than we have gone in this Constitution to meet the view of those in the North without sacrificing, to an extent that they are not prepared to sacrifice, the legitimate views and opinions of the vast majority of our people.  This Constitution has been designed on that basis.  Here you have to assure to the majority the things which they will not sacrifice no matter what would be gained in regard to the unity of this country by the sacrifice of them.</P>
    <P>Towards the end of that column and in the next column he said&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>My view is that this expresses the limit to which the majority of the people in this country are prepared to go in order to meet the sentiments of the minority, and that if you meet them at all you will meet them on a basis not behind us but farther advanced: that this indicates the utmost limit to which you can go in the way of concession to meet the views of people who are differing from us.</P>
    <P>That was the Fianna Fáil view and the basis on which the 1937 Constitution was presented to the people, and they were told that the Constitution was designed on that basis.  There have been changes of viewpoints since, not merely down here but also North of the Border.  We should not allow the situation to continue in some sort of <Col N="730" /> twilight zone without knowing here, and without letting the people north of the Border know, just how far we are prepared to go.</P>
    <P>I want to question the value of constitutional changes as a whole in relation to the question of national unity. I get a strong feeling that there is a hard core in the North which may be sufficiently large to have a decisive voice in affairs.  There is a hard core that will not be affected or attracted in the direction of Irish unity no matter what we do down here by way of concessions or changes in our Constitution.</P>
    <P>This does not mean an end to our aspirations for national unity.  It does not mean that the people in general and, in particular, the Government, should not continue to strive and work for national unity, but it does mean changes of approach in two directions. It means giving up the idea of framing a single Constitution for a united Ireland.  It means we must approach the matter of constitutions with the idea of having a central core of articles which would be acceptable both north and south of the Border. Parallel with that, there would be separate Constitutions in the context of a federal arrangement.</P>
    <P>While the Leader of the Fianna Fáil Party spoke in 1937 about guarantees or assurances to the people of the North, the only guarantees which would be acceptable to the kind of hard core I am speaking about would lie in a Constitution which would be separate and distinct in regard to a number of matters from a Constitution which would be applicable to the Twenty-six Counties.</P>
    <P>It is arguable that Constitution-making down here is not going to have any effect on a hard core of Unionists in the North but there is one thing which would have an effect and it is up to all of us as legislators and to the people south of the Border as a community to try to establish that when we talk of national unity by consent we do not regard that as a mere cliché.  We will be serving the people, North and South, and will be making an effective contribution <Col N="731" /> towards taking some of the violence out of the situation if we are courageous enough to say that if unity was offered to us as a result of violence, we would not accept it.  We should make it clear that that is not the kind of unity we want and that when we talk of unity by consent we are not merely using a cliché which is convenient to use from public platforms.</P>
    <P>If we are to have unity by consent it will not be on the basis of what is or what is not in constitutions; it will be on the basis of the kind of State and kind of community we build for ourselves south of the Border. If we can justifiably point to the kind of society we have south of the Border as being a society into which people will wish to come then we have a prospect of getting national unity by consent.  If we are not prepared to create a kind of society which would be the envy of others we will always be up against the hard core opposition in the North.</P>
    <P>The arguments in favour of the proposal that is now being put before the people will be spelled out by the Government, by Fine Gael and by Labour.  The people may feel there are unspoken arguments against the proposal.  Whatever decision is taken by the people will be open to misinterpretation and mis-representation. If the people defeat this referendum it will be regarded as a vote against unity and a pro-Partition vote.  That will be the predominant argument which people will feel coerces them into supporting this proposal.  I believe that the leaving out or leaving in of these sub-articles in Article 44 does not matter a rap in the context of national unity at present.</P>
    <P>Assuming that this proposal will be carried at the referendum there are certain dangers.  If these sub-articles had never been inserted into the Constitution in 1937 we would have gone along quite happily without them, but once they were inserted and are taken out some people are bound to get the feeling that we are in some way devaluing the vision of the Catholic Church, particularly, but also of the <Col N="732" /> other churches.  It would be unfortunate if that interpretation were given to the result, assuming that the proposals are carried.  It has never been suggested by anyone that these articles were of any value so far as the Catholic Church was concerned or that they conferred any benefit on Catholics.  My personal approach to this matter, if I were asked to amend these articles of the Constitution, would not be on what might be regarded as a demotion basis but on a promotion basis.  It might have been better had we approached this on the basis of recognising, in addition to recognising the special position of the Catholic Church, the special position of the other churches in their capacity as guardians of the faith professed by their flocks.  I hope I am wrong in thinking that if this referendum is carried there will be, if not amongst us here in the South but may be elsewhere, those who may regard the result as in some way devaluing the position of the Church in our community.  That could only arise from a complete misconception of what the Catholic Church is.  Any Catholic will tell you that the Catholic Church does not consist of the Catholic Hierarchy or priests and religious; each of us who professes the Catholic faith comprises the Catholic Church.</P>
    <P>With an electorate which is 95 per cent Catholic it would be completely wrong to assume that the carrying of this proposal is intended by that electorate to devalue the position of the Church in any way, or to indicate that there is any loosening of the affection of the Catholic people for the ministers of their faith, or that there is any slackening of the regard for the faith for which so many of our forebears suffered.</P>
    <P>Enormous benefit could accrue from this referendum if we could dissociate it from the question of divisiveness and national unity.  If we could see in the carrying of these proposals something in the nature of a political and religious ecumenical movement which would apply to the people of the North and South this referendum could be of great benefit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kerry</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to welcome <Col N="733" /> this Bill.  May I say I have no objection to the context in which Senator O'Higgins has just placed this debate when he quoted the views of Éamon de Valera on the draft of the 1937 Constitution at the time it was debated in Dáil Éireann and when he pointed to the position of the Fianna Fáil Party on this issue.  I am proud to be a member of a party of which the generations who founded that party and who worked to achieve the position which they have maintained over the years, are men who fought extremely vigorously for the carrying of that Constitution in 1937.  They saw in it the great merit that it was establishing a Constitution for an independent Irish Republic which at that time set extremely high standards of civil liberty.  It is important to appreciate that this is the context in which we, on this side of the House, are speaking.  What I am going to say is in no way a criticism of the views of the Fianna Fáil Party expressed at that time or a specific criticism of the draft document as it stood then in the context of that time.  To put my remarks in a wider context I should like to get my terminology clear where we are discussing the relations between individuals and the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From time to time complaints are made against the State by individuals on the grounds that the State is acting in a sectarian way.  The individual is claiming that the State is not treating him in an equal way because of his religious belief and practice.  I should like to make a very clear distinction between that type of sectarian complaint and what I would call a civil rights complaint.  A complaint by an individual against a State of the infringement of his civil rights is simply a claim that the State is interfering with certain rights and freedoms which he as an individual of that State feels he should enjoy.  When we are discussing this Bill it is important to be clear that we are discussing it in a sectarian rather than a civil rights context.  In saying that, I do not wish to be misunderstood and would like to enlarge on it a little more.  Any one reading further down Article 44 <Col N="734" /> of the Constitution, beyond the part we are being asked to amend, will see clearly that this Article of the Constitution in 1937 recognised the civil rights issue and granted full freedom of conscience and profession in the civil rights sense.  It is important that subsection 2, paragraph I should be on the record from the 1937 Constitution:</P>
    <P>Freedom of conscience and the free profession and practice of religion are, subject to public order and morality, guaranteed to every citizen.</P>
    <P>In other words, the civil rights position was quite clear at that time where religion was concerned.</P>
    <P>When certain other aspects of this Constitution are discussed there is a tendency, which I deplore, to bring these other possible changes into the sectarian arena.  I refer particularly to discussion of the possibility of amending Article 41 on divorce.  That is not an issue of any sectarian kind. It is a civil rights issue.  It is a section of the Constitution affecting every citizen of the State, no matter what his class, creed or politics may be. When we are discussing these two sections of Article 44 we must remember that the situation is not one of a general kind.  We are speaking of specific references to specific churches, therefore we are debating in sectarian terms.  It is important to make the position quite clear.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Higgins said that the recognition of the special position of the Catholic Church in subsection 2 was never felt by Protestants to be any kind of infringement on their rights or affecting them disadvantageously.  In my view this is not true.  This opinion is not in conflict with what I have said about the adoption and approval of the 1937 Constitution.  As soon as pen is put to paper on draft proposals for any constitution, they are immediately the subject of debate.  The final terms of wording are almost invariably a compromise.</P>
    <P>When one looks at the debate on the draft Constitution of 1937, it is interesting to find hardly a word of criticism. <Col N="735" /> There was a query from one Member of the Dáil at that time about Article 44.  We should ask ourselves why there was no criticism.  The reason was&mdash;and this applies to every line of that Constitution&mdash;because there was full and frank consultation with all the parties and interests involved.  There was little debate because Article 44, as it now stands in our Constitution, represented at that time an agreement by all parties concerned.  Such agreement and compromise may well leave lingering doubts and perhaps a little apprehension.  Nevertheless, one must accept that the wording at that time was accepted.  People, whether they were Protestant or Catholic, who had doubts about the situation agreed to put them to one side once the Constitution had been adopted by the people. One specific reason for this attitude was that it appeared to many that the wording of Article 44, and particularly its reference to the special position of the Catholic Church, was simply a statement of statistical fact.  It could not possibly have any juridical influence or effect.</P>
    <P>Although this is still a matter for debate, certain events occurred which raised doubts about the possible effects and implications which might flow from this wording of Article 44. I should like to refer briefly to one particular law case which caused considerable apprehension and discussion in Protestant circles.  I refer to the case of Tilson v.  Tilson which was in the <i>Irish Law Times Report</i> LXXXVI 1952, pages 49-73.  In that case, arising from a marital situation, Judge Gavan Duffy gave a judgment which seemed to imply that Article 44 of the Constitution gave canon law something of the same status as ordinary domestic law. He said:</P>
    <P>In my opinion, an order of the court designed to secure the fulfilment of an agreement peremptorily required before a mixed marriage by the Church, whose special position in Ireland is officially recognised as the guardian of the faith of the Catholic spouse, cannot be withheld on any ground of public policy <Col N="736" /> by the very State which pays homage to that Church.</P>
    <P>The history of that case shows that that statement by Judge Gavan Duffy was not relevant to the ultimate finding.</P>
    <P>I should like to say, as someone who comes from a family with an entirely Protestant background, that that case is nevertheless a part of Protestant folklore and is cited as illustrating the possible adverse effects the special position of the Catholic Church in Article 44 might have on the Protestant community.  The reference to mixed marriages in the quotation I have read and the fact that even up to the present time this is the most vexing problem as seen by the Protestant community in the development of community harmony and reconciliation in Ireland underlines how important was the feeling of apprehension aroused by the Tilson case and the effect which it has had since that time. That is one example occurring after 1937 which altered significantly Protestant views regarding Article 44.  This is one of the reasons why it is important that the situation regarding the civil rights position, so well spelt out in the second subsection of Article 44, should be clarified beyond all doubt. This is the main reason I welcome this opportunity to amend the Constitution, which I hope will be carried overwhelmingly. It provides this opportunity, once and for all, to clarify the position regarding religious rights and freedoms which from the start were part of the 1937 Constitution.  It will remove all ambiguity and doubt regarding this particular section so that no citizen of this island can possibly feel any doubt about his religious rights and freedoms under this particular section.</P>
    <P>With regard to the other section which has not been referred to so far in this debate&mdash;subsection 3, paragraph 1 of Article 44&mdash;there is also a need for clarification because the Constitution gave recognition simply to religious denominations existing in Ireland at that time.  Other religious denominations have made their appearance in the State since.  They are likewise entitled to an assurance <Col N="737" /> that the rights and freedoms which they have enjoyed and continue to enjoy are guaranteed to them by the Constitution.</P>
    <P>Despite the fears and folklore created by findings like the Tilson case, it is absolutely true that Protestants recognise that they participate equally and without discrimination in general terms in the life of this State. Even the most extreme of Unionists, who come on holidays or are transferred to some position down here or come perhaps as students, must recognise that they are under no threat of any kind nor do they experience any feeling of discrimination.  This is true of many members of the former Unionist Governments in the Six Counties who travelled widely in the South and who spoke of how much they enjoyed life in the Republic. What, then, is their fear?  What is their criticism of our Constitution? What is the drive behind their pressure&mdash;and there is a definite pressure &mdash;on the need for constitutional change in the South, if the question of closer relationships between the Republic and the Six Counties is ever to be considered?</P>
    <P>The pressure is that in a united Ireland situation&mdash;one in which the present 1937 Constitution would apply to the whole island&mdash;the balance of distribution between minority and majority in religious terms would be completely changed.  The fears and criticisms expressed regarding our Constitution are not of life in the Republic as it is at present but of what it might be in a united Ireland governed by this Constitution.  It is important to recognise this fact.  It is another good reason for changing our Constitution now, particularly when we are in a fluid period where none of us really knows what movement there will be in the development of new relations between both parts of the island and, hopefully, the development of a united Ireland.</P>
    <P>In describing this situation I have underlined how times have changed, not just in the awareness of the importance of civil rights but also in regard to certain events which have <Col N="738" /> occurred in this State and which are affecting us all at this time.  It is interesting, particularly when one looks back at some of the criticisms from Catholic sources of Article 44 in 1937 that perhaps Article 44 did not go far enough in terms of recognition of the position of the Catholic Church in Ireland, to note the developments which have occurred in the Catholic Church since then; to see, for example, the declaration on religious freedom which issued from Vatican II which made it quite clear that Catholics need not seek for such recognition from a Constitution.  I should like to quote from section 6 of the Declaration on Religious Freedom of Vatican II:</P>
    <P>Finally, government is to see to it that the equality of citizens before the law, which is itself an element of the common good, is never violated whether openly or covertly for religious reasons nor is there to be discrimination among citizens.</P>
    <P>There is much more in that vein which makes the change one of a deeper understanding by the Catholic Church in matters of this kind.  This is one of the encouraging changes which has led to the development of ecumenism in a full and welcome sense. I agree with Senator O'Higgins that one of the effects of the referenda campaigns on this particular issue might be in the wider development of an ecumenical sense among all our people.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal with some of the points made about how people in the Six Counties may view the situation during this referendum campaign.  The Government find themselves in a rather difficult position regarding constitutional change at this time.  On the one hand you have demands for constitutional change from the North.  In the New Ulster Movement's publication&mdash;a moderate Unionist publication entitled <i>Two Irelands or One</i>&mdash;the obstacles to unity are quite clearly laid down. Under the heading &ldquo;Religious Difficulties&rdquo; references to Article 44 are quite clearly listed.  This is one aspect of the view from the North.  But no <Col N="739" /> sooner is any change announced than people in the North&mdash;say &ldquo;It does not matter, we are not interested.&rdquo; One is in the situation where&mdash;in terms of what may be said from both sides of the Border&mdash;one cannot win. Changes are asked for and they are carried out but they are not good enough, and so on.</P>
    <P>If you change and it is the wrong change where do you stand?  For that reason I believe that the repeated views of the Taoiseach on this matter are the most desirable way of approaching it. Contrary to any impression Senator O'Higgins may have given, the Taoiseach made it quite clear that he is against piecemeal changes in the Constitution. Since Senator O'Higgins placed President de Valera's views on the record of the House, I think it appropriate to place on the record also the views of the present leader of the Fianna Fáil party with regard to the 1937 Constitution.</P>
    <P>May I quote from the Taoiseach's remarks in an article headed &ldquo;The Anglo-Irish Problem&rdquo; which appeared in the American <i>Foreign Affairs</i> Journal of July, 1972?</P>
    <P>The 1937 Constitution as it stands is not suitable for a new Ireland.</P>
    <P>He went on to spell out what he meant and said:</P>
    <P>The Constitution of the new Ireland would have to be a written one with firm and explicit guarantees for the rights and liberties of all who live under it.  I would tend to favour the view that these guarantees should relate to the individual citizen rather than to institutions as such. The Constitution makers should, perhaps, take a minimal approach, i.e. not start from broad philosophical assumptions but instead try to piece together an agreement on what is necessary for government to function while ensuring rights and liberties to the individual.</P>
    <P>That is, obviously, a much broader approach than a piecemeal approach. I would think that a much more elaborate change will come before us in due course.</P>
    <P>How can one justify this piece of <Col N="740" /> piecemeal legislation?  It certainly can be justified.  Apart from the fact that it deals with a situation which has caused apprehension and concern for one section of our community, apart from the fact that it is constantly raised as a bone of contention by people debating future relations between North and South, apart from its own merits and apart from the ecumenical context that Senator O'Higgins referred to, it is to be welcomed because it presents an opportunity to make a change of this kind and it presents an opportunity to develop, during this campaign, a feeling of thought for the concept of a new Ireland.  It affords an opportunity for people to discuss the future of Ireland in a much wider way in the years ahead.  I look forward to the campaign which will follow the passage of this legislation at a time which I hope will prove to be a time of very serious and thorough reflection on what a new Ireland will mean, on what full reconciliation of all our people will mean, on what documents are needed to ensure and guarantee every aspect of civil rights and civil liberties for all our people.</P>
    <P>Clear debate and discussion here will be an excellent preparation for the discussion which is now taking place in an all-party committee and which will, I hope, become part of the general public debate before long. I welcome this legislation at this time for its own merit.  I also welcome it as an opportunity of discussing new horizons.  This is an important change for the reasons I have already outlined. I believe it is the beginning of a time of exciting debate for all of us in the Republic.  I hope this excitement will be obvious in the referendum by a massive turn-out of voters to demonstrate their interest in these important questions, to demonstrate their awareness of the need for change and to demonstrate the fact that there are no discriminating or sectarian attitudes here and that we are anxious to take the lead in developing deeper reconciliation and understanding in every part of this island.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret I have to strike a rather sour note in this debate <Col N="741" /> but I regard this legislation and the constitutional amendment as not much more than a charade.  I believe that everybody in this House, knows that it is no more than a charade.  It is a laughably minute concession to the susceptibilities of the Northern majority.  I find that after all the labouring of the mountain, after all the tastefully printed and distributed speeches of the Taoiseach over the last few years which talked about recognising other traditions and respecting them, after all the talk and acres of newsprint that have been expended on this apparent liberalisation of the Fianna Fáil Party, we are confronted with this ridiculous little measure.  I call it that because its effect on the North of Ireland will be absolutely nil.  I have not seen the Northern Ireland papers today but I listened to the Radio Éireann programme &ldquo;It Says in the Papers&rdquo; and the passage of the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution Bill in the Dáil does not appear on the front page of the <i>Belfast Newsletter.</i></P>
      <P>In Northern Ireland there are other matters on their minds.  They are matters which can be weighed in terms of life and death.  Our tinkerings with the Constitution, which contains many matters which should never have been included in it, does not concern or preoccupy them.  To deceive ourselves that it preoccupies them or concerns them or that it is going to make any difference to their interest in us or to our aspirations towards Irish unity, which we have very languidly pursued over the last 40 or 50 years, is to represent ourselves as children to the world.  I resent very much that the way in which this Government have handled the Northern situation, ever since it became headline material about three or four years ago, has left us open to the charge of being children who only feel our own wounds, have no understanding of the matters that may have caused them and have no understanding of the hurts which other people experience.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Such a gesture should never have been made.  It was made after a lot of talk and wind and it bears a gross disparity in size to what is really needed to convince the Northern majority that <Col N="742" /> we mean business about their being brothers and that we mean business about winning their loyalty to us and to the idea which we hold of a united Ireland by consent.  By consent I do not mean a forced consent but a freely given consent.  I am sorry that my opinion is that this constitutional amendment will not go any distance in that direction.  Naturally, I shall vote for this amendment and I join with the rest of my party in recommending it to the people.  I could not do otherwise because it amounts to removing from the Constitution provisions which should never have been there.  I am on record as having said that long before I came into politics and long before I had any particular convictions favourable to any one party in this State or unfavourable to another.</P>
    <P>In this part of Ireland, during the period when the British were going through the operations of trying to kill Home Rule with kindness, there was a kind of catch-cry.  It was as follows: &ldquo;To hell with your concessions; we want our country.&rdquo;  I am afraid that I regard a concession like this towards Northern or Protestant susceptibilities as roughly analogous to what the British might have thought useful to us in, say, 1900 or 1910, had they painted our pillar boxes green and hoped that that would in some way reconcile us to being governed from Westminster.</P>
    <P>I believe that the reaction of the average Northern Protestant to this legislation will be to say: &ldquo;To hell with your concessions.  Get off my back.  Leave me in peace.  Watch your own side of the fence.  Make sure that no deadly thing comes across your Border and blows up my house, wife, child, brother, sister or myself.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>When I say &ldquo;average&rdquo; I am not speaking about men of unusual vision; I am not speaking about the occasional Protestant who is at heart a nationalist; I am just talking about the average Northern Protestant, so far as I can observe the way he thinks and behaves from reading the papers and from listening to people who have been there and from my own small experience of being there myself.  That would be my reaction if <Col N="743" /> I were a Northern Protestant.  I really think that this solemn conclave assembled here, deleting this Constitution provision and having nothing else to offer to the people in the North of Ireland, is making itself ridiculous.  I hope I am not in contempt of the House by using such language.  As usual, I have let my feelings run away with me, but we are doing something that is so pitifully inadequate to what is needed in order to reconcile is with the people we always canted about as being our sundered brethren that we might have been better off to have left in alone.</P>
    <P>Deeds speak much louder than words and my impression of the Northern majority is that they are not worried and do not care two hoots about what is in our Constitution. What they are afraid of is not a few words giving a special position to the Catholic Church.  What they are afraid of is that the Catholic Church has a special position, whether it is laid down in the Constitution or not. Although I am not and never have been anti-clerical&mdash;it is not just prudence; I do not have that disposition&mdash;I have to say in honesty to the people in the North of Ireland that that point of view is not entirely without foundation.</P>
    <P>When I look back at things in our past&mdash;some of them not associated with Fianna Fáil but associated more with my own side, like the Mother and Child episode&mdash;I have to say to myself that all constitutional tinkering and monkeying in the world will not correct the impression that episode, rightly or wrongly, made on the people in the North.  When I consider the way in which Senator Robinson's Bill was treated here, her Bill to amend the law in regard to contraception, by the Government who have still got it on the long finger, I have to ask myself&mdash;and I want to emphasise I have never been to the forefront of the move to amend this legislation&mdash;whether on the whole I would vote with Senator Robinson, because I do not think this is a matter in which the State should poke its nose.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="744" /> I have reservations about it and I am not by any means a headlong reformer in this matter.  However, when I consider it and about how it is put on the long finger by the Government, I have to ask myself whether it would make any difference to the Government if there was some way to get the green light from the Catholic Hierarchy.  I recall that the last Archbishop of Dublin, not long before he retired, expressed himself very strongly in a Lenten Pastoral against any change in the law in this regard. If I were a Northern Protestant I would say to myself&mdash;of course, I might be wrong&mdash;&ldquo;What the Archbishop of Dublin says goes and it does not matter what is in Article 44, or what goes in or is omitted.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Although I do not want to identify myself in any way with the people who are conspicious in the press and elsewhere as trying to rush headlong into the secular State, I am afraid that I would have to admit that there is ground for suspicion that the attitude of the institutional Catholic Church is a factor which plays a part in the delay in the reform of this law. Perhaps this is rightly so, and I do not necessarily fault the Fianna Fáil Government for going slow when they are dealing with a matter which is so sensitive.  It is a matter in which there is the pastoral experience of a heavily committed pastoral church, and it may have something useful to say.  I do not blame them for going slowly, but I blame them for not admitting that this is the reason, or one of the reasons, for going slowly.</P>
    <P>A little more frankness about these things would do us no harm at all and would not discredit us with the people in the North.  Let us admit that most of us who were brought up Catholic tend to regard the church into which we were born as having a rightful say in such matters.  Let us admit that even if we are in public life we cannot jump out of our skins and leave behind us the feelings, even though perhaps we may be bad Catholics, which were fed to us with our mothers' milk.  Why then pretend that it can be done so easily and why make such a sham about the whole thing? <Col N="745" /> It is perfectly obvious to me that there is ground for suspicion.  The legislation advocated by Senator Robinson and Senator West is being put on the long finger because the Catholic Church has not given the green light.</P>
    <P>My own mind is not altogether clear about the legislation, but to me that is more significant than the couple of phrases in Article 44 which are now being removed.  I am afraid that if I were a Northern Protestant it would make me dig my heels even further in.  It would confirm my suspicions which, if I were a Northern Protestant, would have been equally fed to me with my mother's milk, that Southern Irish Catholics are twisters, that you cannot trust them as far as you can throw them, that they give you a smile one side of the street and shoot you in the back as soon as you are out of sight.</P>
    <P>Of course, that is a vile untruth about the kind of people who live in this part of the country, but that is the kind of people they are and it is up to us to disarm their suspicions and we are not doing it by this trivial measure.  If we do something which really hurts politically and which might cost Fianna Fáil some votes, that is what they would understand. I do not at all suggest that we should trim our legislation, even in a matter like this or even in a matter like the contraception issue&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I did not hear Senator Honan's interruption.  I guess that he was challenging me to come down on one side or the other.  I have already done so; I have said that left to myself I believe I would, on the whole, support Senator Robinson's Bill.  I have doubts about the precise form in which the matter should be controlled but the principle is correct and the State ought not to put its nose into this area of life which is so private.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="746" /> There is a limit to what the State ought to do with the criminal law.  I have said that before and I am not ashamed to say it again.  I am ashamed to be governed by a Government which will not say these things and which will not give liberty to their own members to say them.  I hope I am not giving offence to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach when I recall that he was rapped over the knuckles and went through a period of shadow because he had the guts to say on television during the time when it was not popular to say so that he did not like the Criminal Justice Bill which the previous Minister for Justice was promoting about four years ago.  I should like to see more of that.  Because there is so little of it in the Government Party many people are driven into other parties in spite of whatever qualities Fianna Fáil may have.</P>
    <P>Deeds speak louder than words.  I have given this instance of Senator Robinson's Bill as a deed which would speak a great deal louder if it were taken seriously and promptly by the Government, whatever the Catholic Church said about it, than what we are doing now with Article 44.  I hope I shall not be represented as trying to secularise this State.  I have no time at all for the empty philosophy which talks about the secular society.  I hope that no one will spread that lie about me.  However, I still say that it would be more impressive to the Northern majority if we were to do something, whatever the Catholic Church thought, which we believed right, rather than simply remove these couple of sentences from the Constitution, and get back to the old Constitution which William Cosgrave's Government was so reviled for defending.</P>
    <P>I should like to make one last comment in regard to this principle that deeds speak louder than words.  I ask Members of this House to put themselves in the position of a Northern Protestant family, perhaps one with no particular connections with the Unionist Party or the Orange Order or anything like that.  Suppose they were related to the Protestant bus <Col N="747" /> driver who was shot to pieces in front of his mother and children at the beginning of this year because he was going to give evidence the next day in a bus hijacking case.  If you were a friend, relation or neighbour of that unfortunate man&mdash;for whom no flags were at half mast in this part of the country&mdash;what would your impression be on reading that the Parliament of the Irish Republic had solemnly excised a couple of sentences from the Constitution which gave the Catholic Church a special position? Would it stir your heart, now turned to stone, against people who you thought sympathised with the IRA? Would it move that heart or soften it or tend to make it look more favourably at the Tricolour with all its symbolism? It is a very optimistic man who would answer &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to that question.</P>
    <P>It would speak louder for our intentions towards the North if we made sure that in so far as we can do it, as I have said in this House so many times before, no one will die up there because of any word or deed of ours.  Our aspirations could well be kept in a bottle and corked and put away on a shelf until the violence has gone out of the situation up there.</P>
    <P>I know there is a point of view, it may be a sincerely held one, that there never will be peace up there except in an all-Ireland context.  I should like the people who say that with such assurance to back it up with a bit of rational argument instead of waving a flag.  I do not doubt the sincerity of that point of view but I believe it to be wrong.  Peace is perfectly conceivable within the boundaries of the Six Counties.</P>
    <P>I do not like to have to say this because I should like to see a united Ireland just the same as any other Senator in this House.  People who take it on themselves to prophesy that there will never be peace in Ireland while the Border remains have got heavy responsibilities on their sould because that kind of prophesy, if I were Mr. Hull or Captain Ardell or Mr. Craig, would make me reach for my gun.  That is <Col N="748" /> what we are seeing.  Anyone down here who takes it on himself to make a prophesy of that kind and to speak that kind of language may have to answer for it to a serious judgment seat some day.</P>
    <P>Last year in this House I pointed out provisions in the Offences Against the State Act which had lain idle and which might be invoked in order to give the impression in the North that we were serious about trying to prevent bloodshed up there.  I drew attention in this House to the provision which enabled the closure of buildings which were believed to be used for the purposes of an illegal organisation.  It did not happen until now&mdash;several hundred deaths later&mdash;that a direct connection was seen between the deaths and the fact that some buildings were open, but I pointed it out as an instance of how this Government, have dragged their feet in things which possibly might have been directly effective in killing violence&mdash;I do not want to claim that they would have been&mdash;but they would have made a better impression in the North on the people we are trying to win over.</P>
    <P>The same thing goes for the control of firearms and explosives, and Members of this House may remember the tussles which the Minister for Justice, Deputy O'Malley, and our party had when the Firearms Bill was being passed and with Deputy Brennan, the Minister for Labour, when the Explosive Substances Bill was going through. I tried to get the Minister to admit that the powers which he proposed to use under this Bill were not wide enough.  I said that I was in favour of calling in every gun in the country in so far as those guns were within the Minister's jurisdiction, even if only to reassure the people in the North that we were doing something about the situation.  I said the same about explosive substances and was laughed at from the Fianna Fáil side because they pointed out that there were certain kinds of combinations of washing powder and sugar and so on, which could cause an explosion and they asked if I were going to control them. Now I find that there is an order in front of the House controlling a substance <Col N="749" /> which has a perfectly legitimate industrial use but which&mdash;as was well known then&mdash;could be used in a way dangerous to human life.  These are the things about which the Government have dragged their heels.</P>
    <P>I believe there are some Ministers in the Government who genuinely would like to get ahead in the way I am suggesting but they are being dragged down by the dead weight of their colleagues and party which in the political spectrum shave off imperceptibly into people who think that the name &ldquo;republican&rdquo; entitles them to do what they damn well like, whether the law forbids it or not. That is the dead weight which is holding the whole country back.</P>
    <P>Although I hope I am willing to give the Government credit when they deserve it, that is one of the main reasons why I want to see a change of Government.  I am sick of this country being ruled and its affairs and relations with the North being determined by a Government which have to look over their shoulder at their so-called republican supporters.  That is the reason for this tip-toe approach towards the North and, after all the labouring, this is brought before us solemnly as only the fifth amendment to the Constitution in 35 years.  It will weigh nothing in the balance against what we ought to be doing and what we are being faulted by our so-called brethren for not doing.</P>
    <P>I support the Bill because it tends to excise something from the Constitution which never ought to have been there.  I am sorry if I introduced a sour note.  I could not go on record in this House without making it clear that even though this Bill has to be supported I regard it as a drop in a large bucket and I see no sign of the Government being willing to put any more water into the bucket unless they can be sure it will not cost them votes.</P>

      <P>I welcome this Bill which is a change from our recognition of certain statistical facts to actually a guarantee of certain religious <Col N="750" /> guarantees.  I welcome it in that respect.  It is fair to say that through the years we have had many criticisms of this particular section from politicians in England and Northern Ireland.  They, too, should look at their legislation at this point and make it tone in with us and help to get things back to normality.  I should like to bring the attention of those who would criticise us to the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, which is the Constitution of the Six Counties.  Section 65 (1) of that Act has a certain provision for Freemasons. I quote from the section:</P>
      <P>It is hereby declared that existing enactments relative to unlawful oaths or unlawful assemblies in Ireland do not apply to the meetings or proceedings of the Grand Lodge of free and accepted masons of Ireland or of any lodge or society recognised by the Grand Lodge.</P>
      <P>Section 2 provides:</P>
      <P>Neither the Parliament of Southern Ireland nor the Parliament of Northern Ireland shall have power to abrogate or effect prejudicially any privilege or exemption of the Grand Lodge of Freemasons in Ireland or any lodge or society recognised by the Grand Lodge which is enjoyed either by law or custom at the time of the passing of this Act, and any law made in contravention of this provision shall so far as it is in contravention of this Act be void.</P>
      <P>While this remains in the statute book in England and Northern Ireland those people have little right to criticise the special position of the Catholic Church and argue against something which is a statistical fact and a fact that will remain irrespective of whether the State recognises it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is not intended to bring us any nearer to the North because no legislation, whether on divorce, contraception or any type of legalised prostitution, or whatever you like to call it, will effect the unification of this country.  The only way to effect the unification of this country is the way the Taoiseach has said and which we <Col N="751" /> are striving to achieve, that is to bring our social services and our standard of living into line with the North.  Then many Northern unionists will be happy to come and live among us in positions which pay well and give them good standards of living. This amendment of the Constitution will not affect them.  The loyalty of the average Northern Unionist is not to the Crown; it is to the half-crown.</P>

      <P>Despite what Senator Kelly said, the Members of both Houses and all political parties are to be congratulated in their united determination to eliminate discrimination or alleged discrimination on religious grounds.  After such a display of determination in this respect we should see the same determination and unity in the future to eliminate discrimination in every walk of life such as economic, social, legal matters, <i>et cetera</i>&mdash;discrimination not only between various sections of our own community but between our own community as a whole and the Northern community as a whole.</P>
      <P>I know as much about Northern workers as anyone in this House.  I have frequently to attend meetings in Belfast, Derry, Newry.  Despite all these contacts with Northern workers since trouble began again there some years ago, and having attended perhaps hundreds of meetings attended by Catholic and Protestant workers, I have never heard one reference to Article 44, to divorce or to contraception. All my dealings with Northern people have been concerned with economic and social matters and only this morning, as the last speaker stated, there appeared in the press an account of a report issued by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions making a comparison between social welfare benefits in the North and in the South.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Figures produced by Congress show that a man with a wife and two children earning £24 per week would in the North get unemployment or sickness benefit of £19.20.  In the South he would get £11 approximately.  Comparisons regarding other matters are also made, such as graduated pension schemes, <i>et cetera</i>.  I agree entirely with <Col N="752" /> Senator Kelly that this proposed amendment of the Constitution is a start and displays our sincerity, but its amendment in this limited regard will have absolutely no impact on Northern people and will not resolve the problems existing there.  Unless we can demonstrate clearly to the Northern people that economically and socially they will be at least as well off in a united Ireland, then all talk about amending Article 44, about divorce, about contraception, will have no affect on its own.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>The touch of reality which Senators Kelly and Kennedy introduced into this debate is welcome. We ought to see how our actions affect the views of people in the North and I agree with Senator Kelly's statement that this amendment of the Constitution will virtually have no effect on the situation in so far as the Northern Unionists are concerned. If we really want to show the Northern majority that the Catholic Church has a position which is not special in the sense that it has undue power and influence in the South, we ought to tackle some of the difficult and sensitive areas of legislation in which a Government might come into conflict with the Church.</P>
      <P>The fact that the step which is proposed is generally agreed by all religious denominations in this part of the country to be one which should be taken and which should have been taken some time ago points out that this piece of legislation is not likely to be contentious and that essentially we are solving a simple problem.</P>
      <P>We are faced with two different tasks.  One is the creation of a Constitution for a new Ireland.  This means we will have to create something entirely new which will be acceptable to people on both sides of the Border.  As Senator Keery has stated, this is also the view of the Taoiseach when he stated in his article in <i>Foreign Affairs,</i> Vol. 50, No. 4 July, 1972&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It should be clear that a united Ireland will not be an Ireland in which the present state in the &ldquo;South&rdquo; takes over the &ldquo;North&rdquo; and assimilates it into existing structures. There should be negotiation, <Col N="753" /> but it should be about a NEW Ireland...</P>
    <P>...the constitution of this NEW Ireland...must reflect the values and meet the legitimate interests of all sections of the population.</P>
    <P>This is the first problem.  However, we have a duty in this part of the country to deal with the Constitution which binds us and I support this move to delete the sections of Article 44 in which particular churches are named.</P>
    <P>It is clear that many of the sensitive areas and many of the problems and divisions in this country, thinking particularly about the North, are divisions that run along religious lines.  The churches have an important role to play in the establishment of harmony and in the building of bridges between the communities.  I am encouraged by the fact that the Roman Catholic Hierarchy recently issued an open-ended invitation to the Irish Council of Churches, which is the body representing the main Protestant denominations, to come together to discuss the problems which cause division.  There are the problems of inter-marriage and the <i>Ne Temere</i> decree, the problem of integrated education, the problems involved in family morality.  The coming together of the churches to discuss these problems means that some progress is being made towards dealing with these particularly sensitive areas in which a change in attitude is needed more than a change in legislation.  It is the task of the Church to do something about changing that attitude.  It is not an impossible task.</P>
    <P>The Anglican and Roman Catholic Churches appointed a working party which produced a statement about the interpretation of the Eucharist, which was one of the areas of division and dispute between those two churches. The working party, which was composed of theologians from both churches in equal numbers, came to an agreement so full and comprehensive that it really showed that, if people get down to analysing what their position is, finding out what their true views are and seeing where they lie <i>vis-á-vis</i> the people on the opposite side of the fence, it is possible to <Col N="754" /> hammer out agreements in these difficult and delicate areas.</P>
    <P>The churches have a tremendous role to play in bringing about harmony in Ireland.  As political institutions&mdash;for that is how they often are seen to act&mdash;they have a great deal of guilt to bear for the present situation. These problems have never been admitted as problems before.  The <i>Ne Temere</i> decree is applied with rigour in this part of the country while in other parts of the world it is regarded as an obsolete piece of church law.  I speak for my part of Ireland, County Cork, where the <i>Ne Temere</i> decree is still applied with the utmost rigour. Speaking as a member of a minority church there are always great problems to be faced by a couple who wish to marry but who hold different beliefs.  It is up to the churches, instead of making it more difficult for those people, to work out ways to help them and not just stick to worn out formulate which prove a complete hindrance to one of the parties involved. They should work out a way in which they could give some meaningful help and guidance to people faced with these problems.  I am encouraged that the churches in Ireland are meeting to discuss these topics. We need changes in attitude and this applies to the North and South, much more than changes in legislation.</P>
    <P>This particular change in legislation which we are contemplating is indicative of a change of attitude which has taken place since the 1937 Constitution was drawn up.  I agree with Senator Kelly when he said there are many things in this Constitution which should not be in a Constitution, whatever one's personal views or the views of any single institution such as a church may be.</P>
    <P>The Constitution is there.  It has faults.  Let us deal with them.  Even if this is a small step, at least it is a welcome one.  I hope that we will shortly adopt a recommendation of the 1967 all-party committee on the Constitution that:</P>
    <P>It would now be appropriate to replace the claim of the present Parliament and Government to jurisdiction over the whole island <Col N="755" /> made by Article 3 with these words: &ldquo;the Irish nation hereby proclaims its firm will that its territory be reunited in harmony and brotherly affection between all Irishmen&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>One of the things we want to be clear about is what we mean by Irish unity.  I do not like to use that word. I prefer to use the word &ldquo;harmony&rdquo; because the very word &ldquo;unity&rdquo; tends to raise the Unionist hackles at the moment.  In my view unity is a far off goal.  Let us talk about working together first and then see what emerges from that.  Have we any notion of the sacrifices that this part of the country will have to make if this real harmony is to be achieved?</P>
    <P>Senator Kennedy has mentioned the discrepancy in social welfare benefits.  This has been well and clearly set out in a recent book by Deputy FitzGerald in which he has gone into the question of these discrepancies in a more thorough way than has been done before.  There is no point in trying to skate over the problem.  There is a great discrepancy. If British support is slowly withdrawn and if we have to foot the bill as this financial support is withdrawn, it will be a huge bill.  However it is spread out, the people in the South will have to make great financial sacrifices.  We should face this honestly.  We should ask ourselves: are we going to make these sacrifices with the aim of solving the Irish problem?</P>
    <P>A great many people in the South may not be prepared to make the sacrifices involved.  If this was said clearly, when the extent of these sacrifices is known, it would help to partially allay the fears which the Unionists in the North continually have about absorption by the South. The constant idea in the North is that the South is just waiting to jump over the border and take them in.  If the truth were known and if our real feelings were brought to the surface and analysed, nothing could be farther from the truth.</P>
    <P>When we realise what is involved, many people will take a second look at the whole question.  If people were <Col N="756" /> to say in public: &ldquo;We are not prepared to make these sacrifices&rdquo; it would help the Unionist to get his view of us into perspective.  One of the key factors in the situation is that the Northern Unionist has a distorted view of how we see this whole problem of Irish unity.  If we looked at it more honestly, began to add up what it means, what it will cost us and what our reaction would be then, this would help to clear the mind of the Northern Unionist.  The snowball has started to gather momentum in the North.  Changes are bound to accelerate. British will withdraw sooner or later.  The Northern and Southern parts of the country have got to face this.  There will be absolutely no alternative for either of us but to get down to it, work together, try to sort things out.  In that way we shall find what the problems really are.</P>
    <P>There is no alternative.  Whatever the parliamentary structure, whatever the federal structure, whatever way the new Irelands emerges, if we do not fact these problems by buildings bridges between the communities and by starting to see and understand the other person's point of view and his fears of us, we will face the dreadful situation which will entail increasing violence with the inevitable intervention of the UN.</P>
    <P>Whenever the United Nations troops appear on Irish soil then Ireland acknowledges her failure.  We will then have failed as Irishmen, North and South.  Let us face it, we have not made any great effort in this direction so far.  I know there are people on both sides of the House who have endeavoured to build bridges between the communities to open up communication across the sectarian barrier in order to examine the thoughts and feelings of the people on the other side of the fence, but the time has come for each and every one of us to make a greater effort.</P>
    <P>Senator Kelly helped to put matters into perspective when he spoke about the view of the average Unionist. Members of the House will have received a copy of John Robb's pamphlet which was published last week. It is clear that John Robb's views are not the views of the average Unionist <Col N="757" /> but if one looks at his approach to the new Ireland problem one can see his open-minded attitude and realise that if this attitude is shared by at least a small section of the Ulster Protestants it should give is encouragement in our efforts to build bridges to enable people to get together and talk about their real problems, not just to pay lip service to the old formulae, and to get down to working out what the new Ireland will be.  I have no doubt that in that new Ireland we will need a totally new Constitution and we will need totally new structures from our present ones. But that is no reason why we, in the Republic, should not tackle the problems that our present Constitution has created.</P>
    <P>As Senator Kelly has mentioned, we should get down to acknowledging that the difficult problems of family morality in which the criminal law or the Constitution are involved have to be tackled fairly and honestly.  The sooner the churches start discussing these problems the better for everybody. I believe that there should not be a clause in the criminal law which prevents the sale of contraceptives. There should not be an article in the Constitution which prevents the enactment of divorce legislation.  The all-party committee on the Constitution has reported on other articles of the Constitution which need to be amended.  The Government should put some of their more difficult recommendations into force.  In this way we can start to allay the fears of the Northern Unionists.  One way or the other, we should deal with these problems in our own context.  They need to be solved.</P>
    <P>This amendment of the Constitution is a small start in that direction and I hope the Government will continue to press forward with other amendments.  For my part I will endeavour to encourage the Government to move so that we can get a Constitution to which we can totally subscribe.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiBrugha" hpid="Ruairí Brugha Ruairí Brugha">
      <NameTxt>Ruairí Brugha</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment of the Constitution lends itself to a very wide debate.  There is a committee sitting on many of the questions that have been raised and I would prefer <Col N="758" /> at this stage not to go into the broader issues.  While sub-article (2) of Article 44 did not appear to have any real meaning over the years a situation has been created by people in the North which has given to this subsection an appearance of sectarianism. That is one reason I am glad to see the sub-article being repealed. It seems a rather negative reason for abolishing that sub-article but in the present circumstances it is a valid one.</P>
      <P>Another reason for its abolition is the danger of legal interpretation of the meaning of the sub-article.  Senator Keery has already referred to a case which is cited in the courts.  A third reason which has been mentioned by Senator West is that it may help to clear the air in so far as Northern Protestants are concerned and perhaps allay their fears.  If it succeeds in that regard it is a very good reason for introducing this amendment.</P>
      <P>If the repeal of this sub-article and sub-article (2) is likely to contribute in any way to an improvement in understanding or to a lessening of tension in Northern Ireland, I would be very much in favour of it.  If such an exercise in democracy on our part were to contribute to the preservation of even one life it would be well worth while.  I am in favour of this amendment of the Constitution and will urge the electorate to support it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to begin my contribution by agreeing with the sentiments that have been expressed, more frequently on this side of the House than the other, on the possible effect on public opinion in Northern Ireland of the passage of this Bill and of the subsequent referendum proposals. I am not as familiar with the North of Ireland as Senator Kennedy. I do not claim any special knowledge of the North of Ireland but I know enough about it and I know enough people there of different political and religious affiliations to be able to state with some certainty that there are important facts about Northern public opinion which are simply not recognised down here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We in the Republic tend to believe <Col N="759" /> that the population of the North of Ireland is divided into two groups, one of which is favourable to the idea of a united Ireland, the other of which is hostile to the idea.  This kind of judgment of the situation tends to colour very strongly our reactions and very often our concrete actions and proposals. We must face the fact that a substantial proportion of the Unionist population of Northern Ireland is not so much hostile to the idea of a united Ireland: they are simply not interested in the idea.  They are not interested in it and do not want to hear about it.</P>
    <P>They have been living there for half a century or so under their present constitutional arrangements.  Those arrangements and the society which has evolved under them is perfectly satisfactory to them.  I am not saying that it is satisfactory to me or that I would necessarily agree with this particular Northern Unionist point of view.  However, we have to accept this as one of the basic facts of the situation.  We may say that unwittingly they are ignorant of some factors about their society which obtained greater prominence here.  They say that they just do not want to know.  What they are hostile to, more obviously, is not any idea of a united Ireland, as such, but to the idea of change.  People everywhere are, if not hostile to, at least suspicious of change.  In order to try to explain what I think the Northern Unionist population feel about change I should like to try to invert the situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="An Leas-Chathaoirleach An Leas-Chathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Chathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I hesitate to intervene, but I would ask the Senator to relate his remarks to the proposal that is before the House. While the background against which the proposal is made, or the effect of the proposal, is certainly in order, we are concerned with proposals to amend the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly.  We have before us at the moment a proposal to amend the Constitution.  It is being said that one of the reasons why we should amend the Constitution is, in the words of the 1967 all-party committee on the Constitution, to dispel any doubts and suspicions which may linger in the minds of non-Catholics, <Col N="760" /> North and South of the Border.  I ask the House what would their reaction be if a reconstituted Stormont, sitting today, took up the Government of Ireland Act, of which Senator Gallanagh complains, and proposed to remove from that Act provisions relating to the Order of Freemasons? If, in the debate for the removal of that proposal, the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland, whoever he might be on that occasion, said that removal of this provision would dispel any doubts and suspicions which may linger in the minds of Catholics, north and south of the Border, about the wisdom of the re-incorporation of the Republic of Ireland into the United Kingdom, this really is the level of absurdity with which this contention must be treated.  When we argue, as is being argued, that the passage of this proposal and the subsequent amendment of the Constitution would help to resolve the Irish problem, we have to accept&mdash;as Senator Kelly has accepted&mdash;that it is at least possible, however unlikely, that the Irish problem in so far as it exists in the North of Ireland at the moment can be resolved at least temporarily in a Northern Ireland context.  We would then find ourselves in the position of having discussed constitutional reforms in the context of Irish reunification until we were blue in the face, only to discover that the people on whose behalf we are supposedly enacting this legislation, and passing these referenda, are simply not interested. The Irish Government, for all their goodwill, would have brought their constitutional harp to the party and nobody would have asked them to play.  This is a possibility that nobody is seriously considering here and must be set against the kind of drone of approval for the proposition that we need to pass this referendum in order to improve relationships between the North and South and between the communities in the North.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Constitutional reform, such as we are discussing here, has two aspects. One is the aspect in connection with Irish reunification.  The other is connected with constitutional reform on its own merits.  To me, it is an extraordinary and dispiriting fact that <Col N="761" /> when we discuss a constitutional reform like this, we are stressing the least relevant of these two aspects.  We tend to stress the effect, real or supposed, it would have on Irish unification and decline to discuss the whole question on its merits.  Instead of discussing the whole question on its merits, we get a whole lot of talk about something called UI, which is nothing more or less than an excuse for postponing action, an excuse for inaction and for inactivity.  I must confess that I never realised, until I became a Member of this House and started to study politics more closely, what an incredible political weapon inertia can be, and has become in the hands of this Government.</P>
    <P>We tend to discuss constitutional reform in terms of a new Ireland. The most concrete statement in regard to this that I have managed to find was made by the Taoiseach himself, in an article in the November issue of <i>The Cross</i>.  He said:</P>
    <P>I feel that the new Ireland should be regarded as an entirely new political entity which should work out and enact for itself its own Constitution, with firm and explicit guarantees for all who are to live under it.  I have also suggested, not so much on grounds of general principle as for pragmatic reasons, that subject to the inclusion of these guarantees such a Constitution would be more easily worked out if it were a minimal document which would not demand nor presuppose agreement on broad philosophical assumptions.  Problems would arise as to the extent to which community morality, which frequently reflects religious beliefs, should be given effect in social and legal institutions. It would help to minimise, though not eliminate, these difficulties if we did not regard the Constitution as a comprehensive statement of community beliefs on the lines of a creed but rather as a document to enable the institutions of the State to function within certain defined limits.</P>
    <P>Basically there is nothing in that with which I disagree, but I find fault <Col N="762" /> with the unwillingness of the Taoiseach and the Government to take the logic of those sentiments and to follow them to their natural conclusions. Before the excerpt which I have quoted the Taoiseach remarked, in the context of Irish unity:</P>
    <P>I do not believe the existing Irish Constitution is suitable for that purpose.</P>
    <P>The question which has neither been asked nor answered is whether the existing Irish Constitution is suitable for the existing Irish State.  It has not been asked because it could only be answered in one way and that is a way which would commit the Government to a much more radical and widespread constitutional reform now irrespective of unity, a course of action to which it would unwillingly indeed commit itself.  We have a right to demand a commitment from the Government to constitutional reform now.  The Taoiseach has spoken, and I quoted his words, on the kind of Constitution which would be suitable for a new and united Ireland.  I put it to him and to the Government that they should accept the logic of their own arguments.  If a Constitution is good enough for a new and united Ireland it is equally good enough for a rather shop-soiled and disunited Ireland.  If there are arguments in favour of a new Constitution for a united Ireland they must be seen to be equally strong in favour of a new Constitution for the existing State.  In the light of what the Taoiseach has said it is almost certain that it would be objected to.  If we accepted the advisability of this course of action, we would only be leaving ourselves in the position where we would again have to embark on a constitutional revision if by any chance Irish unity became a potential or an established fact.  This argument can be easily answered.  The 1937 Constitution, which we are now proposing to amend, was supposedly enacted for the entire island of Ireland.  This is evident, not only in Article 3, which has caused a certain amount of controversy, but also in Article 15, subsection (2) of section 2, which reads:</P>
    <P>Provision may, however, be made <Col N="763" /> by law for the creation or recognition of subordinate legislatures and for the powers and functions of these legislatures.</P>
    <P>This is the kind of section which was inserted in the Constitution at that time with a view to the eventual reunification of the country.  When I advocate as my response to this proposal by the Government the need for a completely new Constitution along the lines spelled out by the Taoiseach, but now, and not at some date in the future, I am doing no more than suggesting that we should do what Mr. de Valera did in 1937.</P>
    <P>I have been somewhat amused to hear the 1937 Constitution defended by arguments which take the form of attacks on the 1922 Constitution as one which was imposed on us by the British. If we are going to adopt this sort of criteria for the validation of our constitutional and other arrangements it is a pity that we have not been so quick to throw out other things that we have inherited from the British Government and their system of administration.  Two things that come to my mind are the corporal punishment of children and the widespread patronage system which is part of our political life today.  The basic point I am making is one of serious dissatisfaction with the Bill before us as a totally unhelpful, irrelevant and unnecessary answer to a problem which exists independently of the question of Irish unity, related to it perhaps at some level but in most important respects independent of it.  We should have an explicit commitment from the Government to a more widespread and fundamental reform.</P>
    <P>If one looks at the voting figures for the 1937 Constitution we will see what an incredibly slender popular base it rests on.  Assuming that the population of Ireland in 1936 was 100 per cent, the voting at the plebiscite was as follows: for the Constitution, 26 per cent; against the Constitution, 20 per cent; eligible to vote, but did not vote, 22 per cent; ineligible to vote&mdash; the residents of Northern Ireland&mdash; 32 per cent.  In other words, not even in the area to which it was immediately <Col N="764" /> intended to apply, did a net majority support this Constitution. More people stayed away or voted against it in the Twenty-six Counties than took the trouble to go to the polls to support it.  Taking the country as a whole, it follows that we are now living under a Constitution designed supposedly for the whole island, of which only a fraction more than one quarter of the people have signified their acceptance.</P>
    <P>My final point is in connection with some of the terminology which has been used.  From time to time we have heard talk about concessions.  I hope that the Government might agree with me that when we are talking about amending our Constitution and the possibility of drafting a new Constitution &ldquo;concessions&rdquo; is not the terminology we should be using.  Unfortunately, it is a terminology which is in widespread use.  If we are more sophisticated, we speak about concessions to the Northern Unionists.  If we are less sophisticated, we speak about concessions to the Northern Protestants.  The people who use this terminology will not accept that we are not talking here in terms of concessions, but in terms of basic rights.</P>
    <P>I must endorse Senator West when he criticised, among other things, the present Constitution for its section on divorce legislation.  This is an area in which the concession terminology has been abused to the point where it makes one's head spin.  To people who say that there should be divorce legislation in our country, the retort is generally made that the Anglicans, Methodists or Presbyterians do not believe in divorce, as if divorce was some article of faith alongside the Trinity.</P>
    <P>Senator Kerry stated that this is not a concessional question nor a sectarian question, but a civil rights question.  This is the basis on which this particular question, and all questions relating to the kind of basic rights which should be enshrined in the Constitution, should be related.</P>
    <P>I accept this Bill and this proposal for what it is&mdash;a tiny and minimalist gesture at a time a when what we really need is a full-scale revision of our Constitution to make it one which <Col N="765" /> would certainly be acceptable in this part of the country, and arguably, if we did the job properly, acceptable to everyone in Ireland.  I have argued that in doing this we would not be doing anything we have not done before, as this is precisely what Mr. de Valera did in 1937, but we might be doing it rather better and with our eyes open.</P>

      <P>When Senator Horgan gave that series of figures about the voting for the 1937 Constitution he inspired me to remember the words used by Senator O'Higgins when he hoped a quotation from the debates of that time would serve as a sort of <i>aide-memoire</i> to those of us in the House who did not remember what was going on.  I know a lot about what was going on at the time as I was one of those who put that Constitution across.  The speakers here today who have criticised the 1937 Constitution do not realise, or if so they have not referred to it, that it is a very difficult thing to persuade the people to make a departure from accepted arguments such as was involved in that Constitution, which was a Republican Constitution, and was fundamentally the law of a Republican State, within such a short period after the unfortunate events which occurred in this country within the memory of the majority of the people who at that time had votes.</P>
      <P>We were in a war situation then. The date given by Senator O'Higgins for the extract from Mr. de Valera's speech was June 14th, 1937.  In 1937 we were the victims of a brutal assault by the British Government on our cattle trade and on our exports generally. We were defending ourselves to the best of our ability to maintain our independence against an onslaught which, thank God, failed.</P>

      <P>As I have stated, there was a war situation.  Allied to that was the fact that there was a disgraceful campaign carried on by the Fine Gael and Labour Parties at that time, aided and abetted by the Trade Union Congress, which befuddled the minds of a number of people about what was or was not allowed under the Constitution. Every effort was made to spread panic, doubt and fear amongst the people as to what was to come upon them if they were stupid enough to vote for the enactment of that document.  It was also the culmination of the tearing up of the last of the shackles, except the one big one, which bound us to the Treaty legislation of 1922.  It was the end of the scraps of paper which were left in the 1922 Constitution which had been demolished, article by article, over the previous five years.</P>
      <P>Senator Kelly had a nostalgic desire to get back to the 1922 Constitution. On reflection, I think he would like to amend that statement and make it relevant to the religious clauses, but not to the 1922 Constitution with its dictated articles and its imposed phraseology.  We were in the position that the Constitution of the so-called Irish Free State at that time had been destroyed, taken to pieces, wiped out and a new Constitution was necessary. This particular Article 44 was submitted to the heads of all the churches in this part of Ireland at that time and there were no objections.  Nobody said there was any discrimination or any reason for a misunderstanding. The Constitution was under debate publicly for two months in the newspapers and in the Dáil.  One lone voice was raised to query its advisability, and that was an Independent, Senator Frank MacDermott.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was no heed taken of Article <Col N="767" /> 44 and to say now, after 35 years, that this should not have been inserted into the Constitution and that this was a Fianna Fáil blunder shows how little people who use those words appreciate the difficulty of getting that Constitution passed.  It was not easy to fight the combination presented by the two parties, the Trade Union Congress, the press and by a number of big business concerns and the banks.  It was necessary to insert into that Constitution phraseology which might not have been used had the situation been normal.</P>
    <P>The Constitution was in this way enacted and I remember very well making a round-up of all the newspapers here and in the Six Counties&mdash; the <i>Belfast Newsletter,</i> the <i>Northern Whig, et cetera,</i> and the British newspapers as well.  I did not see in any of those papers any reference to Article 44 as being detrimental to the Protestant minority here or as being discriminatory against any minority in this part of the country or as giving the Catholic Church any power over any other church.  Surely some of those newspapers would have adverted to this if there had been that &ldquo;stupid blunder&rdquo; which has been referred to here today.</P>
    <P>Thirty-five years have passed and until this Constitution Committee began their labours we heard no word of objection from all these pressure groups who are now operating to get this Constitution torn up and a new one substituted.  People who speak like that do not know what they are talking about.  They may have read Article 44.  They may have read one or two of the other Articles, particularly the one dealing with the Irish language, to which all these hostile people have an instinctive objection. They do not realise what is contained in the Constitution or what it provides for in black and white, otherwise they would not talk such silly nonsence that the whole document must be scrapped.</P>

      <P>It is a document that I am very proud to stand <Col N="768" /> over.  The people were very happy under it for the past 35 years.  The first two paragraphs of Article 44 provided for the recognition of a fact. It gave no power to the Catholic Church above that of any other church.  There is no need for those words.  Had it been possible at that time to draft a normal type of Constitution, there might have been different wording.  The Catholic Church was not noted for its adherence to republicanism nor for its support of any movement which had as its goal the establishment of an independent 32-county republic.</P>
      <P>Senator Kelly told us today how cowardly the Government are and that they are running away from amending other Articles in the Constitution and in the laws, because they did not get the &ldquo;green light&rdquo; from the church.  Senator Kelly, if I remember correctly, is a Professor of Constitutional Law and he ought to know what he is talking about.  He should not make such stupid statements. Fianna Fáil Governments have never run away from the Catholic Church or any other church.</P>

      <P>Fianna Fáil have always stood up to pressure from any quarter, clerical or lay, and will continue to do so because of the proud tradition which they have.  To refresh Senator Kelly's mind, we must remember the Mother and Child Scheme of which he spoke, the Adoption Act and the shortened birth certificate.  These did not meet with approval in ecclesiastical quarters but the Fianna Fáil Government put them through.  They should be part of the law in any civilised country.  There is nothing wrong with that.  The Government will not be dictated to from any quarter such as Senator Kelly has suggested.  It is wrong to create the impression in a debate of this nature that the Government in this part of Ireland are subservient to any church, or afraid to advance legislation because they might step on the toes of a bishop, a cardinal or the Hierarchy.  That is entirely wrong.  It does not sound good coming from those who claim they are trying <Col N="769" /> to ease the position <i>vis-à-vis</i> the North.</P>
      <P>With regard to Article 44 of the Constitution, it means nothing so far as factual power is concerned.  It does not give greater power to the Catholic Church.  Its removal will not convince a single Unionist that he will be better off, or freer in any way than had the Constitution remained unchanged.  Idle though the exercise might be in the eyes of Senator Horgan and Senator West, that it is only a &ldquo;mickey-mouse&rdquo; job to remove this Article which means nothing, the fact remains that it is being used, twisted and distorted by ill-minded people, who have not the interests of the whole Irish nation at heart, as an example of clerical control over the lives of the people.  If only for the reason it is being used not for the purpose of achieving unity, but in the interests of the good name of this country which is being tarnished by this type of subtle suggestion that an Article such as this in the Constitution shows that we are a church-ridden people and have a church-ridden Government and regime, it is well worth removing this Article from the Constitution.</P>
      <P>There is no reason why anybody should lose any sleep because this Article is to be deleted.  I remember what the newspapers said when the Constitution was enacted.  We do not have to go back that far in history. We have high and low churchmen of other denominations paying tribute to the religious freedom here and to the lack of discrimination, and testifying that this Article means little or nothing to them.  I hope that as a result of this debate this Bill will be passed and when it comes before the people all the parties who committed themselves to it will work hard to get the people to approve of the removal of this Article from the Constitution. A defeat or a small vote might lead to misrepresentation or misunderstanding. It is the duty of every citizen of goodwill, who values the future of the country and who would like to see religious, political and social harmoney restored, to help in every way to get as big a majority as is possible for this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Kennedy, Senator West and <Col N="770" /> Senator Horgan spoke about the prospects for unity not being very good until our social services were as good as the British.  I heard some statements one night from two impudent Northern politicians named Fitt and Devlin.  I was really astonished to hear the Chief Whip of the Social Democratic and Labour Party speaking on the radio giving his view that it did not matter a damn what we removed from the Constitution. He said if we did not have pounds, shillings and pence as good as they had in the North there was no use talking to them.  He meant himself and those he represented, apparently.  It is not alone the Unionists we have to contend with, not the lads from Sandy Row and the Shankill, but these people who value the social services they have there to such an extent that they insist that the last penny here must equal what they have in the North&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;forgetful of the fact that a vast subsidy is being paid by an outside Government to maintain those subsidies in the North, forgetful of the fact that the insurance contributions in the North are higher than ours.  If that is the idealism with which that party, and any others who agree with them, are trying to attract the support of the people, then it is a poor look-out whether you remove one, two, three or four Articles of the Constitution, if that is the best we are going to get as a result of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Higgins also made a point in connection with the 1937 Constitution that that Constitution was intended to last for all time.  Nothing lasts for all time.  The people who drew up that Constitution realised that fact also. The result was that they inserted Article 46 which provided the possibility for the people in the future, if they so wished, to change not alone the Constitution or any of the Articles it contained but to do away with it altogether.  There was no impediment to changing the Constitution; the provision was there whether it was <Col N="771" /> required or not and it enables us to deal with any situation which might arise in the present time.</P>
    <P>If we are to have a Constitution for a new Ireland, or any sort of Ireland, it must be one which will provide for the rights and liberties of the people in the same way as the Republican Constitution of 1937 provided for the rights and liberties of the people.  I recommend those who speak on the Constitution to read it all and not be satisfied merely with the few Articles on which we are speaking.  It is very important when speaking on this matter not to attempt to hide facts.  There has been a refreshing candour in this debate today, from both sides of the House.  We are all better informed than when the debate began.  It has been conducted on a high standard and I hope this Bill will pass without undue delay.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to begin by apologising to the Leader of the House for interrupting him when he was speaking.  Normally I should have been in a more somnolent condition at this time of the day but his eloquence unfortunately disturbed me into the interruption which was disorderly, even though it was based on a correct view of the history which he was relating.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the matter which is our concern today, I should like to express the sense that, in so far as the removal of these sections of this Article of the Constitution is designed to remove an obstacle to the unity of Ireland and the unity of Irishmen&mdash; when speaking of unity I prefer to think more of the unity of Irishmen than of the unity of Ireland&mdash;we may have the wrong accused in the box. I would not be prepared to accept the view that the chief obstacle to the unity of Irishmen in this country is the influence of the Catholic Church, the Holy Catholic and Apostolic and Roman Church, or whatever way it is described in the Constitution.  If that influence was greater than it is and has been over the last few years, there would have been less murder, less maiming and less arson.  The only <Col N="772" /> Protestants in this world which I dislike are the Protestants within the Irish Roman Catholic Church who take the doctrines they wish and the comforts they want and reject the disciplines they dislike and the moral precepts which they choose to regard as inapplicable.</P>
    <P>If there is to be an accused in the dock as an obstacle to the attainment of the unity of Irishmen.  I think that accused, if it is to be found in the form of an ideology, is not going to be found in any Christain form but in the form of the introverted, violent, extreme nationalism which is the expression of the majority here which is causing the disturbance, in so far as the majority here are causing the disturbance. I do not take a simplistic view of this historical and geographical problem&mdash;a problem, perhaps, which may not be solved simply by being defined.  One of the things which people who concern themselves with political affairs should remind themselves of&mdash;and every politician in this House who has had to concern himself with political matters realises this also&mdash;is that there are in political affairs, as there are in biological circumstances, incurable diseases.  There are problems which will not go away. There are cases which cannot be settled.  You can only get something which approximates to a solution by breaking out into a new dimension of the terms in which the problem must be faced.</P>
    <P>When we talk about the natural unity of Ireland I am not satisfied that we have sufficiently recognised the reality of the problem in these islands.  Let me remind the House that geography is a very poor base on which to erect a political structure. We will not solve our problems here overall by a simple regard even to the context of the whole island of Ireland. This, perhaps viewed in larger terms, is a very big western European problem. What greater western European problem have we had since the civil war in Spain than that which now bedevils the two islands, Britain and Ireland?  We have here to get a solution which will be expressed in terms which do not merely concern themselves <Col N="773" /> with the problems of the people but the problems of our people in Britain and the British People in Ireland.  When we debate a Bill of this kind which is directed towards the removal of a statement of fact, as Senator Ó Maoláin has properly said, that is, the special position of the Catholic Church, we cannot even begin to reach a solution of our problems until we take the overall view of our position.</P>
    <P>With regard to that particular Article, the objection to it is the lack of generosity one never expects to find in a legal document.  In the proposals for the Constitution in 1937, I remember resenting this and feeling that it seemed to imply that a Catholic Irishman had some right superior to that of a non-Roman Catholic Irishman.</P>
    <P>Purely in terms of social relations I objected to it then.  It was taken, of course, from the Napoleonic Concordat. Even if it is not established historically that it was expressly copied from it, the echoes of that Concordat were in the mind of some draftsman before it was finally drafted.  That Concordat dealt with an entirely different situation from the Irish situation. Perhaps we should remind ourselves that the Napoleonic Concordat was made by a Catholic Church in France which was monarchical, aristocratic and loyalist in tradition with the Revolution, whereas the extraordinary and unique achievement of the Irish Catholics is that they were the first Catholics to become democratic. In European terms Daniel O'Connell was a very great man no matter what they may say about him in relation to his judgments in particular matters here.  There was moved in 1973 out of the French situation into the Irish situation what was, and has been proved to have been, an unnecessary and offensive Article.</P>
    <P>Historians will be interested in what the Leader of the House has said here today.  It is interesting.  If I understood what seemed to be implied in what he said in so far as he was directing himself to a discussion of the Articles it is now proposed to remove, he seemed to be saying this was put in because <Col N="774" /> the Constitution would be easier to carry if it was put in.  It was put in because the Church was not getting on so well with Fianna Fáil in 1973.  As someone interested in historical matters that seems very important because Senator Ó Maoláin had direct evidence to give on that point.</P>
    <P>It is good to see this Article being removed.  I should like to join with other Senators who expressed the opinion that if we are proposing this amendment to the people let us see that it is carried.  Nothing would be worse than if this amendment were put forward and rejected through lack of enthusiasm, through lack of understanding or through the type of fears which Senator O'Higgins expressed, and which I share, as to the possible consequences of its removal.</P>
    <P>Let us look at this Article.  It has given Ireland, to some extent, a had name.  People have made the point that the Roman Catholic Church is not the established church of Ireland.  It is true to say that the Church of England is the established church of England. It is important that we understand why that always seems to be such a weak debating point for anyone to make.  We often hear it said: &ldquo;They have got their established church, we have not got an established church and yet they are saying that they are more liberal than we are.&rdquo;  The point is that what is established in England is the State in the Church, not the Church in the State.  It is important to realise that. In so far as we have got a bad press out of this it is possible for people throughout the world to believe that in some way there has been unequal treatment meted out by our courts to people who do not belong to the church whose special position was recognised.  I do not think there is any evidence whatever of that.</P>
    <P>I have looked at the cases in which reference has been made to this Article.  The position of charitable gift contemplaive orders was changed in 1943 by a decision of Judge Gavan Duffy who reversed the prevailing English law on the matter which had been enacted in 1871, which would have been the law in this country until 1943, not on the basis of this Article but on the basis of the <Col N="775" /> Preamble to the Constitution.  I believe his reversal of that decision was right but that is a view which I should have to develop further if it were relevant here.</P>
    <P>In 1945 the only single case I found where there was an actual change of law affected by the dynamo of this Article was where the confession made to a priest was held, by Judge Gavan Duffy, to be entitled to the privilege of the courts, thus changing a whole trend of decisions. If that was not a decision open to him to reach on any other ground, it was a right decision for him to have reached on some ground and I believe that the Supreme Court now having held that it is entitled to reverse itself would have reversed the previous decisions on this matter.  If it was a matter in any difficulty it should have been a matter of statute law.</P>
    <P>The Tilson case is frequently referred to as having been brought about by the operation of this Article. This is not true.  The Tilson case was not decided on the basis of Article 44.  The Tilson case was decided by the Supreme Court, with Mr. Justice Black dissenting, on the basis of the rights of the parents, in the plural. The Supreme Court held that the constitutional expression of this entitled them to depart from what had been the previous law, that was that the father would determine the religion of the children.</P>
    <P>There are views of lawyers, Catholic lawyers as well as non-Catholic lawyers, to the effect that that decision was not a right one on the fundamental ground that the promises of husbands and wives are not sealed with seals and sealing waxes and, therefore, are not to be enforceable in the courts.  There is a fundamental institution involved in matrimony and private exchanges between the parties should not be cognisable in the law courts.  The point I wish to make is that the famous Tilson case was not decided by virtue of this Article.  In so far as any of these decisions are reached <Col N="776" /> there is no question of treating Protestants or Catholics differently by virtue of it.  It is of some importance to make that point clear.</P>
    <P>In the other House there was reference to the <i>Ne Temere</i> decree and its operation prior to the recent changes. This is absolutely irrelevant to any discussion of the behaviour of the Irish State which has nothing whatever to do with <i>Ne Temere</i> unless it is to be invited to have a head on conflict with the church of the majority of the people and to rule this as being contrary to public policy and illegal.  That is a major proposition, to say the least, be of it, and people who talk about <i>Ne Temere</i> in relation to the behaviour of the Irish State should, at least, be clear as to what they are requiring of the Irish State.  They are requiring of the Irish State to take on the church of the majority of the people, fight it and without necessarily having any great conviction that it was right in doing so.  At any rate, it is not a matter that is in any way dependent upon the decision of the politicians.</P>
    <P>With regard to the politicians in this country and their responsibilities and duties&mdash;and I presume it is permissible to speak of the responsibilities and duties of Christain politicians with regard to such matters as those which we are now debating&mdash;render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's is not a <i>diktat</i> or a decree of Caesar. It is a Christain principle and to me it very clearly implies that if a Christian finds himself, as a politician does, in the ranks of Caesar, it is his duty to exact what Caesar is entitled to get. It is his duty to withstand institutional pressures, institutional influences which do not persuade him that what is proposed to be done is right.  He should act with simple regard to what his job is, the job of Caesar, the job of running the country, which is a secular job and not specifically a Christian job.</P>
    <P>It is the burden of the Christian politician from time to time to stand up to the Church in its institutional aspect&mdash;any of the churches in their institutional aspects&mdash;and to say: &ldquo;This may be your opinion, but this is my judgement as to what now <Col N="777" /> should be done.  It is my right to make that judgement, and your right to say I am wrong, but it is my right to make it and it would be a usurpation by you to endeavour to intervene in what is my definite sphere, a sphere recognised by you in your principles, and by me in my acceptance of them.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>With regard to the Church's influence as such, let us take such a matter as divorce.  At this time I could not inform the House what my judgement would be as to what would be the right and desirable thing to do with regard to divorce.  I am not speaking of the abolition of the restriction of divorce in the Constitution, but rather of the enactment of provision for divorce.  There is a liberal wing of theologians that take the view that our Constitution should be secular.  I should like to say to them: &ldquo;This is a view permissible for you to have and it is well that you should express it. It is not something that I, as a politician, think in my judgement about Irish affairs at this moment, and not something that I need necessarily accept or reject.  It is my duty to judge what is best for Ireland at this time.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>One of the problems we have in Ireland, which is a little difficult to express, is that of Caesar, on the one hand, Christ on the other.  The Minister may be surprised to hear me say that I think it is arguable that in Irish circumstances and in Irish terms and for Irish needs, Caesar is not strong enough, that secular power is not strong enough.  A part of the problem that we are faced with and part of the blame that gets cast on the Church, is that Caesar&mdash;the Government, the State&mdash;does not do its duty sufficiently and is perhaps not able to do so.  There is no tradition of respect for Government.  There is no sense of authority.  We never had Rome in Ireland.  There is no presidential glory such as attaches to the presidency of the United States of America, which means that the atmosphere wholly changes merely by the intervention of the institution of the presidency. Here, we have a secular power which is not reputable, at least not reputable enough.  It is divided and weak and in relation to the matter which I <Col N="778" /> have in mind, which are these fundamental matters of general justice, is not able to do all that it should do.</P>
    <P>For example, I should like to refer to my very first point when I talked about who should be accused.  It is the failure to prevent men who describe themselves as the leaders of armed forces from walking the streets of Dublin and from walking into public meetings that does much more damage to Irish unity than any special position the Catholic Church might have acknowledged to it in a written document. The standing and reputation of the State is not strong enough to withstand this long tradition which has attacked from the beginning the legitimacy of this State, and which continues to be attacked, even when we use the words &ldquo;this unnaturally divided Ireland&rdquo;.  If it is unnaturally divided, there are two institutions under threat: not merely Stormont, which is gone, but Dáil Éireann, which remains.  If it is an artificial division, and there is something illegitimate about one of them, there is something illegitimate about the other.  Today we had figures quoted by a university Senator which, lamenably, I thought&mdash;supported the proposition that in some fashion the people of this State were not free to enact a Constitution by appropriate majority voting, which they did in 1937, by producing percentages based upon what would have happened if you had taken in the Thirty-two Counties of Ireland. Why have this sort of approach which questions the legitimacy of the authority in both Northern Ireland and here?</P>
    <P>I said that I liked what Senator O'Higgins said and I shared his anxiety with regard to the effect of the removal. It is one thing to put it in, it is another thing to take it out.  What does the taking out of a reference to particular religious institutions mean?  Does it mean that there is to be a general message that religious life is to be regarded by the wisacres of Leinster House as less important than it was?  I liked what was quite new for me, that is the idea that the notion of special position should have been extended to include the other described religions, and that all religions would have a <Col N="779" /> special status and be recognised to have such.</P>
    <P>We are insufficiently straightforward in saying that we do not want unity with the people in the Six Counties however artificially created that entity was, without their consent.  We do not want it achieved by immoral means. There is a continual doubt in any Christian's mind when he is faced with the proposition that he should take up arms to kill people unless there is a proper authority requiring him to do so.  I am judging them objectively.  Any subjective judgment about them is their affair.  That is the decision of all those who are engaged in or who are in any way attempting to force Northern Ireland to do their bidding.  It is ludicrous to think that we have the greater force, but assuming that we have, it would not even be the honourable force that would be wielded by our Government issuing lawfully authorised directions: it would be dishonourable and the result of our inability to control our own people.  What kind of Ireland would there be then?</P>
    <P>After the dissolving of Stormont people said that Leinster House would follow and they meant what they said. We have been overpleased with the destruction of the power of Stormont but it is a poor political objective.  I was never tempted by plausible reasoning on the part of my colleagues in Fine Gael over the years to say that Fianna Fáil were being finished. Though temporarily this would be pleasing to all of us, I never thought it would be a good thing to have them finished forever.  The objective of destruction is not a good one and we have not fully savoured all the consequences of the fall of Stormont.  If loyalties of passionate men are set footloose it raises questions as to where they are going to be fastened.</P>
    <P>There are also those who attacked the Orange lodges.  I know little about them, but I know a lot about the equivalent of Orange lodges.  There is a lot of it harmless, side by side with their political activities.  The destruction of the Orange lodges should not go out from this parliamentary institution as an objective.  It is wrong to <Col N="780" /> destroy something without having a clear idea of what you are proposing to substitute for it.  A substitute for Stormont seems to be on the way.</P>
    <P>In the Ireland of the future there must be a place for the Orange lodge loyalists, the republican loyalists and other various kinds of people who have different traditions.  The consequences of the attainment of unity by immoral means would lead, in my judgment, to a moral degeneration of the whole Irish situation, therefore something that we should be deeply concerned to avoid and prevent.  I will quote from Lecky at some length, if I am permitted:</P>
    <P>History is never more valuable than when it enables us, standing as on a height, to look beyond the smoke and turmoil of our petty quarrels and to detect in the slow developments of the past the great permanent forces that are steadily bearing nations onwards to improvement or decay.</P>
    <P>The strongest of these forces are the moral ones.  Mistakes in state-manship, military triumphs or disasters, no doubt affect materially the prosperity of nations, but their permanent political well-being is essentially the outcome of their moral state.  Its foundations is laid in pure domestic life, in commercial integrity, in a high standard of moral worth and of public spirit, in simple habits, in courage, uprightness, and self-sacrifice, in a certain soundness and moderation of judgment, which springs quite as much from character as from intellect.  If you would form a wise judgment of the future of a nation, observe carefully whether these qualities are increasing or decaying. Observe especially what qualities count for most in public life.  Is character becoming of greater or less importance?  Are the men who obtain the highest posts in the nation men of whom in private life and irrespective of party competent judges speak with genuine respect? Are they men of sincere convictions, sound judgment, consistent lives, indisputable integrity, or are they men who have won this position by the arts of a demagogue or an intriguer; <Col N="781" /> men of nimble tongue and not earnest beliefs&mdash;skilful above all things, in spreading their sails to each passing breeze of popularity?</P>
    <P>Such considerations as these are apt to be forgotten in the fierce excitement of a party contest; but if history has any meaning, it is such considerations that affect most vitally the permanent well-being of communities, and it is by observing the moral current that you can best cast the horoscope of a nation.</P>
    <P>I hope that quotation was of some interest.  It seems right to me to remove these sections from this Article not merely because of the Northern problem, though it may be of some significance there.  It would be significant to the Northern situation if we failed to do what we set out to do and if there is any feeling such as has been expressed over the years with regard to its being capable of misrepresenting our situation.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should like to say that this may be the first of many amendments.  The Articles relative to the national territory, and the manner in which the Article relative to the Irish language is expressed, are unlikely to be of any moral or certainly of any religious contention.  If we are to say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to divorce we should all be thinking ahead as to the basis for saying &ldquo;no&rdquo; to abortion.  If we say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to divorce, on what basis are we saying &ldquo;no&rdquo; to consenting adults and on what basis are we saying &ldquo;no&rdquo; to the control of pornography, which is a prime modern capitalist weakness, a frightful exploitation of human beings, and even if it is impossible to prove that people are corrupted by pornography, certainly the pornographers are, or they could not produce what they are producing?</P>
    <P>We must think about the question of the right of the majority to stand by what they regard as objectively right for everybody, even if their view as to what is right is not acceptable by the minority.  When we have made up our minds on that, we must make a stand. To take a simple matter like abortion, which is easy for me, taking the view <Col N="782" /> of life I do, it would seem to me that the majority should not be put in a worse position than they would if they were in a minority when they would be fighting to change the law and would have a moral duty to do so.  If they would have a right as a minority to fight to change the law they should have a right as a majority to maintain the law.  There is this large question of divorce and it can only be considered in international terms having regard to the perjurous kind of activities which are operated by people getting divorced.</P>
    <P>The main objective of public policy here must be, not unity, but peace. Peace may involve unity, but peace above all.  If peace is to be got by some alteration of the law regarding divorce it may well be that this would be a justifiable reason for making that change.  I strongly recommend this Bill.</P>

      <P>I speak as one who has a very great respect for this Constitution which we are about to change by amending it in this small manner.  As soon as that amendment is accepted, there is then much advancement in social thinking, but despite that there is very little in the Constitution to which anyone, even the most liberal, can find fault.  It protects the rights, liberties, the philosophy of all normal people.</P>
      <P>The subsection which it is now proposed to amend is really little more than a statement of statistical fact.  It states that</P>
      <P>The State recognises the special position of the Holy Catholic Apostolic and Roman Church as the guardian of the faith professed by the great majority of the citizens.</P>
      <P>In other words, it states that the faith possessed by the vast majority of the citizens of this State is the Catholic faith, and the State recognises that fact. Nothing more or less is stated.  It does not give any special position to the Catholic Church, as is so often stated in arguments.  On the contrary, subsection 2.3º of that Article states:</P>
      <P>The State shall not impose any disabilities or make any discrimination on the grounds of religious profession, belief or status.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most people who criticise us, who <Col N="783" /> say we are a church-ridden State, <i>et cetera,</i> have not taken the trouble to read our Constitution and they have not even read Article 44.  Because of this and because, some 35 years later when social thinking has progressed, it might possibly offend the susceptibilities of others, I think it is proper that it should be removed from our Constitution.</P>
    <P>I do not support this amendment merely because it has anything to do with a united Ireland: you can change the whole Constitution from beginning to end and it will not advance one iota the achievement of a united Ireland.  We shall have a united Ireland if and when we have unity of heart and mind, brotherhood and affection for all Irishmen irrespective of whether they are unionists, nationalists, republicans or conservatives. We must recognise their right to their own views and we must appreciate that we cannot rape them by murder and arson, by pillage and plunder and robbery, and having raped them drag them to a marriage bed where we will produce a monster. It would be a bad day if that monster were produced by such means.</P>
    <P>The days of a united Ireland have been set back by decades by pillage and murder of our fellow Irishmen. Only when we are prepared to recognise the dignity, the patriotism&mdash; which is very different from nationalism&mdash;the goodwill and good sense of our fellow Irishmen in the North, can we look forward to a united Ireland. But to forward the argument that this change should be made as a contribution to a unification of this country is to appear stupid ourselves and to be an insult to our fellow Irishmen in the North.  It is not intended as such. It is intended because we want to ensure that not only will there be no discrimination but there shall not be in this country between us and between people of other religious denominations the slightest sign of discrimination and that there shall not be in our Constitution anything which even indirectly might offend the susceptibilities of our fellow citizens.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="784" /> There were references made here today that if we had divorce, contraception and so on, it would show good faith and help unite Ireland.  I was amazed at the statements of a Senator whose name I will not mention, as he is not in the House at the moment.  You can permit divorce, homosexuality, polygamy, contraception and sterilisation of the unfit but it will not bring you one bit nearer to a united Ireland.  Even if it did, these things would not be justified.  Our Constitution must express the way of life we wish to live.  In other words, what is our philosophy of life?  There is no use chiding the Government for not introducing certain legislation unless the Irish people want it and if and when they want it.  Any Government that wish to stay in power will then have to introduce legislation.  Otherwise they will not be complying with the wishes of the people.  I do not wish to take up the time of the House discussing something which is so obviously clear-cut.</P>
    <P>Senator Alexis FitzGerald has already raised one matter to which I wish to refer.  Speaking as a lawyer, so far as I am aware there was only one instance in the Irish courts where it could be even suggested that this subsection of Article 44 which is now being removed had any legal effect. That was when a priest was asked in the witness box to disclose what he had heard in confession and refused and the courts decided that there would be no obligation on him to do so.  If a lawyer in his office cannot be compelled to disclose what is told to him, I feel that it would be the general philosophy of the Irish people, irrespective of their religious beliefs, that a priest should not be forced to disclose in such circumstances.</P>
    <P>This case of the Tilsons is frequently referred to but I do not have to reiterate what Senator Alexis FitzGerald has already said.  Prior to that, the father alone was considered as the head of the house and had the right to decide how his children should be reared.  This recognised that both parents have that right.  Any sensible person will agree that is not an unreasonable philosophy.  It has <Col N="785" /> nothing to do with religion.  It has nothing to do with the special position of the Catholic Church which we are told is incorporated in this Article.</P>
    <P>I hope that when this is put to the people they will not be lackadaisical about it, that they will come out to the polls and that they will show by the majority of their vote their goodwill to people of all denominations.  I do not want them to fool themselves that this will lead us to a united Ireland.  We shall have a united Ireland only if and when we respect the feelings, views and political philosophy of every Irishman, north and south of the Border.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose it is inevitable after the passing of years that a written Constitution must suffer some amendments.  As regards our Constitution, and as a member of a party who opposed it in 1937, I would be very reluctant to see any amendments to our Constitution being made unless after very careful deliberation and consideration by the two Houses of the Oireachtas and thereafter at the will of the people.</P>
      <P>We do not perhaps in this country give the Constitution the honour and respect due to it.  The Americans could teach us a lesson in this regard. Even though they have amended their Constitution over the years they show a greater respect and tradition for a country living under a written Constitution than we do.  I wonder how many Irish citizens who talk about their rights under the Constitution are familiar with the Articles contained in it.  How many Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas are familiar with these Articles?  Is it only when the Constitution is challenged or amendments are proposed to it that we begin to realise we have a written Constitution and that it should lay down the principles and ideals that reflect our philosophy and our way of life?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One thing which this debate and the very full reports which the newspapers have carried has done is to bring before the people the fact that we have a Constitution.  I hope one of the results of this debate will be a greater <Col N="786" /> interest by all our people in our Constitution and a realisation that times are changing and it has of necessity to be amended.  It will be amended again and again in the years ahead until eventually with the votes of the people of the Thirty-two Counties of Ireland we will have a new Irish Constitution.</P>
    <P>It would not be a good thing to demolish our Constitution.  We should certainly amend it where we think it is right to do so.  The circumstances in which our Constitution was adopted have changed.  Changed circumstances demand that our Constitution be amended but.  We should do so very slowly and only after very grave consideration and very careful deliberation. Nobody can say when we will have a united country.  By united country I do not mean just a geographical entity of thirty-two counties.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Alexis FitzGerald and other Senators that we need a unity of hearts and minds as well as political, economic or social unity. Until we can achieve that, we will not be in a position to vote on a new Thirty-two County Constitution.  I further agree with the other Senators who said it would be mischievous to pretend that the proposed deletion of the sections of Article 44 are going to advance the cause of a united Ireland one iota.  There is no question about that.  I agree with Senator Ó Maoláin and other Senators who touched on the point that it is helpful to remove certain sections of our Constitution which have been and would continue to be used in a mischievous manner to misrepresent us in the Twenty-six Counties as a sectarian people.  It is obviously the right thing to do and that is the only reason why we should consider these changes.</P>
    <P>I was rather surprised to hear Senator Ó Maoláin and other Senators suggest that this was a trivial change&mdash;that it was something that did not matter anyway, that the Cardinal had said he would not shed any tears if it was taken out of the Constitution.  That argument can be overdone.  If it is as trivial as all that, why are we amending the Constitution?  We either regard it as an important matter, something <Col N="787" /> we should do and intend to do whatever the consequences, or we should leave the Constitution alone.</P>
    <P>I do not regard it as a trivial change in the Constitution but an important one.  The Oireachtas are acting wisely and properly in bringing in an amendment to the Constitution. We, as representatives of the people in the two Houses of the Oireachtas, have an obligation to do everything in our power to ensure that the people as a whole exercise their rights to vote in this referendum.  It would be a tragedy if through apathy or indifference the feeling got abroad that this was only a trivial change in the Constitution; that it was only deleting something which should never have been inserted, and for that reason, people did not come out and vote.  It is important that there should be a massive vote.  If there was a low poll or an inconclusive one, even if favourable, it could be used to far greater and more mischievous extent than by leaving the Article as it is.</P>
    <P>It is a fact of life that the Catholic Church has a special position in this country, for the very good reason that 95 per cent of the people of this State are Catholics and probably 75 per cent in the island as a whole. Whether we delete these sections from Article 44 or not this fact will remain.  Whether we make changes or not does not make the slightest difference to the fact that in this State, since its foundation 50 years ago, there has never been and please God never will be any sectarian discrimination against the minority.  We see from time to time many generous tributes paid by members of the various minority religions to the tolerance of successive Governments and people generally in the Twenty-six Counties. It is important to emphasise this fact because when there are discussions on such a matter there is always an undercurrent or suggestions that the reason the Articles are being taken out is because there is sectarianism in the State.  That argument should be scotched straightaway.  The best advocates for the falsity of that argument <Col N="788" /> are those who speak on behalf of the minority.</P>
    <P>When we come to enact a new Constitution, and it may come sooner than the current situation would lead us to believe, it should be a short and simple document.  It should not go into some of the detailed Articles which the present Constitution contains and which have led to the situation we are discussing here this afternoon.  It should spell out in clear and simple language the principles and ideals which influence and direct our people. Such a Constitution would be acceptable to the entire country.  The only reason why I would not advocate bringing in such a Constitution now and scrapping the existing one is that our people in the six northern counties would not have the opportunity of voting on it.  Therefore, the enactment of a new Constitution must await the time when arrangements can be made for the entire Thirty-two Counties of this country to vote in a new Constitution.</P>
    <P>Another factor which may inhibit a substantial turnout in the forthcoming referendum is the fact that all the political parties have been unanimous in agreeing to these amendments to the Constitution.  It is a factor which might lead people to believe that this is only a matter of form.  I do not know what the mechanics of this referendum will be.  It is not a subject about which one can address after-Mass meetings.  It will lack the emotional vigour of a general election or an election proposing to change the electoral system.  Perhaps the Minister will give us some information when he is replying.</P>
    <P>Many of the points I would have wished to make have already been expressed very well by other Senators here this afternoon.  I should like to join with Senator Ó Maoláin in paying a tribute to the many excellent contributions made to this debate.  It has shown that in a matter like this which concerns us all, whether we call the 1937 Constitution the Republican Constitution or something else&mdash;I prefer to use the title an Irish Constitution&mdash;it is our Constitution and belongs to the people of Ireland.  We <Col N="789" /> represent the people of Ireland in this House and we are debating in their name.  In the final analysis they must be the judges.  I hope they will come out in their thousands to show us, their representatives, that our unanimous decision in their name has been the right one.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to welcome this amendment and am glad that the Government, encouraged by the Opposition parties, have seen fit to bring it forward at this time.  I do not believe that it in itself will contribute greatly to the unity of Ireland but it will contribute to some degree towards that unity.  In the present situation in Ireland today everything which contributes to peace and harmony will be welcome.  Now that we have decided to put this amendment to the people, if we fail to pass it handsomely that failure will be misused by those who do not wish to see the unity of Ireland.</P>
      <P>There are other changes which I would welcome in our Constitution, but every journey begins with a first step.  This is a first step and as such is to be welcomed and supported by the Members of this House.  I do not believe that section 2 of Article 44 has any juridical effect but that is a matter of opinion and debate into which we need not now go.  This Article undoubtedly causes some apprehension in the minds of non-Catholics and gives offence to some citizens of our State.  This should not be the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The trouble in the North undoubtedly has its roots in Orange bigotry which tried to establish a British Protestant Parliament in the Six Counties.  Perhaps we in this State have over-reacted to this situation. Perhaps we have tried too hard to build a Gaelic Catholic Ireland disregarding other points of view.  We should agree among ourselves that there is more than one point of view in life and that our fellow Protestant Irishmen have different traditions of which they are as proud as we are of our traditions.  Nobody or no group of people have a monopoly of virtue, of right or of truth.  If we are to live in peace in Ireland we must learn to <Col N="790" /> be tolerant of ideas and traditions which, if not ours, are as dearly held and valid to those who hold them as ours are to us.  We should aim towards a society in which each man will have the right to have his free conscience respected and shall, in turn, respect the free conscience of all men.</P>
    <P>We should have a secular Constitution in Ireland for the pluralist society which a united Ireland will contain. This amendment, as I have already said, is the first step in that direction and as such I should like to welcome it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, should like to welcome this Bill.  Nevertheless I feel that the articles of our Constitution should reflect the Christian way of life which is traditional in this country.  The proposed amendment of Article 44 will make it a better Article and will reflect the Christian outlook, traditions and way of life of our people.  I hope, when this referendum goes before the people next month, each and every individual elector will make up his or her own mind on this question.  I hope the electorate will turn out in strength.</P>
      <P>It is no harm to remind the public that what will be left of Article 44 will certainly not weaken the position of the Christian churches.  This must be pointed out to the people.  I should like to quote from the proposed amendment of Article 44.  It has not been quoted in the House before.  Lest people may think that the entire Article is being dropped from our Constitution we must ensure that the public, and especially our older citizens know this is not so.  The proposed amended Article 44 will be superior to the original.  It will leave no shadow of doubt and will set the pace for our Christian way of life.</P>
      <P>I consider this amendment to be very appropriate at this time.  We have set a date this year for the first meeting of all the Christian churches in Ireland.  A priority from now on will be the unity of the Christian traditions. Section 1 of the proposed amendment to Article 44 states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The State acknowledges that the <Col N="791" /> homage of public worship is due to Almighty God.  It shall hold His name in reverence and shall respect and honour religion.</P>
    <P>Section 2 (1) states:</P>
    <P>Freedom of conscience and the free profession and practice of religion are, subject to public order and morality, guaranteed to every citizen.</P>
    <P>Section 2 (2) states:</P>
    <P>The State guarantees not to endow any religion.</P>
    <P>This is something that has worried many people in the past.  People thought that the Catholic Church was getting more from the State than other churches.</P>
    <P>Section 3 reads:</P>
    <P>The State shall not impose any disabilities or make any discrimination on the grounds of religious profession, belief or status.</P>
    <P>Section 4 reads:</P>
    <P>Legislation providing State aid for schools shall not discriminate between schools under the management of different religious denominations or be such as to affect prejudicially the right of any child to attend a school receiving public money without attending religious instructions at that school.</P>
    <P>Section 5 reads:</P>
    <P>Every religious denomination shall have the right to manage its own affairs, own, acquire and administer property, movable and immovable, and maintain institutions for religious or charitable purposes.</P>
    <P>Section 6 reads:</P>
    <P>The property of any religious denomination or any educational institution shall not be diverted save for necessary works of public utility and on payment of compensation.</P>
    <P>The proposed Article 44 embodies everything the people would wish it to contain.  It does not affect the position of any religion and it certainly will protect the Christian way of life.  We must consider this island as being basically Christian even though there are many un-Christian acts taking place at present.  Our crusade should be aimed towards <Col N="792" /> bringing our people back to a true Christian way of life.</P>
    <P>I listened to the remarks of Senator Ó Maoláin this afternoon and for a time I did not know whether he was for or against the proposal.  I appreciate his position and I believe it is no harm to have such matters aried in public.  I was particularly impressed by his short history lesson.  The duty of the Members of this House is to encourage the largest possible proportion of our electorate to decide this issue.  They must be encouraged in every way to cast their votes for or against this amendment.  I hope that the issues involved will not be clouded by a personality cult and that the decision of the people will be very clear and decisive.  Irish people want to do what is right and I am sure they will prove to be anxious to get a Constitution which guarantees those freedoms to all.</P>
    <P>This country urgently wants peace, prosperity and fellowship.  We must unceasingly work towards those goals. The Christian way of life and the Christian principles which we cherish, if put fairly into practice, will ensure that this island will become a peaceful and prosperous place for all sections of our community.  I hope to see the Constitution altered in the way now being proposed but, since many doubts have been cast on our present Constitution, perhaps the all-party committee will come forth, in the shortest possible time, with a comprehensive appraisal of our Constitution so that we can have a Constitution which will meet the needs of our time and gives the necessary guarantees for each and every one of us to live our lives out in this emerald isle in peace and prosperity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AndyOBrien" hpid="Mr. A. O'Brien Mr. A. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with those who welcomed the introduction of this Bill and I hope that the referendum on the question of deleting these words will be carried by a massive majority.  However, there is a danger that the people might not turn out in large numbers.  Firstly, the referendum is being held at a time of year when weather conditions may be bad and when the hours of daylight will be short.  Secondly, because of the unanimity <Col N="793" /> which exists between all political parties on this issue, the electorate might become somewhat apathetic and think that the result was a foregone conclusion; in fact, we could have anything but an impressive result.</P>
      <P>I believe that it is the duty of every public representative to use his or her influence to ensure that there is a good turnout.  We owe that to the Irish people because their enemies abroad have been making use of this phase to villify the people and to hold them up to odium and to disrespect as being narrowminded and intolerant, whereas the reverse is the case.  I hope that the people realise that the Constitution ensures that they have the last word in these matters.  They should also be made to realise that they have now an opportunity of expressing decisively their broadmindedness and tolerance by showing their readiness to understand that a man's religious beliefs are his own affair and by professing their belief that the Constitution cherishes every citizen equally, irrespective of class or creed.</P>
      <P>It is regrettable that the Government did not hold this referendum earlier in the year when people were asked to express their opinion of whether or not we should join the EEC.  Indeed, it is a pity that this opportunity was not afforded to the people some years ago.  Those who are now holding us up to scorn for having included phrases such as this in our Constitution accused us of being bigoted people that we were anxious in some way to exercise the rights of a majority over a minority.  These people should never have been afforded that opportunity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After the referendum is carried successfully&mdash;as I believe it will be&mdash; these same people will take advantage of that occasion to say that they, by their protests in the North of Ireland and elsewhere, forced the people of this country to do something they otherwise would not have done.  That would result in our people being placed in a position into which they have no right to be, because since the foundation of the State they have always exercised tolerance and afforded equal opportunity to every <Col N="794" /> section of the community, irrespective of their beliefs.  Tributes have been paid to that tolerance by leaders of the minority in this State, but they have never received the same publicity as the jeers and jibes of the bigoted people in the North of Ireland.</P>
    <P>It has been said here today that this was a meaningless phrase.  I agree with that because it did not in any way interfere with the practise of any religion in this State.  I do not know why it should have been included in the Constitution.  It is not easy for a citizen of the Republic to defend his Constitution when attacked by a Northern Ireland bigot about the inclusion of Article 44.  We do not convince him very much by saying that it did not mean anything; if it was meaningless it should never have been included, and it was a great mistake to have kept it there for so long.  The retention of a section such as that provides for the enemies of this State &mdash;particularly those who are absolutely opposed to the re-unification of this country&mdash;a certain amount of ammunition.  It is exactly the kind of thing that these fanatical bigots want when addressing their followers and pouring forth about the evils of Papist society, and how true it was to say that &ldquo;Home rule meant Rome rule&rdquo;.  It afforded a narrowminded and bigoted people an opportunity for holding on to leadership.  If there were no such targets here for them to snipe at, then such leadership would have had no meaning.  It is, therefore, a mistake to do anything in this part of the country which affords these people an opportunity of presenting us in the wrong light to the outside world and preaching their policy of hatred, destruction and annihilation.</P>
    <P>For these reasons I hope the people of this country will avail themselves of this opportunity to express their support by a massive majority for the deletion of these words from the Constitution. That will deny the type of people I have been talking about the opportunity they have been availing of down the years.  It will afford the Irish people an opportunity of showing themselves in a true light before the world.  Every effort should be made by the political parties to ensure <Col N="795" /> a good turnout: the result should not be taken for granted.  Because other elections may be imminent and because political parties might feel that it was necessary to conserve their funds for events that might be in greater doubt, there might be a tendency not to put enough into this referendum.  That would take from the greatness of the occasion now afforded.  The people should see this opportunity to amend the Constitution as something they should cherish greatly.  They should not be misled into thinking that the general agreement between the various parties in both Houses makes the referendum any less important.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I note with regret the introduction of this Amendment of the Constitution Bill, not with a view to opposing it, but deeply regretting that it contains so little.  Earlier this year when the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, which was to lower the voting age to 18, was being discussed, I spoke out on many of the matters which are being discussed today.  At that time I regretted that in Ireland this year, and given what I believe is a change in the climate of opinion in this country, we were doing so little in respect of amending our Constitution that we were having a referendum merely to lower the voting age to 18.  I then went through the Constitution and noted the other matters which ought to be changed and, of course, this amendment of Article 44 was one of those matters.  I do not see the need to repeat myself in detail today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regret so little is being done so late. We have no reason to congratulate ourselves or to feel that we have contributed in a significant way either to the position in the Twenty-six Counties or to the position in regard to North-South relations.  If I may make one comment on the so-called urgency of this proposal and the fact that it had to be discussed quickly in the Dáil and in the Seanad, this urgency was created by the procedures decided on by the Government.  They created the situation and then took advantage of it.  This is merely a political ploy and has nothing <Col N="796" /> to do with the considered proposals or with the sort of debate which a Bill of this nature merits.  The Dáil could have been reconvened earlier or this Bill could have been introduced before the present session.  The measure of the seriousness of intent of the Government can be shown by the fact that, after persuasion by the Opposition parties, they agreed that if the matter became urgent they would change this provision of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>As far as I could follow without having a script, in his opening speech on the Second Reading the Minister laid the main emphasis on the necessity to ease North-South relations and to show the critics in the North and the ordinary people there was a change of climate here.  This is a wrong emphasis when introducing a Bill to amend the Constitution of 1937.  We should not amend our Constitution or think in these terms merely to pacify Northern critics or to help the North-South situation. This might be one of the positive and welcome results of such an amendment, but it ought not to be the basic reason.  The reason for bringing in this amendment should be to create for the area over which we have jurisdiction full equality and freedom for our people and to ensure full protection of the law in the exercise of their rights.  This is why this proposal to amend the Constitution really has no meaning.  It is not going to effect any change in this position.</P>
    <P>One political commentator said that most of the people in Northern Ireland know that this provision has no meaning, but nevertheless there seems to be some merit in amending the Constitution by deleting the reference to the special position of the Catholic Church and the reference to other religious denominations by name.  This political commentator is right.  The people in Northern Ireland, who have a native shrewdness and who know well what the position is in the Twenty-six Counties, are not going to be fooled or impressed by this attempt to amend our Constitution in a way which we suggest is meaningful and which they know is only a formal change with no real significance. It is not an adventurous change. If one looks at the build up to it, it was one of the recommendations made <Col N="797" /> in the report of the all-party committee on the Constitution in 1967.  Why was it not done in 1967 rather than in 1972?</P>
    <P>Various church authorities have spoken out before the political commitment for change was there.  Cardinal Conway has said that he would have no objection to the change.  Recently Archbishop Buchanan said that he had never lost any sleep over Article 44.  He, too, sees the empty nature of this constitutional amendment in that it is only a formula.  The inter-denominational body set up by the Irish Theological Association, which brought in a detailed report this year on amendments to the Constitution, mentioned the amendment of Article 44 as being one of them, but stressed far more important amendments of the Constitution, but these have been overlooked by the Government and the Opposition parties in their great urgency to make this formal.  Because it does not achieve what it purports to achieve it is a meaningless change.  This change purports to achieve a non-denominational State in the Twenty-six Counties.  This is what we are trying to say to the world and particularly to the North of Ireland and Britain.</P>
    <P>The Minister has described the rest of Article 44 as second to none in that it includes the respect and honour which is owed by the State to religion. No particular religion will be endowed and people will have the freedom to practice their religion and they can exercise freedom of conscience.  These are excellent provisions and should be part of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>In other aspects the Constitution is discriminative and does not allow the full expression of civil rights and full participation of all citizens.  The formal change being made in removing Article 44 is meaningless as purporting to show that we have a non-denominational State unless we change these other provisions of the Constitution which are the real crux of the matter.  This is realised by the politicians and they are failing to give proper leadership and are shirking the issue and making a formal, meaningless change which will not achieve the desired result of bringing about a new <Col N="798" /> climate of feeling between North and South.</P>
    <P>It is argued that the removal of the provision relating to religious denomination will provide for a non-denominational State in the Twenty-six Counties where no particular religion is favoured or has a particular influence on our Constitution or our laws.  This cannot be upheld while we still have in the Constitution the prohibition on the possibility of granting a divorce in Ireland.  The question of a total prohibition in the Constitution on divorce represents, or goes even further than representing, the teaching of the Roman Catholic Church.  The Roman Catholic Church does allow the nullity of marriage. The Constitution rules out even the provision of nullity of a marriage and also the recognition of foreign forces. This is a reflection of the influence of the majority religion in Ireland.  Its removal would not mean there would immediately be an introduction of divorce legislation in Ireland, but it would remove the question from the Constitution and, therefore, make it a matter within the jurisdiction of the legislature.</P>
    <P>The whole marriage law of the country is within the jurisdiction of legislature and it is appropriate that this would include the possibility, if it were thought proper, of introducing divorce legislation in the years to come.  The matter would be flexible and would be open to proper consideration as to what the position in relation to marriage is now, and if there was a breakdown of marriage and if people were being deserted by their marriage partners in what is called &ldquo;divorce Irish style&rdquo;.  Usually it is the husband who disappears out of the jurisdiction and avoids all his responsibilities.  There is no machinery for making him responsible.  We cannot enter into agreement with other countries on the enforcement of maintenance allowances, because we do not recognise divorce, and enforce alimony payments on a reciprocal basis.</P>
    <P>This distortion of a proper consideration by the legislature of our marriage laws including our reaction <Col N="799" /> to the breakdown of marriage, is as a result of the provision in the Constitution which does not allow divorce in Ireland.  This is contrary to the opinion, belief and moral judgment of a substantial number of people living in the Twenty-six Counties.  They can point to this as the real provision which shows that we do not, as yet, have the sort of Constitution which is appropriate to a pluralist society, but still have a Constitution which is influenced by the views of the majority religion and that this is not particularly a non-denominational Constitution despite the verbal change which has been made by this Bill.</P>
    <P>Another significant matter is that those wishing to take the highest offices in the land must swear a solemn oath of their belief in God.  This is written into the Constitution.  The President, members of the Council of State, the judges of the highest offices of the land must swear in the Presence of Almighty God.  Arguments could be made that either we are not prepared in Ireland to have a President or a member of the Council of State or a judge in the highest courts in the land who does not both believe in God and affirm this solemnly, or else we wish to discriminate against atheists and non-believers.  Therefore, we do not have as other Senators stated we do have, full equality before the law because we do not allow these people to take the highest offices.</P>
    <P>This is a minor part of the Constitution but is one with a particular result that can be analysed and discussed. The problem with the provisions about the recognition of the Catholic Church and other named churches which we are discussing in this Bill is that they do not have a precise legal meaning.  One could look through the various cases where the courts have considered Article 44, from Mr. Justice Gavin Duffy's decision in the Tilson case where he appeared to give some effect to Article 44 and it seemed to have a legal meaning for him, to the latest very strongly-worded opinion of the Supreme Court in the criticism of a case in 1970 that the two sections which are to be deleted here do not <Col N="800" /> have any legal meaning but are merely descriptive of the factual situation that the majority church in Ireland is the Roman Catholic Church and names the other churches existing in 1937.</P>

      <P>I am sure they were very interesting on the Tilson case.  The most recent interpretation shows there was no legal content so far as the Supreme Court is now concerned and only emphasises the extent to which we are engaging in a meaningless exercise and congratulating ourselves on our own hypocrisy.</P>
      <P>Many of the Senators who have spoken on this Bill have referred to the possibility of a new Constitution. They also referred to the large number of amendments that will be necessary in order to make this an appropriate Constitution for 1972.  I was interested to hear the Minister in his Second Reading speech talk about constitutional change and say that a Constitution is not for always, but by its very nature because it is a creative thing, requires amending, assessing and possibly a complete renewal.  This is an important point as we are already on our second Constitution in a period of 50 years.  It is not surprising that this Constitution has dated considerably.</P>
      <P>I support strongly the view of those who would like to see a new Constitution and I hope that this will be one of the strong recommendations of the Dáil Committee on the Constitution.  We have lost an opportunity here to put forward the day of bringing in a new and non-denominational Constitution appropriate to a pluralist society and to the social climate in Ireland in the seventies.  We have not taken our courage into our hands and brought about a real meaningful change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question which is most frequently asked, and which is the most relevant question in the whole North/ South situation, is: what we have done in the Twenty-six Counties to persuade the people of Northern Ireland <Col N="801" /> that we are their friends and that we would like to see a reconciliation between North and South?  This is the only possible meaning when we speak about ultimate reunification and union in the whole island.  One does not unite enemies; one unites friends.  The approach ought to indicate a desire for friendship, reconciliation and a desire to work together towards this new Ireland.</P>
    <P>In letters to the newspapers during the summer John Temple Lang and I have urged that the opportunity ought to be taken to bring in a meaningful amendment of the Constitution by combining the amendment of Article 44 with the deletion of the prohibition of divorce to show that the politicians have got leadership and that they will face up to the real objectionable provision in the Constitution and bring in an amendment to it.  We also advocated that the referendum for this amendment should include an opportunity for the people to express in positive terms their strongly held belief that the reunification of the country should come about by peaceful means only.</P>
    <P>It would be an opportunity to alienate those who advocate violence as a method of reunification.  The people would welcome this opportunity of making their voices heard in stating that reunification should come about by peaceful means only and that they abhor the present attempts by violence to coerce the people of the Six Counties into a united Ireland.  This would be much better than the very dangerous idea of holding a plebiscite at the same time as the poll which is expected to be held in Northern Ireland.  This would be irresponsible towards those living in the Border counties and would be bound to lead to immense friction.  It could not be seen as being in any way helpful to an ultimate solution.</P>
    <P>The Fifth Amendment of the Constitution Bill does have one positive quality despite the fact that it is a disappointment to those of us who would wish to see a real and serious attempt to amend the Constitution.  It is the first amendment of the Constitution to be introduced to indicate a change of this sort in constitutional thinking.  It is completely different from the previous <Col N="802" /> either successful or attempted changes in the Constitution.  The other referenda were concerned with the voting system and the two attempts to change proportional representation.  The amendment to enable us to enter the European Economic Communities was a factual change of certain aspects and the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution Bill earlier this year was again a change of the voting age.  This Bill provides for a different sort of change in the Constitution and for that very small point one can give it a qualified welcome.  It is an attempt to show that the Twenty-six Counties are becoming a pluralist society.  The reason that I view the Bill with disappointment is that having given this indication it cannot be what it purports to be while we still retain the prohibition on divorce, while we still retain laws making the availability of contraceptives a criminal offence, and while we still have the censorship laws in the way in which they are framed.  These are the reality. The other is just a mere empty formula.</P>
    <P>My final point is in answer to what I feel will be the question mark in the minds of those listening as to how to persuade the people of Ireland to remove the prohibition on divorce. There are many politicians in both Houses of the Oireachtas who believe this ought to be done but who do not see the political possibility of it.  To them I would say that they could, perhaps, look at the comparison in approach between the attempt that was made to persuade the people that it was a good thing for them to join the European Economic Communities and the non-attempt that has been made to open up the debate on the question of changing the constitutional position in relation to divorce and the implications of this.  Anybody who was involved in the pre-referendum debate, on the European movement&mdash;the farmers organisations, the business organisations or the political parties&mdash;will know the social phenomena which took place over the 18 months prior to the referendum, where in every town and village community seminars, debates and discussions were held.  Politicians, representatives of professional groups and representatives of the chambers of <Col N="803" /> commerce travelled to speak at these seminars to persuade the people in their own interests to join the European Economic Communities Similarly, farmers, trade unionists and journalists visited Brussels to enter into dialogue with the people there to gain more information.  We should adopt the same approach towards changes in our Constitution which concern the people in the Twenty-Six Counties and which we hope will improve North/South relations.  This we have not even attempted to do.  We have not sent our farmers, our trade unionists, our business representatives or our politicians to Northern Ireland. We have not tried to enter into any dialogue with them nor to understand the social and political implications.</P>
    <P>In relation to changes in our Constitution and laws, we have not tried to persuade the people as to what is really meant.  We have not tried to get across the message that in this time of great bitterness, violence and hatred in Ireland we have to change our outlook and open our eyes.  This does not mean the undermining of basic values.  In essence it means tolerance of the views and values of others.  This is the only way of avoiding the sort of confrontation which many people fear will happen in this island.  If this confrontation comes, people who could have given leadership cannot avoid shouldering the moral guilt for their lack of leadership. I do not see a great deal of leadership in this particular Bill to amend the Constitution.  It is a mere formula which will be used by us to congratulate ourselves on having entered a new era.  My regret is that many people will be fooled by this.</P>
    <P>I do not share Senator McDonald's fear that the people will think that we have removed religion altogether from the Constitution.  If they look at their ballot papers under the Referendum Bill, which we will be discussing very shortly, they will see that it retains the text of Article 44 covering the protection of religion, the prohibition of discrimination against any particular religion and freedom to <Col N="804" /> profess and practice religion.  That is not a real fear.  I am confident there will be a good turnout.  The people are not as gullible as politicians occasionally think.  They know this is only an empty formula but they will go along with it in the hope that this can be some small contribution to a better Ireland.</P>

      <P>As an indication of their concern for the future, the framers of the Irish Constitution made provision for amendments if the need should arise. Any Constitution will require amendment. It is indicative of the excellence of this Constitution that so far only four amendments have been made.  We are now making the fifth amendment.</P>
      <P>Much has been said during the day about this section, two small paragraphs of which will be deleted.  I refer everybody to the first paragraph of Article 44:</P>
      <P>1º The State acknowledges that the homage of public worship is due to Almighty God.  It shall hold His Name in reverence, and shall respect and honour religion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The same motif&mdash;honour to God and absolute freedom from discrimination in the practice of one's religion&mdash;runs <Col N="805" /> through all of that section.  We are only asked, in this particular Bill, to delete the names of certain churches which are contained in paragraphs 2º and 3º.  A number of churches are mentioned.</P>
    <P>3º The State also recognises the Church of Ireland, the Presbyterian Church in Ireland, the Methodist Church in Ireland, the Religious Society of Friends in Ireland, as well as the Jewish Congregation and the other religious denominations existing in Ireland at the date of the coming into operation of this Constitution.</P>
    <P>It will not upset any of these churches if their names are deleted.  We are a very broadminded people and it is part of our religious beliefs that Christian and non-Christian churches should communicate with the Almighty God in their own manner. The deletion of the names will not make any difference except in one area only.  It is scandalous that certain people who are not well disposed towards this country have used part of this section to try to establish the existence here of religious discrimination and the special position of the Catholic Church.  It is evident that they did not read the whole Constitution not even Article 44 <i>in toto</i>.  If they had done so they would have seen that other churches were mentioned. If the deletion of these subsections do nothing more than silence those critics for ever, it will be a good day's work.</P>
    <P>One of the points which struck me very forcefully during the debate was the call for the immediate acceptance of a new Constitution by the Houses of the Oireachtas and the people. Speaking realistically, it will not be possible to have a new Constitution immediately nor even in five years' time because the conditions in the Six Counties are too complex and it will be some time before we can come together and draft a new Constitution.</P>

      <P>We have had a very informative debate.  Deputies and Senators are agreed that this Bill must pass and by a very substantial majority as an indication of the <i>bona fides</i><Col N="806" /> which exists towards general reconciliation within our community.</P>
      <P>Certain points were made as to the inadequacy of what we are doing, the timing of the Bill and referendum and even whether it was an important matter.  Senator O'Higgins set the headline in that respect.  I should like to emphasise one point which has been made already by Senators Ó Maoláin and O'Higgins, that is, the climate within which we are now moving this amendment and that in which the 1937 and 1922 Constitutions were passed.  It is a futile exercise to start relating what should or should not have been done in 1937 and 1922 to the present situation.  We know, historically, that in 1922 there existed a completely revolutionary situation after we had achieved independence. That situation existed until 1937 when there was a very definite polarisation of views within our community as to whether or not we should have a Republican Constitution.  This was the main aspect in the referendum on the Constitution of 1937.  Aspects such as we are considering here to-day were not pertinent to the general consideration of the rights or wrongs of the matter at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What we must consider is the present climate.  Senator O'Higgins posed the question why we should have the referendum at all at the present time. I should like to answer that question very clearly and it will also meet a number of points made by various other Senators as well.  If we are to have the new Constitution which people want, whether it be in the form of revamping or reviewing our present Constitution or an entirely new Constitution, they are matters which are under consideration at present by an all-party committee.  They are not just trivial matters but are of very serious import, as Senator Russell mentioned.  They will take some time to settle.  Senator Robinson appears to think that you just turn on a tap and produce a constitution.  It is far too serious a matter for that.  Whatever constitutional changes evolve from the all-party committee will merit great consideration by all political parties, by the Government and by the community in general.  They <Col N="807" /> are certainly not matters that can be undertaken overnight.</P>
    <P>We have a political situation at present which is swiftly evolving.  The importance of the present situation has been highlighted by the fact that much of the debate, both here and in the Dáil, was more relevant to the situation which developed since the publication of the British Green Paper and to the coming White Paper in which more positive decisions will be laid out for future structures in the North of Ireland.  It is quite evident that this current political development, and the political thinking arising out of that development, has largely swung this debate away from the particular issues here into a larger area.</P>
    <P>This brings me back to my point in regard to the Government's thinking in having this measure incorporated in the referendum due to take place on 7th December.  We are moving in a swiftly changing political situation.  Time is running out on us. Inside the next few months we will see established structures in the North of Ireland, under an umbrella of the Council of Ireland, and these structures are ones which will have to appeal to all reasonably minded people, North and South.  They are structures which will have to provide a basis on which reconciliation can take place.  In that climate of swiftly evolving political change the Government felt that it was incumbent to make a gesture in some direction.</P>
    <P>The immediate one that could be undertaken was this one in relation to Article 44, on which the all-party committee had already got general agreement and which everybody here is in general agreement should be amended.  It is an Article, particularly with regard to two of its subsections which we are now proposing to delete, which has come in for fantastic misconception in the North of Ireland, in Britain and throughout the world.  I do not think that we, who tend to dismiss this Article as if it does not matter, as Senator Robinson has done, realise sufficiently the kind of weight that is given to those two subsections abroad.  That is natural.  We realise <Col N="808" /> here that there has been no discrimination in favour of the Catholic Church and that no sectarian policies or principles have been adopted by reason of those two subsections.  We can look at them coldly and recognise that, in fact, the words themselves confer no particular legal privilege on the Catholic Church, but this is not how it is read abroad.</P>
    <P>It has been the experience of a number of us who have participated in discussions in the North of Ireland, in Britain, in North America and in Europe that this is a constantly raised point.  They believe that in some way those two subsections confer some theocratic power or function on the Catholic Church and from that idea flows the prejudiced argument that we are not a parliamentary democracy but a sectarian State of some kind.  In order to eliminate forever this misconception that is rampant amongst responsible parliamentarians and leaders of public opinion throughout the world we proposed the deletion of those two subsections.</P>
    <P>The timing was right in the sense that, along with the evolving political situation that I have already mentioned, we have our votes at 18 referendum taking place on 7th December.  Therefore, what better opportunity than now to bring in a referendum Bill proposing the deletion of two sunsections which have worked against us.  By doing so we hope to show <i>bona fides</i> or evidence of good faith <i>vis-à-vis</i> other people in parts of this island who desire reconciliation at this time, I do not pretend that it is a giant step forward but it is a step in the right direction and I do not think it should be dismissed as a meaningless gesture.  When you consider it in the context of what other people have been reading into it over the years it is a substantial step forward in the present climate of opinion that is changing rapidly, both in Britain and in the North of Ireland, towards some form of reconciliation based on structures within which responsible people can work.</P>
    <P>It is not for that reason alone that it is proposed to delete the two subsections. We must consider it in the context of basic religious guarantees existing throughout the world in various <Col N="809" /> constitutions and in the context of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which has been passed by the United Nations, and the Council of Europe Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.  If we consider it in the context of the documents which emerged from the last Vatican Council we can see straight away that our Article 44, with the deletion of those two subsections, is directly in line with the thinking of the United Nations, the Vatican and the constitutions of countries throughout the world.</P>
    <P>Article 44, without those subsections, will be a far better document. It acknowledges in the first subsection homage and public worship to Almighty God.  In the next subsection freedom of conscience and the free profession and practice of religion, subject to public order and morality, is guaranteed to every citizen.  It guarantees not to endow any religion and guarantees not to impose any disabilities or make any discrimination on the ground of religion.  It gives a guarantee that legislation providing State aid for schools shall not be on any discriminatory basis and it guarantees that every religious denomination shall have the right to manage its own affairs, administer its own property, and the property of any religious denomination cannot be diverted save for essential works of public utility.</P>
    <P>The point raised by Senator O'Higgins and Senator FitzGerald that one could have linked in some way the two subsections by recognising the Catholic Church and the other churches, taking them all together, does not make sense because it only freezes the position to churches as they exist at present.  Since 1937 a number of new churches have been added to the list of Protestant churches and there is some doubt as to their position at present.  There may be further new churches in the future.  At least let us keep the situation open and fluid rather than freeze the situation into churches that exist at the time a particular document is enacted.</P>
    <P>A point was made by Senators Kelly <Col N="810" /> and Horgan concerning the social services with regard to the Northern situation.  Again, this is not strictly relevant to the debate but the gap between ourselves and the Six Counties in regard to the social services is narrowing.  It will narrow to equality, as it must, within the framework of the European Economic Community.  It is acknowledged in the Green Paper that our pending entry into the EEC will be a very potent force making for greater social and economic equality between North and South over the next five years.</P>
    <P>A number of Senators spoke about the importance of getting a massive vote in the referendum and I introduced my remarks with it.  I want to emphasise again that it is up to us to ensure, now that we have started on this endeavour, that we get a substantial vote in favour of the deletion of these two sections.  It is quite obvious the sort of misconception that would arise if we did not get a substantial vote from the people and it is up to us who in our own ways can be educators of public opinion to ensure that that is done.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the point made by Senator Robinson, and again I think that she suffers from a misconception here.  These are the only two subsections in the Constitution that could be called theocratic and that could be interpreted as giving a special position or status to a church, and indeed also to other churches.  The other subjects to which she refers are entirely separate matters; the question of divorce and related matters are matters of social content and do not concern the supremacy of a particular church or churches.  This is a very fundamental point because the whole question of divorce is one for social examination: whether the rights of society or the rights of civil rights are more important in this particular respect.</P>
    <P>I do not consider this to be a matter of religious observance at all.  I wish to draw that distinction between what Senator Robinson suggests in having all of these matters discussed together. They are entirely different matters. The whole question of divorce is one on which people would have views <Col N="811" /> right across the board through all religions.  It is not necessarily the prerogative of one particular religion to have one particular view on it.  A number of religions would have very strong views on that and a number of people within these religions would have strong and differing views on this particular aspect.  Therefore, I do not think it is relevant at all to any consideration by the public of what should or should not be done to say that matters such as divorce should be linked with this in a constitutional amendment in the future.  This constitutional amendment stands on its own as eliminating two subsections that can be interpreted, and have been interpreted, by people as giving some sort of theocratic supremacy to the Catholic Church and in some way giving specific recognition to churches that happened to be in existence in 1937.  That is entirely superfluous and irrelevant in the climate today.</P>
    <P>I would not dismiss, either, gestures or symbols.  Those of us who are practitioners in politics recognise that symbols and gestures are often very important to politics.  Very often what is of more importance in politics is the psychological rather than the real. When an impression is conveyed that we are moving in the right direction and that we in this island are turning our faces towards our brothers in a spirit of reconciliation, this amendment, if carried substantially by the people, can have a very real and beneficial effect in that direction.</P>

      <P>As indicated in the explanatory memorandum, the Bill proposes to assist voters at the forthcoming referenda by making available to them a statement relating to the proposals which are the subject of the referenda. It proposes that a special polling card, containing the statement set out in the appendix to section 1 will be sent to every elector, including postal voters and that the statement will also be displayed at polling stations.  Presiding officers will be authorised to assist blind, incapacitated and illiterate electors who cannot vote without assistance, by reading out this statement to them, where necessary, and then marking the ballot papers in accordance with their instructions. These arrangements are the same as those made in relation to the referenda held in 1968 and in relation to the referendum on membership of the European Communities earlier this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the law relating to referenda, the proposal which is the subject of a referendum must be stated on the ballot paper by citing, by its Short Title, the Bill containing the proposal for amendment <Col N="813" /> of the Constitution passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas and the Ballot paper may not contain any paraphrase or summary of the proposal.  The Short Title of a Constitution Amendment Bill gives little indication of the contents of the Bill, and where two referenda are held on the same day there would be a grave danger that voters would not be able to distinguish between the separate proposals.  In the circumstances, I feel that Senators will agree that we should follow the same procedure as at previous referenda and include on the polling card to be issued to each voter a statement approved by the Oireachtas in relation to the proposals which are the subject of the referenda.</P>
