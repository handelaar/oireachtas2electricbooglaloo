      <P>I should like to address myself, first, to the constitutional change which has been made by the passing of the referendum by the people by such a significant and encouraging majority.  In particular, I should like to ask a question as to whether we are, in the terms of Article 5 of our Constitution, any longer a sovereign, independent, democratic State.  If we are, I should like to ask in what sense we are.  I do not think it right in the public area to flinch from this question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The British legal theory has been stated as being that Parliament is the power to make or unmake any law whatever.  We are, today, making a law relative to a particular area of great importance and what we are doing may possibly be without precedent in the history of the State in that we may be proposing to adopt law which we will never, legally or constitutionally, be able to repeal.  Both the Belgian courts and the German courts have unequivocally found that membership of these Communities&mdash;I speak in particular of what is the most important community for us, namely, the European Economic Community&mdash;involves the reception into the legal <Col N="926" /> systems of Belgium and Germany of a supranatiosal legal system restricting national sovereignty.</P>
    <P>The American position, with regard to international law, is quite different from the British and our own in that international agreements in the United States take immediate legal effect without the necessity for any domestic law to be enacted.  Although it is the law of the United States that an international agreement can be set aside or repealed, international law can be varied by subsequent federal legislation. It is quite clear that in Britain that is not the position.  In Britain an international agreement requires the adoption of domestic legislation to give it legal effect, while the international obligation is there.</P>
    <P>Article 29.6 of our Constitution provides that:</P>
    <P>No international agreement shall be part of the domestic law of the State save as may be determined by the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>All that the amendment of the Constitution, which was effected by the adoption of the referendum, has done is to remove the obstacle in the Articles of the Constitution.  There is a legal view, which I am unable to assess except that it was expressed by some very well-informed people that the amendment may not have done enough to achieve what was its undoubted objective.  All that it may have done&mdash;and, I am going to assume, that it has done&mdash;is to remove the obstacle in the Articles of the Constitution invalidating laws enacted, acts done or measures adopted by the State necessitated by the obligations of membership of the Community.  That amendment would seem not to remove the necessity to do what is being done in this legislation.  This amendment would not seem to remove the necessity to determine as part of the domestic law of the State the international agreements which have been made in connection with the European Economic Community.</P>
    <P>However, Article 29 of the Constitution contains another section which may have importance in distinguishing the jurisprudential position <Col N="927" /> of this country and that of the United Kingdom.  Clause 3 of Article 29, which has been before the courts for interpretation, provides that Ireland accepts the general recognised principals of international law as its rules of conduct in its relations with other states.  Mr. Justice John O'Byrne, in a case in 1945&mdash;The Saorstát and Continental Steamship Company <i>versus</i> De Las Morenas&mdash;and the Supreme Court in the State (Duggan) <i>versus</i> Tapley in 1952, held that this clause of this Article repealed domestic law inconsistent with customary international law.  It would appear that there are other arguments than these decisions and other arguments than those dependent upon this clause of that Article to support the view that the Oireachtas has no power to enact legislation, if to do so would constitute a breach of Ireland's international law of obligation.</P>
    <P>There are other arguments to support this view.  An important argument can be based on the nature of the amendment which the people have made to the Constitution and which would appear to give these treaties, if ratified and if made part of the domestic law of this State by the determination of the Oireachtas, a status outside the Constitution and not subject to amendment.  In addition to the effect that may have been caused by the amendment, there is the legal argument that where the legislature joins with other states in setting up and recognising in Irish domestic law an authority with governmental powers, the legislature cannot unilaterally determine it.  This obviously arises with regard to the establishment of the different colonies of the receding British Empire and its dependent states, and, indeed, even in relation to the effects of the Statute of West-minister.</P>
    <P>The British are slow to depart from their old stated principles, but Lord Justice Denning has in a recent case said, with a piece of typically British pragmatism, that legal theory must give way to practical politics, and Lord Haw-Haw must be hanged.</P>
    <P>A question remains that is of importance. <Col N="928" /> I raise it to discover what is the Government's view on it.  It is whether it is thought that the effect of this legislation is to give a clear primacy in Irish law of community law over laws enacted hereafter by the Oireachtas.  There may be some significance attached to the fact that there is absent from our legislation a provision which appears in the European Communities Act, 1972, which the British legislature has enacted. There is no equivalent to section 3, subsection (1) which incorporates as British domestic law the principles laid down by the decisions of the European Court.  This may be important and I would like to be clear as to the reason for the absence of an equivalent section in our code, because the European Court itself has asserted without qualification in a number of cases&mdash; Costa <i>versus</i> Enel in 1964 and Wilhelm in 1969&mdash;the primacy of Community law over national law.</P>
    <P>It may be the Government's view that it is the effect of Article 5 of the Treaty which is to be made part of the domestic law of this State, which requires each member state to take all the necessary steps to see that its obligations are carried out, and that where there is a conflict the courts, in interpreting that as part of the domestic law of Ireland, will have to give that primacy to European law which has been, apparently, decisively given by the section I have referred to in the United Kingdom Act.</P>
    <P>I take the view that, despite the proposition of Article 5, we are a sovereign independent democratic State and that it has already been part of our law that sovereignty is and can be limited by the implication of Article 29.3 of the Constitution with regard customary international law. The enactment of this legislation will place a further effective and irretrievable limitation on the sovereignty referred to in Article 5.  I am concerned to discover the actual position. I am distressed that the position should be as I think it is because we gain more by accepting this limitation of sovereignty than we apparently lose by it.</P>
    <P>A decision to share our power is involved here with a view to an enhancement <Col N="929" /> of sovereignty in terms of the economic realities which this country has to cope with and which are there irrespective of any legal sovereignty.  It is not an empty phrase to argue that we are providing evidence of the existence of sovereignty by accepting a limitation on it.  We should now look at the nature of the limitation which we are accepting in regard to certain significant policy questions for Ireland.  We are entering a unique federation.  It is a functional, if not a political federation.  It is a federation whose objectives delineated the field of application of the laws capable of being enacted by the institutions of that federation.  The fact that there are institutions in itself supports the view that what one is doing is entering a federation.  The supreme institution which gives evidence of the federative nature of this Community is the European Court, which has been developing, in its interpretation of the treaty and the regulations, directives and decisions made under the treaty, into a system of law which is self-enforcing.  There is other evidence of the existence of a federation.</P>
    <P>The Commission has a legal personality. It is the Commission which made the agreement with GATT.  It has the power to make treaties.  There are also budgetary powers.  I want to ask a question now which is peripheral to what I am talking about. Why do we not find in this Bill any of the matter relative to the fiscal consequences of membership of the Community? I take it that the answer will be that these will be found in some measure introduced by the Minister's colleague.  There does not seem to be any legal provisions here to deal with the financing aspect of membership.</P>
    <P>It is proper to say that there are important questions of policy arising from a contemplation of the present type of Community that we are entering. These are matters about which we, as a people, should be thinking strenuously and about which the Government and its advisers have done their thinking already, because, within that effective area where Community law applies, there is, on examination of the powers of the different institutions <Col N="930" /> of the federation, little limitation on the power of Council in the Commission.  Historically, I think I am correct in saying that at a certain point, as a result of French behaviour, there was a transfer of effective power to the Council where the Minister will be sitting.  The assembly functions under remote and exceptional supervision and sanction.  There is obligation to consult it in certain cases&mdash; as, for example, with regard to directives under Article 100 of the treaty. The Minister will be acutely conscious of the importance of giving the people in Ireland a real sense of participating in the decisions that are going to be made within this area.  It is an area which may become, as time passes, in practice much larger than it has hitherto been, even if that is only because certain of the objectives of the treaty themselves imply a degree of planning which seems to involve political institutions of a kind which we have not had before, such as the whole matter of regional and social development and the co-ordination of policies leading to monetary union.  Is it Government policy to seek to increase the democratic nature of the European assembly so that its members from this country are not found to arrive there by curious processes which the people know little of?  Is there to be a deliberate policy to see, for example, that that assembly is itself strengthened? Is it to be national policy to seek to have the members of the assembly directly elected?</P>
    <P>All this is going to take time.  While that assembly is evolving and while Irish policy is concerned to have it strengthened and to make more obvious to the people its democratic nature, the Community could be getting a bad name in Ireland.  The quality of the men in Brussels raises problems for us.  Their abilities may make them impatient with the delays which people unaccustomed to their procedures may want to impose on them before the particular directive or regulation would receive the warm support of the people.</P>
    <P>A law which is not consented to can become, as we know in Ireland, law without content, law without teeth, law which is not endorsed.  During <Col N="931" /> the period which must elapse before the assembly gets the power which, as democrats we must seek to give it, close attention must be given to the manner in which the Houses of the Oireachtas participate in the government of the Community.</P>
    <P>Irish administration generally may learn much from the procedures of the Commission, may have to learn much.  In our administrative way, in the British tradition, all Irish Governments have had the habit in all the different Departments affected by a particular proposed piece of legislation of keeping it close to the chest. This is not the way of the Commission. They publish drafts, circulate them widely, desire to get reaction, and Irish Departments will find it necessary within the area of the operation of the proposed new law to consult with those who know most and who may have special interests.  It is important that, by discovering the sense of the Houses of the Oireachtas about a proposed regulation or directive, views other than those of people specially affected are also discovered.</P>
    <P>The matter of the operations of this proposed committee is of enormous importance. I understand the Oireachtas Library will be provided with directives and regulations.  This should include drafts in all the different stages of what is proposed to be done.  From the beginning the provision of those documents should be skilfully done with the proper ordering of the matters relative to what is affected.  Those of us who are to continue to butter our bread from understanding what is the law have been filled with a sense of dismay when faced with the mass of regulations which are being received into our legal system. Some assistance has been given to us by an attribution in a non-binding way of the apparently affected area.  When drafts are put into the Library they must be of help to Members of the Dáil and Seanad who wish to understand what is proposed.  They should be told what is thought to be the likely effect of what is proposed on existing law.</P>
    <P>Cataloguing will be of supreme importance. I share the view which has been expressed here that no committee <Col N="932" /> of the size proposed will be able to do this.  Some rota system may be required. There will be some fields which certain people will know better than others.  All the available skills of Parliament must be obtained.  It may be troublesome for the Government if as a result of this we have debates in the Houses of Parliament on what is proposed.  It may be helpful to the final acceptance by the people of what is done that they be given a sense that their views have at least been expressed, views which will be found to be cross-party ones.</P>
    <P>The Minister will have the final say regarding this, as a member of the Council.  It will be of assistance to him to know what he should say, and the longer he stays in Brussels the less familiar he is likely to be with reactions here.  Inevitably the longer you are away from your native city the less you know about it.  I am thinking of my native city of Waterford.</P>
    <P>I should like to make a point regarding the amendment which has been made to the Constitution.  It has removed all obstacles in the Articles of the Constitution invalidating laws enacted, acts done or measures adopted by this State necessitated by the obligations of membership of the Communities.  It is significant that it does not say &ldquo;present obligations&rdquo;&mdash; anything in the Constitution which would invalidate future obligations taken on effectively by the agreement of the Irish member of the Council of Ministers.  These may be obligations which must be accepted as part of the domestic law of the State and no part of the Constitution can be invoked to prevent these or to cause an impediment to them.</P>
    <P>Some of the objectives of the treaties, such as regional, social, co-ordination of economic and other policies to achieve monetary union, are large and could include many things and would seem to imply political institutions.  The people have not authorised the transfer of any executive, legislative or judicial powers to any future Community but this Community can begin to do many things to achieve their objectives that they are not doing now.  Obligations may be imposed to achieve what is described as a European Economic <Col N="933" /> Community which may be much more of a political community than they are at the moment, particularly having regard to the provisions of Article 235 of the Rome Treaty to the effect that the Council may adopt unanimously any measure to further the objectives of the treaty even if there is no express power.</P>
    <P>Law which becomes a secret science is bad law.  We are in a limited area at the moment where Community law is directly applicable.  That is the area which is defined by reference to all matters which make for a unified or common not fragmented market.  Community law is expressed in different terminology to that used by Irish draftsmen and lawyers.  There are different styles involved.  We will have to face the problem of reconciling laws in no way related.  Although I have great sympathy with those criticised in the problem they were faced with, I must say that while it has been some assistance to practitioners to be told where the Government think that in a non-obliged way our laws are affected, an insufficient effort has been made to clear up in an express way conflicts that may well be there.</P>
    <P>The United Kingdom have amended in an extensive way in schedules to the Act their laws which required amendment by way of reception into United Kingdom law of the law of the Community.  I cannot see why the same has not been attempted here. There are two areas where directives are primarily operative where the British have clearly faced the problem. A directive merely defines the objective to be attained, leaving open to the national parliament the means to be adopted.</P>
    <P>The British have amended their company law expressly to eliminate any problem.  There is at least one problem of which I am aware which may arise because of the language of the directive with regard to company law and reconciling it with British company law.  I cannot see why we have not done this, particularly as the directive calls on all companies to set forth their capital on their notepaper, failing to recognise that there are some companies <Col N="934" /> operating under Irish law without any capital.  These are companies limited by guarantee without a share capital.  The British have solved that problem by enacting a section which expresses the directive and applies it only to companies with a share capital.</P>
    <P>There is another area in which a substantial change in the law will take immediate effect from 1st January next.  That is in the field of competition. The famous Article 85 deals with exclusive dealing agreements, sole agencies, licences, know-how arrangements and alleged abuses of industrial property.  In the Wilhelm case, to which I have already referred, the European Court has gone very far in accepting what is known as the double-barrier theory with regard to restrictions on competition.  They have accepted that you can have a national law which contains its own method of removing restrictive practices side by side with the Community law on the same matter.  Provided the national law does not make illegal something which is exempted by the exemption section 3 of Article 85, both can stand.  The British by amending their restrictive practices code seem to have made that possible.  I do not know why we have not done this.</P>
    <P>I should have liked to have seen in the White Paper an account not only of what has been done in this area but an account of what it is proposed to do.  We will have to face this question of reconciling existing law with new laws.  The field of insurance and exchange control immediately arise.  The laws relative to these will change.  That is quite clear from the terms of the treaty.  It may take some time to change the law on insurance because of considerable problems in that field.  The nature of the change to be contemplated should be given consideration, as early as possible.</P>
    <P>In patent law if an employee in the course of his employment invents something the invention becomes the property of the employer by virtue of either an express or an implied term of employment.  This may or may not be good law.  The proposed European patent will make that matter one for the domestic law of the country concerned.  You can have a European <Col N="935" /> patent which can be got by the employee applying to the European Patent Office if he is in a country giving him the right.  The employer could come to the Irish Patent Office and get a patent for the same thing. The matter could then be determined by who is there first.</P>
    <P>European Community law has been described as a reflection on the Community level of continental administrative law.  The European Court has power to annual measures which violate community law or represent a misuse of power, or it can decide that a measure should be taken where the Council of the Commission had failed to act. In the latter one the Court has taken a German concept which the French do not have.</P>
    <P>It is very important that we develop here a proper system of administrative appeal tribunals.  May I make this point which appears familiar to the Minister?  Because of the possibility of proceedings for <i>mandamus</i>, prohibition or <i>certiorari</i> existing in relation to these tribunals, it would seem that the tribunals will not be the tribunals of last resort. There will be no obligation on them to refer Community questions to the European Court.  This will mean that business enterprises, making their case before such tribunals and invoking Community rights, may find themselves, because of the existence of the limited powers as we know them a <i>mandamus</i>, prohibition or <i>certiorari</i> proceeding, unable to look to the European Court for assistance in the exercise of their Community rights. The matter may be of considerable human importance where, for example, we are dealing with the rights of migrant workers who may be claiming social insurance rights here and who may be unable to claim their rights beyond the tribunal in question.</P>
    <P>It must be remembered that the business enterprise or the workers would appear to have no right of recourse against this State before the European Court.  The best it could do would be to get the Commission to bring the member state, Ireland, to book if it was failing through this <Col N="936" /> tribunal to give the European Community right to the particular enterprise or person.</P>
    <P>What way will the request for preliminary rulings in inferior courts work?  I presume it will be regulated by rules of court.  Could we be told the state for which the amendments to these rules may be?  What is the policy with regard to the question of the refusal of an inferior court to refer a matter to the European Court? Is this matter capable of appeal to the superior court?  If it be not, should it not?  Does it involve a change of the substance of law with regard to our courts to give this right of appeal? It would be proper to have it well ordered so that these matters should be finally determined by one court here which will get and develop experience on the matter.</P>
    <P>I would end with a simple question &mdash;there is nothing barbed about it.  It is a simple question which occurs to anyone who reads the equivalent UK provision.  The UK have limited the powers to make subordinate legislation by providing that there should not be included any power to make any provision imposing or increasing taxation, or to make any provision taking effect from a date earlier than that of the making of the instrument containing the provision; or conferring any power to legislate by means of orders, rules, regulations or other subordinate instrument other than rules of procedure for any court or tribunal; or to create any new criminal offence, and so on.  There are no similar restrictions in this Bill.  I am sure that the matter has been considered and it may be that the protection will be found elsewhere.  I should like to know where that protection is and if it is understood that there are these restrictions, because we have amended the Constitution by removing any provisions which would invalidate any of the acts or measures of the Community.  I am not personally clear in which manner the Constitution can be invoked to protect the people from, for example, subordinate taxation or retroactive legislation, and so on.  I would be grateful if I could have some information on these points.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PierceButler" hpid="Mr. Butler Mr. Butler">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Butler</NameTxt>
      <P>I find it difficult to rise to speak, especially after listening to Senator Alexis FitzGerald with his legal mind.  Mainly I wish to criticise Senator Keery's speech here yesterday, in particular where he stated that when directives are passed we can either hedge them, overlook them or hide them.  If we are members of the EEC we should not make this type of statement in the Chamber.  We should be full members of the Community and take an active part.  If directives are passed it is binding on us to accept them and put them into effect.</P>
      <P>The Minister stated that he would have a committee of the Dáil and Seanad to advise him.  This committee should be formed and be an advisory one before the directives and regulations are passed.  Our Parliament will be much reduced by this type of situation, where regulations and directives can be passed by the EEC and we will have little to say in the matter but to accept them.</P>
      <P>Senator Keery quoted two directives, Directive 63/261 of 2 April, 1963:</P>
      <P>laying down procedures for achieving freedom of establishment in agriculture in the territory of a Member State for nationals of other Community countries who have been continuously employed for two years as agricultural workers in that Member State.</P>
      <P>and Directive 63/262 of 2 April, 1963:</P>
      <P>laying down procedures for achieving freedom of establishment on agricultural holdings deserted or not cultivated for more than two years</P>
      <P>He also quoted our own Land Act, 1965.  Our Land Act of 1965 will have no effect as and from 1st January, 1973.  We will then be bound by those two directives.  I feel there is no importance attached to bringing the Land Act, 1965, before the Oireachtas for amendment because the changes have already been made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister what is the meaning of the expression &ldquo;agricultural worker&rdquo; in the context of this document?  I know this point was debated during the campaign.  At that time I spoke at many seminars and symposiums and tried to clarify <Col N="938" /> the meaning of &ldquo;agricultural worker&rdquo;. This question was raised at almost every meeting I attended.  It was pointed out that any person from the EEC countries could, after two years, purchase land here.  He could then get his son to work with him and after two more years he, in turn, could purchase more land.  This is not the type of agricultural worker I envisage. I should also like to ask the Minister the meaning of the phrase &ldquo;agricultural holdings deserted or not cultivated&rdquo;.  What does &ldquo;not cultivated&rdquo; mean?  We have land in this country which is described as not being cultivated but I believe much of this land is cultivated.  It may be under grass but it is worked.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the European Parliament.  I am sure it was discussed here yesterday but I was unavoidably absent.  The importance of the European Parliament is not fully recognised.  We read in the papers the various speeches made at the European Parliament but they are not given the prominence they deserve. The European Parliament is put across in such a way as to make it appear unimportant.</P>
    <P>We are sending ten Members of our Parliament to the European Parliament and I hope those Members will look upon it as an important job.  I hope they will carry out efficiently what we expect of them.  The parties who have the job of selecting those ten Members should see to it that the best men will be sent.  I believe that some of the people who will go to Europe to represent us will be sent because they have requested to go there.  They are anxious to go probably because they feel that it is a good place and they will have a good time there.  I hope every Member of the Oireachtas and people in prominent positions in the country will keep a watchful eye on our Members in the European Parliament and point out to them the importance with which we regard that Parliament.  They are our ambassadors and we must see to it that they do their work properly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBelton" hpid="Dr. Belton Dr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>It has only come to the notice of most of us here that the Minister has had a bereavement in the <Col N="939" /> family.  We wish to offer him our sincere condolences.</P>
      <P>The question has been raised by Senator Butler&mdash;I was not here to listen to all of yesterday's speeches but I am sure Senator Robinson raised this point too&mdash;of our representation in the European Parliament and how the ten Members will be, or have been, selected.  The Seanad should have been considered far more seriously in that selection than it has been.  I do not believe it is correct for the Dáil to arrogate to themselves the selection of the Members of the European Parliament without prior consultation with the Seanad.</P>
      <P>If one analyses the situation correctly, Members of the Dáil who will be selected for Europe will have two duties to perform.  They will have to look after our interests in Europe but they will also have one eye on their own constituency.  They will have two jobs and perhaps may not do either properly.  They will, inevitably, try to cut short their duties in Brussels to make sure that nobody gets in behind them in their own constituency.  This position would not apply to Senators. Senators, in my opinion, may be better people&mdash;I do not mean better qualified people&mdash;who would attend to their duties in Europe far more conscientiously than Deputies who have to look after a constituency as well.</P>
      <P>Senator Butler adverted in his statement to the selection of the ten Members. I believe far more consideration should have been given to the Seanad in the selection of those Members.  It is only fair to say so here and now.  Perhaps decisions have been taken on this matter already, but the personnel may need changing at some future date and the Seanad should be seriously considered in such an event.  Senators do not have to look over their shoulder to see if they are going to be returned by the electorate.  They may have to look over their shoulders to see who the county councillors are but that is all they have to look after.  I wish to repeat that the Seanad should have received more consideration in those appointments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr. Hillery) Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr. Hillery)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr. Hillery)</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to thank Senators for <Col N="940" /> their contributions which have been very enlightening and I hope will be very useful.  I shall not answer some of the points raised by Senator FitzGerald now partly because many of them are very interesting legal points with which I am not competent to deal.</P>
      <P>This is a Bill of basic principles. There will be other legislation to deal with specific matters which bothered some Senators.  They are matters which must come into question when we bring the Community law into our own law.  Any comparison with the method of dealing with this legislation in Britain should take into account that our way of looking at it is better.  If some people think that there is a lesser acknowledgment of democracy in our Bill they will have to take into account the fact that we had a referendum which not alone asked for the changes in the Constitution but also was, as was made clear beforehand in statements made by the Taoiseach, a consultative referendum as to whether or not we should become members of the Community and take on the obligations of it.  That plus the safeguard clause in our legislation which has on occasions been overlooked, not alone by both Houses but also by me.  The clause in our Bill which ensures the involvement of the parliament is stronger than anything in the British Act.  It quite clearly demands that everything made by ministerial regulation shall be confirmed by statute or otherwise will lapse.  It means that every decision to implement a directive will be confirmed by statute, and if not it will lapse.  The difference is that it is not the subject of statute law when first made.  We did this because we were faced with a situation of making ourselves capable of expeditiously taking on the obligations and the benefits of membership, while at the same time wanting to make sure that the Oireachtas had their full say.</P>

    <P>It is quite clear to me that if Ministers decided to implement by statute everything it is binding on them by directives to implement, we could very quickly have both Houses of the Oireachtas rendered impotent and quite incapable of dealing not alone with Community legislation but with <Col N="941" /> any other business.  I do not think that either House would want this.  As well as doing that, we could also reach a situation where we were not able to fulfil our obligations.  Therefore, this law makes it possible for Ministers to do by regulation what needs to be quickly done.  It makes it possible for them to select what needs to be done that way.  It also makes it binding on them to have what they bring into our legislation by regulation passed through both Houses&mdash;through all stages of legislation&mdash;within six months.  Any Minister making a ministerial regulation must have regard to this.  I cannot imagine any Minister who has to come to both Houses for legislation to confirm his regulation wanting to make a regulation other than one which would be passed by the Oireachtas, if brought to it in the first instance.  No Minister would want his regulations to lapse if they were an essential part of the fulfilment of our obligations to the Community. Therefore, in framing regulations to implement Community directives, Ministers will probably frame them with an eye to their going through the Dáil and Seanad.</P>
    <P>There is therefore a double feature: there is influence on the Minister framing a regulation, and there is the fact of making it lapse if the Houses do not want it.  It is a very strong safeguard, but we all overlook it, because the prominent feature of the Bill is to give power to Ministers to make regulations.  That power disappears unless it is confirmed within six months by legislation and all the procedures of legislation.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to some notes to help answer points made by Senators. However, I would ask Senators to regard this as a Bill of principle. I believe that many of the suggestions and amendments I have seen and many of the doubts raised are based on misapprehensions of the purpose of the Bill.  The distinction between regulations and directives is one of the things that caused us problems. For simplicity in explaning the matter to the public and because, in principle, they were intended to be quite different, we have always described a Community <Col N="942" /> regulation as something which has direct application in the member countries, regardless of national parliaments. A directive is something which sets out the objective to be attained, but leaves to the national governments the method of attaining that objective.  In detailed examination we have found that there is a grey area.  There are some regulations which need ancillary legislation to make them fully effective, if not for their implementation.  There are certainly some directives&mdash;or some parts of some directives and decisions&mdash; which are directly applicable.  Our section 2 is based on this absence of a clear division.  In other words, there is no clearly drawn line between the provisions which are and the provisions which are not directly applicable.</P>
    <P>There are two individual cases which I wish to give to Senator Robinson, rather, to give the reference.  They are: 1. Sace Case; No. 33/70 (1970), Common Market Law Reports, Vol. X, (p. 1), and 2. Franz Grad Case; No. 9/70 (1970), Common Market Law Reports, Vol. X, (p. 123).  These are examples of EEC directives and decisions which are directly applicable. Having accepted that, Senators will see the need for Article 2.  If we had had quite a clear distinction as we thought existed earlier on between directives and regulations, we might have been able to frame it in a different way.  The situation being as it is, to achieve the effect we wanted the best way possible was to provide that the Treaties and Acts <i>in toto</i> should become part of our domestic law under the conditions laid down in the treaties.  This may not be immediately clear.  I have explained it several times in the Dáil and perhaps after a time, it will be accepted.  I shall refer to it again on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>There was an objection to the Government implementing directives by ministerial order rather than by legislation, and there was a suggestion that this might be unconstitutional.  I dealt with this before.  The amendment which the people made to the Constitution last May was drafted so as to save from invalidity a provision necessitated by the obligations of membership which <Col N="943" /> otherwise would have been in conflict with the Constitution.  Senators will see then that we have, already, delegated legislation.  We never regarded delegated legislation as being in conflict with the Constitution.  It is only had it been in conflict with the Constitution that we would be seeking, in this legislation under the Amendment to the Constitution to make it possible on the grounds that it was necessitated by membership.  Therefore, we are not stating anything new in relation to our Constitution by having delegated legislation by ministerial regulation.</P>
    <P>When I say that it is not in conflict with the Constitution, it was suggested in the Dáil that under this legislation it was in conflict with the Constitution. My comment to the Deputy who raised it was that this was not doing a service to our European attitude, because what was being questioned is something which exists.  There were 350 such statutory orders last year; presumably there were as many every other year and nobody ever questioned their constitutionality until we came to meet our obligations of European membership which are very pressing, and need to be met.  Until now the power to make ministerial regulations we provide for here has not been found to be unconstitutional, and there is nothing in this Bill that would make it less constitutional than any power to make ministerial regulations given before.</P>
    <P>It was mentioned that no provision had been made for the recall of the Seanad.  Senator Nash said that this was reasonable because the role of the Seanad normally follows on legislation in the Dáil.  The Seanad does not have difficulty in coming together.  The purpose of this section was in case Members would want to question a new regulation.  Deputies who put forward an amendment to it in the Dáil felt that the Government might find itself having gone beyond the time provided&mdash;now six months&mdash;and requiring to have Dáil confirmation, and find the Dáil in recess.  The attitude of Deputies who wanted to amend this section was &ldquo;If it is going to help the Government we will not press this amendment&mdash;it is up to the Government to ensure that they get <Col N="944" /> their confirmatory legislation through before any long recess.&rdquo;  I do not see anything in principle against providing for the Seanad being recalled but they can do it without putting it into this Bill.</P>
    <P>My speech is a bit disconnected because I am going through points made by different Senators.  Senator Robinson suggested that there is insufficient Parliamentary control.  Our confirmatory provision is absolutely necessary, or otherwise any regulation lapses and is no longer functioning or no longer law.  The original Bill drafted provided that these confirmatory Bills would come the following year.  I gathered from the debate that this was a bit long.  If there was some law enacted by a ministerial regulation that was not liked it would be a long time to wait until the following year and we agreed on every six months.  In actual practice having this six months' provision, as Senator Nash has pointed out, may mean full legislation and debate on regulations three times a year.</P>
    <P>We have a strong Parliamentary safeguard, stronger than anything in the British Bill.  I do not like making comparisons, but they have been made for me and I have to answer them.  The Bill was said to lack explicit repeals and amendments.  Most Senators will know that when a provision in existing domestic law is in conflict with directly applicable community law, the existing domestic law will be automatically amended or repealed to the extent of that conflict.  This is the principle of implied amendment and repeal.  Therefore it is not necessary to amend or repeal specifically.  Specific amendment and repeal would involve exhaustive and time consuming examination of our statute law at a time when I would like to say our resources are fully extended and devoted to the preparations for membership.  Any assertion of laziness in the preparation of the annex to the explanatory memorandum is misleading. Our resources are fully extended in making it possible for us to undertake the obligations of membership and to go through this exhaustive examination of statute law at this time would be to take people away from something which is more essential.  The <Col N="945" /> House will have to appreciate that our resources in manpower and talent in this country are not unlimited.</P>
    <P>The list of the enactments in the appendix to the memorandum is the result of examination by the State Departments, but it does not purport to be exhaustive.  It could not in any country.  Nobody could be quite sure that any list is exhaustive, and it is as good as Departments can do to give such an indication.  Since it is not exhaustive, provisions for amendments or specific repeals based on the list would be selective and we felt that this would be confusing rather than helpful to the public.</P>
    <P>Finally in this question of repeal and amendment, there is a large area of doubt which can be resolved only by decision of the courts, because it is proper to the courts rather than to the Oireachtas.  These are reasons why we did not try to do it.  The Taoiseach mentioned in the Dáil that there would be frequent statute law revision Acts.  We will depend on frequent revision of the statute law to make it tidier for the public and lawyers. Given an indication that certain laws are affected by Community regulations this means that there will be an indication to whoever is interested that these have been affected and if the Community law is in conflict then these laws are repealed or amended. The Departments will be available to people having problems of this nature to help guide them.  I feel that it is the job of a lawyer to find his way once he knows that there is a possibility of domestic law having been amended or repealed according to this principle. He will get help from the Departments, but they could not undertake to do the job for him.  One representative of the law said that no lawyer in Dublin knows the law, and then expected the lawyers in Foreign Affairs to write it down for him.  There is no magic in Foreign Affairs that makes it possible for a lawyer to find an easy way in a difficult situation to solve a problem which cannot be solved by lawyers in practice outside. Our resources are fully extended, but it is possible for it to be done, and it is a function of the lawyers themselves to do the research necessary.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="946" /> Senator Robinson asked if we will have the backlog of directives, which are now operative, implemented by the 1st January.  We will in so far as it is necessary to have it done.  Even though we want to have them all done by the 1st January the obligations may not fall all together on us on that date, but, depending on the passing of the basic legislation I hope to be able to have the regulations made and therefore be able to take on our obligations.</P>
    <P>As regards the disappointment expressed at the result of the summit in relation to the institutions of the Community, it is likely that this country would want direct elections to the Community in the early stages.  It would suit us.  At this time we have no experience whatever of the functions of the institutions.  We are secure because in the Council of Ministers where the decision making is done there will be no decision taken against the vital interests of any one member, As a Government, that gives us a very strong position.  However, we feel that the development and strengthening of the institutions of Europe would be totally to our benefit since we are a small country.</P>
    <P>But until we have experience of the operation of the institutions we cannot argue with any conviction or force about the reforms which should be made.  The Taoiseach supported at the summit the Dutch proposal for direct elections by universal suffrage.  Apart from the principle of wanting to strengthen the institutions, in real practice it may be better for us to have direct elections.  As Senator Belton stated it will be difficult for any Member of the Dáil to leave his constituency as our system of voting encourages competition when you leave your constituency even for a short period.  We calculate it would take approximately 100 days in a year to properly carry out the duties of a Member of the European Parliament. This could discourage TDs from wanting to become Members of the European Parliament and for that reason it could be more suitable for Senators.</P>
    <P>There has been no selection of members yet nor have we decided <Col N="947" /> on a method.  The methods of selection in the Dáil to date have been consultations between the parties.  There was no question of excluding Senators.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">

      <P>I gather that in the Seanad all are independents.  If we had this legislation it is possible that the agreed method of doing it would be provided for by ministerial regulation. I will bring the views of the Seanad to the notice of the Government.  I agree it would be easier for Senators.  We should seek for the strengthening of institutions and we will probably play an active part in that once we get the feel of how the institutions of Europe are working.  We are fully extended in becoming members this year.  It is a very big achievement for this country. We will play a big part in strengthening the institutions as that is in our national interest.</P>
      <P>Senator Alexis FitzGerald mentioned the possibility of very clever people being impatient with delays caused by the needs of politics.  The Commission as envisaged now will be made up of politicians who should have some experience of how to assess what legislation will fall for want of public support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator McDonald was worried about the &ldquo;wide powers&rdquo;, and Senator Jessop mentioned there would be 200 ministerial regulations, rather than my educated guess of 20.  We were on two different wavelengths.  The Community regulations, which constitute the vast majority of the legislation, consisted last year of approximately 2,900.  The ministerial regulations would implement European directives and would be perhaps 20 in number in a normal year.  There were about 400 directives last year.  Many of these would be possible of implementation under existing law and others would be administratively implemented.  Having got over the backlog, there would be no more than about 20 ministerial regulations per year.  There will therefore be no massive addition to the volume of <Col N="948" /> statutory instruments or accretion of ministerial powers.</P>
    <P>Senator Cranitch mentioned an unhappy advertisement, not by the Commission but by a member of the Secretariat of the Council.  The Secretary General of the Council has been approached by our Ambassador and he had been assured there is no question of any Irish citizen not being eligible for recruitment because of the requirement that English be the mother tongue.  I hope in future the council will follow the Commission's formula when drafting advertisements, seeking people with a thorough knowledge of English.  This was not intended as an offence but people might feel excluded by the use of the words &ldquo;mother tongue&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Senator Russell mentioned the needs to preserve the powers of the Oireachtas.  I should like again to point to the confirmation of ministerial regulations which would have to be done by full legislation.</P>
    <P>Senator Jessop stated there was no mention of human health.  This is true.  The progress to date in the Community, which is reflected in its legislation, has dealt more with the fields of economy and trading.  These matters include animal health.  Social developments have been slow.  The overall Summit decisions indicate that the accent would be away from economic trading on to people.  We are looking forward to a new development in Europe that would be concerned with people as individuals and the social aspects should get more support in future.</P>

      <P>I agree.  In reply to Senator Butler, an agricultural labourer may be defined in some Acts for the purpose of those particular Acts. In terms of Community regulations about the land purchase, two have been adopted.  One states that, if a man works as an agricultural labourer for two years in a country of the Community, he can buy land in that country.  Our own authorities would <Col N="949" /> have to decide if he fulfilled the requirements.  There is no problem from the point of view of the Minister for Lands in this regulation.  The second one states that, if land lies idle for two years, it would be possible for any citizen of the Community to buy that land.  The full right of establishment is in draft but has not been adopted.  The Minister for Lands is quite satisfied that this does not create a problem for us.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the points raised.  Senator Robinson raised the question of amendment.  This is a Bill of principle.  If you put in all the amendments and the limitations you are departing from the principle of making it possible for a Minister quickly to make a regulation subject to having it confirmed by legislation. He does not escape going through all the legislative procedures in the Dáil and Seanad.  When any amendment was put to me that would put a limitation on the Minister it was put and argued in the absence of any mention of section 4 which made it absolutely essential to go through the legislative process or it would lapse.  In dealing with the Bill as one of principle I saw no need to exclude matters.  The purpose of excluding them would be that the Minister would, in the first instance, have to come to the Dáil and Seanad rather than make his regulation and come back in six months. The amendment has been put up in the terms of the British Act which is quite a different one.  Ours is a better Bill with a much stronger safeguard. From listening to the debate there is just one aspect I would like to mention and that is the creation of a new criminal offence.  It is necessary to be able to do this but perhaps there should be a limitation on the degree of criminal offence.  Perhaps we should say that it would not be possible to create a new indictable offence.  It is somewhat illogical of me in so far as all regulations made by Ministers will be subject to Dáil and Seanad approval or they lapse.  It is the one amendment that was raised in the Dáil and Seanad that I feel might be brought into the Bill.  I will give the matter some thought.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was very encouraged to hear Senator Keery's remarks.  He took an attitude which I hope we all will take not alone in the Houses of the Oireachtas but in business, agriculture, trade unions and management.  We must make ourselves better able to cope.  He did criticise our Library here and the various facilities at our disposal.  We have agreed to set up a committee.  It is <Col N="951" /> not appropriate to this Bill as it is one of principle.  It should be a joint committee. The best approach in setting up a joint committee is to have expediency resolutions in each House of the Oireachtas to agree on the numbers, terms of reference, <i>et cetera</i>.  The amount of legislation being done in the European institutions is so great that no Member of the Dáil or Seanad could keep abreast of it.  It would be like trying to keep up with every decision being made in every Civil Service Department. Ninety per cent of the legislation last year in Europe dealt with the administration of the common agricultural policy.  It would be quite ridiculous if each Member of the Houses of the Oireachtas tried to keep up with that.  There are some pieces of legislation such as the right of establishment in land which contain real political decisions and are matters of importance. Other parliaments have had committees which have become swamped with the amount of documentation coming into them.  The committee which we propose to set up should have its own secretariat.  Senator Jessop mentioned several committees.  The functions of the committee will cover several Departments of State and in that sense there could be several committees.  But one committee with an adequate high level civil service secretariat with access to State Departments would make it possible for Deputies and Senators to know the significance of various regulations coming out.  Draft Community legislation will be placed in the Library. The confidential matters are limited. They usually relate to financial matters or the taking of decisions in negotiations. The main legislation, which is not confidential, will be available in the Library.</P>
    <P>I should like, if it were possible, to take the Committee Stage of this Bill next week.  We have to bring in about 70 regulations to meet the backlog.

      <P>The Marriages Bill, 1972, settles a minimum age for marriage and eliminates certain difficulties and doubts arising under the existing marriage laws.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an interim Bill with the limited objective of making some rather urgent amendments to the marriage code and I have gone on record as welcoming a general overhaul and codification of the marriage laws which go back over 100 years. Indeed, I have been encouraged by the extent of support which has been made manifest for such a comprehensive measure and, if this House also indicates its support for such a move, it may be taken that the necessary steps will be initiated by me at an early date to make a start on this. I must reiterate my belief that the need for such a comprehensive measure must be accepted generally and that all religious bodies must have a considerable voice in working out <Col N="953" /> a revised marriage code.  My reason for saying this arises from the need to obtain not alone a consensus of views, but, as far as possible, agreement of views, on matters which are so delicate and so complex and so important as the marriage code.  These requirements affect every member of the community in one way or another; they are interwoven with religious beliefs and practices; they are interlinked with rights to property; they have international repercussions.  The difficulty of such a task should not be under-emphasised.</P>
    <P>Consultations on this small Bill, which has had complexities out of proportion to its size, have been undertaken with all religious bodies both before the provisions of the Bill were formulated and in specific terms after its introduction.  And I think I can say that in every case where one religion only was concerned in a provision that that provision is to the complete satisfaction of the religious denomination concerned.  Where a provision affects more than one I have done the best I could to meet the wishes of all.  I think I can say that the Bill has not alone been generally welcomed by the religious denominations but that all the pressures have been to have it enacted without further delay.  I must again record my appreciation of the religious bodies, whom I consulted, for their willing co-operation in this matter.</P>
    <P>On the detailed provisions, section 1 fixes 16 years as the normal minimum age for marriage.  There is provision made for exemptions to be given for specified reasons and subject to specified safeguards which are set down in the section.  This is the first time we have had a statutory minimum age for marriage and up to now we have been dependent on a common law requirement under which the minimum ages were 12 years for a girl and 14 years for a boy.</P>
    <P>I should perhaps explain that a United Nations Convention of 1962 provided that parties to the convention would take legislative action to specify a minimum age for marriage and to provide that no marriage should be legally entered into by any person <Col N="954" /> under that age except where a competent authority had granted a dispensation as to age for specified reasons in the interests of the intending spouses.  The United Nations followed this up in 1965 when the General Assembly recommended member states to fix the minimum age at not less than 15 years.  In drafting section 1 it will be noted that the interests of the intending spouses are in fact kept to the fore.  The minimum age of 16 obtains as regards males in the United Kingdom, Italy, Portugal and Spain and of 18 years in eight other European countries and a minimum of 20 in two others.  As regards females, a minimum age of between 12 and 16 obtains in nine European countries, a minimum of 17 in one and a minimum of 18 in four others.  In 12 European countries there is provision for exemption from the minimum age.  The numbers of marriages in Ireland of persons one of whom was under 16 years of age average about 30 a year of whom the great majority are Roman Catholic marriages.  In 1969 and 1970, for example, of the 60 girls and three boys under 16 who married 57 were Roman Catholic.</P>
    <P>Section 2 deals with the validation as to form of the marriage of an Irish citizen which was solemnised in Lourdes, by a religious ceremony only, before the passing of this Act where the requirements of the French civil law were not complied with.  That law requires marriages to be by civil process whether or not a religious ceremony is also performed and the absence of the civil process in the small number of cases concerned has raised a doubt about the &ldquo;Lourdes Marriages&rdquo; as they are called.  It is possible and perhaps probable that the Irish courts would hold such marriages as valid here but the present section settles any doubt which might arise.  The section also contains a provision for optional registration here if the parties so desire.</P>
    <P>Section 3 deals with certain marriages of members of the Church of Ireland.  Some of their churches have in the past been amalgamated or closed and the districts of the closed churches or amalgamated churches <Col N="955" /> should have been attached for marriage purposes to a church which was still open.  The section covers cases where this was not done in good time.</P>
    <P>Section 4 concerns the members of the Orthodox Jewish faith and permits the secretary of the synagogue to appoint a deputy to act in relation to the registration of marriages solemnised in the synagogue during the secretary's absence.</P>
    <P>Section 5 deals with the Dublin Jewish Progressive Congregation which was established some 26 years ago.  It provides for recognition, for civil purposes, of marriages solemnised in the synagogue of the congregation.  It terminates the arrangement, which has operated up to now, whereby, despite a religious marriage ceremony in their synagogue, they were required, for civil purposes, to have another marriage ceremony in a registrar's office.  The section also provides for the appointment of a deputy to the secretary who will register marriages held in the synagogue in the absence of the secretary.</P>
    <P>Section 6 is designed to facilitate members of small religious groups who have only very few churches in the state.  At present in such cases it is necessary for at least one of the parties to reside for 23 days in the registrar's district in which the church in which they wish to marry is situated before the registrar can issue a licence to marry.  If neither of them resides in such district, one of them has to change residence temporarily.  Under the section such period of residence will no longer be necessary&mdash;the requisite notice can be given in the registrar's district in which he or she resides.</P>
    <P>Section 7 provides in one concise revised provision for what is called parental consent to the marriage of a minor.  This requirement under the section, will apply to all under 21 marriages solemnised in the State including, for the first time, marriages solemnised in Catholic churches.  I would call attention also to the provisions of section 18 of the Bill under which a change may be effected in regard to the age of 21.  Section 7 makes it clear that the marriage of any underage person solemnised in the state must have the consent of both <Col N="956" /> parents or, if only one is alive, then of that parent; or if the child has one parent and also a guardian, then of both those parties.  Where there is no parent or guardian then either party to the marriage may look to the courts for consent and the adjudication of the court may also be sought in cases where a parent or guardian withholds or refuses consent, where the parent or guardian is unknown or of unsound mind or is unreasonably difficult to locate.  If one parent consents, and the other withholds or refuses consent, recourse to the court would also be possible to enable the under age marriage to be solemnised if the court so thinks fit.  The section is drawn in such a way that the consent will be sought from the courts in a manner which is quick, informal and as inexpensive as possible.</P>
    <P>Section 8 of the Bill by changing the words &ldquo;Meeting Place&rdquo; to &ldquo;Church&rdquo; brings the legal titles in relation to the Presbyterian Church into line with the titles in use by that Church.</P>
    <P>Section 9 gives to the Assistant to an tÁrd-Chláraitheoir the same formal statutory powers in relation to marriage as he now has in respect of births and deaths.  It is not clear why the position was ever otherwise.</P>
    <P>Section 10 is of interest to members of the Church of Christ Scientist. Their marriages in registrars' offices are linked, at present, with a requirement to have notice of the intended marriages published in the newspapers. In future this will not be necessary and the notice of the marriage will be sent to the secretary of the church.</P>
    <P>Section 11 removes a restriction in respect of the Church of Ireland mentioned in an Act of 1870 dealing with marriages.  The reference in that Act to rules of the church in force in 1870 is being changed to rules of the church in force from time to time.</P>
    <P>Section 12 will remove restrictions about residence relating to the marriage of members of the Church of Ireland who, for example, moved from a city centre to the suburbs and continued attending at a city centre church.  The section will enable the <Col N="957" /> couple to marry in the church where one of them worships or in the church attached to the district where he or she lives.  The section is of general application throughout the country and deals with any members of the Church of Ireland who have continued to worship in a particular church after moving to another area.</P>
    <P>Sections 13 and 14 deal with the existing statutory requirements about special licences.  Special licences are issued by specified religious leaders who may authorise a marriage of persons of the same religion as themselves at any time without residential qualification and in any place.  These provisions were set out in an Act of 1870.  Sections 13 and 14 provide that, in future, only one of the parties to the marriage need be of the religion of the person issuing the licence.  The sections also make provision for the appointment of a deputy who may issue special licences in the absence of the authorised person.  Section 14 also authorises the Chief Rabbi to issue special licences and this is a new provision in his case.</P>
    <P>Section 15 will operate to enable two or more religious bodies to combine in making joint use of one building for marriage services by the religious bodies if they so wish.  It also removes legal difficulties which exist about the use of temporary buildings for marriage purposes where, for example, the usual building is being reconstructed or has been destroyed by fire.</P>
    <P>With regard to section 16, cases have occurred where parties wished to marry by civil process but one of them was so ill that he or she could not travel to a registrar's office to be married. This provision will authorise an Ard-Chláraitheoir to issue a special licence which, in effect, will enable the registrar of marriages to travel to where the sick person is and officiate at the marriage ceremony there.  The section will benefit those types of hardship cases the number of which is not expected to be large.</P>
    <P>Section 17 wipes out all the existing legal restrictions as to the hours of the day at which marriages may be performed by religious ceremony.  The one exception to this is in regard to <Col N="958" /> civil marriages in a registrar's office and in this case the hours in which marriages may take place are being extended.  The commencing hour remains the same, at 8 o'clock, but the closing hour is 5 o'clock instead of 3 o'clock as at present.</P>
    <P>Section 18 authorises the Minister by regulations, which must be tabled in each House of the Oireachtas, to amend the age limit of 21 which is referred to in section 7 of the Bill and is mentioned incidentally in various consequential provisions of the marriage laws.  The intention is that if the voting age is lowered from 21 to 18 a corresponding reduction will be made in the age of marriage in respect of which parental consent is necessary.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBelton" hpid="Dr. Belton Dr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to discuss a Marriages Bill. There are certain references in section 17&mdash;it was introduced in the Dáil as section 16 but it became section 17&mdash;to Acts that have been repealed. One has to undertake some research to find out what this means.  This is not only relevant to the Marriages Bill before us but to other Bills which are brought in here by other Ministers.</P>
      <P>I would welcome a revision and consolidation of the whole legal code in regard to marriage, in every sense of the word.  I know this would take a long time to complete but we are rapidly reaching the stage where this must be tackled once and for all.  If this is done we will not have to refer back as we must do if we wish to understand section 17 correctly.  Section 17 refers to the Act of 1844 as amended by the Act of 1918.  The years 1863, 1870 and 1919 are mentioned in it.  The Minister has advisers who can produce any information he requires but other people have to look up all the Acts referred to here.  The general codification of law requires consolidation and should be brought up to date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another aspect is whether the Bill is comprehensive enough.  I have some doubts about it.  I have some sympathy with the Minister in that if he did make it more comprehensive there might be <Col N="959" /> danger in it and we might have too many people writing to <i>The Irish Times</i> disagreeing with certain things. Therefore, it may be advisable that it should not be as comprehensive as I should like it to be.</P>
    <P>I shall confine myself to three aspects of this Bill.  The fact that I do not mention any others does not mean that I do not attach to them the same importance. I do, but I see in them less room for contention and argument than the three I am about to mention.  On the Second Stage of a Bill it is not usual to go into detail on the sections.  That is usually done on the Committee Stage where there may be amendments to them but, frequently, on the Second Stage it may be as well to refer to certain sections so that the Minister can reply to them in his winding-up speech and, therefore, preclude or prevent certain amendments being put down in Committee which may delay the passing of the Bill.  It may prevent me from putting down amendments that I would otherwise put down.</P>
    <P>The first contentious point is the question of age.  All of us inherently accept the point that with two people entering into a marriage contract the male partner is generally older than the female partner.  I recognise the difficulty involved in making special laws for one sex.  You would be legislating for special cases which has always been regarded as bad legislation. I think most of us would accept that marriages appear to be more successful where the male partner is at least four or five years older than the female partner.  I accept that the Minister cannot embrace that point in legislation.</P>
    <P>I wish to quote from a biography of Louis XIV.  It is not Nancy Mitford's boudoir escapades of Louis XIV. Vincent Cronin dealt in his book with commerce and finance in the colonisation of Canada.  We read how the Ministers of Louis XIV, Fouquet and Colbert, especially Colbert, decided on the colonisation of Canada.  Certain men were sent out to Canada and returned with furs to keep the ladies warm.  They soon found out that the trappers out there were not warm <Col N="960" /> enough themselves so the king sent out what are called king's women to keep them warm.  I shall quote a piece from that book:</P>
    <P>To stimulate the birthrate in Canada a gift of £7 was given to each youth who married before 20 and to each girl who married before 16.  Families with ten living children, excluding those in religion, were given an annual pension of £100.</P>
    <P>What I am about to say is not too pertinent but it will be of interest to Senator Robinson, I am sure.  Louis's conscientious attendant, Jean Perot, reported that Indian women impaired their fertility by nursing babies longer than was necessary, but he added: &ldquo;This obstacle to the speedy expansion of the colony can be overcome by police regulation.&rdquo;  In other words, the Minister's colleague, Deputy Brennan, Minister for Social Welfare, was not the first to invent the whole idea of giving marriage allowances and children's allowances; it was first done in 1674.</P>
    <P>As the Minister mentioned in his memorandum, there have not been statutory age limits: one could be married at 12 or 14 years up to this. It was just the natural law that decided it&mdash;there is no statutory limitation.</P>
    <P>In those days they were trying to increase the age at which people got married, not reduce it.  However, they recognised then the optimum difference in age between the man and woman who were to be married.  I think that roughly prevails today in most people's minds.  I am sorry to see that Professor Jessop has left because he might bear me out on this point&mdash; this pertains in my opinion at the marriageable ages, that is 20 years and 16 years: it is medically true, in general, that a woman matures earlier than a man and especially in regard to sexual matters and the running of a home, which are necessary in a wife.  A man is inclined to be a bit more irresponsible at that age and therefore this should be the correct difference between the ages of a man and woman getting married.  I do not know how the Minister can get over this.  I do not want to suggest to him that he should make certain legislation for the male <Col N="961" /> and different legislation for the female; that would not be correct.  However, the Minister must agree that the male should be older, generally.</P>
    <P>There is a further aspect of this which does not enter into the matter. If there were not that difference in age between the male and female, a discrepancy may occur at the end of what I might term their sexual life that might lead to certain difficulties in marriage.  Therefore, on balance, not because I do not think a girl is too young to get married at 16 but because I think the male is too young to get married at 16, the striking of the age 18 years may overcome this to some degree.  It does not overcome it in the way that I should like, but it might to some degree overcome the points I have made.  Section 1 (3) (b) (ii) of the Bill states:</P>
    <P>the welfare of the person in respect of whom it is made shall then be the paramount consideration and, in considering that person's welfare, regard shall be had to the religion professed by him or her and his or her moral, physical and social wellbeing.</P>
    <P>I do not know exactly what that means and I should like to have an explanation of it.  For instance, take the word &ldquo;moral&rdquo;.  If a girl unfortunately becomes pregnant&mdash;and a lot of people would like to see her married to the father of her forthcoming child&mdash;it is obvious that she has not been moral. How is one to get over this?  Perhaps two people under 16 years of age who may want to get married and are completely moral may be refused permission. In other words, are we giving licence to immorality?  In my religion the parish priest would like to see the girl married to the father of the child she is going to bear.</P>
    <P>Regarding the word &ldquo;physical&rdquo;, what is meant by it?  Do the parties to this contract of marriage when under 16 years have to be examined by a doctor to see if they can get married? Has a doctor's certificate to be issued as regard their anatomies? There is also the question of whether a psychiatrist should be called in to see if they are mentally fit to get married.  Is this embraced in the word <Col N="962" />&ldquo;physical&rdquo;?  I am not sure what this means.</P>
    <P>Again, I do not know what &ldquo;social&rdquo; means.  Does it mean in effect that if the husband cannot support the girl that a refusal is given?  If they cannot get a house is a refusal given? What does &ldquo;social&rdquo; mean in this context? If I am satisfied with the Minister's explanation in this regard, it will end at that.  However, if I am not satisfied, I may put down amendments at Committee Stage to get more information on it.  That is why occasionally one has to go through sections to find this out before Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Subsection (3) (d) (i) of section 1 states:</P>
    <P>...it may be made by or on behalf of either party to the intended marriage and without the intervention of a next friend,</P>
    <P>Is it correct that one party should do this?  Would it not be better if both parties to the marriage contract came together for this purpose; or whoever is acting for both parties&mdash;whether they be wards of court or otherwise? Why should not both parties be involved in it?</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the movement of labour, capital and other resources when we enter the EEC.  People may say that it is more likely that labour will move out of this country, but we do not know when we might have an E1 Dorado in Tipperary or another Tynagh in Kilkenny or something of this nature when we might have an influx of foreign labour.  There is Muslim, Turkish and Greek Orthodox labour in some European countries at the moment, especially Germany.</P>
    <P>If a new mine were found here, the labour might come into this country instead of going out of it and no provision is made for the religions of such migratory labour.</P>
    <P>The Minister may be able to help me about British passports and how they are valid here.  I mention this because of what has happened in Uganda.  Ugandan Asians with British passports are allowed into England.  They may be Hindus, Muslims or other Asian religions.  We have made no provision in this list for <Col N="963" /> people like that if they came over here.  Do we exclude them?  By listing any religion we are automatically excluding the others.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to section 16 of the Bill as introduced in the Dáil.  Because a new section was interpolated in the Dáil, it is now section 17.  This is the section with all the repealing Acts and amendments to Acts and so on. The word &ldquo;solemnisation&rdquo; of marriage is mentioned in some of these Acts and it is retained here.  The definition of &ldquo;solemnisation&rdquo; is to perform the ritual ceremony.  The Minister may say that the solemnisation in regard to marriage is not included. This may be a perfect answer on the Minister's part, but if he is repealing Acts in which the word &ldquo;solemnisation&rdquo; occurs he is repealing only the provision in relation to the hours from eight to three.  Stroud's <i>Judicial Dictionary</i> defines &ldquo;solemnisation&rdquo; in regard to marriage, as used in a marriage settlement:</P>
    <P>The solemnisation of the said intended marriage means the consummation of a valid and effectual marriage.</P>
    <P>I want to draw the Minister's attention to the provision in this Bill amending the hours from 8 a.m. to 3 p.m. to 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.  Up to now marriages have taken place outside the hours of 8 a.m. to 3 p.m.  I know of marriages which were celebrated at 6.30 a.m., 4 p.m. and 5 p.m. Are the marriages which have taken place outside these hours invalid?  If they are not invalid what is the purpose of this section?  Does it solely refer to the registrar's opening hours? Surely people could wait until the next day to get the marriage registered. All they have to do is sign a book in the religion I belong to&mdash;I am sure it is the same with the Minister's religion&mdash;and the signing of a book is taken as sufficient for the registrar.  This could be forwarded to the registrar the next day.  If this is referring solely to the registrar's opening hours it should be brought out in this.  If not, then surely the marriages that have taken place outside the hours he has mentioned are not valid <Col N="964" /> marriages.  The question of legitimacy in the distribution of property held by one spouse on the death of the other one comes into question in this.  I agree with the Minister when he said that there we are on grounds that are extremely delicate.  It is one that involves many complexities because one has to deal not alone with the statutory law of the State, which must be complied with, but one has to take into consideration the various nuances of different religions that are set out. If the Minister were making an effort to comply as far as he can with the wishes of the various religions and denominations it may have been better not to have mentioned any single one.  He may have to add to this list in a year or two under section 4.</P>

      <P>There is very little more I have to say.  I am quite sure the Minister appreciated the points that I have put forward through the Chair. If I get a responsible reply to the points I have raised it will reduce the amendments put down for the Committee Stage and we will get through this Bill quicker.  I should, however, like to raise a few further points on section 1, subsection (8), following paragraphs (i) and (ii) which state:</P>
      <P>...the marriage shall not be registered save on production, to the person effecting the registration, of&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  in the case referred to in paragraph (a) of this subsection, a certificate signed by the parish priest in whose parish the marriage was solemnised and certifying that the permission was granted by a named person and that that person was duly authorised to grant the permission, or</P>
      <P>(ii)  in the case referred to in paragraph (b) of this subsection, a separate such certificate in relation to each permission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 1 is so long that the point I wish to raise may have been covered somewhere in the section and perhaps the Minister would enlighten me in his reply.  If the parish priest is not available is any provision made that somebody else can act on his behalf? <Col N="965" /> Section 1 deals with so many things and refers backwards and forwards that one becomes slightly involved in dealing with this type of thing.  If this provision has not been made then it should be.</P>
    <P>I should like to commend the Minister in his efforts to solve a very complicated situation with regard to marriages in this country, although I do not necessarily agree that his efforts have been successful.  I should have preferred to have a more consolidated, all-embracing Bill.  There may be some difficulty in providing this at the present moment and perhaps this is not an opportune time to do so.  When things quieten down I presume that, if we have the same Minister for Health, he will provide the proper machinery to consolidate all the Acts that are repealed in section 17 of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Since there are so many legal questions involved, I am amazed that this Bill is being dealt with by the Minister for Health.  It would be more appropriate to the Department of Justice.  I am not suggesting that the present Minister is not capable of bringing in this Bill but, while the health aspects of marriage are important, I am sure he understands my point.  I am not qualified to deal with the legal matters and perhaps somebody will follow me who will deal with them.</P>
    <P>If I receive satisfactory answers to the points I made before the lunch break I may not put down any amendments. I cannot guarantee that amendments will not be put down for the Committee Stage.  The Minister has always been extremely helpful.  I may criticise him at times, but that is my duty&mdash;and I am sure in his reply to the Second Reading he will be equally helpful.</P>

      <P>I should like briefly to associate myself with the other speakers who have worked on this Bill. The Minister in his opening remarks explained to the House that he recognised the need for a more comprehensive Bill.  He indicated that he hoped to bring such a Bill before both Houses in the not too distant future.  I sincerely hope that the &ldquo;future&rdquo; will not be too distant.  I certainly welcome this <Col N="966" /> measure for what it contains.  I also welcome it for regularising a rather unfortunate position in connection with what are commonly referred to as the &ldquo;Lourdes Marriages&rdquo;.  The fact that we have now arrived at a minimum legal age for marriages is very important. I was concerned that it took us from 1962, and from 1965, to bring in this measure.  Without going into the detailed discussion of whether 16, 17 or 18 should be the age, at least it is a step forward that we have established a minimum age.</P>
      <P>I should also like to welcome the Minister's amendment which he introduced in the other House whereby he gave the right of consent to marriage to both parents.  I think he realised when he introduced the Bill that this was causing concern to women particularly active women's organisations.  It remedies the defect in this particular area, one of the first areas in which the State has recognised the rights of mothers.  I hope that shortly we will have legislation which will give the mother the same right to her children as the father has. This does not pertain in other areas&mdash; for example, the claiming of the children's allowances and the right to get passports for the child.  There are many other instances as well.</P>
      <P>I welcome this Bill on behalf of the Labour Party Members in this House.  I look forward to and urge the Minister to introduce a fully comprehensive marriage Bill.  I should like to ask the Minister if he could explain why it is that this item of marriage legislation comes under his Department. It is something which has been queried by a number of people.  It is more a matter of curiosity than of criticism, as to why this type of legislation does not come under the Department of Justice.</P>

      <P>I was very critical yesterday of the European Communities Bill and was gently reprimanded for talking about lazy draftsmanship and preparation of the Bill.  Yet I find myself in somewhat the same position when faced with this Marriages Bill, 1972.  As the Minister said in introducing the Bill, it is an interim measure with a certain urgency attached to it <Col N="967" /> and therefore not a full-scale measure on marriage.  It is confined only to one or two specific aspects.  Given that point, I should like to come back to the general point.  One can look at the drafting with very critical eyes.  I am reluctant to find myself twice in 24 hours being critical of the parliamentary draftsmen.  They are the officials of the Departments and one should perhaps be critical of the Minister as the person taking responsibility for the drafting.</P>
      <P>Looking at section 1 of this Bill, it appears to be an extraordinary approach to the problem.  It reminds me of lecturing to law students about what Parliament can do about blue-eyed babies.  Subsection (1) states:</P>
      <P>(1)  A marriage solemnised between persons either of whom is under the age of sixteen shall not be valid in law.</P>
      <P>Then subsection (2) makes an exception to this proposition:</P>
      <P>(2)  Subsection (1) of this section shall have effect subject to the proviso that where a person who is under the age of sixteen wishes to marry, application may be made for permission for the marriage and, if the application is granted and the marriage is solemnised, the person shall be regarded for the purposes of that subsection as being not under the age of sixteen.</P>
      <P>This seems to be a very strange and unusual way of achieving a point, that you state a proposition and then apply this sort of exception, not based on reality but on the provisions of the subsection.  A person under the age of sixteen &ldquo;shall be regarded for the purposes of that subsection as being not under the age of sixteen&rdquo;.  This is a rather strange and weird approach. I propose to introduce amendments on Committee Stage which would state this in a more straightforward way.  I hope also to introduce amendments on what follows, because we are introducing the possibility of creating exceptions and we are giving to various churches a role in being part of these exceptions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the point made by <Col N="968" /> Senator Horgan in a recent article in <i>The Irish Times</i> that it is ironical that, at the same time as we are hoping to remove the provision recognising the special position of the Roman Church and recognising certain other religious denominations, we are introducing lists of religious denominations into legislation of this sort.  I am not suggesting that this is being done as reflecting either sectarian attitudes or anything of that sort.  This type of legislation is unnecessary and leads to a bad situation. I hope to develop that point by suggesting that it would be much better to leave it purely to the court to decide if there is to be any exception to this age limit of 16.</P>
    <P>Also on section 1, I would be critical of the fact that, where the court is involved, the application in any other case is to the President of the High Court or to a judge of that court nominated by the President thereof.  This seems to be too restrictive. Last year we passed a Courts Bill which was to give more jurisdiction to the Circuit and District Courts.</P>
    <P>This seems an appropriate matter on which application could be made either to the District Court or the Circuit Court or in summary manner to the High Court on the grounds that to provide only for application to the High Court would discriminate against those not living in Dublin.  It could be awkward and unnecessarily restrictive to confine it to the High Court.  Section 1 (3) (b) reads:</P>
    <P>Without prejudice to the next paragraph, in determining whether it shall be granted&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  considerations of propriety shall first be decided on.</P>
    <P>I would be very interested to know what are &ldquo;considerations of propriety&rdquo; here.  Considerations of propriety shall first be decided on and then the welfare of the person in respect of whom the application is made will be considered.  I hope to introduce an amendment here and to suggest very strongly that the welfare of the applicant is surely the first and paramount consideration.</P>
    <P>I have no objection to the rest of the wording of section 1 (3) (b) where <Col N="969" /> it states that &ldquo;regard shall be had to the religion professed by him or her and to his or her moral, physical and social well-being&rdquo;.  I do not understand, and am not at all impressed or persuaded by the phrase &ldquo;considerations of propriety&rdquo;.  I do not see why, in an application of this nature, they should have more importance than the person's own welfare.  This is a very cumbersome and unnecessary procedure.  What I would propose to do by way of amendment&mdash;I give notice of it in this way because I hope by doing so that the amendment will be received in the spirit in which it is offered&mdash;is to introduce a much simpler form such as:</P>
    <P>A marriage solemnised within the State between persons either of whom is under the age of 16 shall, subject to subsection (2) of this section, be invalid in law.</P>
    <P>Then we get the exceptions.</P>
    <P>Where a person who is under the age of 16 wishes to marry an application to do so may be made to the District Court, the Circuit Court or, in a summary manner, to the High Court.  Notwithstanding subsection (1) of this section, a person in respect of whom such an application has been granted shall be capable of contracting a valid marriage within the State.</P>
    <P>That is the end of the provision.  There is no necessity to have the various cumbersome religious clauses.  It is not at all clear how the various authorities of religious denominations would assess this and it is not at all clear why it is proper to give them this role in creating an exception that a person under 16 may marry.  I consider this an appropriate matter for an application to be made to the court.</P>
    <P>It is rather unusual, as set out in section 1 (3) (c), to have the period of residence set at four months.  It reads:</P>
    <P>It shall not be granted unless the place of residence of the person in respect of whom it is made has, during the period of four months ending at the time of the application, been within the State.</P>
    <P>It is normal procedure in questions of <Col N="970" /> capacity to marry that the criterion is permanent residence.  I am interested to know why a period of only four months residence is required in this matter.</P>
    <P>Section 2 deals with the question of the &ldquo;Lourdes marriages&rdquo;.  I would be interested to know why this is confined to marriages celebrated in the Hautes Pyrénées.  One can think of other shrines at which Irish people might have been married or, even in the future, there might be a fashionable shrine to which Irish people might go to be married.</P>

      <P>No, I was thinking of a religious shrine outside the country.  I do not think Leinster House would qualify.  Why are we specifying this one area where the problem has arisen that the religious ceremony was not part of the civil ceremony and in relation to which the country required a separate civil ceremony?  There is always the possibility of introducing a further Bill at some future date or even a Bill in relation to other places where this might occur.  On the actual wording of section 2, it seems unusual that the criterion of citizenship has been chosen.  Under section 2 (1) (b) we read:</P>
      <P>This section applies to a marriage which was between persons both or either of whom were or was citizens or a citizen of Ireland on the day of the marriage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The normal wording would be &ldquo;domiciled&rdquo; or &ldquo;permanent residence&rdquo;. This would be readily understood by courts of other jurisdictions. At present I think they would be puzzled at the introduction of the concept of citizenship rather than permanent residence or domicile.  I use the words &ldquo;permanent residence&rdquo; in order to have the same basis between ourselves and the civil law jurisdictions, because they understand the concept of permanent residence.  They do not have the same legal or technical concept of domicile as we do. Both in Britain and here, in the conventions on private international law <Col N="971" /> now, there is a tendency to use the concept of permanent residence.  The criterion here should not be citizenship of one of the parties in Ireland but permanent residence.  I may have missed the point of the wording on section 2 (2) or else the subsection does not achieve the object which it wishes to achieve.  The subsection states:</P>
    <P>A marriage to which this section applies shall be and shall be deemed always to have been valid as to form if it would have been so valid had it been solemnised in the State.</P>
    <P>I can understand the purpose of this. The purpose was to validate, retrospectively, marriages in Lourdes but has it, in fact, achieved this purpose?  The criterion is a religious ceremony between persons one of whom is a citizen of Ireland.  That, of itself, would not be sufficient in Ireland.  It would have to take place in a registered building and it would have to take place at certain times of the day.  Neither of those criteria are there, so would it, in fact, achieve the result which the Minister hopes?</P>
    <P>It could be argued that this religious ceremony between Irish citizens would not, of itself, be valid if performed in the State.  It would have to be performed in a registered building and within the appropriate times.  I know that we intend changing the times but we are talking about retrospective validation. I am thinking of drafting an amendment to this subsection in which I would propose to delete &ldquo;if it would have been so valid had it been solemnised in the State&rdquo;.  In that way we could remove this problem so that the marriage would be valid as performed, which is the purpose of this section.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to comment on whether he has considered the problem of those who married in Lourdes and then took legal advice on the question and were advised that there was serious doubt as to whether they were validly married.  Have any of the parties to a Lourdes marriage, on realisation that there was doubt as to the validity of their marriage, decided that they were not married and <Col N="972" /> remarried?  If so, what are the provisions in relation to them?  Are we retrospectively creating the crime of bigamy for somebody who was a party to a Lourdes marriage which was not valid at the time they entered into it and which we are making, retrospectively, valid?  Are we leaving somebody who had taken part in a Lourdes marriage, and who subsequently married somebody else, open to a charge of bigamy?  Is this the creation, retrospectively, of a criminal offence? Is there any evidence of whether the parties to Lourdes marriages have subsequently broken up and remarried and has their position been considered?</P>
    <P>In this question of retrospective validation we are by no means the only country which has gone into these provisions, and it is interesting to note the problems which have arisen.  I found that this was very close to what happened in an English case which came before the House of Lords: the case of Stowkovsky against the Attorney-General in 1954, appeal cases, page 155.  I shall quote an extract from this in Grayson's <i>The Conflict of Laws</i>, 6th edition, at page 282. The facts of the situation were as follows:</P>
    <P>In May, 1945, Enrica and Richard, domiciled Polish nationals of Roman Catholic faith, went through a religious ceremony of marriage in Austria, at a time when only civil marriage was permissible. In June, 1945, an order of the Austrian Provisional Government validated such ceremonies retrospectively, provided the marriage was subsequently registered with the appropriate registrar.</P>
    <P>Without taking this step, Enrica and Richard became domiciled in England but separated in 1947.  In 1950 Enrica declared that she was unmarried, went through a civil ceremony of marriage in England with Michael.  In 1949 the religious ceremony of 1945 was registered without Enrica's knowledge in accordance with the Austrian decree of that year.  Enrica was the mother of a child of each of the two unions.</P>
    <P>The House of Lords in that case gave effect to the retrospective Austrian <Col N="973" /> legislation and upheld the first as against the second marriage.  I cite this case because, although the facts are not identical, the sort of problems that might arise are problems which could occur under the provision here. It is always difficult to validate retrospectively.</P>
    <P>I wish to ask what is the position of the parties to such marriages, particularly of a party to a Lourdes marriage, who wished to avail of the apparent illegality of that marriage in order to get out of it?  Has this been considered by the Minister?</P>
    <P>I should also like to hear him on subsection (3) of section 2 on the question of registration.  I notice that here &ldquo;the registrar may, on production of such evidence as appears to him to be satisfactory, cause a marriage to which this section applies to be registered in a register...&rdquo; Do these marriages, then, not have to be registered?  Is it possible to have them registered on the application of one party and not of the other, and what was the thinking behind this question of registration?  Does the registration go to the validity or is it intended that they will be valid in Ireland, even if they are not registered?  These are questions which arise out of the wording of that section.</P>
    <P>I was glad to see that on the passage of the Bill through another place it was amended to allow both parents the responsibility in relation to consent, and not the father only, as had been the case in the original draft.</P>
    <P>I should now like to refer to the question of consent under section 7. I take it that, if the consent is refused or withheld under section 7, subsection (2), the following subsection, regarding the right to apply to the court, shall not apply in a case in which the consent is refused or withheld, or in which the guardian is unknown, of unsound mind or the whereabouts of whom would be unreasonably difficult to ascertain.  I take it that applies if the consent of the guardian is refused, even if that is reasonable, to the marriage of a person under the age of 21.</P>
    <P>I was glad to see that the Minister <Col N="974" /> has retained the option of lowering that age to 18 years.  Do I understand from the Second Reading speech that the Minister intends definitely to lower this age to 18, if the referendum is passed?  It appeared from the Second Reading speech that this was a definite commitment.</P>
    <P>There are some other points to which I should like to refer but, as the Bill is so complicated and so strangely drafted, it is a little difficult to find one's way.  However, I shall raise them on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>As regards the wording of the Bill, I consider it to be a strangely and weirdly-drafted Bill.  I hope this House will table amendments to remove from the Bill the many religious denominations who participate on this question of the application for a person under 16 years to marry.  I hope we will have it as normal that, in the circumstances of creating an exception, an application can be made to the courts, and that we will widen the jurisdiction of the courts in this matter to include at least the Circuit Court.  I should like the District Court to be included also and not merely confine it to the High Court. I realise that the President of the High Court has had a traditional function in such matters, but I do not believe it is necessary that he should be the judicial authority on a question such as this.  It could be applied for in the lower courts and they should be able to look into the criteria.  Some clarification is necessary on the criteria and also on the provisions of section 2 relating to the Lourdes marriages.</P>
    <P>I should also like to be given the Minister's assurance that this is only a very minor interim Bill.  Nevertheless, I am pleased to feel that the wheels are being set in motion and that the Minister is convinced of the necessity for an overhaul of the general marriage law in this country.  There is one specific aspect of this which I should like to query and that is the vital necessity of introducing into the District Court's jurisdiction the possibility of granting a separation between parties to a marriage.  This type of remedy is vital in cases where a woman is being physically assaulted by her husband, either because of alcoholism <Col N="975" /> or because of cruelty or something of this nature.  She has no remedy in the District Court.  She cannot get a separation or protection from him.  This is in contrast with the provisions of the Magistrates' Courts in England.  There the magistrates, who are lay persons and not even judicial officers such as the District Justices, have power under the 1960 Matrimonial Proceedings (Magistrates) Act to grant a separation on specific grounds.  One of these grounds is alcoholism.  Another is cruelty and failure to maintain.</P>
    <P>I am still considering the possibility of introducing an amendment to this Bill to meet this problem and to find precisely what might be done.  In trying to work on an amendment I realise that it is a complex area and it would be better as part of a general revision of the marriage code.  It is of vital importance to many people living in this country.  There is a great human tragedy of women who cannot get protective separation from being victimised by their husbands through drink, neglect, abuse or cruelty, as is standard in the lower courts in other countries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but I will read part of the Minister's Second Reading speech, which indicates a broader approach to the problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an interim Bill with a limited objective of making some other urgent amendments to the marriage code and I have gone on record as welcoming a general overhaul <Col N="976" /> and codification of the marriage laws which go back over 100 years.  Indeed, I have been encouraged by the extent of support which has been made manifest for such a comprehensive measure and if this House also indicates its support for such a move it may be taken that the necessary steps will be initiated by me at an early date to make a start on this.</P>
    <P>It is my hope that, in speaking in a slightly broader framework, I can lend whatever little support I have to the Minister, if it is his intention to bring in a general codification of marriage laws and a general reform.  I have deliberately isolated this single problem.  I know of the marriage problems in this country.  I have talked to Mr. William Dunkin, the lecturer on family law in Trinity College.  The real area of problem is the lack of protection of a spouse who is abused, assaulted or beaten by another, either because of alcoholism, cruelty or the complete failure to maintain, and that the wife cannot get the simple judicial protection to which she is entitled.  The fact that it is possible to apply in the High Court for a judicial separation is a completely unreal remedy for most of these women.  Usually the women are not of substantial means.  They could not proceed with the case in the High Court.  They certainly could not wait the time necessary to get a decree of judicial separation.</P>

      <P>May I interrupt the Senator for a moment?  As the Senator has pointed out, the Minister somewhat widened the scope of this debate in his opening speech.  Nonetheless, it was only a passing reference in his speech.  Therefore, further references to these matters should also be of a passing nature.  The fact that the Minister put in one sentence in his speech does not enable the House to discuss the matter at any length. Passing references would be in order, but no more.</P>

      <P>I accept the ruling of the Chair.  I think I have confined myself to that one area where I would like to see urgent reform in our <Col N="977" /> marriage law.  It is of vital necessity. I am glad to have had the opportunity to state the point clearly.  It must be clear from the other points I have made that I am hoping to table some amendments to this Bill and have a further opportunity on the Committee Stage of speaking on these amendments.  I hope, for the sake of those who are Independents in the House and who have to do home work, that we will not take the Committee Stage with the Committee Stage of the European Communities Bill next week.  There is a great deal of work to be done on this Bill and a good deal of thinking about the form of the amendments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill.  The Minister pointed out that some necessary changes in the marriage laws are urgent.  I welcome the Bill also for the spirit in which it has been worked on by the Minister and his Department for his efforts to consult with the interested bodies, namely, the various churches involved, in obtaining agreement on the forms of amendments to the marriage laws which we feel to be necessary.  I am glad that the Minister outlined this in his opening speech and emphasised that he made considerable efforts&mdash; and I have some evidence of them from my own church&mdash;to obtain agreement among the churches involved in this delicate area.  The problems of marriage are affected by the fact that different churches have different rules and, of course, these come into conflict when two partners of different religions wish to get married.  Some of the church rules are, in fact, rules of law, which are being examined in this Bill.  Some of them are not, such as the <i>Ne Temere</i> decree or the <i>In moto Proprio</i> which now causes tremendous problems.</P>

      <P>Yes, I agree that this is not a law of the State, but I wish to mention it in passing because the Minister has set a headline in his <Col N="978" /> efforts to get the churches to agree. Further agreement along these lines between the churches themselves is most important.  It is the only way in which these problems are to be ironed out.  The fact that the Minister has stressed this in his opening speech is welcome.  He has got agreement between the various churches involved. The Hierarchy are to meet the Irish Council of Churches shortly to discuss marriage problems.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">
      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the point I was trying to make.  One of the things I would like to see included in some legislative way in Marriage Bills is some specific provision for counselling and marriage guidance.  As Senator Belton pointed out, the whole business of marriage, especially of younger people, which we deal with in section 1 of the Bill, is a problem of age and I agree with the amendment to legislation which now raises the age to 16 from ages 12 and 14.</P>
      <P>Marriage at the age of 16 is difficult and creates problems.  Section 1 of this Bill raises problems and the legislation deals with them in a sympathetic way.  There are the problems of making exceptions for people who for some reason have to get married before the age proposed in this Bill or where one of the partners is under age and the other partner is over age and there is some reason such as to avoid immorality and the problem of having children born out of wedlock.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 1 has made an attempt to help these people in a constructive way.  In a mixed marriage in which at least one of the partners is under 16&mdash;by a mixed marriage I mean <Col N="979" /> Protestants marrying Roman Catholics &mdash;and they have to get married to avoid the child being born out of wedlock, so far as the Protestant is concerned the question of permission from the church&mdash;which means the Church of Ireland&mdash;is a pastoral matter.  The other Protestant Churches regard it as being a matter for the jurisdiction of a court.</P>
    <P>There is an area of disagreement here.  There are further problems when a Protestant marries a Roman Catholic in these circumstances.  The Minister and his officials have, through their consultation, made real efforts to get the churches together to work out some consensus on these difficult and delicate problems.  I should like to have seen some reference, even if only a passing one, to the fact that none of these marriages will work.  The incidence of breakdown in marriages of very young people is very high and none of these marriages is likely to work without real help and counselling.  I should like to see something more comprehensive being done in the way of marriage guidance.  It may not be possible to include this directly in this legislation, but some legislation should be introduced which would help the various local authorities to set up real marriage guidance councils and counselling facilities.</P>
    <P>These problems differ between the cities and the rural areas.  The move from rural to urban areas has brought a change in the problems that were faced 25 or 30 years ago.  In the rural areas there is the problem of large numbers of people who are unmarried. In urban areas there is great pressure for early marriages, but they have financial problems and difficulties with housing.</P>
    <P>The general provisions of this Bill to help to legalise marriages such as the Lourdes marriages and marriages which were solemnised in Church of Ireland churches, where there are problems of closure of churches and the actual details of registration were not accurate, will be applauded by everybody.</P>
    <P>The provision in section 11 to <Col N="980" /> change the marriage laws <i>vis-à-vis</i> Church of Ireland partners to the wording &ldquo;in force from time to time&rdquo; is a necessary one, as under the previous form of words marriages were not strictly legal.  The provisions to make the granting of licences more flexible will help people who are involved in inter-church marriages.  The Minister and his Department have the right approach and it should generate more discussion and real thinking about the problems which young people, or people of differing religions, must face.</P>
    <P>There are great obstacles in these inter-church marriages and any legislation which helps to remove some of these obstacles is to be welcomed. This legislation makes a definite effort to help.  It has been brought about by consultation between the churches involved and the Minister and his Department are to be complimented.</P>
    <P>There are many points dealing with the specific sections of the Bill which could be more appropriately raised on the Committee Stage.  I echo Senator Robinson's plea that we do not take the Committee Stage next week as I wish to do some more work on this.  This is a very complex piece of legislation.  It embodies moves in the right direction and if there are things which we can do in this House to imimprove this piece of legislation, we should have at least a fortnight to do the homework necessary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiBrugha" hpid="Ruairí Brugha Ruairí Brugha">
      <NameTxt>Ruairí Brugha</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to compliment the Minister and his advisers on the numerous improvements in the situation regarding marriage and also on their having consulted all the churches concerned. There are some interesting aspects in this Bill.  In sections 7 and 18 I take it the Minister means that, if the referendum for votes at 18 years is passed, the consent of parents will not be required.  In other words, the age level will be reduced from 21 years to 18.  This raises another point.  The Bill specifies 16 years which is a very low age.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One would hope from the statistical history of marriages in recent times that the specification of 16 years and <Col N="981" /> of 18 years with the parents' consent will not encourage marriages at this young age.  There is evidence to suggest that some marriages among such a young age group are not very durable. It is generally accepted that a young couple have to make sacrifices in preparation for marriage and perhaps wait a time while saving to set up a home.  Such marriages have a much better chance of surviving.  I do not know whose responsibility it is to bring out this, perhaps it is that of the churches, but in so far as we are legislating for health some responsibility must rest on the State.</P>
    <P>I agree with the inclusion of the different churches in section 1. Marriage is a union between two people.  The first partner to that union is Almighty God.  The next is the religion of which the persons are members.  What we are doing is assisting. That is the function of the State. Consequently I see no reason why the different religions should not be included in this section because one has to have the approval of one's church to get married.  This only refers here to those under the age of 16 years where exceptions might have to be made.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister in his reply to tell us why it is necessary to refer to one church in subsection (3) and to the other different churches and representatives of religious bodies in subsection (4).  It would seem to me they ought to be together.  The Bill is a very necessary improvement in the situation with regard to the responsibility of the State in relation to marriage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Childers) Erskine Hamilton Childers">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the House for its constructive approach to this Bill.  I should like to stress, first of all, that this is a patching Bill and I should warn the House that I could not possibly accept amendments of any kind that go beyond the ambit of the Bill.  I cannot discuss amendments that relate to marriage guidance councils, the <i>Ne Temere</i> decree or to any other of the matters that have arisen in relation to various discussions which have taken place on the nature and character of marriage in the present world.  I hope the House will bear with me in that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="982" /> Senator Brugha raised the point that I may make an order which has to come before the Houses of the Oireachtas reducing the age from 21 to 18 years.  That means that consent to marriage by parents is not required for those aged over 18 years.  He also inquired why in section 1 (3) and (4) the religions were separated into two groups.  The reason for that is simply convenience arising from present legislation.</P>
    <P>I should like to say we are dealing with a very limited number of marriages in this Bill.  People who discuss the Bill sometimes forget that between 1961 and 1970 there were only 30 marriages a year in which the girl was under 16 years of age.  There have been only six marriages in the whole period from 1961 to 1970 where the boy at the time of the marriage was under 16 years of age.  The House may be interested to know that in 1969 the number of marriages in which one or both of the parties was under 18 years of age was of the order of 500.  In 1961 the number of marriages in the State was 15,000 odd and by 1970 they had increased to 20,000 so we are dealing with a very limited situation in this Bill.  From 18 years to 21 there are a very considerable number of marriages but that is a different question.</P>
    <P>In relation to points raised by Senator Robinson, I do not intend in this Bill in any way to engage in any measure secularising the marriage ceremony.  I wish to state this with absolute conviction.  I am not going to take away from the religious authorities one iota of the main authority they have had in relation to the solemnisation of marriage.  The Marriages Law, 1844, dealt with and provided separately for the different religions.  We are following generally the pattern of that law in relation to this Bill.</P>
    <P>The clergy have accumulated wisdom which I respect in relation to any decisions they will have to make in connection with the operation of this Bill.  It is true that all the churches will have to adapt themselves to face modern problems.  I quite agree with Senator West who spoke about the <Col N="983" /> necessity for providing marriage guidance counselling.  It is being done to a greater or lesser extent everywhere, but I do not believe it can be enforced by State legislation.  This is a matter for community work and for the development of social service councils which encourage this kind of activity. The problem, as the Senator probably knows, is that in Dublin, for example, 80 per cent of the people who take this counselling are already fairly well indoctrinated and the people who need it most are not at the moment in large measure availing of it.  That, again, means there is a problem of gaining the confidence of those who are getting married and having a kind of atmosphere in every parish area which would encourage everyone to take marriage guidance counselling, but it certainly cannot be part of this Bill.</P>
    <P>If I may speak again of my unwillingness to engage in any secularisation procedure, the reason is because I look at countries which have become completely secularised&mdash;I shall not mention them by name. With all our social and moral faults in this country I would not exchange its position with any one of them for anything on earth.  If in one country there is one in every 300 of the live population having treatment for venereal disease, if in another country there are two and a half legalised abortions for every birth, if in a third country there is an illegitimacy rate of between 8 and 12 per cent, I do not see any particular reason for secularising the marriage ceremony.  If the divorce rate in another country is such that, in the principal city of that country one in every two couples are divorced and one in every four couples are divorced over the whole state, nobody can tell me that the mere fact of secularising the marriage ceremony will get us any further along.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I will admit that the churches may have to take a great many measures of the kind they are only beginning to think of to face the requirements of modern society and help young people.  Nevertheless, this is my view and I think it is the <Col N="984" /> view of my colleagues in the Government.</P>
    <P>Nobody raised here in any very important way the fact that we chose the age of 16 so I will not discuss the matter.  There are some countries where the minimum age is 20.  That specific country has not benefited particularly in any moral sense for having made the age 20 but I have not inquired into this in detail.  The main point is that the age of 16 was the one on which we obtained the maximum degree of consensus among the religious authorities and in relation to societies representing women's interests.</P>
    <P>Senator Belton welcomed the consolidation of the marriage code.  He criticised drafting by reference to old Acts and not by new provisions.  I quite agree with the Senator that the comprehensive Bill should stand alone and not be expressed in relation to any of the older Acts.  The comprehensive Bill will take some considerable time to prepare and will require an enormous amount of consultation. Senator Belton also spoke in favour of the male being older than the female for the purpose of a Bill such as this.  This is not being pronounced upon at all.  All the section in the Bill says is that 16 is the minimum statutory age.</P>

We followed the United Nations Convention which I quoted in the Second Reading speech, which speaks of:</P>
      <P>granting a dispensation as to age for serious reasons in the interests of the intending sponsors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have attempted in these paragraphs to give guidelines to the authority granting the exemption.  There is no need to obtain a doctor's or other certificate. The court or the authorising authority will bear this in mind.  I will not, for the benefit of the courts or the religious authorities, start to define <Col N="985" /> what &ldquo;moral, physical and social wellbeing&rdquo; is.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBelton" hpid="Dr. Belton Dr. Belton">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Or what &ldquo;propriety&rdquo; means.  These phrases are in sufficiently general use, so the religious authorities and the courts will be able to interpret them.  If they should make some desperate mistake and start giving a distorted definition to &ldquo;moral, physical or social well-being&rdquo;, obviously there would have to be some amendment of the law, but I do not think this will arise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>Why must priority be given to considerations of property. That was one of the points.  Why not leave it to society to determine whether they are more important than the welfare of the applicant?</P>

      <P>It depends on how you start to judge any particular case. It would be a matter solely of propriety if a girl of 16 married an Eskimo of 85 and went to live with him in Eskimo land.  Then I think there would be a question of propriety, but I may be using the word in the wrong sense.</P>
      <P>In relation to section (3) (d), I was asked why not both parties, why only one party is mentioned in this section. If the two are being married it is reasonable to enable either to start off the procedure under the section.  There is nothing to stop the courts or the specified religious bodies from hearing both partners.  The application may present occasions of practical difficulty &mdash;for example, if one of the intending partners was abroad at the time.  There is no harm in that section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to section 1 (4), I was asked are we to add more religions. The religions mentioned in the Bill are those authorised to issue special licences.  All except the Chief Rabbi have been doing this for 100 years. Religions with very small numbers go to the courts.  No request has been made to us by any religions where there are very small numbers to include them in this list or to enable them to give special licences.  We have not restricted them in any way.  They <Col N="986" /> are quite satisfied in the case of members of their religion that their recourse is to the courts.</P>

      <P>Before the Minister leaves that matter, I am very interested in this particular section.

Could we within this Bill by regulation empower the Minister to add to this list, or something of this nature?</P>

      <P>Senator Belton, in relation to section 17, suggested that the solemnisation of marriage means consummation.  He introduced a rather Rabelaisian note in this connection, if we were to agree with him.  This is not the case in the Acts affected by section 17.  Solemnisation quite clearly means celebration of marriage with the practise of the marriage ceremony.</P>
      <P>He also asked, as an explanation, why it is that marriages, in relation to section 17, have been celebrated at hours different to those specified in the Bill.  Marriages can legally be celebrated under special licence at any time.  If outside the hours a special licence is not used, then the courts can decide the validity.  This Bill will clarify the position completely.</P>
      <P>Senator Robinson asked, in relation to section 1 (3) (c), why the four-month residence for under 16 marriages is mentioned.  This is to stop traffic from outside the country.  She asked in relation to section 2 why citizens of Ireland are mentioned. This is restricted to 33 marriages performed in Lourdes, one or both of the parties being citizens.  It is non-recurring in its character.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="987" /> Senator Robinson suggested that marriages must take place in Ireland in registered buildings and at stated times.  She wanted to know if, under section 2 (2), the marriage would have been valid if it had been performed in the State.  There are no such restrictions in regard to Catholic marriages here.  All the section states is that if the couple could have been legally married here&mdash;I am not pronouncing on the legal position of each as regards marriages here&mdash;then the couple's marriage is also valid here.</P>
    <P>Senator Robinson asked, in relation to section 2 (3), why is there a suggestion of optional registration of Lourdes marriages.  The section validates Lourdes marriages but registration is not essential.  If either party wants registration there is provision for it.  The validity of the marriage is not dependent on the registration. Senator Robinson asked, in relation to section 7, whether in the case of the guardians' consent being refused the appeal can be made to the courts. The answer to that question is yes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>We have not had a demand for any other types of marriages that took place outside this country.  I should make it clear to the House, and I stated this in the Dáil, that this is purely a retrospective section. All those who go to Lourdes, or to any other place where they may wish to be married at a shrine, from now on will have to ensure that they marry according to the law as it would be accepted in this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>All people have to do who want to get married at any shrine in Europe, or in any unusual way in Europe, is to ensure by getting legal advice that their marriage will be recognised here.  We made this clear on a number of occasions.  The Catholic authorities have also informed their flocks about this in relation to marriages in Lourdes.</P>

    <Col N="988" />
    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked about the position of people who had taken part in Lourdes marriages and who were advised that these were not legally recognised here and who, therefore, broke up.  What would be their position?  Have they been considered?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Robinson</NameTxt>
      <P>So the problem has not arisen with any of those parties who considered, on legal advice, that the marriage was not a valid marriage and chose to break it up? Has this not occurred?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so. The courts would pronounce on them anyway.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryRobinson" hpid="Mrs. Robinson Mrs. Robinson">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The courts would have to consider that.  If anyone asked me about this type of thing I would tell him to bring it to the courts.  I am not going to act as a judge in this connection.  Senator Robinson asked, in relation to section 1 (3) (d), why we do not make use of the District Court or Circuit Court.  We select only the use of the President of the High Court. She suggested that this was unnecessary and restrictive.  This is an effort to make the application private, informal and inexpensive.  The President of the High Court has a traditional function in this respect.  The number of marriages affected is very small and I do not think we need to extend the arrangements for appeals outside the office of the President of the High Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Belton asked what would happen if the parish priest was required to give a certificate under section 1 (8) (i) and he was ill or absent.  There is no time limit on registrations for marriages and this means that the parties could, if they wished, wait for the return of the parish priest.  Alternatively, <Col N="989" /> if there is an acting parish priest then the certificate applies.</P>
    <P>I was asked why I and not the Minister for Justice was conducting this Bill through the House.  I would be delighted if my colleague would take over, as I know very little about the law.  Unfortunately, the Marriages Act, 1936, gave functions to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health which were formerly exercised by the Lord Lieutenant. The Minister for Local Government and Public Health took on authority from the Lord Lieutenant in British days and I have taken on the authority as Minister for Health.  That is why I am sponsoring this Bill.  It impinges on matters that are the responsibility of the Minister for Justice.  If I can persuade the Minister for Justice to introduce a comprehensive Bill I certainly will do so.</P>

    <Title>Births, Deaths and Marriages Registration Bill, 1972: Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Childers) Erskine Hamilton Childers">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Births, Deaths and Marriages Bill, 1972, will effect certain amendments of the registration code and will enable improvements of the arrangements for registering births, deaths and marriages to be carried out including improvements in the associated documentation.</P>
      <P>The existing system has been in operation for over a century and in that period a dependable service of high standard has been built up.  Persons associated with the registration service have reason to be satisfied with their efforts towards achieving this end.  But the time has come to make certain important changes and I trust the House will agree with me that these changes cannot be delayed and must be made if the registration service is to maintain the standards and at the same time meet modern needs.</P>
      <P>The question has been asked how comprehensive our statistics of births, deaths and marriages are.  In so far as births are concerned, we are achieving 100 per cent registration, or close to it, which is highly satisfactory.  Less satisfactory is the fact that the registration is sometimes delayed until a birth certificate is actually needed for some purpose. Marriage registration is, as one might expect, comprehensive in its coverage.  Death registration, on the other hand, gives cause for considerable concern and far too many deaths are not being registered at all.  This is particularly the case in rural areas in respect of old people who do not own property or have no life insurance. Precise figures are impossible to come by but, from studies undertaken, it is clear that there are areas where under-registration of deaths is of the order of 7 per cent to 8 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any short-fall in registration of <Col N="991" /> births, marriages or deaths, or even undue delays in effecting registrations, reduces the effectiveness of our vital statistics and, if these figures are not reliable and well based, our social planning will operate under a grievous handicap.  I do not have to underline the importance of this or indeed the part which accurate vital statistics play over a wide range of social planning.</P>
    <P>The Bill, when enacted, will effect various organisational improvements designed to help towards achieving 100 per cent registration of all events. But I would appeal to members of the public to appreciate the need for a full and complete registration service and to co-operate fully in making the necessary registrations promptly and accurately.</P>
    <P>On the detailed provisions of the Bill, subsection (1) (a) of section 2 authorises the chief executive officers of health boards to make appointments as registrar as vacancies occur. The vacancies will be those which exist at the passing of the Act or which arise subsequently.  Existing permanent registrars are not affected and they will continue to hold office on the same terms as hitherto.  I should explain that we have at present some 650 registration districts dealing with the registration of births, deaths and Catholic marriages&mdash;there are registrars of marriages other than Catholic marriages also and their districts are another matter.</P>
    <P>These registration districts are generally coterminous with the dispensary districts in which the dispensary service functioned.  Such a large number of registration districts is unnecessary nowadays and indeed is often a handicap.  For example, over 400 districts or 60 per cent of the total are called upon to register less than 50 events in the year and all told they deal with less than 10 per cent of registrations.  Registrars in those small districts have not the variety or volume of registration to become expert in dealing with the unusual cases which can arise.  This in turn means that the central registration office in Dublin is called upon to intervene to deal with cases which <Col N="992" /> a local registrar with a reasonably wide span of work would be competent to deal with.  This in turn leads to inconvenience and delays for members of the public.  It seems quite clear that the needs of the service could be adequately met by halving the number of registration districts now in operation.  I would hope to achieve this by amalgamating smaller districts as vacancies arise.  This amalgamation would, incidentally, give a wider range of work to the registrars of the expanded districts.</P>
    <P>I would also see the amalgamation process as leading to the establishment of registration offices open during normal office hours in each major centre of population.  These offices are a feature of the registration services provided in other countries and would be more effective in populated areas than the present service on the basis of one or two hours attendance on mornings of the week in a number of scattered locations.  I must emphasise, however, that I will keep the convenience of the public at all times to the fore and if, say, the low density of population in areas in the west calls for retaining small sized districts they will be retained in those areas.  Subsection (1) (b) of section 2 removes a lien which dispensary doctors have had up to now on registration posts, and with its removal the amalgamation process can proceed. Subsection (1) of section 2 also has the effect of bringing within the administrative ambit of chief executive officers the registration service at local level for the first time.  Health boards already exercise responsibility for general supervision of the registration service in their area and also act as superintendent or regional registrar.  The new provision would, in time, therefore complete the rationalisation process in respect of the registration service.</P>
    <P>With regard to subsection (2) of section 2 it is proposed to continue the present arrangement whereby the existing registrars hold their appointments from an tArd-Chláraitheoir as it would not be feasible or desirable to alter that arrangement.  This being so, it would not be practicable to apply a different basis of tenure of office to registrars who will be appointed to future vacancies. <Col N="993" /> Because the new appointments are being made by chief executive officers it is therefore necessary to exclude the appointees from the usual provisions about offices under health boards.</P>
    <P>Section 3 deals with problem cases which cause personal distress and hardship and which arises occasionally. Old persons sometimes find that their birth has never been registered and a statutory informant is no longer available, for one reason or another, to attend and sign the register.  At present such events cannot be registered. Section 3 will provide some answer to this problem.  If the individual is able to produce satisfactory evidence of the particulars which are usually registered, an tArd-Chláraitheoir will have discretion to register the birth.  But if there is not satisfactory evidence, the birth cannot be registered.  In other words the section goes as far as possible to meet the difficulty while insisting, at the same time, on maintaining the high ethical standard of the registration system.</P>
    <P>Section 4 deals with other registration difficulties.  It covers certain births or deaths which occur outside the State where the person born was the child of an Irish citizen domiciled in this State or the person dead was an Irish citizen domiciled in the State. It will make possible the registration in Ireland of such events where, for example, there are no records available in foreign countries, either because there is no registration system, or the records may have been destroyed by fire, or accident, or in war.</P>
    <P>Section 5 will permit the Minister, by regulations, to make an important change from the present cumbersome statutory requirements about registration forms.  In the Registration Acts the contents of these forms is itemised and set out in specific detailed terms and their incorporation in ledgers required and so on.  These requirements are out of date and must be changed if we are to take advantage of modern recording techniques, micro filming, automatic data processing and so on.  Regulations made under the section can require persons other than the present statutory informants to notify registrars of events <Col N="994" /> with which they are concerned and, for example, undertakers may be required to notify a registrar before a burial.  This procedure could help to reduce the number of unregistered deaths which I mentioned earlier.</P>
    <P>Section 6 is necessary because under existing legislation certified copies of registered births and deaths are acceptable as proof of the event without further evidence only if the registration was made under the signature of an informant or on the basis of a notification from a coroner.  Section 6 will place registrations, made under sections 3 and 4 of the Bill on the authority of an tArd-Chláraitheoir, on the same standing as the normal registration of a birth or death.</P>
    <P>Regarding section 7 it has transpired that subsection (5) of section 2 of the Vital Statistics and Births, Deaths and Marriages Registration Act, 1952, was drawn too tightly.  That subsection prevents any person engaged in collecting, publishing <i>et cetera</i>, vital statistics from disclosing information relating to any identifiable persons unless for the purposes of a prosecution under that Act.  This has made for certain difficulties for medical and social research workers.  Medical and other professional bodies have pressed for amendments of the section and have indicated that the restriction operates against the best interest of the community health and welfare and hampers research work.  I am satisfied that the case they have made is well founded and, accordingly, I am, in section 7, seeking authority to disclose information to meet this type of situation subject to conditions which the Minister will, in each case, lay down. Applications will be considered on their merits and will be acceded to only if the public good so requires and I shall see to it that confidentiality in the real sense is preserved.</P>
    <P>I would therefore ask the House to endorse the Bill now before it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBelton" hpid="Dr. Belton Dr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>This House will generally welcome this Bill but there may be certain points that need clarification. Section 2 states that the chief executive officer of the health board shall appoint the person to hold the office of registrar.  It would seem from the <Col N="995" /> explanatory memorandum that the health board will not have to pay this person.  I take it that this is true. Another point with which I should like to deal is whether the Minister is satisfied that the registration of illegitimate births is properly covered or whether he can go any further in ensuring that the registration of these births would be properly carried out and in whose name they should be so done.</P>
      <P>He mentioned that the person involved in funeral arrangements notifies the registrar.  Most people nowadays use undertakers, but some people may not use them for one reason or another.  It may be more appropriate to the Department of Justice to investigate why an undertaker was not used or why a proper report to the registrar was not given on the cause of the death of the person.  Is there any method by which that can be got around?</P>
      <P>Towards the end of the penultimate paragraph of the Minister's speech he says:</P>
      <P>because the new appointments have been made by chief executive officer it is therefore necessary to exclude the appointees from the usual provisions about offices under health boards.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister would expand on that to some extent when he is replying.  Can the registrar be appointed from the staff of a health board by the CEO?  The CEO usually can so appoint him, and therefore he comes under the jurisdiction of the registrar general.  I presume the payment is going to come from that source rather than from the health board.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBelton" hpid="Dr. Belton Dr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the question of the restrictions which were in existence <Col N="996" /> up to now, the Minister is trying to reduce these restrictions in order to allow medical and social research workers access to more details about various people.  This is tied up with means tests in the sense that we are introducing another investigator into the privacy of homes.  I have always maintained that one investigator is sufficient to cover the whole gamut of investigation, whether it is for the purpose set out here by the Minister for Health or for other health purposes, social welfare or housing purposes.  One competent investigator should be able to deal with all this to cut out the multiplicity of investigators visiting homes.  It is the poorer sections of the community that will object to this.</P>
      <P>It may be that for medical reasons a special investigator would have to be provided.  I understand this particular situation, but I am still loath to increase the number of investigators going into houses.  The outcry against means tests at the present moment is not because a means test is objected to; it is the number of investigators going into homes and taking down the same particulars. One can understand this when it is being done for research purposes and when a specially qualified person investigates. Investigations should be reduced to the minimum by the employment of a proper investigator.</P>
      <P>In general I welcome this Bill.  I do not think that anybody can have any serious objection to it.  I am sure the Minister will explain the few points I have made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamOBrien1977" hpid="Mr. W. O'Brien Mr. W. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. W. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to welcome the Bill.  It is a serious matter when births or deaths are not notified to the registrar.  It is only when you are called upon as a public representative to help somebody who is making a claim for an old age pension that you realise the difficulties in regard to non-registration. I am aware of a few cases in my own county where people about to leave this country on holidays made application for a passport and were shocked to find that, so far as the records were concerned, they never existed.  It is well that there is some attempt made to eliminate any recurrence <Col N="997" /> of that.  Would it be possible, through the news media or some other way, to remind people to ask if their births have been registered?  This is easier to ascertain through the information of a live person than through some widow who finds herself in a difficult position when her husband dies and she discovers he has never been registered.</P>
      <P>The Minister has gone a long way in helping people with regard to death certificates.  Sometimes when people died of accidents the coroner delayed the inquest.  Maybe he had some valid reason, but that delay often created great hardship for the widow who was seeking a gratuity or pension. That is eliminated now.  The transfer to the CEO of the function of appointing a registrar will, in my opinion, improve the position.  It is well to know that people who are already registrars will maintain that position until they arrive at a certain age.</P>
      <P>There is a situation existing in Limerick where one can obtain a death certificate only on Tuesdays. If you are not there before 3 o'clock you must wait until the following Tuesday.  I welcome the Bill.</P>

      <P>I imagine it would. Senator Belton also asked whether the registration of births is satisfactory.  I am told by the registration office that this is so.  He asked about the remote rural areas where there may be no undertaker. <Col N="998" /> There are some areas where this happens.  We would have to consider how to deal with this.  It might be possible to engage the interest of the caretaker of the burial ground in relation to the operation of the Bill.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Brien suggested that we need some strengthening of the registration arrangements by reminding people that their births should be registered, but this is really not necessary. We are receiving almost 100 per cent registration of births.  Section 3 of the Bill will go towards meeting the problem of where the birth was not registered until late in life.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Brien also raised the question of coroner's inquests causing delays in relation to registration.  It does take time to organise an inquest, so some delay must occur.  However, if the inquest cannot be finalised rapidly, a system exists for registering deaths before the completion of the inquest under the present legislation.</P>
      <P>Senator Belton asked about the investigators. When we make use of the section in the Bill which provides for research we will be careful to ensure that anything that is undertaken will be conducted in a reasonable way.  The object is to carry out research in relation to the age at which people die from certain diseases and the location of diseases and deaths therefrom in relation to soil or water conditions.  I guarantee that we will exercise discreation so that people will not feel they are being invaded by yet one more investigator of means or conditions.  In many cases letters can be written to people in advance in regard to this matter.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P>Agreed to take remaining Stages today.</P>
      <P>Bill put through Committee, reported without amendment, received for final consideration and passed.</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 4.25 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Wednesday, 29th November, 1972.</P>
