      <P>Senators will have learned with deep regret of the death this morning of our colleague Senator James Dunne.</P>
      <P>Born in Dublin some 50 years ago, he started work at an early age. Although he received little formal schooling he was an omnivorous reader and later attended University College, Dublin, where he was awarded an honours diploma in social and economic studies. A trade union official for some years, he became general secretary of the Marine Port and General Workers Union in 1957. He was for a period President of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.</P>
      <P>At the general election in 1969 he was elected to the Labour Panel of the Seanad on the nomination of the Congress.</P>
      <P>Senator Dunne was of a kindly and friendly disposition in his personal relations, and his personality endeared him to all with whom he came in contact. His contributions both in the Seanad and outside were outstanding for their sincerity and courage. In Senator Dunne we have lost a colleague whose gifts of intelligence and humanity were widely appreciated. His untimely death will be keenly felt by all Members.</P>
      <P>To the widow and children of the late Senator I shall convey, on your behalf and on my own, our deepest sympathy. Solas Dé lena anam.</P>

      <P>On No. 3, there are a few points on which I should like to get some clarification. One is the position with regard to motions. I understood there was agreement that when the House was sitting Thursday would be devoted to motions. Quite apart from that, I think it is necessary that the House should have some clarification as to the scope of the debate which will arise on No. 3. Is it intended that the discussion should be limited to the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill or is it intended that in conjunction with that and as part of <Col N="413" /> the discussion the Government White Paper on the EEC should be discussed by the House? The Leader of the House will appreciate that if the latter is the position Senators may legitimately require greater notice than to be told today that there would be a general discussion tomorrow.</P>

      <P>The question raised by Senator O'Higgins is really one for the Chair and it might perhaps be better raised tomorrow rather than today. However, the Chair will take this opportunity, since the matter has been raised, of saying that while it is unwilling to rule on a hypothetical matter it would seem to the Chair impossible to debate this Bill without referring also to the White Paper.</P>

      <P>Arising out of the Chair's intervention in this regard, it is appreciated that it would be difficult to debate the Bill without debating the White Paper. It is equally difficult for Members of this House to debate the White Paper, to debate the prime issue of entry into the EEC, without notice. I would suggest to the Leader of the House that if it is the intention that this should be the significant debate of the Seanad on the question of entry into Europe, it might well be deferred until next Tuesday. My understanding is, from Members on this side of the House, that Members are not apprised of the fact that there is to be a major debate and that Members would certainly be far better prepared to debate this important issue next Tuesday than tomorrow morning.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. O'Malley) Desmond J. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset, I would like to explain briefly the manner in which solicitors' remuneration is fixed. With a view to the protection of clients, the rights of solicitors in regard to the amount and recovery of their costs are, unlike any other profession, almost entirely controlled by statute and orders made thereunder and by rules made by the various rule-making authorities set up by statute. Costs which a solicitor may charge in civil matters may be considered under the two broad divisions of legal work which a solicitor is called upon to perform for his client, namely, &ldquo;contentious&rdquo; and &ldquo;non-contentious&rdquo; business. Contentious business embraces the work executed by a solicitor for his client in connection with court proceedings of a civil nature. Non-contentious business, on the other hand, may be said to be that performed by a solicitor on behalf of his client in connection with legal transactions as distinct from court proceedings, for example, making a will, drawing a deed, selling, purchasing, leasing or mortgaging property, administering estates or trusts, and so on.</P>
      <P>Costs in respect of all contentious business, non-contentious probate and administration, and registered conveyancing are regulated by rules made by the three rule-making authorities for the various courts and by the Registration of Title Rules Committee. Before coming into effect, such rules must have received the concurrence of the Minister for Justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Costs in respect of non-contentious business, other than non-contentious probate and administration and registered conveyancing, are regulated, on the other hand, by orders made under the Solicitors Remuneration Act, 1881, by the Statutory Body established thereunder. The Statutory Body consists of the Chief Justice, the President of the High Court, the senior ordinary judge of the Supreme Court and the President of the Incorporated Law Society of Ireland. An order <Col N="416" /> made by the Statutory Body does not take effect unless and until it has been laid before each House of the Oireachtas and one month thereafter or four sitting weeks&mdash;that is, four weeks on which the House has sat&mdash;thereafter, whichever is the longer, have elapsed. However, the order may be disallowed, in whole or in part, by the Government on a resolution passed by either House within the relevant period seeking disallowance. It will be seen, therefore, that Parliament did not hand over to the Statutory Body the right to regulate costs, but reserved to itself the final say in the matter.</P>
    <P>Under the Solicitors Remuneration Act, 1881, solicitors' remuneration has been regulated by order since 1884. The work covered has been divided into two categories and the remuneration for these was fixed under Schedules I and II, respectively, to the order of 1884. Schedule I provided scales of fees based on the amount of the consideration for sales, purchases, mortgages, leases, agreements for leases, and similar transactions. Schedule II covered other business of a non-contentious kind and continued the system then in force of charging for the work done by reference to a priced list of items. The order has been amended from time to time and charges provided for therein have been increased. The new order provides for an increase of 42 per cent in the Schedule II costs, that is, costs in non-contentious business&mdash;other than scale fees for sales, purchases, mortgages and so on&mdash;which costs were fixed at their present level in the Solicitors' Remuneration General Order, 1964.</P>
    <P>The Solicitors' Remuneration General Order, 1971, cannot be considered in isolation but must be viewed as part of a general claim being pursued at present by the Incorporated Law Society for considerable increases in costs, both in contentious and non-contentious business. I have already refused to give my concurrence to new rules made by the Superior Court Rules Committee which provide for an increase of 42 per cent in solicitors' costs within the jurisdiction of that committee. Other rule-making authorities have also submitted for my concurrence new rules providing for very substantial increases in solicitors' <Col N="417" /> costs within the jurisdiction of each committee. These rules are at present being examined.</P>
    <P>The Government are satisfied that there is no justification for an increase in solicitors' costs of the magnitude proposed by the Statutory Body. It must be remembered that, since costs were fixed at their present level, solicitors' incomes have been substantially increased by higher amounts allowable under the head of &ldquo;instructions&rdquo;&mdash; which is a fee at large. These fees increase with the fall in money values and also with increases in the cost of running a solicitor's business. Moreover, the main item in a solicitor's bill of costs, whether for contentious or non-contentious business, is the &ldquo;instructions&rdquo; fee&mdash;a fee which in the case of Schedule II costs must be determined having regard to every relevant, and indeed conceivable, circumstance.</P>
    <P>Increases in property values also bring in substantial increased remuneration since conveyancing costs are regulated on an <i>ad valorem</i> basis. Solicitors' costs for property transactions are much in excess of what could by any standard be considered reasonable. Solicitors in the State do better than solicitors in Northern Ireland and far better than solicitors in England and Scotland. This is all the more remarkable since conveyancing charges in England are constantly being criticised as being too high. The National Board for Prices and Incomes have recommended changes in conveyancing costs in England and Wales with a view to reducing solicitors' total income from conveyancing. The Lord Chancellor has recently put to the English Law Society certain proposals for changes in the bases of solicitors' remuneration for conveyancing work with a view to a reduction in conveyancing costs.</P>
    <P>It used to be said that it was of the nature of a solicitor's business that while some parts of his business, e.g., District Court work, were not really remunerative this was offset by those parts of his business&mdash;for example, conveyancing and probate work&mdash;that were highly remunerative. The Government are satisfied that we have <Col N="418" /> now reached the stage in this country where most parts of a solicitor's business can be said to be reasonably remunerative and that a very substantial part of his business is highly remunerative&mdash;and indeed, as I have already said, much more remunerative than in England, Scotland or the North of Ireland. In addition, the effect of the <i>ad valorem</i> scales for conveyancing is to link conveyancing charges with rises in property values, which generally rise faster than prices and costs. Between 1960 and 1970 the rate of increase in house prices in the Dublin area was double that in the cost of living. This link, coupled with a growing volume of business, has, in the view of the Government, enabled solicitors to keep up with rising costs.</P>
    <P>I do not want it to be thought that the Government are totally opposed to any increase in solicitors' remuneration at the present time. They are prepared to accept that a reasonable increase would be justified, but certainly not an increase of the magnitude provided for in Solicitors' Remuneration General Order, 1971. However, as the law stands, the Oireachtas is not able to amend an order made by the Statutory Body. The order may be allowed to stand or disallowed in whole or in part. If the order is disallowed, the existing Schedule II costs will continue to operate and it will be open to the Statutory Body to make another order containing proposals of a more reasonable nature which may be acceptable. I have already indicated to both the Statutory Body and the Superior Courts Rules Committee that I am agreeable to a reasonable increase in the charges for both contentious and non-contentious business. I know that it is often argued that the solicitors' profession is unique in that it is the only profession whose remuneration is and has been over the years controlled by statutory powers vested in a Minister of State or in Parliament. However, as Senators will be aware, there is now before the Dáil a new and comprehensive Prices (Amendment) Bill that proposes to extend price control to all professional services.</P>
    <P>The services with which I, as Minister for Justice, am particularly concerned are those rendered by lawyers <Col N="419" /> and auctioneers. If the Prices Bill becomes law, the Government may by order transfer to me the powers and functions of the Minister for Industry and Commerce under the Prices Acts in relation to the fees of lawyers and auctioneers. If and when this is done, I will be able to establish an advisory body or bodies to inquire into the fees of the professions concerned and to make recommendations to me. The representatives of each profession may make their cases to those bodies, who will, I am sure, examine the various fees chargeable in the different areas of a solicitors' or auctioneer's business.</P>
    <P>The trouble at the moment is that there are too many bodies dealing with solicitors' costs with the result that there is no overall assessment or examination of legal remuneration as a whole. This has led to a number of anomalies, the most glaring of which is that charges for registered conveyancing are in some cases higher than in unregistered conveyancing. This is unique in these islands, and is indefensible when one has regard to the fact that a registration of title system is supposed to reduce costs.</P>
    <P>Indeed, in Scotland, where solicitors' conveyancing costs are substantially lower than ours, a Government Committee, under the chairmanship of Lord Reid, a Lord of Appeal in Ordinary, recommended in 1963 the introduction in Scotland of registration of title to land. They stated that on the whole they thought &ldquo;that a reduction of 25 per cent on the present scale of fees should be achieved in transactions in land the title to which has been registered&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Government do not accept that, if the remuneration of a particular profession is controlled, the independence of that profession is put at risk. After all, the remuneration of judges and of the legal profession has historically been subject to Parliamentary and Government or Ministerial control both in Britain and in Ireland. Here, no rules of the Superior Courts or of the Lower Courts or of the Registration of Title Rules Committee may come into operation without the concurrence of the Minister for Justice&mdash;and concurrence <Col N="420" /> has been refused from time to time by different Ministers in different Governments. In England, the Lord Chancellor, who is a senior Cabinet Minister, is a member of the Statutory Body as well as being a member of the Supreme Court Rule Committee. Moreover, rules made by the County Court Rule Committee in England may be allowed, disallowed or altered by the Lord Chancellor, whose Department is, <i>inter alia,</i> particularly concerned with legal remuneration.</P>
    <P>By the way, I think I should mention that, under our Prices Acts, any Prices Order made by a Minister must be laid before each House of the Oireachtas, and it is subject to annulment by resolution passed by either House within 21 sitting days. The proposed new Prices Bill extends this control to professional remuneration. Also, the Bill contains in section 2 a provision which is designed to ensure that any power, arising under any other enactment to control, regulate or specify charges for professional or other services, shall not be exercised without the consent of the Minister concerned.</P>
    <P>The making of a Remuneration Order under the Solicitors Remuneration Act, 1881, is not a judicial function. It is a case in which legislative powers have been delegated by Parliament to a statutory committee consisting of three judges and the President of the Law Society. In giving these powers, Parliament retained the authority to set aside any order made by the Statutory Body that it considered not to be in the public interest. The duty of the Oireachtas in this matter, therefore, is to safeguard that interest.</P>
    <P>I regret that I have to request the House to exercise its control over the Statutory Body. However, the Government, having carefully considered all aspects of this matter, are fully satisfied that they would be lacking in their duty if they did not seek to have this order disallowed. The plain fact is that 42 per cent is by any reasonable standard far too much of an increase on present remuneration. One must bear in mind also the feelings of other sectors of the community of an increase of this kind is allowed. This is <Col N="421" /> all the more so when one takes into account&mdash;as one must&mdash;that the &ldquo;instructions&rdquo; fee&mdash;which is a fee at large and the main fee in a solicitor's bill of costs&mdash;increases with the fall in money values and with the rise in the cost of running a solicitor's business, and that solicitors are doing exceptionally well from the fixed <i>ad valorem</i> charges, the highest in these islands, for the transfer of land and houses, whether registered or unregistered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask this House to reject this motion. First of all, as a practising solicitor, I must declare an interest and I hope the arguments which I will place before the House will show that this motion should be rejected by the House on the merits of the case. I certainly do not want to appear to be in the position of arguing a case on the grounds of self interest. I do not think it is necessary. This motion should be rejected by this House because there is no reasonable justification for it. The Minister has mentioned correctly that up to now, in any event, the solicitors' profession is the only one which has been subject to control so far as costs and fees are concerned. It might interest the House to know that for a very considerable period, more than 100 years anyhow, the solicitors profession has been subject to such control. There have been a variety of Acts dealing with the question of solicitors' remuneration, starting at the Attorneys and Solicitors (Ireland) Act, 1849. There was then the Attorneys and Solicitors Act, 1870, the Legal Practitioners (Ireland) Act, 1876, Mortgagees Legal Costs Act, 1895, and the Solicitors Remuneration Act, 1881, and the general orders made under that Act with which the House is concerned today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to put it bluntly to the House that, regardless of whether the legal profession as such is popular or unpopular <Col N="422" /> with the general public, that is not a matter that should be taken into account by the Minister or by any Member of this House. The solcitors' profession is as much entitled to fair play and fair remuneration as any other section of the community. Solicitors in common with other sections of the community are affected by increased prices. They are also affected by increased taxation increased rates and increased wages. But, unlike many other sections of the community, particularly the business sections, solicitors are subject to a rigid code of conduct and discipline which precludes anything in the nature of advertising or touting for business. The solicitor must rely on the reputation which he has established for himself, on his expertise, his efficiency and ability and general performance to attract new business and to increase output in his office. If costs are increased against the solicitor he has no way of offsetting that because he is rigidly controlled so far as his fees and costs are concerned. He cannot pass that on to the consumer. This would apply particularly to the younger solicitor and the smaller office. If there is not a compensatory increase in the volume of business being attracted to his office then something must suffer: either the standard of living of the solicitor must be reduced or else he has to cut costs somewhere. What is the way to cut costs? Any businessman or employer will know that in that kind of situation the only way to cut costs is to cut down on employment.</P>
    <P>In connection with this order I wish to assert that we are not considering an irresponsible wage claim. We are considering here a formal order made by what must be one of the most responsible and certainly one of the most impartial and judicial cost fixing authorities in the country. The present order, as Senators will see by looking at it, is signed by the Chief Justice, the President of the High Court, a senior ordinary justice of the Supreme Court and the President of the Incorporated Law Society. The general order is made by and under the authority of the Statutory Body constituted under the Solicitors Remuneration Act, 1881. This body is composed, by that Act as <Col N="423" /> adapted, of the Chief Justice, two senior judges and the President of the Incorporated Law Society.</P>
    <P>The Minister pointed out the difference between contentious and non-contentious business. It is important to appreciate that we are not concerned in this order with court costs in any degree. Court costs, land registry costs, and Land Commission costs are dealt with by other rules committees. The scale of these costs, in order to become operative, require the concurrence of the Minister for Justice, with the exception of the Land Commission committee. At this point I wish to say that here is a vital distinction which goes to the very root of parliamentary responsibility. Court costs, by and large, are within the control of the Minister for Justice in so far as he has a concurring function in their making. The non-contentious costs, with which this order is concerned, are not within the control of the Minister for Justice. They are within the control of Parliament. That is a very important distinction.</P>
    <P>I do not think any Member of this House can evade his own personal responsibility for coming to a decision on this matter by allowing himself to be said by the Minister on it. This is not a ministerial function. It is a matter which concerns each of us as individual Members of this House. The Act has placed the responsibility on us as Members of Parliament to take our own decisions and make up our own minds with regard to it. In those circumstances, I feel very strongly that this is not a matter which should in any sense be subject to a party whip. So far as the Members of my party in this House are concerned, they are not under any party whip with regard to this motion. They are quite free to vote against the case I am making and to argue against it. That is the proper approach to this matter because the responsibility is on each of us as individual Senators. The Minister expressed his regret in the course of his remarks at the action which he and the Government apparently consider themselves bound to take. He expressed the point of view that the Government would be lacking in their duty <Col N="424" /> if they did not seek to have this order prohibited by Parliament.</P>
    <P>I think it fair to ask the Minister why he is now taking that step, not having taken it in the Dáil where the Members are popularly elected. Why did he allow the Order, when it was placed on the Table of the Dáil, to go through unchallenged? Why did he wait until it came here to the Seanad? I put it to him&mdash;and I am putting it bluntly for the benefit of the Senators opposite&mdash;if the reason is because the Minister regards himself as having a built-in majority in the Seanad by reason of the nominations made to this House by the Taoiseach. I would deplore it very much if that was the reasoning behind the Minister's move. I do not think it right that any Senator, supporting the Government generally, should be placed in that position in a matter of this kind where he has individual responsibility. Even at this stage, I would urge the Minister to allow this matter to be the subject of a free vote. No application of a party whip will relieve individual Senators of their responsibility under the law as it stands.</P>
    <P>It is relevant to note that the Statutory Body which has made this Order is, under the Act of 1881, entitled to have regard to particular considerations. These considerations include &ldquo;the skill, labour and responsibility involved therein on the part of the solicitor&rdquo;. They include the number and importance of the documents prepared or perused without regard to length. The personnel of this eminent Statutory Body, that is the Chief Justice, the President of the High Court, a senior Supreme Court judge and the President of the Incorporated Law Society, are particularly well suited by their specialised knowledge and experience and by their own training and expertise in these matters to assess and adjudicate on what is fair, just and reasonable as regards the solicitors' costs with which they deal. I know&mdash;and I am not saying this in any taunting manner&mdash;that the present Minister for Justice is a solicitor but this is merely a coincidence that happens from time to time. Normally speaking, the occupant of the ministerial chair in the Department of <Col N="425" /> Justice would in no way be as well equipped or qualified to deal with the matters and items of costs dealt with in this order as would be the Chief Justice, the President of the High Court, the Supreme Court judge and the President of the Incorporated Law Society.</P>
    <P>This eminent body, which is impartial and is virtually an entirely judicial tribunal, has decided that the appropriate increase in the items with which they are dealing would be 42 per cent on the level of fees fixed in 1964. That figure may appear to be high. It may be a reasonably easy exercise for the Minister to stand up in this House and ridicule the figure and to talk cautiously about the necessity to have regard to the views of other sections of the community, but there are a number of very important considerations that are relevant. However, there is one consideration which I regard as being entirely irrelevant and which was dragged in by the Minister presumably to colour the case he was making when he spoke about the conveyancing fees and costs paid to solicitors. This order has nothing, good, bad or indifferent, to do with conveyancing fees.</P>
    <P>There are some considerations that are both important and relevant to this discussion. One of those relevant considerations is that there have been six rounds of wage increases since 1961. Those wage increases, together with other increases such as increased postal charges, telephone charges, electricity charges and increases in other items and services which are used by a solicitor in his business, operate automatically to increase the office expenses of solicitors.</P>
    <P>I shall give an example of this as regards my own office. I know that one cannot, in a matter of this sort, argue from the particular to the general, but if the Minister cares to make inquiries among solicitors of his acquaintance and if he cares to examine the figures in his own office, before he reached ministerial status, he will find that the figures I am about to quote here are reasonably typical. I am giving figures for certain items from certified accounts in my office for the year ended 31st December, 1963. and the year ended 31st December. <Col N="426" /> 1969. Those accounts are not selective. So far as the 1969 figure is concerned, I am giving it because it was the last certified account available to me at the time I undertook this examination. My reason for taking the year 1963 is because my firm moved offices in 1962 and if I went back to make a comparison, as I would have preferred to do, with the year ending 31st December, 1960, or 31st December, 1961, I would be misleading the House because I would not, in some instances, be comparing like with like. With the change of offices certain matters such as rates, light and heat were on a different scale and volume. It would be much more in my favour to go back to the earlier years and give the figures for them but as this is not possible the figures I am giving for the later year are more suited to the Minister's case than mine.</P>
    <P>I find, taking those two comparisons &mdash;the year ended 31st December, 1963, and the year ended 31st December. 1969&mdash;that accountancy charges have increased by more than 150 per cent. The cost of printing, postage and stationery have increased by more than 56 per cent. Rent and rates have increased by more than 71 per cent. That, of course, would be nearly exclusively rates because, talking from recollection, the rent was only a ground rent and would have been static. Light and heat have increased during that period by more than 52 per cent and salaries have increased by more than 100 per cent. So that on those five items within the shorter span of time that I am taking&mdash;the six-year span&mdash; the average increase under those five headings has been something more than 85 per cent in my office and I think you will find, if you care to make inquiry, that that is probably typical as regards size of any reasonably equivalent solicitors' office.</P>
    <P>It is also relevant to point out in this connection that every Senator got a very reasonably worded and courteous letter from the President of the Incorporated Law Society, enclosing the memorandum which was submitted to the Minister, I think, on 3rd January last, and which received no comment from the Minister. Those documents will satisfy every Member of the House. <Col N="427" /> If you place the solicitor's profession side by side with a number of other categories, the solicitor's profession has certainly fared very ill. Between the years 1961 and 1971 the cost of living increase has been 74 per cent. Compensatory increases have been given to higher civil servants averaging 85 per cent during that period. Judicial salaries have been increased by 100 per cent during the period. TD's allowances have been increased by 150 per cent during the period mentioned and the allowances of Members of this House have been increased by 100 per cent.</P>
    <P>How did the highly-paid solicitors mentioned by the Minister in his opening address this afternoon fare during that particular period? It is the responsibility of each of us to consider this and to make up his own mind on it. If one looks at the solicitors' item charges for that period it can be seen &mdash;taking 1962, not 1961, as a base&mdash; that the Superior Court costs went up by 12 per cent; the Circuit Court costs went up by nil; the District Court costs were increased by 12 per cent; non-contentious business items of cost were increased by 12 per cent and land registry costs were not increased. The only reasonably substantial increase&mdash; from 1965, not from 1961&mdash;was in the fees payable under the criminal legal aid scheme, which is of limited scope and of very limited applicability so far as the general body of solicitors is concerned. These fees went up by 25 per cent. That is the position.</P>
    <P>What is the position of other professions? At the outset I said, as did the Minister in his opening speech, that the solicitors' profession is the only one that is controlled as regards fees and costs. Every other profession has been able, during the period of which I speak, to make its own adjustments. In the circular which Senators received from the President of the Incorporated Law Society an example is given of one other profession. For two years&mdash;1970 and 1971&mdash;a typical accountant's fee of £300 in 1970 rose to £500 in 1971, and was justified on a time cost basis. I am not in any sense endeavouring to denigrate other professions or to say <Col N="428" /> that whatever increased allowances, costs or fees they received were not justified and warranted. I am merely mentioning this point in order to show the differentiation in treatment as between the profession to which I have the honour of being a member and other professions. While I am on the point, I have here the scales recommended by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Ireland on two dates: those that were recommended in September, 1968, and those recommended in July, 1970. That is only a two-year period. I should like to give some comparison between the fees that are recommended. Of course they are not necessarily limited to this or are not necessarily maximum fees: they are simply recommended fees in particular circumstances.</P>
    <P>I should like members to look at the order that we are considering now. It is not very easy for a non-solicitor to follow, because the order is made&mdash;I assume that this is the usual way of doing it&mdash;by reference to particular items under Schedule 2 of the general order. These items cover a number of things. I want to take particularly three items: item No. 8, of which the increase was from £1.12 to £1.60; item No. 8 relates to perusing accounts and rentals per hour, in other words, it is a time cost basis for a particular job. What is ordered by the Statutory Body is that the fee in that should be increased from £1.12 to £1.60.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to two others, Nos. 12 and 13. The reason why I am referring to these will become clear later. No. 12 is the attendance fee for an attendance in a solicitor's office for the first half-hour. No. 13 is the attendance fee in a solicitor's office for each subsequent half-hour, so that if you add items 12 and 13 together, you will get the fee which a solicitor may charge for an hour's attendance in his own office. This order increases item 12 from £1.12 to £1.59, that is, for the first half-hour. It increases No. 13 from 84p to £1.19, that is, for the second half-hour. If you put the two together you get the hourly charge which may be made and it works out at £2.78.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="429" /> I want to compare those figures: No. 8, which is an hourly charge for doing a particular job in the office and the Nos. 12 and 13 combined, which give the hourly charge for the first hour for an attendance in the office, and remember, it is reducing after the first half-hour. In regard to No. 8; the recommended charge for the time-cost basis of working on accounts and rents for an hour in a solicitor's office is £1.60. If one compares that with the recommendations from the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Ireland&mdash;this is given, per day in a day of seven hours and I have broken it down into an hourly cost basis&mdash;the principal's time on an hourly basis recommended in 1968 was £4.18. The principal's time recommended in July, 1970, on an hourly basis is £6, that is, for a principal doing general supervisory work. A principal's time for work other than general supervisory work in September, 1968, was about £3.07, and in July, 1970, £4.60. Managers or principal assistants in September, 1968, were paid about £3.07, in July, 1970, £4.60. Senior assistants in July, 1968, were paid about £2.11. Solicitors are way down the scale as compared with the recommendations of the Chartered Accountants Institute. Junior assistants in July, 1968, under the Chartered Accountants recommended scale, got about £1 and in July, 1970, it ranged from £1 to £1.60.</P>
    <P>That is a fair comparison. The position is that, on the basis of those figures, even the most senior and most experienced solicitor in the largest solicitor's office in this country fares extremely poorly by comparison with managers, principal assistants or senior assistants in the office of a chartered accountant, because they can be charged at a rate per hour ranging from nearly £1 per hour to more than £3 per hour. When you compare it with the principal on general advisory work, of course the solicitor, despite his qualifications and the importance of the work he may be concerned with, despite the volume of business which he may be required to handle and control, is simply nowhere in the race.</P>
    <P>Another comparison I should like to make is this. I am not going to mention <Col N="430" /> the name but I have here a copy of an account which was submitted by a firm. I want to describe them generally as civil and structural engineers because I do not want to identify them as I have not got their permission to do so. I should imagine that they are working on a recommended scale also. This was an account presented in December, 1970, and it shows that the charge per hour for the senior partner in that firm was £5.25, as compared with a maximum of £2.78 for the first hour for a solicitor, which is only being recommended now. This shows also that the technician's hourly charge, in this particular firm, was £1.05 an hour, a rate very much the equivalent of what the solicitor has been allowed up to this.</P>
    <P>Anyone considering this matter and the very reasonable case which has been made to Senators by the Incorporated Law Society concerning the facts, items, figures and percentages which I have given&mdash;and I believe they are incontrovertible facts, not in any way exaggerated or slanted to suit the case I am making&mdash;will agree with me that this order made by this very responsible and important body is one which should be upheld by this House. Certainly I would urge Senators to accept that they have individual responsibility in this matter. If they are convinced by the case which the Minister has made, then by all means, their duty is to vote for the Minister to disallow this order. If they feel that, on balance, the weight of the argument is against the Minister, as I feel it most emphatically is, then I think the duty of individual Senators is to reject this motion, regardless of which side of this House they may sit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>I find myself in a difficult position here in deciding which way I should vote on this issue. I have read the literature which we have received. First of all, there is the Statutory Order, the Solicitors' Remuneration General Order which we are discussing. I find without doing a great deal of further work that this particular order does not mean anything to someone who is not a solicitor, because there is no explanatory memorandum to point out which items are being referred to <Col N="431" /> and to explain in a more general way what the changes will mean. I feel this should have been done by the body which drew up this statutory instrument. Also I found it difficult to follow precisely what the Minister said. It was so technical that without a script it was just not possible to take it all in, absorb it and then get some sort of balanced view of his remarks. It is a great disappointment to me that we were not given copies of the Minister's speech, because I just got lost about half way through trying to figure out&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I made signals towards the door with no effect, so I presumed that no copies were available, and I apologise to the Minister. I feel I should respond to what Senator O'Higgins has said in that I must make a judgment on this issue. I feel it is an extremely important issue. The salaries of a whole group of people are involved, a large and very important profession, and it is clear from the Statutory Instrument or from some of the other documents with which we have been issued by the Incorporated Law Society&mdash;who have not been slow in issuing documents on this and quite rightly so too&mdash;that the fees in question have not been changed for a considerable period of time. I should like to refer again to one of the documents issued by the Incorporated Law Society and to reiterate how difficult it is for someone who is not a solicitor to judge the particular issue. In a document which I received dated 18th February, 1972, there is discussion of the salaries and increases in salaries of the various professions and of members of the legal profession, Members of the Dáil and Seanad, the higher civil servants and <Col N="432" /> the judicial salaries. Various comparisons are made. There is also a comparison of the rise in the cost of living between 1961 and 1971, from base 100 in 1961 to a figure of 174 in November, 1971.</P>
      <P>However, when one is trying to assess what is a fair salary in these situations, we have got to have some figures of what range of salaries solicitors actually get. It is not enough to have a base figure of 100 and say that the cost of living has gone up to 174 points from 100 points. One must know what the actual salaries involved are or at least have a reasonable range given by which one can judge what the solicitors' maximum salary might be, what the minimum salary might be, which is probably more important, and also what would be the salary earned by the average solicitor in the country. These figures are essential and we were not issued with them at all. How then does one compare the solicitors' salaries with the salaries of the other professions, the academic profession like my own whose salaries are controlled by the Government through the Department of Education, and quite rightly so? We are in a negotiable position and negotiations continue and our salaries change. Also how would one compare the salaries of the solicitors with, say, salaries of people in the medical profession? Again without actual figures it is very difficult to make any accurate judgment.</P>
      <P>It is my impression that the solicitors are not badly off. I have not met solicitors who failed to make a living. Most of the solicitors I know are doing well&mdash;perhaps an unrepresentative selection. On the other hand, this does not mean that the solicitors are keeping pace with other professions. The indications from the figures given by the Incorporated Law Society are that they are not, but this is only an indication. If we do not know the actual base figure from which we are working this is all meaningless. For example, supposing a solicitor was earning £10,000 a year, then the cost of living index increase probably would not affect him very much, but this is the problem which we are faced with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will carefully go through the Minister's <Col N="433" /> speech and try and understand the gist of it now that I have got a copy. But I feel that in respect of fees which have not been increased since 1961 solicitors have a very strong case. On the other hand, I can quite see any Government baulking at having to authorise increases of 42 per cent. It strikes me that the only just solution is a long-term one which is apart from this particular issue, and that is, the working out of a fair and just incomes policy to which people should adhere. That does not get over the present problem in relation to which we are being asked to authorise specific increases through this order. Even though the solicitors' case is strong, in that since 1961 these fees have not been increased and they therefore ask for an increase of 42 per cent I feel that this is asking for too much in present circumstances. I would have been happier had they asked for a figure which was considerably less than 42 per cent and some compromise on this has been struck. However, the body which has drawn up this statutory instrument is obviously a body which contains very distinguished people. The people who have signed the instrument are all well known, all people whose integrity would be above suspicion, but we must remember that they are members of the legal profession and, like any other profession, tend to band together to protect their own interests. Of course one of the things that they clearly will do is to protect their financial interests.</P>
    <P>My point really is that it is very difficult for an individual making up his mind independently to judge this issue. I rather sympathise with the Minister in that he is a member of the profession himself and therefore is in some sense taken to be adjudicating a case in which he is personally involved. I feel that on occasions like this people who are fair-minded tend to be rather too hard on the body in which they are personally involved. That is just my personal experience. I feel worried about this. The cases that have been put are absolutely divergent and I guess that if there was a Labour Court situation some sort of compromise would be reached which would not satisfy all the aims of both parties but would at least satisfy some of the aims <Col N="434" /> of both parties. I must say that the documentation which we have received has not helped to put me completely in the picture, and I feel that we could have had more information of a comparative nature and this would certainly have helped me to make up my mind on this issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnNash" hpid="Mr. Nash Mr. Nash">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nash</NameTxt>
      <P>It is most important that no section of the public should have incomes out of proportion to any other section. It is equally important that everybody should be dealt with fairly, objectively and impartially. The Minister has stressed in his speech that the decision of the Statutory Body consisting of the Chief Justice, the President of the High Court, the Senior Judge of the Supreme Court and one member from the legal profession&mdash;the President of the Law Society&mdash;should be subject to statutory control. May I say that the solicitors' profession welcomes at all times statutory control, that is, control by either or both Houses of Parliament, who are the custodians of the public good.</P>
      <P>As far back as 1962&mdash;and that is nine years ago&mdash;the solicitors' profession suggested that, instead of the various committees to which the Minister has referred, there be one committee for dealing with all aspects of a solicitor's remuneration. If it were felt that the Statutory Body that was dealing with them was not adequately acquainted with the practical aspects of life, then the solicitors recommended that this body should contain members of the general public who would be in a position to arrive at an objective judgment; that it would include&mdash; though not in the majority&mdash;some members of the solicitors' profession; that it would include persons who were acquainted with what solicitors' remuneration is and what their expenses are. It is absolutely impossible to give an average, as Senator West has asked. Some men are barely able to struggle along with the assistance of their wives doing the typing or with the assistance of one or two typists. Other men acting for large corporations who want everything done yesterday are prepared to pay accordingly and, in fact, to offer those fees in advance if necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You cannot arrive at an average. <Col N="435" /> It is important that the remuneration should be reasonable and that this committee, therefore, should include people who are acquainted with what the average solicitor earns, having regard to the amount of work he does, what his expenses are and what is left for himself to live on. For this reason it is suggested that this committee should include representatives of accountants who audit solicitors' fees. It should include also representatives of the public who have experience of dealing with solicitors and possibly even people in a substantial way of business. We suggested that the evidence before such a body could, if possible, be given in public and be given by people who had experience of these matters and who would be qualified to advise such a body, and that whatever that body decided upon would be binding on us as a profession, but subject to the overriding obligation of the Oireachtas, who are the custodians of the public good, if they saw fit, to say, that it was too high.</P>
    <P>That was the suggestion we made and that was a suggestion we did not wait until now to make. So far from objecting to control from the Oireachtas, we welcome that control and we like control by the Oireachtas and by the Oireachtas only. We feel that in all matters where incomes, divisions in incomes or reductions in incomes or anything else arise, these matters too should be subject to the control of the Oireachtas. I doubt if there is one other profession in this country that would make such a suggestion or such a case. I respectfully submit that.</P>
    <P>We have no choice in this matter. We are governed by the statute as it exists. The statute as it exists is that this Statutory Body shall be the Chief Justice, the President of the High Court, a Senior Judge of the Supreme Court and the President of the Law Society. Where matters in dispute regarding income are submitted to a body I think that the employers&mdash;even when the employers are representative of the general public&mdash;usually take the body to be impartial. There is no reason in the world why people who are accustomed to being conservative, who <Col N="436" /> represent the public good, who safeguard the general public, such as judges of the High Court or the Supreme Court, should be unfair to anybody. Perhaps they are. I am not saying that the Minister is not perfectly correct in what he says. If that is the view of the Government the Oireachtas would, as he says, be failing in their duty if they did not oppose their decision. <i>Prima facie,</i> I would have imagined that they would be fair.</P>
    <P>The Minister has stated that the question of solicitors' fees has come up and they have been increased from time to time. This would leave a person listening under the impression that they had been increased every two or three years. In 1960 there was an increase. Between 1960 and 1972 there was one increase. There was an increase in 1964 of 12 per cent relating to these particular items. From 1964 to date there has been no increase in those items. Perhaps the Minister is right in saying that there should not be an increase. In the meantime, of course, there have been six increases in the remuneration of the staff of solicitors' offices. They are also governed by arbitration, and when the arbitration decides this decision is accepted. The arbitration body consists of representatives of the solicitors, representatives of the staffs and an independent chairman. The independent chairman usually decides.</P>
    <P>Between 1964 and the present time there have been enormous increases in rents. Every solicitor must get his accounts audited, and the fees for this have been increased. There have been increases in his insurances. This year alone fire insurance has gone up by 40 per cent and a solicitor must take out very heavy insurance because if documents belonging to clients are destroyed he will be in serious trouble. If he carries a large amount of money on hands for clients, or if his ledgers or accounts are destroyed, he must be heavily insured against those things. I noticed when I got my own bill for insurances last month that they had increased by 40 per cent during the past 12 months.</P>
    <P>Other increases one has to meet are postage, stationery, repairs, replacement <Col N="437" /> of typewriters and so on. We can take it on average that those increases were not less than increases in the cost of living, that is about 74 per cent between 1964 and the present. Despite that, it may be felt, objectively, that solicitors should not get 42 per cent. One would imagine that the Statutory Body would possibly have given 74 per cent. Judges are a conservative body and are entitled to feel that, if things were let slide for the last six or seven years, this is all they can do. I think, however, they originally considered and made this offer some 12 months ago.</P>
    <P>The Minister has stated that instructions fees, which are a substantial item in a solicitor's bill, have increased with the cost of living. I agree with the Minister. The implication there might be that there is a suggestion that this instructions fee should be increased by 42 per cent. This is not so. If one item in a solicitor's bill increases by 42 per cent, unless they were overpaid in 1964 to make sure they are not overpaid at the present time in case they were overpaid in 1964, the other items should not increase. The suggestion was that the decision in 1964 to increase fees by 12 per cent for a period of four years was not excessive and, therefore the increase in the instructions fee has no bearing on the items under consideration.</P>
    <P>The Minister also refers to scale fees on sales and states that these increase in proportion to the amount of the sale. This is perfectly correct so far as it goes, but they do not increase in direct proportion; they increase on a sliding scale. I am dealing with the sale, at the moment, of a licenced public-house including an acre of land in County Tipperary. The purchase price is £6,300. I have had a good deal of work negotiating this. The auctioneer had it advertised for quite a long time. There were people coming into my office making inquiries and so on. My actual scale fee for this is £74.75 because the scale reduces by approximately £1.25 per £100. The sale which a solicitor gets is like getting money from America. You do not have substantial sales every day of the week. <Col N="438" /> According to the Minister's speech I am being overpaid. After the place is sold, and I have had all these interviews in advance, I have to submit the contract, get requisitions on title and deal with them. I have to get the deed completed. I must arrange for the transfer of the licence and so on. Perhaps I am overpaid at £74.75. I do not know. Personally I would find it difficult to believe this.</P>
    <P>Again, dealing with these sale fees, the Minister has stated that the value of property and of lands has increased considerably more than the cost of living. He is quite correct there. If a solicitor sells a house, which is not in the Land Registry, for £10,000, he would feel like taking his wife to a party that night. He has been very lucky that day. For all the work in connection with that sale, assuming that it is not in the Land Registry, which involves going through a maze of title deeds, to satisfy the purchaser to whom he is selling, or to go through all the title deeds, prepare the deed of conveyance, stamp and register it and so on, the solicitor's fee is £200. If a farm is involved and, as frequently happens, the owner is there for 20 years so the equities can be readily discharged, the fee is £102.50 on a sale for £10,000. These sales are, so to speak, plums.</P>
    <P>Supposing it is a very big farm and goes over £10,000 and up to £20,000, for every £1,000 the solicitor gets an additional £3.75, if it is registered for over 20 years and you can get equities discharged. Therefore, for the extra £10,000 he gets £37.50 on top of his £102.50. That makes £140. I agree this pays and I am very happy when I get it. Perhaps it is excessive, as the Minister has stated. That is a matter of opinion. There is no application to increase those fees.</P>
    <P>In connection with this pub I sold, one firm of auctioneers who advertised it wanted 5 per cent on the sale and their advertising expenses, which on £6,300 was £315 plus their advertising expenses. To add insult to injury, when they went to sell, another firm of auctioneers had a letter from a prospective purchaser in England and they <Col N="439" /> would only introduce the prospective purchaser on condition that they got 5 per cent also&mdash;£315. I have not yet paid either of them. I have put the money on deposit receipt. I got £6,300 plus the £315 auctioneer's commission which I have put on deposit receipt to see exactly what I can do because I rather object to paying them £315 apiece.</P>
    <P>The client in question is an old and valued one and in the hope that he would not get involved in litigation I offered to do the work for nothing and to make the second firm of auctioneers who introduced the purchaser a gift of £74.75 which was my fee. I simply give those figures as some of the practical objective points.</P>
    <P>The Minister has said that most parts of the solicitor's business can be said to be reasonably remunerative. That depends to a great extent on the type of business you do. If you are acting for a wealthy man who wants a thing done thoroughly and quickly and is prepared to pay you whatever you demand that is fine. The man with one or two typists and a wife and four or five children dependant on him gets the average client who does not want to pay a shilling more than he should.</P>

      <P>I merely make that point. He hopes that sometime his practice will improve and he will get regular fees. I sympathise with the Minister. The legal profession have been very remiss and they have let things run since 1964. As the Minister has pointed out, if the average worker feels that the solicitor is getting an increase of 42 per cent he will see red. He will not consider that since 1964 the solicitor has got no increase in these items. Taking my own practice, which I would consider to be reasonably average, the items here would probably cover approximately 70 per cent of my income, except the instructions fee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to be fair to the Minister. The instructions fee has increased with <Col N="440" /> the cost of living but there is no application to increase that. There should be a levelling up rather than a levelling down. I should like to see the income of the poor man, the worker, the small salary earner coming up at a much more rapid percentage than the incomes of others. In one way I cannot speak for the profession in that I am not dependent on my income from the profession. Other aspects of my income have increased.</P>
    <P>I have tried to explain the facts as fairly and as objectively as I can. I think it is difficult when nothing has been done for seven or eight years&mdash; whether that is the fault of the Law Society I do not know&mdash;to come along to the Minister and say: &ldquo;Look, here is the situation. We find a large number of solicitors, especially men in small offices, are unable to get along. What can we do if they overcharge and they say they must overcharge in order to live. If they charge more than the scale fees how can we penalise them?&rdquo; If you make your statutory charges too low they will be ignored. If they are ignored it is the dishonest men who will suffer least. This is the difficulty as I see it.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that this large increase has been put together this way. Perhaps the reason that the Law Society do not come forward every two or three years is because naturally judges are slow to make decisions They have public responsibility. When the decisions are made they have to be submitted to the Minister's Department. They have to be considered for a long time and there is usually a lapse of an average of two or three years in many of the applications for increases. I have tried to put the facts objectively. I have endeavoured not to lean in any direction. I visualise the Minister's sense of responsibility, if he and the Government are convinced they would be failing in their duty if they granted this increase. The real issue is: is this increase unfair in these circumstances? If their expenses have gone up 74 per cent in those circumstances is the increase excessive?</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say a few words on this subject on which I <Col N="441" /> find myself not very competent to speak. In order to weigh the scales as fairly as possible and, having listened to the case made by the Minister to disallow the order and listened to the cases made by Senators O'Higgins, Nash and West, I should like to contribute what I hope will be some helpful remarks. As a nonmember of the legal profession and one who from time to time has had reason to use the services of the legal profession, as I see it purely on the basis of an increase based on a scale of fees last fixed in 1964, almost eight years ago, the request for an increase of 42 per cent strikes me as not being unreasonable.</P>
      <P>There are very few salaries, wages and other sources of remuneration that have not increased by substantially more than 42 per cent in the past eight years. Examples have been given by Senators O'Higgins and Nash to indicate that other sectors of the public have received justified increases very substantially in excess of 42 per cent. If there were no other relevant factors in the case I feel that the Minister and the Government would accept it.</P>
      <P>The Minister has introduced the question of the reward to the solicitors from other types of work which they do. In his speech he has mentioned two in particular, the higher amounts allowable under the head of instructions which he defines as a fee at large and, secondly, the increase in property values which has brought a substantial increase in remuneration to solicitors for conveyancing, as costs are related on an <i>ad valorem</i> basis to the value of property conveyed.</P>
      <P>I am at a loss, as I am sure other Members of the House must be, in trying to decide if the increases under the latter two headings make up for the losses which solicitors incurred as a result of the increased costs of running their offices. Is the income under the heading of &ldquo;instructions&rdquo; and from conveyancing increased to such an extent that it will offset those losses? The Minister has not produced any figures to suggest that this is so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was very impressed by the case made by Senator Nash and I find <Col N="442" /> myself influenced, to a large extent, by the points he made. There must be a substantial difference in the remuneration accruing to a solicitor in a good city practice and the remuneration accruing to a solicitor in a rural area. I have had some experience of solicitors practising in rural areas and one example stands out in my memory. Following the death of a rural solicitor it became almost impossible to sell his practice. Finally, one buyer came forward who purchased the practice at his own price. Nobody could contend that such a solicitor was getting a remuneration commensurate with his profession. The remuneration of solicitors is a very difficult matter for an ordinary layman to adjudicate on. To complicate the task still further there are three bodies dealing with the question of solicitors' remuneration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Five bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>That augments the Minister's own case and makes it even more confusing for people such as myself. I would echo the Minister's plea and Senator Nash's plea that some consolidation or rationalisation of the bodies involved with solicitors' costs should be undertaken. The Minister in his speech said that the Government were not totally opposed to an increase in solicitors' remuneration but they were not prepared to accept an unreasonable increase. The Minister then went on to compare costs in this country under certain headings with comparable costs in Great Britain, Scotland and Northern Ireland. Again, I must admit to being unable to grasp the comparison because the figures were not produced. It is very hard for a layman such as myself, who has a very high regard for solicitors' competence and integrity, to know which side to take.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The cost of law generally to the litigant is increasing very rapidly and at some future time something will have to be done to keep costs within limits. Perhaps the answer to that problem lies, as the Minister said recently, in the coming together of the legal professions something along the lines of the system in the United States. Without doubt, the cost of law <Col N="443" /> is becoming excessive to the ordinary public. I do not lay the blame for that on the shoulders of the legal profession as this trend has been apparent for some years.</P>
    <P>On balance I think the solicitors have made a good case for the increases. I sympathise with the Minister as he has a responsibility towards the community but I am not convinced that the Minister has made a sufficiently good case to justify my supporting him on this order. An order seeking to recoup costs incurred eight years ago cannot be considered unreasonable. The Minister has not proved that solicitors' remuneration arising under other headings is sufficient to offset the increased costs incurred by them during the past eight years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Owens</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to delay the House very long because much of what I intended to say has already been said by Senator West. I find myself largely in agreement with what he said. We are in rather an extraordinary position as Members of this House because we are trying to arbitrate on a pay claim. In many respects Senators find themselves acting as advocates, counter-advocates and arbitrators. It is difficult to arrive at a proper balanced decision in such a situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From what other speakers have said I am more convinced than ever that the entire situation has got into a horrible knot and I cannot see how they are going to extricate themselves from it. Perhaps the blame can be laid on both sides in the past for what has resulted in the present impasse. Having had some experience of wage and salary negotiations and having sat on arbitration boards, may I say with respect to the learned gentlemen on both sides that if either side in normal wage negotiations, where the chairman of the arbitration board is generally a rather eminent gentleman from the legal profession, presented their case in the way in which it has been presented to this House the chairman of the arbitration board would have no option but to say: &ldquo;I think we will have to adjourn and do a little more homework on both sides and come back before I could make my decision.&rdquo;<Col N="444" /> We are all anxious that justice be done to the people who are seeking this increase but we also have to look at the other side of the case. We must think not only of the general good but on the case as presented by the Minister. I have difficulty in understanding it. It is obviously a very complicated matter which requires some study and a great deal of expertise, but having five bodies to adjudicate on different parts of the solicitors' remuneration seems to be quite extraordinary in the year 1972. Here we seem to be dealing with one of those bodies but I am not clear as to what increases members of the profession may have received since 1964 from the other four-fifths of the relevant bodies.</P>

      <P>It illustrated the point very clearly. Suddenly I found I was almost acting as chairman of an arbitration board between the Minister and the advocate on the other side. It is not so simple: there is an awful lot more that could be argued on both sides of the case. I agree very much with Senator West when he made the point about the Statutory Body that deal with this, made up of the Chief Justice, the President of the High Court, a senior judge of the Supreme Court and the President of the Incorporated Law Society of Ireland. I do <Col N="445" /> not for one minute doubt the integrity of these gentlemen. However, in the present state of advancement of industrial relations in this country, I think it is extraordinary that people within the profession should be adjudging the remuneration of their own profession. I should imagine there would be quite a howl and cry from the business world if we had a board of dockers who decided what increase the men on the docks should get.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Miss Owens</NameTxt>
      <P>I said it was from the business world the howl would be. Obviously, this is something that is wrong. It is not unusual for professional people to appear before independent arbitration boards. The engineers have done it; the Irish Medical Union do it quite regularly in the area where they are negotiating salaries and fees. I should like to see this type of negotiation system applied to the Law Society. Senator Nash pointed out that some years ago they made a proposal&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not entirely fair to the Minister. There have been negotiations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EvelynOwens" hpid="Miss Owens Miss Owens">
      <NameTxt>Miss Owens</NameTxt>
      <P>Negotiations, but obviously they have not been finalised, or we should not be in this morass today. The Minister also pointed out that this particular order could not be considered in isolation. It must be viewed as part of a general claim being pursued at present by the Incorporated Law Society for considerable increases in costs, both in contentious and non-contentious business. Frankly, we have not heard anything as to what that might be, what the extent of it is, what percentage or whether it is a percentage. Again, all I can do is put a query after it. I should like to know, and if we have any way of getting the information it would be of value to <Col N="446" /> people in trying to make a judgment on it.</P>
      <P>One of the real problems we are facing is that one must either accept or reject it: there is no way of amending the order. This is an extraordinary situation for any arbitrators to be in, because what you can normally do is liable to be the result of a concensus and you must hope it is agreed on both sides.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>This originated in 1881, unfortunately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EvelynOwens" hpid="Miss Owens Miss Owens">
      <NameTxt>Miss Owens</NameTxt>
      <P>From 1881 to 1972 is an awful long time. I do not know of any trade union that would have put up with a situation that had continued for so long. I would say to the Law Society: &ldquo;For goodness sake, get your house put into order: you are well able to do it.&rdquo; I am afraid that Senator O'Higgins's interruptions make me sound a little stronger than I probably intended to be.</P>
      <P>The other big factor that must be taken into account is the general good and the fact that the last national wage agreement which is still operating, has confined the ordinary worker to £2 per week, with a follow-up of 4 per cent. Two pounds a week was quite deliberately negotiated as being a way of bringing up the lower paid worker, which is a principle that everyone in this House would agree with. The tendency now in negotiations, both from the employer and the employee, is to go away from percentage increases, because they have never worked to the benefit of the lower paid worker, and they never will. There is no way of bringing up the lower paid worker or of getting an equitable distribution of income, and this is what we should be anxious to do, if percentage incomes are to be proceeded with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have wandered more than I intended to. On balance, I must say that I would support rejection of the order. It is not that I am satisfied entirely with the reasons for rejecting it, because I do not think all the facts have been put before the House, and I would do it solely for this reason. We should give enough impetus to both sides to get together to sort out a proper way and one that would conform with the <Col N="447" /> procedures that obtain normally when negotiating salaries, fees and wages.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to oppose this order. The case has been made that solicitors have not received an increase for some time. However, most of the business conducted by solicitors is in connection with sales and transfers of property. Everybody knows how much that has increased during the past ten years, and solicitors get a percentage of the money. Solicitors and auctioneers are the only people who work completely on a percentage basis and, with higher values, they are getting a much better income.</P>

      <P>There are many people building houses as a result of the government's policy of helping them. All those loans are going through the solicitors' hands and the costs are quite substantial. It is a business that did not exist ten years ago, or to a very small extent. I suppose 99 per cent of all those people getting married today must consult a solicitor before they apply for loans for their new houses. That is a business that never existed before and is comparatively simple. In Dublin it usually consists of dealings with the builder who acquires sites for houses. It is simply a question of transferring the property and can be carried out in bulk. The solicitors then collect their fees for such transfers. I have never heard of a solicitor whose work was done overnight. It is usually carried on over a period of months and a long time elapses before he sends a bill. If it was a business, the account would come out every month. A solicitor never makes out his account until the business deal is completed, so he is obviously never short of money. Most of them are progressing quite favourably. If anything their offices are getting bigger. In that regard there is no justification for a 42 per cent increase. Some years ago when we received our own increase there was a great deal of opposition and the public and trade unions maintained that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It was 60 per cent for Senators and it came after a long time. If this increase is granted the general public will take a very poor view of it. As a profession they do not have very good public relations and therefore they could not expect to have a 42 per cent increase without having to put up any case, except to one of their own members. They do not have to appear <Col N="449" /> before an independent tribunal so it is only right that they should put their case to us before receiving an increase in order that we may express the opinions of the general public. In this respect I feel that this very substantial increase should be rejected.</P>

      <P>The impasse here shows the necessity for an overall look at the situation. It is no justification to say that increases under one heading should not be allowed because charges under other headings are extravagant. I admit that charges under other headings are quite extravagant in that the whole question of fees &mdash;whether auctioneers' fees or some of the transfer fees charged by solicitors &mdash;are out of keeping with the amount of work involved. On the other hand, the fees which were adequate in 1969 and which come under the present order obviously are not adequate today. It highlights this tardiness in bringing fees and payments for many sections into line with the decrease in the value of money.</P>
      <P>We are now faced&mdash;as we were in the case of the Oireachtas salaries&mdash; with what certainly appears to be a completely exorbitant increase due to the fact that regular increases were not given over the years. If all wages were paid at the 1962 level and suddenly had to be raised to today's level the increase in most of them would be of the order of at least 100 per cent, if account were taken of devaluation and the economic improvement that has taken place since then.</P>
      <P>The Prices Bill promised by the Government is long overdue and it may bring order into this field.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is difficult at this stage to judge whether a 42 per cent increase is justified. On the other hand, some of the other increases, based on percentages, <Col N="450" /> whether it is on a sliding or whatever other scale, are inordinate for the amount of work done. At the head of that, the auctioneers stand the most culpable of all. Consequently I welcome the Minister's declared intention of rationalising those fees in the Prices Bill. We look forward to the debate on that.</P>
    <P>In the meantime the Minister has set his face against this increase. Therefor, I hope that arising out of the rejection of the order the Minister will get together with the profession concerned and will try to rationalise and relieve some of the burden of the inordinate charges they have made under other headings in conveyance of land, property and other things which are totally exorbitant today.</P>

      <P>The topic which we have been discussing for the last two hours is a complex and highly complicated one. It is a topic that is not understood even by some solicitors. In many of the larger offices many solicitors would not have a great deal to do with costs and so would not know a great deal about them. In view of the fact that there are quite a number of solicitors who do not understand the complexity of the topic we have had under discussion today, it is not surprising that laymen and women find it difficult to understand it. I sympathise with their predicament. I am sorry that my opening speech was so technical that lay Members of the House found it difficult to follow, but unfortunately if one is to deal objectively and fairly with this topic one has to try and spell it out accurately and at great length.</P>
      <P>As I have said already, there are quite a few solicitors who do not understand very much about costs. I might add that it has often been said to me that no barrister knows the first thing about solicitors' costs. This highlights still further the problem that a non-lawyer must have in trying to understand what we are talking about here today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because the matter is so complex and difficult to understand, it is unfortunately very easy to be misleading in regard to it. There was a fair amount of misleading done today, although I <Col N="451" /> am not suggesting it was intentional. It is little wonder, therefore, that uncommitted Members of the House, who seek to do justice to both sides, would find a lot of difficulty in making up their minds. I am sorry that some of the Senators who expressed difficulty in understanding the matter are not in the House any longer because I would like to try to deal with the points they raised and to try to clear up the difficulties they had in understanding the whole affair.</P>
    <P>I did not want to refer to a memorandum sent out by the Law Society to, I understand, all Senators, because I have an objection to private pressure groups trying to put their points of view across. To refer to such documents as private pressure groups may put out is only to add a certain dignity to them and this is something I do not wish to do. This memorandum, which is dated 3rd January, 1972 was handed to me by a member of the Law Society on 5th January with the request that I should read it&mdash;not that I should comment on it. However, Senator O'Higgins has criticised me for not commenting on it today.</P>
    <P>So far as that memorandum is concerned I want to say straight away that it is misleading in two respects. It picks out certain items and gives figures in respect of them. However, these items are by no means representative as they relate to only a small fraction of what is really involved and the very large increases in the other items have been totally ignored.</P>
    <P>Even allowing for this distortion, there are, on the face of it, at least two blatant errors in the percentage increases in relation to solicitors' item charges shown on page 2 of this memorandum. One is the statement that between 1961 and 1971 there was no increase in costs in the Circuit Court. That of course is untrue: there was an increase of 20 per cent in 1967.</P>
    <P>This memorandum also has a statement that whereas the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme had a base of 100 in 1965, it was 125 in November, 1971, and that the increase in that period was, therefore, 25 per cent. In fact, the increase was slightly more than <Col N="452" /> 60 per cent: it averages out at about 62 or 63 per cent. I am very familiar with these figures because I was involved in the negotiating of that increase. It is very disturbing to my mind that the Law Society would send out figures such as these to Senators, who no doubt accept them in good faith, when in fact the figures are totally wrong. I made an order in October, 1970 increasing criminal legal aid fees by slightly more than 60 per cent. Notwithstanding this, the figure that is given in the memorandum is 25 per cent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, because it was only in 1965 that the original order was made. When I talk about distortion I am not trying to imply that any Senator or the Law Society has deliberately tried to distort but the matter is so complex that distortion is almost inevitable in the mind of anyone who is not very familiar with this particular topic. For example, arising out of what Senator Russell said, I could see the difficulty he was in. He was with me for about half of the way but he could not quite grasp some of the distinctions. Quite frankly, I do not blame him or, indeed, anyone else for that matter who found it difficult to get to the root of this.</P>
      <P>The case has been made here that there has been no increase in the items under Schedule II since 1964, that an increase of 42 per cent is now proposed and that this is all there is to the matter. It is not as simple as that, at all. The first item under Schedule II is an &ldquo;instructions&rdquo; fee which is a fee at large. It covers everything and it takes every factor into account. The vast bulk of what is charged under Schedule II is charged under that item. The remaining items, which relate to specific things, are small by comparison. To give you an idea of the range of item No. 1&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Col N="453" />
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not only the remaining items that are dealt with under the order.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall give an idea of the range of item No. 1, the number of things that are involved in it and the number of factors that can be taken into account in fixing a fee. It sets out seven different things and as far as I can see they cover every conceivable contingency that would be even remotely relevant. They are (a) the complexity, importance, difficulty, rarity, or urgency of the questions raised; (b) where money or property is involved, its amount or value; (c) the importance of the matter to the client; (d) the skill, labour and responsibility involved therein and any specialised knowledge given or applied on the part of a solicitor; (e) the number and importance of any documents perused; (f) the place where and the circumstances in which the business or any part thereof is transacted; and (g) the time reasonably expended thereon.</P>
      <P>That general item covers the vast bulk of cases in which the question of charging under Schedule II would arise. That, as Senators will see, is completely equitable and it takes every possible relevant factor into account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>What is relevant here is that it does not come under the order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not interrupt Senator O'Higgins at all. He spoke for three-quarters of an hour. I have been speaking for five minutes and he has interrupted me three times already. Item No. 1 of Schedule II which as I have said is the instructions fee has increased very considerably since 1964. Since the bulk of charging done under Schedule II comes under the instructions fee it is quite misleading to say that there has not been an increase since 1964. Of course there has been an increase and a very large one. To answer the specific point put by Senator Russell, it would be my submission to the Seanad, and I speak of my own personal knowledge without any axe to grind one way or the other, that the increase in the instructions fee allied to the increased income from <Col N="454" /> conveyancing under Schedule I and the increase in legal business, including probate and administration, far outweigh the lack of progress in the specific items numbers 2 to 21, inclusive, in Schedule II of the 1970 order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>No. 21 is not included.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry. It is Nos. 2 to 20. Again this is a general item. If Senator O'Higgins has to fall back on that sort of thing it is indicative of the strength of his case. No. 21 is, in fact, the same as No. 1. To say, therefore, that because these items have not been increased since 1964 there has been no increase in remuneration, is a total and gross distortion of the facts. The instructions fee, which is the main item, has increased greatly and income from the scale fee in Schedule I has, of course, increased greatly also, because of the rise in the value of property.</P>
      <P>Some examples of fees were given here today by Senators but unfortunately in each case they tended to pick very special types of cases. I suppose there is a natural temptation to do this but I need hardly add that they picked out the very lowest possible fees in the particular circumstances. To that extent Senators could possibly be misled as to the general scale of fees.</P>
      <P>Perhaps a better way of giving Senators an idea of how we stand in relation to fees here would be to give a comparison with other countries. For example, in the case of a sale of unregistered land worth £10,000 the solicitors' fees here would be £400. In Northern Ireland they would be £359; in England they would be £210 and in Scotland they would be £240. I think that this is the most valid way of showing whether our fees are high or low in particular circumstances.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do. In the case of unregistered land, there are differences in the fee depending on whether the land is subject to equities. If the land is not subject to equities, which I shall not bother to explain now because it would take too long, half fee is charged and the fee referred to by Senator Nash would, of course, have been half fee. The full fee is chargeable where the land is subject to equities.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Higgins has inquired why I did not move this motion in the Dáil. The answer to that is that it was laid on the Table of both Houses on 22nd December. It was not possible to deal with it in the Department or for me to examine it until early in January; it had to be examined, which took a week or so, and then submitted to the Government. As anyone who is familiar with the preparation and transmission of memoranda for the Government knows, it takes at least a week to get a memorandum considered by the Government. The result was that by the time I had got a Government decision on the matter the time for me to move in the Dáil had elapsed. The Dáil had by then sat for four weeks due to the fact that we came back very early this year. The only House in which it was open to me to put down this motion was this House. This is the fourth sitting week since Christmas and the last week in which I can move.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Higgins made the statement&mdash;and I took down exactly what he said&mdash;that &ldquo;This order has notthing to do with conveyancing fees&rdquo; Anyone who has a copy of the General Order of 1970 on which the new Order is based, will find if he reads items 2 to 20, which are the ones with which we are concerned here, that the majority of them refer to conveyancing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, <Col N="456" /> may I suggest to the Minister that I do not doubt him when he quotes my exact words, but I suggest that it must be quite clear that I was talking about conveyancing scale fees?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the point I am coming to. Schedule II is used for the most part in relation to conveyancing. If all the ordinary items, apart from the &ldquo;instructions&rdquo; fee in Schedule II, are increased by 42 per cent, there will be an immediate temptation for a solicitor not to use the scale fees in Schedule I in the case of smaller sales but to produce an itemised bill under Schedule II, as increased by the proposed order, and thereby get his total bill up to a higher figure than it would be if he had used the ordinary scale fee in Schedule I.</P>
      <P>This, of course, will not matter in a sale of something like £10,000 because, unless it was exceptionally complicated, there would not be enough individual items to bring it up to anywhere near the scale fee which would, of course, be very high. It would matter in a sale of, say, £2,000 or £3,000 because, unless it was unusually straightforward, the Schedule II method of charging would bring it above the scale fees. This would have the effect, therefore, of increasing the conveyancing charge to the man who is buying a small house or a plot of land for £2,000 or £3,000 or £4,000, but not to the man who might be able to afford to pay higher fees in the case of a conveyance of £10,000 or £20,000. It is the small man who I would particularly like to protect because I know that people buying small properties are frequently very hard hit by the charges that are consequential on the purchase of property. I do not mean merely solicitor's fees, which are by no means the biggest item, and I want to emphasise that. There is stamp duty and very often too there are auctioneer's fees; also in some instances there are land registry fees. Between the lot, the costs that are consequential on the purchase of property amount to a figure that creates hardship for the smaller man.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One notices this particularly in relation to newly-married couples and particularly <Col N="457" /> those who are getting a loan. one of the great horrors, to my mind, that faces people in that position is that when they get a loan very often they have to get a loan of the maximum amount and they are put to the pin of their collar to buy at all. They are often landed then with a bill for £50 or £100 extra that they never thought of or catered for, not for their own solicitor but for the solicitor of the building society. I think that is very unfair and what I propose to do, as soon as I can get a suitable Bill into which to put it, is to make a provision similar to what was done in 1967 in relation to lessors and lessees where the lessees had to pay the owner's costs. We prohibited that in 1967 and made is unenforceable. I propose to do the same in relation to building society solicitors' costs in order to take the burden off the unfortunate borrower who very often has not catered for it at all. Even if it means that he has to pay in the long run, and that his loan has to be increased by £50 or £100 as a result, he has 30 or 35 years, or whatever it is, to pay it back and he is not being landed with this awful problem, which I have seen so young people stuck with, of trying to many find £100 that they had never catered for, particularly when they have gone to great trouble to work out the economics of the whole thing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. J. Fitzgerald Mr. J. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The same principle would apply, or in the case of any lending institutions, whether it be a building society, an insurance company, a local authority or a bank.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think I have covered at least in a general wav all the points that have been made. There have been a lot of specific fees mentioned and things of that kind. I could not follow every one <Col N="458" /> of those and I cannot deal individually with them. The final point that I want to make is that I am not asking the House to choose between giving 42 per cent and giving nothing. I have already asked those concerned to put up a more reasonable figure and if they do so I would be very happy to give my blessing to it. In present circumstances and for the reasons I have given to the House today I cannot in all conscience stand over a fiaure of 42 per cent in the particular circumstances.</P>
    <P>When I ask the House now to support me by passing this motion, it does not mean that the whole thing is nmsned and nobody gets anything. It means that we can start again and perhaps within a week or so come to an agreement on a reasonable figure. something on the lines of what Senator Miss Owens suggested. There is no question of anybody being blocked off for good if this motion is passed. It simply allows a more reasonable figure to be agreed upon and I should hope that, if this motion is passed now and this order disallowed, a reasonable figure can and will be agreed upon within the next week or two and that another order can then be made and go through without any problem.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bili be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. O'Malley) Desmond J. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to enable the Government to determine the ranks of the Garda Síochána and the maximum number of members in each rank. At present the various ranks of the Garda Síochána and the maximum number in each rank are prescribed by statute, that is, by section 5 (2) of the Police Forces Amalgamation Act, 1925, and the Third Schedule to that Act, as amended by the Garda Síochána Acts of 1945 and 1962. In addition to the five Commissioners and the surgeon, the statutory maximum establishment is now 29 chief superintendents, 157 superintendents, 110 inspectors, 70 station sergeants, 1,350 sergeants and 6,000 gardaí. An increase in the statutory maximum number of inspectors and, possibly, in one or more other ranks is now required. To enable this to be done an amending Bill is required and the opportunity presented by the Bill is being availed of to amend the law so as to avoid the need, for having a special Bill passed through all its Stages in each House of the Oireachtas whenever such increases are necessary. However, the Bill does provide that any order made by the Government under the Bill will be liable to annulment by either the Dáil or the Seanad, so that each House of the Oireachtas will continue to exercise a measure of control in these matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I announced in the Dáil recently the strength of the force is being increased by a further 600 gardaí, in addition to the extra 400 announced last year. This increase is in addition to recruitment to replace normal wastage and will bring the strength of the force to 7,560, the highest ever. In order to recruit the extra gardaí as quickly as possible, a recruiting campaign has been launched and I have made new appointments regulations modifying the requirements for entry to the force. The main changes in the regulations are that the minimum height for male candidates has been reduced from 5' 9&rdquo; to 5' 8&rdquo; and the upper age limit has been extended <Col N="461" /> from 25 to 26 years. Moreover, to encourage candidates to come forward, exemption from the qualifying educational examination is being given to persons who have the leaving certificate and have passed, or have obtained grade D or better, in Irish and English. The next entrance examination is being held on 23rd March.</P>
    <P>The increase in strength is required partly to offset the reduction in working hours in the force but mainly to help in dealing with the increased incidence of crime with which we, in common with other countries, are faced. In the year ended 30th September, 1970&mdash;the last year for which we have figures&mdash;the total number of indictable crimes was 30,756, which represents an increase of 18.4 per cent. As in previous years, about two-thirds of the total number of indictable crimes consisted of non-violent crimes against property, mainly larcenies. Most of the larcenies were from parked motor vehicles and these offences increased by over 1,800. Prosecutions were brought in respect of 44.5 per cent of the total number of indictable offences. In a further 5 per cent, the Garda were fully satisfied that they knew who was responsible but procecdings could not be taken because the person could not be found or because the evidence was inadmissible. The overall detection rate was 50 per cent as compared with 61 per cent in the previous year. In the Dublin Metropolitan Area the detection rate was 37 per cent while in the rest of the country it was 69 per cent. The increase in strength should be a substantial help in curbing the increased crime and improving the effectiveness of the protection given by the Garda Síochána to the community.</P>
    <P>In addition to the recruitment of additional gardaí, female clerical assistants are being employed to do the office work now being done by gardaí, and 70 have already taken up duty. This policy, together with the employment of an increasing number of traffic wardens, will release a substantial number of gardaí for more important police work Other steps taken to improve the olice service to the community, include the doubling of the provision in last year's Estimates <Col N="462" /> for the purchase of Garda cars and special arrangements for the rapid improvement of the Garda radio and communications system. A Garda task force has been set up in Dublin and has already proved to be very successful. I expect that there will be similar units in other areas in due course. The Garda Research and Planning Unit are at present engaged in studies designed to improve manpower utilisation and the existing arrangements for training, recruitment and promotion. In all these matters the intention is to invite the views of the Representative Bodies. A special investigation is being made of clerical procedures with a view to making them fully up-to-date and efficient. Discussions are taking place with the Department of Posts and Telegmphs with a view to providing police boxes at rural stations where this can be done without undue difficulty. These telephones will provide immediate contact throughout the 24 hours vath the local district headquarters. An accelerated programme of building Garda stations and houses, with the emphasis on system built structures, is being initiated. For this purpose I propose to set up a separate unit in my Department to deal exclusively with building projects.</P>
    <P>From what I have said I hope Senators will accept that a sustained effort is being made in this the jubilee year of the foundation of the force to bring it to the highest attainable level of efficiency and so to equip it to carry out its task of safeguarding peace in the community and helping to protect the person and property of all our citizens. I shall continue the search for further means of introducing improvements where they appear to be necessary and I do not exclude invoking the assistance of outside experts to help the Research and Planning Unit in its task of modemising the force.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House and ask that it be given a Second Reading.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I am concerned and as far as the Fine Gael Party are concerned, we approve this Bill. Many spokesmen from my party have made it clear on a number of <Col N="463" /> occasions that whatever steps are required to increase the strenith, to increase the efficiency, to increase the mobility of the Garda would find ready support from us. The Minister is approaching this task, so far as this legislation goes, in the right way. In other words, he is correct in getting away from the legislation which proprovided for a particular limit to the Garda as regards the various ranks. Personally, I think it would be more satisfactory that the matter be dealt with in future on the basis proposed in this Bill, namely, that the Government will have authority from time to time to decide what is the appropriate numher or numbers in any particular rank of the Garda Síochána. They will be required to come to the Oireachtas under subsection (3) of section I of the Bill which reads:</P>
      <P>An order under this section shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after it is made and, if a resolution annulling the order is passed by either such House within the next twenty-one days on which that House has sat after the order is laid before it, the order shall be annulled accordina,ly but without, prejudice to th e validity of anything previously done thereunder.</P>
      <P>In other words, as regards the numbers in the Garda he is adopting the ordinary procedure whereby the order can be made increasing or fixing the number, as may be required, and that will automatically have the force of law unless it is annulled by the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a matter of procedure, that is preferable to the system whereby the limit is set by the legislation. What worries me about the Minister's proposals is not the contents of his amending Bill but his announcement that the targets which he and, presumably, the Government have set for the increase in the Garda personnel is 1,000. That is 400 already announced and a further 600 for this year. In our present circumstances an increase of 1,000 in the Garda force does not appear to be enough. In his speech, the Minister <Col N="464" /> indicated that when the numbers have been increased by the 1,000 of which he has spoken&mdash;the 600 and 400&mdash;the strength of the force will be up to 7,560. It is worth noting that no new legislation is required to bring the total of the Garda force up to that number. That is within the limits already permitted by the legislation. However, I assume&mdash;and I hope I am correct in this&mdash;that the reason for the legislation is that recruitment will not stop there. If it does stop there, I do not think it will be nearly sufficient. It was suggested on behalf of this party in the other House that a target of 2,000 should be set. I personally would have some doubts as to whether even that target would be quite sufficient. If the Minister is going to limit himself to a total of 1,000 in present-day cir cumstances that will not be sufficient.</P>
    <P>Two of the very significant figures Inentioned by the Minister in his opening remarks related to the crime detection rate. It is a deplorable situation th-at the detection rate should show a pretty sharp decline from 61 per cent to 50 per cent all-over, particularly in the Dublin area, where the detection rate is as low as 37 per cent. Those figures, without any other arguments, would immediately justify a very con.gider,able expansion in the Garda force. Certainly a detection rate of iess than 50 per cent should not be tolerated by the people. When the situation in the Dublin area is such that the detection rate is as low as 37 per cent, it will cause alarm to Members of this House and to the public at large.</P>
    <P>This month the Garda force has celebrated the 50th anniversary of its foundation. It is appropriate that a Bill of this sort, which enables us to look at the Garda force in depth, should be introduced this year, I wonder how many Members of the House will feel that at the end of 50 years the Garda force presents a happy picture to us. The overriding impression people will get is that for some time past the T)icture has been one of discontent. Different people may have different views as to why that is the picture that is shown to the public.</P>
    <P>It is relevant on this occasion to see, what views are being expressed or <Col N="465" /> have been expressed as to the condition of the Garda force and as to why it has reached that condition. I want to refer briefly to some extracts from three different newspapers which will give the House some indication of the kind of picture which is being presented of the Garda force so as the public Press are concerned. I refer first of all to a leading article in the <i>Evening Herald</i> on 29th December last. This article was dealing primarily with the remarks made by Cardinal Conway in his Christmas message but the portion relevant to this particular discussion is ithe following. In the body of the editorial it says :</P>
    <P>It does not assist the situation. when the Government appears to shrug off civil disturbance or avoid meeting challenges to our democratic institutions. The Government has a twofold duty. It must ensure the safety of the State and see to it that the crust of the volcano remains intact.</P>
    <P>The last is the reference to the crust of the volcano to which Cardinal Conway referred. In that short quotation I have given there is a matter of very considerable importance dealt with, that is the question of the security and safety of the State. There is no doubt at all, that to a very large extent, the security and safety of this State and the security and continuance of our parliamentary institugons depend and are going to depend on the Garda force in this country, on their training, expertise and their general efficiency. One of the dangers of allowing the Garda force either to become badly undermanned or to become in any way demoraused would be that we would face, all the sooner, a threat to our democratic institutions here.</P>
    <P>The second article I want to refer to is an editorial in <i>The Irish Times,</i> of Tuesday, 28th December last. There are a number of points in this article that it would be well worth while for the Members of this House to dwell on in relation to the Garda force and in relation to the administration of justice in this country. This starts off by saying :</P>
    <P>Quite apart from any potential <Col N="466" /> threat from illegal organisations, there is certainly a general lack of cohesion, and in place a definite breakdown in co-ordination between the various parts of the justice machine in the Republic. The machine has become run-down; it needs an overhaul.</P>
    <P>The next paragraph deals with general matters which I will not go into now. Further on in the article it says :</P>
    <P>It would appear, too, that there has been an abandonment of one of the essential principles of the administration of justice&mdash;that it be not only efficient, but swift and thorough. This is certainly not the case at present.</P>
    <P>It goes on to say, and this deals in particular with the Garda situation :</P>
    <P>The breakdown can be seen at various levels. At local police level there has been a failure in investigation. A list of the number of unsolved murders would come at the head. There has been an increasing number of serious cranes, short of murder, which have not been cleared up and the Garda emergency response system (999 calls) is not up to scratch. In short, many who now seek normal civil police aid do not. apparently, get it.</P>
    <P>I want to give two further short extracts from this. The next one is:</P>
    <P>At national Garda level there are several problems. There appears to be an impression among the gardai that theymust observe various undefined political considerations. There isa feeling that the heads of the force have come under heaw political pressure. This not only manifests itself in poiltical offences. but also in civil and ordinarn, criminal cases.</P>
    <P>The editorial concludes with this paragraph :</P>
    <P>The security of the State itself depends on a police and judicial machine which not only functions smoothly and swiftly, but is seen to do so. Political activists are not the only danger to the Republic. In the ordinary way of the administration <Col N="467" /> of justice, too many flaws have become apparent. A searching look at the whole machinery is one of the most urgent problems facing the Government and the people.</P>
    <P>They are comments by two separate and distinct newspapers. Both bring out the point, which we cannot afford to overlook and is one whien I endeavoured to emphasise in a debate here a short while ago, that we may very well be in a situation where the security and safety of this State is concerned and where the continuance of our svstem of parliamentary democracy is concemed.</P>
    <P>Of course, the searching kind of examination which one of those editorials sought was, at least to my mind, to a very great extent obtained some time ago when the Conroy Commission sat and presented its report. I think I am correct in saying it wa! !n January of 1970. The point I want to make at this stage is that the conclusions reached, as regards some matters anyhow, by the Conroy Commission justify the anxieties that have been expressed in the quotations which I have given. If Senators care to look it up they say, in paragraph 1266 of the Conroy Commission Report, page 214, that :</P>
    <P>We would be failing in our duty to the Minister if we did not strongly urge that an examination be carried out by appropriately qualified people, into the role, organisation and personnel policy of the force and in particular, its relationship with the Department of Justice.</P>
    <P>In the next paragraph of the Commissions Report, paragraph 1267, it goes on :</P>
    <P>For example : (a) There was evidence of an unclear definition of roles as between the Department of Justice and the Garda Síochána. Specifically, there was a vagueness, causing uncertainty and ineffectiveness, about the relationship between the Department and the Commissioner. There seemed to us to be a lack of delegation from the Department to the force. This lack of delegation permeated the force. <Col N="468" /> Authority&mdash;particularly in relation to financial resources&mdash;was not commensurate with responsibility causing an unhealthy &ldquo;them and us&rdquo; attitude. (b) There was no comprehensive planning based on research. No one was specifically charged with this function. The result was reaction to circumstances and <i>ad hoc</i> decision making. (c) There was no clear personnel policy. We found is disturbing that, in a force of this size, there was no one with specific responsibility for developing an on-going personnel policy including training and retraining.</P>
    <P>These were conclusions reached by the Conroy Commission, a very excellent Commission. I do not-think it was the present Minister but one of his preaecessors who was responsible for its establishment, but it was a very excellent Commission which did-extremely good work and reported in a very frank way to the Minister. Those are some of the comments contained in that report. They do at least give some degree of justification for the kind of anxieties which have been expressed with regard to the force.</P>
    <P>It is true to say that for all of its 50 years in existence the Garda force has proved itself to be not only loyal but efficient. It has proved itself to be a force which if it receives the encouragement it is entitled to receive, if the problems, difficulties and grievances which exist in it can be overcome, will be the kind of force that we have traditionally associated in the very name of the force&mdash;Garda Síochána. It has, regardless of politics&mdash;in fact, in spite of politics&mdash;proved itself to be a force which has been loyal not to particular political parties but loyal to the State. It is very important that should continue to be the position in the Garda force. I am saying that because I want to refer now to the other newspaper articles which I mentioned. I want to refer also to some remarks made by a former Minister for Justice giving his views with regard to the force as recently as October, 1971. I am not going to read out this article at length. It is headed &ldquo;The Garda Revolt&rdquo; and it asks: &ldquo;What made 6.500 militants decide to strike?&rdquo; There are a few <Col N="469" /> paragraphsin this article which was as a result of investigations carried out by staff men of the <i>Sunday Independent</i> and reported in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> of 10th October last.</P>
    <P>It stated :</P>
    <P>Another Garda, referring to the startling statement by the Dublin Area Committee of the GRB that &ldquo;armed men are robbing at will and holding the country to ransom&rdquo; stated that many of the young members of the force had lost their pride in the service because of this sorry situation.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We want the public to know that they are not getting value for their money from us but equally we want them to know that it is not our fault&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The real culprits are the people at the top&mdash;they are ust not allowing us to do our duty.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This article goes on with a comment presumably by the authors of the article :</P>
    <P>This raises the delicate subject of veiled political interference in Garda crime-hunting, particularly in the of the spate of armed bank robberies. Most rank-and-file gardaí are firmly convinced that such interference takes place.</P>
    <P>On the same page of the <i>Sunday Independent</i> of 10th October last there are some comments from the former Minister for Justice, Deputy Micheál Ó Móráin. This portion of the article sa in part:</P>
    <P>When Mr. Ó Móráin took over as Minister for Justice in March, 1968, he found a &ldquo;machine that was outmoded, outdated and inefficient&rdquo;. The Organisation, he said &ldquo;belonged to the horse and buggy days at every level.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He goes on :</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I immediately acceded to the Garda Representative Body's request to establish the Conroy Commission. I did this because I was utterly dissatisfied with the lack of efficiency I found in the force.&rdquo; The Commission, he said did a &ldquo;fairly good job&rdquo; but he felt its implementation was &ldquo;rather sluggish&rdquo;. &ldquo;The vital parts <Col N="470" /> in the report should have been dealt with in a very urgent way,&rdquo; he said.</P>
    <P>Later on&mdash;this is the last quotation I propose giving&mdash;he is reported, as saying :</P>
    <P>In his belief, morale in the force was now lower than ever. &ldquo;There was some excuse before Conroy, now there is no excuse.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Those are comments made by the Minister's predecessor in office.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>They are selective quotations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am prepared to read the entire article if the Minister wishes. I do not think they are in any way selective. We might as well keep the Minister right. This starts:</P>
      <P>A complete revision of the Garda code book, the 735 page volume of a Garda's do's and don'ts, was suggested by the former Minister for Justice, Mr. Micheál Ó Móráin, when we talked to him. Mr. Ó Móráin said it was a matter of urgency in the present circumstances to alter the provision in the code which enables the Garda Commissioner to fire a Garda single-handed without appeal. &ldquo;But this is only one of the alterations I would like to make,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The Conroy Commission recommended a whole series of changes which have not yet been put into effect.&rdquo; He attacked the &ldquo;rob at will&rdquo; statement from the Dublin Area Committee of the GRB.&rdquo; I am completely amazed at this queer statement and like Mr. O'Malley, I would want to know what it was all about if I were Minister&rdquo; he said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;If the men who made the statement have knowledge which could legally bring a criminal to trial, and they have failed to do this, then they themselves should be disciplined or flung out of the force.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I have read the next bit of the statement which was referring to the appointment of the Conroy Commission and his reference to the vital part of the report should have been dealt with in a very urgent way. It then states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He added that, in his personal <Col N="471" /> view, he was very dissatisfied with the present training system. &ldquo;I am appalled at the number of nuts being released to the public.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>These are some things I left out from the quotations I was giving. The quotation continues:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am amazed that so many of them are left in the force for so long. I feel that a great deal more care should be taken in selecting recruits at the application stage. After all, the longer they remain in the force, the harder they find it to adapt to another way of life. I believe the unsuitable ones should be weeded out at the Templemore stage.&rdquo; He was highly critical of the methods used to select sergeants. &ldquo;We are being very badly served by the present system,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I made some minor changes myself but I think it is still not satisfactory. I would establish a special Sergeants Corps and send them abroad for training.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Another thing which is seriously wrong with the system is of sending young rookies to the city immediately after leaving Templemore. They are often under the control of old lags who are more concerned with dodging the column than anything else. They learn all the bad habits a sergeant can teach them.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then I quoted the next bit and his belief that morale in the force was now lower than ever. &ldquo;There was some excuse before Conroy, now there is no excuse&rdquo;. It finishes:</P>
    <P>The serious under-manning in the force had created the situation where a garda, in certain parts of Dublin city at night, was as &ldquo;rare as a Red Indian on the banks of the Potomac&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>That is the entire article. I am not in any way being selective in the quotations I gave. In fact, I left out some of the bits which might cause the Minister some sore toes if they were trodden on. Those are comments by the Minister's predecessor as recently as four months ago, and quotations from an article made following an investigation <Col N="472" /> into what was described as &ldquo;The Garda Revolt&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I am not reading out these quotations for the sake of condemning the Garda force. I have the very greatest admiration for the Garda Síochána and I have never made any secret of that. I am concerned when I see this kind of picture emerging in public, when I see the kind of picture shown in the articles I have quoted&mdash;the comments by the Minister's predecessor and the two newspaper leading articles and, in addition, the section of the Conroy Commission which I quoted. On top of that we have the figures which the Minister mentioned here himself this evening with regard to the number of crimes and with regard to the decline in the detection rate.</P>
    <P>I do not believe the situation is beyond saving and I think in one way the entire relevancy of all these grievances is directly to the question of the undermanning of the Garda force. The Minister, I think, referred to the question of retirements and reduced working hours and that kind of thing. I think it is correct to say that not only have working hours in the force been reduced but that duties have been increased. On top of that you have the ordinary retirements on age grounds. You have, naturally, the question of wastage arising by deaths of members of the force and you have further the question of resignations.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether my information is entirely accurate in this, but I think I am correct in saying that if you grouped sergeants, gardaí and recruit gardaí together over the last five years the resignations were probably in the region of something over 200. But 200 is a substantial figure in relation to the total which the Minister now proposes raising. It is just one-fifth of the figure the Minister proposes increasing the force by. I think the figure was about 250. You must take into account the reduction in working hours, and that in a force of about 7,000 it would be normal at any one time to have possibly up to 400 or 500 on leave.</P>
    <P>When you deduct from the total the personnel who would be assigned barrack duties, barrack orderlies or <Col N="473" /> clerks, and when you make allowance also for the proportion which at any given time would be on rest, it would seem to me that if we are thinking in terms of a total of about 7,000 gardaí at the moment, the effective strength of the force at any given time would probably not exceed about 4,000; that is the effective strength of people who would be available for duty outside of barrack duty.</P>
    <P>If those kinds of calculations are anywhere nearly correct I think we can get some kind of idea of the immensity of the task which at present &mdash;and, I would suggest, for some time past&mdash;has been imposed on our Garda force. I attribute, rightly or wrongly, any apparent trouble and discontent in the force to the fact that the force has been undermanned, to the fact that there are additional duties to be performed and that simply there are not enough men there to do the work that has to be done in the manner that they would like to do it.</P>
    <P>What are the consequences when you have a serious degree of under-manning in the Garda? I think it was because there were not sufficient gardaí available to be called on that the British Embassy was burned. I saw, as others did, the television pictures of that event. Like everyone else in this House I deplored what happened. I saw the televised pictures of what seemed to be a mass of people. I do not know what proportion of them were actively involved in the wanton destruction of the British Embassy but it seemed quite clear to me that unfortunately the picture which went abroad was that whatever gardaí were available were not sufficiently numerous to prevent the wanton destruction which took place.</P>
    <P>All of us know the consequences to this country of that single event. We have read of the effect on tourism, the cancellation of conferences, even the cancellation of the international rugby match with Scotland. These are all attributed, if not solely certainly largely, to that event. I feel that if the Commissioner of the Garda and if the Garda administration had more forces at their command and more forces <Col N="474" /> trained in riot and mob control, that sorry spectacle could have been prevented.</P>
    <P>What are the other kinds of consequences we face if the Garda force are undermanned? For some time past I and many others in my party and in the Minister's party have been concerned by the apparently flourishing and growing state of unlawful organisations in this part of the country. The Minister seems to be taking fairly strong action at the moment and credit should be given to him for this, but a lot of water has passed under the bridge since these unlawful organisations are coming more and more on the public scene in this part of the country. I do not think that could have happened if the Garda force were of sufficient strength, or if they had the kind of training referred to in the Conroy Commission Report, that is, the policy with regard to the role and functions of the Garda and a personnel policy. If specialised training had been given to particular sections of the Garda we would not have witnessed a situation where not merely this island but our neighbouring island could be shocked and stunned by what happened in Aldershot and where a claim could be made from an illegal organisation apparently based in this city that they were taking responsibility.</P>
    <P>If the Garda force had been of sufficient strength in the past few years, we would not have witnessed the parades in para-military type uniforms, the firing of volleys at funerals, the giving of Press conferences in this city of the type which have been given. I am not blaming the Garda force nor suggesting that they sat down on the job. I would be loth to blame the Minister, as all of us are to blame to some extent. We should have insisted in time that a dramatic expansion of the Garda and the Army should have taken place.</P>
    <P>I am justified in saying that members of my party were alert to the danger possibly before others and that we made our views known and made it clear there would be no withholding of support on our part if the necessary action were taken by the Government. I am glad that action is now being <Col N="475" /> taken. What is concerned in an expansion of the Garda, though very important, is not merely the question of the prevention or detection of crime and the arrest of criminals in the ordinary sense, but we may well be concerned with the security of this State. If laws made by the Oireachtas are flouted, then parliamentary democracy is in danger and laws made by the Oireachtas may be flouted and will be flouted if we have not a sufficiently strong force of gardaí properly trained and efficient enough in the performance of their duty to ensure that the laws of the only law-making authority in this State are enforced within the State.</P>
    <P>In recent years in this part of the country there has been, as in most other countries, a considerable degree of mob action. Mob action can lead to the kind of spectacle I spoke of when speaking on the burning of the British Embassy. It can lead to other undesirable events and it has got to be firmly controlled by a Garda force of sufficient strength to be able to undertake mob control and riot control with confidence. These are the problems faced by the modern Garda force. To a large extent they are problems associated mainly with the larger urban areas and cities. Essentially, it is the kind of thing that runs right through a country both in urban and rural areas.</P>
    <P>The last thought I wish to leave with the Minister is that there should be a rethink on the part of the Department about the closing down of rural Garda barracks. I take the view and I have maintained it for a long time that it is a mistake to argue in favour of the closing of small rural Garda stations on the grounds that because there is an absence of crime in an area no Garda station is required. That is looking at the thing the wrong way around. We should rather ask ourselves the question: is it not because of the existence of the small Garda station, whether a one-man or two-man station, in a particular rural area that there has been an absence of crime in that area? In the long run I do not think we serve the interests of the people of rural Ireland well by closing these small stations on the grounds that there has not been any serious crime in the area.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="476" /> I should like to see the Department thinking again about that. The old village garda did a great deal for the people of rural Ireland. He was a person who secured the confidence of the people, who was very much in the know in the community. Because he was in the know and because he had the confidence of people in various parts of rural Ireland, the law was kept, the law was administered and there was no serious crime. We would be doing a good day's work for rural Ireland if we tried to get back to some extent to that situation.</P>
    <P>It is not the same thing to send a garda through an area on patrol on a motor cycle or a Garda squad car. That is quite impersonal. It has not got the same effect. There is no question of gathering the confidence of the people of the locality. They are unknown to the garda in the squad car. If the Minister was prepared to rethink on this question he will get the opportunity of doing so provided the Garda force are now expanded sufficiently so as to permit of the continuance of small rural Garda stations as well as providing sufficient strength in the Garda force, particularly in Dublin city, but also in a very special way in the other cities and urban areas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotHonan" hpid="Mr. Honan Mr. Honan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and go a long way with the comments of Senator O'Higgins. I have the highest regard for the Garda force. I am amazed that the Garda force, particularly in smaller urban areas and in the rural areas, are drawn almost drum tight. We have a small number of gardaí trying to do what probably three times as many did heretofore. It amazes me because, whether it is a small urban or rural area, there are recurrences of various types of crimes. It is greatly to their credit that with the small number of gardaí available for investigation and for the many other duties they have to perform, they are so successful in apprehending the people involved. In certain cases they do not get very much cooperation from the people. It is not their fault, but I should like to say that the Garda force are held in the <Col N="477" /> highest possible esteem by the general public.</P>
      <P>The question of what the size of the Garda force should be is another matter. Regarding recruitment to the Garda, I understand that the practice is to recruit gardaí at the age of 18 years. A youth of 18 years is only a boy. The training they get is of very short duration. Very often, because of pressure and because of the need to get them on to the streets and on patrol, these young gardaí are semi-trained when they leave the depot at Templemore. They are then sent to bigger depots or barracks where they are supposed to undergo training in street patrols and the various other duties carried out there. I am told that sometimes they only have six months training in Templemore before they are assigned to one of those stations. It is much too soon to send out any young lad and expect him to undertake the onerous duties the average garda has to deal with.</P>
      <P>A garda's duties requires patience, perseverence and a very cool head. If a young fellow gets himself into any hot spot, particularly where there is any rough and tumble business going on, it is quite likely that his youthfulness might overcome his sensibility. Sometimes they get involved in incidents for which they have to take the blame afterwards. I ascribe a lot of the trouble which some of these young gardaí get into to the inadequate training they receive and to their being asked at a very young age to undertake duties for which they are not fitted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should prefer to see a different system of recruitment. If it is decided to recruit them at 18 years of age they should at least be required to do one year's cadetship which would take place at the recruiting depot and that they would not be allowed out until they had finished a complete year's training. In that way they would be reasonably fitted to undertake the duties of a garda. They cannot anticipate what will happen. They just have to attend to problems as they meet them. It is asking too much to put a young man of 18 or 19 years into an <Col N="478" /> area where there is a lot of strain and tension and to expect him to behave like a man of 35 years of age.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Higgins mentioned the difficulty of having an insufficient number of gardaí for patrols and street duties. The Garda force at the moment are being used as a para-military force because of the conditions that appertain where large numbers of gardaí have to be held in a position of readiness for despatch at very short notice to restrain mob actions. In this way the beats and the small stations down the country have to be denuded to allow their complements to be brought to areas where there is greater need for them.</P>
    <P>For that reason I agree with Senator O'Higgins when he said that an increase of 600 will not be sufficient. With shorter working hours and the more onerous duties the Garda are expected to perform nowadays, they are more comparable to an army force than a police force. They often have to stand by in their hundreds to deal with situations which in my opinion should be dealt with by the military force.</P>
    <P>Riot control duties are a very dangerous task for a Garda force. They are an unarmed force and their only method of defence is their batons. I listened attentively to Senator O'Higgins when he quoted some articles from the newspapers. The people who write those articles tell us about the deficiencies that exist in the force, why there is dissatisfaction among the members and the steps that should be taken to remedy them. If a body of gardaí who are sent out on riot control use their batons when attacked by a mob, the newspapers the following day will accuse them of police brutality. If the gardaí are to do their duty they have to be allowed to control the situation in which ever way they think best. If they are subjected to an attack from a mob and they cannot restrain the mob because of their lack of numbers, surely they are entitled to defend themselves. Last year when we had a lot of mob rioting around Dublin the newspapers the following day carried headlines of police brutality.</P>
    <P>We must have confidence in the <Col N="479" /> Garda Síochána if they are to carry out their duties in a proper manner. I am satisfied that they are a most disciplined force. I have never seen a garda use more force than was necessary in the execution of his duty but we must recognise that the necessity to use extra force sometimes arises. The Garda are the only people who stand between mob law and the rule of law and order. They are there on the authority of the Oireachtas and they deserve the support of the people.</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear the Minister say that clerical duties heretofore carried out by members of the Garda will now be undertaken by clerical assistants. It is high time this was done. A great number of gardaí have been tied up with clerical duties in barracks for years. They are men who could make a very considerable contribution to law enforcement.</P>
    <P>The Bill will increase the number of men in the Garda force. Whether this increase will prove sufficient remains to be seen, but the Minister has power to make further increases if he so desires. It is most important, and it cannot be overemphasised, that the gardaí are the custodians of the peace. They are the people who will ensure that the laws passed in the Houses of the Oireachtas will be complied with and respected. The Minister should be encouraged to increase the number of men by approximately 1,000 instead of 600. The laws are being flouted daily and the authority of the Oireachtas is slowly passing away for want of a strong Garda force who will ensure the enforcement of the laws that are passed here. If we cannot ensure that the laws are strictly enforced we should not waste our time passing such laws.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBelton" hpid="Dr. Belton Dr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in general agreement with what the Minister is trying to achieve in this Bill. Like the last speaker, I wonder if the Minister is going far enough in the proposed increase in the numbers of the Garda force. In recent advertisements on television we were told that 800 new recruits are being sought. Let me pay a compliment to the Garda Síochána: nobody doubts their ability and, in <Col N="480" /> general, they are as good a police force as can be found anywhere in the world, but they are suffering at present from a lack of sufficient numbers. In my view, and the Minister adverted to this at the weekend, they have to deal with people who certain judicial officials allow out on bail and who in turn commit certain crimes while out on bail. This necessitates and creates far more work than can be handled by our present force of gardaí. Gardaí who apprehend people for the commission of crimes must find it extremely disheartening that those people are allowed out on bail on sureties which, at the present rate of inflation, are only nominal.</P>
      <P>The whole concept of bail should be approached in a different way. I do not suggest that one arm of the Legislature should be interfered with but I am sure the question of bail could be dealt with without undue interference. Bail should be related in a more realistic manner to the present value of money. Many years ago bail might have helped to stop various people from committing criminal offences. It might in effect stop various people from committing crime. The higher bail would be, surely the less chance they would have of getting that bail. It would confirm in the minds of the Garda that what they were doing was right and would allay the frustrations they experience at present in the apprehension of these criminals.</P>
      <P>Some gardaí ask: &ldquo;What is the point of catching people at present? What is the point of arraigning them in court, when they can get off so lightly and on such light bail?&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I have not gone into depth on the grievances of the gardaí. They have been aired at a meeting they held in Mitchelstown. The Minister, in his reply, might give us the reasons why it was ever necessary that a certain section of the gardaí should hold such a meeting in Mitchelstown. I do not know the reason. I should like to be told here and one of the Houses of the Oireachtas is the right place in which to give that reason.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Higgins referred also to the Minister's statement, a copy of which was circulated. He mentioned <Col N="481" /> one point with which I agree. Other people, including Senator Honan, I think, also referred to it. On page 2 it states:</P>
    <P>In addition to the recruitment of additional gardaí, female clerical assistants are being employed to do the office work now being done by gardaí, and 70 have already taken up duty.</P>
    <P>One would have thought that clerical work would have been done by people like this long ago, instead of using gardaí, who should be either out on the beat or in a patrol car, or apprehending criminals. That is the work they should have been doing rather than paper work and office work in the Garda station. This does not mean that some gardaí must not stay in the stations.</P>
    <P>I should like also to refer to another statement made by the Minister, with which I agree, and that is in regard to the equipment in patrol cars at present. It is absolutely essential that we keep the gardaí equipped with all the modern gadgets necessary to catch and apprehend criminals.</P>
    <P>I am going to make a statement that may not be to the liking of many people and it is this: if some years ago powers had been given, either to the courts or to the gardaí, for dealing with certain matters, there would not be the necessity today to employ so many gardaí and to have the furoré that is going on around the country at the moment. My own opinion is that this question was not tackled in time. Three or four years ago was the proper time to stop crime.</P>
    <P>Now I should like to advert to a few things that might not be so general. Up to recently it was stated that certain Garda stations throughout the country were to be closed. If new gardaí are to be recruited, will the Minister give us an undertaking that the stations that it had been intended to close will now remain open? I would be satisfied if he gave a general statement. It may be that in certain circumstances one or two stations may of necessity have to be closed. Surely, if we are going to recruit all the gardaí we are looking for at present, <Col N="482" /> some of the stations threatened with closure must at least be kept open.</P>
    <P>The question of siting the Garda Training Centre in Templemore is one I have been dubious about from the beginning. We had sufficient buildings throughout Ireland without erecting a new one, at State cost, in Templemore. I believe that such a building could have been found that would have served adequately the training facilities necessary for new gardaí entering the force. It was an unnecessary expense.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like to refer to my own area of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, and I am sure Senator Keery will bear me out in what I have to say. Of all the Garda stations in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, probably the only one that is fully and properly manned is Dún Laoghaire itself. The substations, such as Dalkey, Kill o' the Grange, and so on, are not properly manned at present.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of places like Dún Laoghaire is that they are being continuously built up. It will be necessary to provide these new areas with Garda stations. With the outflow of population on all sides of the city there is an urgent necessity for additional stations. I should like the Minister to comment on all of these points.</P>
    <P>I do not think this Bill which has come too late goes far enough in providing what I have suggested should be provided in it. It is a Bill, like many other Bills, that is closing the stable door after the horse has bolted. It has been delayed too long. Power should have been given to the Garda long ago to enable them to prevent crime.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NevilleKeery" hpid="Mr. Keery Mr. Keery">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keery</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join with Senators in saying a few words in support of this Bill. Certainly it is a matter of great importance that the Garda force should be strengthened. Apart from numbers and matters such as equipment and the condition of Garda stations, which have all been adequately covered in the debate, I should like to touch on some other items which would help the gardaí to perform more tolerably their extremely difficult and unenviable task&mdash;a task which in my experience they perform <Col N="483" /> with considerable efficiency and with a great deal of cheerfulness and courtesy. One of the striking facts about a policeman in our society is his value, quite apart from his day-to-day duties. In many communities he is a much respected figure; a man who, while off duty, may well be making a major contribution to the local community through his own personal interest in youth clubs and other work. This contribution to our country is acknowledged all too seldom. Often the only time people notice the gardaí is when they come in contact with them for some minor offence or other, maybe a traffic offence. It is a pity that it is that type of contact which tends to build up the most common, or the most often expressed, image of the police.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On this point of public contact with the police force I should like to stress how important it is that all our citizens should co-operate as fully as possible with the force in the important work which they are doing for the community. It may be because of our history but I very much regret at times that people are loath to refer matters of suspicion to the police or to draw the attention of the police to strange occurrences. People seem to prefer either to pass by on the other side or to have a misguided sympathy for the person to whom they would draw the attention of the police. The co-operation and interest of every citizen in the work of the police force is of very great importance. After all, prevention of crime is a major part of the duty of the police. I understand in many cases when police are investigating reports of various kinds, or if their attention is drawn to something which a citizen feels is a matter of legitimate suspicion or concern, that even if that particular call or report happens to be either a wild goose chase or something of no sinister significance, it may well lead to some criminal being captured unawares or start off a chain of detection, completely unrelated to the initial complaint, which might be of major value to the community. It is extremely important, particularly at the moment when our Garda numbers are tightly <Col N="484" /> stretched, that citizens should in this way feel that they can contribute to the maintenance of law and order and decent living conditions in our community by co-operating with the gardaí through the reporting of suspicious activities and in assisting them in any way they can in carrying out their duties.</P>
    <P>May I say in this context too, that there are other institutions in our society which can help the gardaí enormously in their work. We should not look at the work of the Garda force in isolation. For example, in some cases, if the actual procedure of a garda going about his duty is treated in isolation, particularly, say, when dealing with matters of delinquency among young people, or matters of vandalism, if the legal process is not properly handled and if a garda is not given proper support, there is always the danger that the straight forward business of a garda may well create a long-term future criminal rather than simply dealing with an immediate situation. It is extremely important that if a garda is pursuing a case, particularly where young people are concerned, that there should, wherever possible, be a full back-up from services of a probationary nature or from the State's social services because in many cases there is a social explanation for what has happened. It is important, therefore, that if there is a problem of a non-legal nature this should be dealt with when it is brought to light through some criminal activity detected and dealt with by the Garda.</P>
    <P>In the same way too, the work of the Garda would be facilitated greatly if the people responsible for the punishments meted out to criminals who are brought before our courts and sentenced as a result of Garda activity, co-operated with the Garda. It is important that inside our prisons, and particularly inside places of detention for young delinquents, that the work of the Garda in detecting criminal offences in the first instance, should not be set at naught by any system which could turn these young offenders into long-term criminals.</P>
    <P>That is why it is so important that our detention systems and our various <Col N="485" /> punishments should be primarily aimed at rehabilitating the young delinquent. Otherwise the gardaí may find that the young person who they at first detain on a relatively minor offence becomes a life-time criminal, a familiar face they find themselves chasing indefinitely. In the same way it is very important that our court procedures&mdash;this is, of course, something we have discussed on other legislation&mdash;should be speeded up and, indeed, if additional staff is required for the administration of justice on the legal side, it should be realised that this is in many ways of equal importance with the additional recruitment of gardaí.</P>
    <P>Again, if the system of administration of justice is slow and cumbersome that means that gardaí will find themselves wasting many hours sitting around in courts, waiting for their cases to be heard and, again, particularly if for whatever reason, they find that a great number of their cases are unsuccessful they tend to get very dispirited and disillusioned. That is a most unfortunate occurrence because after all it is important that anyone who is doing the sort of important work for the community that the Garda force are doing should be helped to maintain the constructive attitude towards their work with which I am sure all new recruits to the force begin.</P>
    <P>One particular danger I should like to refer to is that if at any stage&mdash;this can happen particularly in dealing with the young thugs that, alas, one can find all too frequently these days in a city like Dublin&mdash;gardaí may be tempted from time to time to take the law into their own hands because they may think that if they are attacked on some occasion their only answer is to hit back, this is a temptation that must be resisted at all costs.</P>
    <P>There have been references to the scenes outside the British Embassy recently. I do not know if the speakers who referred to that were asking for stronger action by the Garda on that occasion, but my own view is that the activity of the Garda on that occasion was quite remarkable. It was their presence in holding the line despite the odds and despite the threats from the fire bombs to themselves as much as <Col N="486" /> to the building that prevented that occasion becoming what it could have been. In addition to this most unfortunate burning, there could have been a very serious riot situation in the city which could well have escalated. I certainly would like to share in the tribute which the Minister for Justice made at that time to the gardaí who were on duty there.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I should not like my views to be misunderstood. What I said in relation to that was in no way intended to be critical of the performance of the gardaí. It was simply that in my opinion if you had a sufficient number there could be more gardaí available but I certainly do not criticise in the slightest those who were on duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NevilleKeery" hpid="Mr. Keery Mr. Keery">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keery</NameTxt>
      <P>I will let the Senator's two statements stay on the record. I do not wish to comment further on them. The point I was making was that on that occasion and, indeed, on many other occasions the gardaí showed tremendous restraint, tremendous discipline, tremendous control. That is extremely important because if at any time a garda would do something as foolish and misguided as taking the law into his own hands he would create a situation which might well lead to the undermining of the whole system of law and order and respect for the police in our society. It is on the very occasion on which that sort of thing happens that some particular person, and often those entirely in the wrong, making use of the machinery which is always there to protect the abused citizen, can set about prosecuting the garda or can set about this business of harassing the garda and raising the old immediate scare of police brutality. In this way by creating headline news they can help to undermine the reputation and image of the police force. For that reason I would like to stress the importance of the discipline and restraint of the Garda force of which we are all justly proud.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to welcome, as others have welcomed, the handing over of many of the clerical duties of the Garda force to proper clerical staff. <Col N="487" /> That should be an important easing of the burden on the ordinary patrolmen. On this point I should like to refer to another possible field of recruitment to the Garda Síochána to which I have not seen any reference and I do not know if there is any forward thinking on this particular matter: I do not think we have at the moment in Ireland any recruitment of university graduates into the police force although quite a few of our Gardaí do take university degrees through evening courses while working as members of the force. But I understand that in many other countries there is an organised pattern for the recruitment of university graduates to the police force. May I say it is not recruitment in any particularly high level or anything of that kind? In fact, university graduates who enter police forces in other countries do their stint on the beat and that is how they begin. But the idea behind the recruitment of graduates, apart from its recognition that being a policeman is in fact a vocation which one can find in people with all sorts of educational background and interest, it is also a recognition that the graduate can in his future development in the police force make a major contribution to the force if he proves to be a talented policeman by the application of the academic discipline and training which he has received during his university career. This may well be important in the future as unfortunately our criminal classes together with the general body politic seem to be getting cleverer and more sophisticated every day of the week. It is important that our gardaí should also be prepared for this and that their skills, techniques and abilities should match, step for step and, indeed, keep ahead of anything the criminal may be able to devise.</P>
    <P>I should like to stress the importance&mdash;I am speaking now without a great deal of knowledge of what is being done in our police force on this &mdash;of ensuring that our police force keep constantly abreast of all sorts of new techniques of crime prevention and detection which science may devise, which initially may be put into <Col N="488" /> use in economies more developed than ours because of the greater scientific research facilities available.</P>
    <P>Apart from scientific techniques, not so much here in Ireland as in the United States and elsewhere, police forces now seem to be paying more and more attention to the research work and study which take place in the field of social science and social studies. There are many people who, when they hear anyone talking about psychiatry, psychology or social work in connection with law and order, feel like reaching for the gun and saying this is just soft liberalism. I think that social scientists and researchers have made a major contribution to the understanding of crime and of patterns of crime, particularly in the United States where they have very serious ghetto problems. In many major cities in the United States they have had &ldquo;no-go&rdquo; areas such as we now see in the Six Counties. They have had &ldquo;no-go&rdquo; areas in the major cities of the United States for a very long time. They have a great deal of understanding of how this serious situation comes about and I think now they have a great deal of understanding of how one can prevent the creation of &ldquo;no-go&rdquo; areas in urban ghettoes.</P>
    <P>I do not know if we have anything in Dublin yet that one could rightly describe in the same way as a ghetto, but we have some very tough areas which have very severe social problems and which pose a menace to law and order in the community. I think it is the job for social research, research of the social services. Indeed, it is a question of the Garda perhaps being able to use these services and research as an ally to try to make sure that such areas do not become established as &ldquo;no-go&rdquo; areas and that, if there has been any tendency in this direction, major steps should be taken to prevent this going any further. In this respect&mdash;I am afraid I have not got the reference in front of me&mdash;but recently I think there was a study of one particularly tough area in Dublin published in the <i>Economic and Social Review</i> which is published by the Economic and Social Research Institute, <Col N="489" /> which dealt in a very enlightened way with the sort of behaviour pattern in that area. There was much there on which our police force could act and plan for the future.</P>
    <P>One of the frightening things about this study of a particularly bad and underprivileged area in Dublin city was that it read to me like a description of the sort of situation with which we are becoming only too familiar every day in Belfast, where they are in a quite different, emergency and virtually war situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">
      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill in this present crisis period. I think it is most important that the Garda force be strong enough to deal with any emergencies that may arise. I am not quite sure if the provisions that are at present being made will make it strong enough, but any measures that can be taken to strengthen the force are welcome and I am sure we shall all approve heartily of them. I should like to echo Senator Keery's plea for the building up of the technical side of the Garda force, the scientific side, by the employment of graduates. If you are going to keep abreast of the criminals you have got to have the latest know-how, you have got to have the latest expertise and you have got to have people who are capable of dealing with unusual situations and unusual problems, and I think we will need graduates in the force. These will be graduates who have been through the mill, who have trained on the beat and who have the particular technical knowledge or the particular expertise in some field or other which will make our force more efficient and more able to deal with the modern criminal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to refer to some consequences of the Conroy Report, and let us remember that the Conroy Commission sat because of pressure from the Garda themselves. This pressure was exerted mainly by the rank and file of the force. As a direct consequence of this the reforms which Conroy suggested mainly dealt with the grievances of the rank and file of the force. These reforms were welcome. They did a tremendous amount to overcome <Col N="490" /> the dissatisfaction which the younger gardaí had. I think that Conroy did a very valuable job. However, there are some problems which have resulted from that report and from the implementation of its recommendations.</P>
    <P>One problem, for example, is the problem of overtime. This is all very well, and I personally feel that the Conroy Report was quite right in saying that there should be a fixed time and beyond that time gardaí get overtime. When it comes to calculating the overtime and working out the number of hours that a particular garda has done over his normal course of duty, then applying to the Department of Justice for the extra money, then the correspondence involved, this takes up a tremendous amount of valuable working hours of, say, a superintendent in a country area. These jobs should be done by administrative staff. I have spoken to superintendents about this and they say that it takes up to two months to get these overtime claims sorted out between the particular superintendents and the Department of Justice. This means a great deal of correspondence; it means superintendents in a country area must do a great deal of work which quite obviously they should not be doing. The super-intendent's main job is to go out and ensure that law and order is being maintained and his job is not to send in overtime claim forms for members of the force and to spend up to two months corresponding with the Department of Justice.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to look into the problem of streamlining the overtime claims. I would ask him to take them out of the hands of the superintendents altogether, that is, the superintendents in the smaller areas where they do not have any clerical assistance. I think it is quite wrong that a superintendent should be doing this. The Conroy Report came about because of pressure from the younger members of the force and it reflects this very accurately : while it dealt with the problems at the bottom it did not <Col N="491" /> deal with the many problems at the top that need to be tackled.</P>
    <P>Let me try to illustrate this. I live in two places, not one. I live in Dublin some of the time and I live in East Cork the rest of the time. The area in which I live in Dublin is under the jurisdiction of the superintendent in Pearse Street. He is an ordinary superintendent with 407 men under his control. Under his control comes this Parliament building, the British Embassy, and the other Departmental buildings, the hub, really, of much of the nation's life. It is too much of a responsibility for one man and there are various ways of dealing with the problem as it stands. I have dealings with the Garda in Pearse Street through my residence in Trinity College. I have always found them extremely pleasant and efficient and ready to help and understand the problems we had in the college, but they have a big area to cover and it seems too much for one superintendent to be in charge of 407 men and be responsible for an area which comprises the most important buildings in the State. Something should be done to deal with this situation.</P>
    <P>In the other area in which I live, East Cork, the superintendent has other problems. He has a big area to cover. He has basically the problem of mobility and the problem of communications. I am pleased to see in the Minister's speech, of which I am fortunate enough to have a copy, that he speaks about the Garda Research and Planning Unit being engaged in studies designed to improve manpower utilisation and the existing arrangements for training, recruitment and promotion and also the problems of the purchase of Garda cars and special arrangements for the rapid improvement of the Garda radio and communications. There is no doubt that we need to be technically equipped in the area of communications, and as well as applying to urban areas this applies especially to the rural areas where there are large areas to cover and there must be proper radios and a proper link system with the central area.</P>
    <P>The Minister is well aware of this <Col N="492" /> particular problem and I would urge him to deal with it in one aspect by forming bigger centres and by the employment of a more mobile force operating from these larger centres. This may mean closing down some of the smaller substations. This has already been done but use may have to be made of these substations on one or two days per week and the main force will operate from the big centre with a very mobile car fleet and a good system of radio communications operating from the central spot. This is one of the key ways of utilising manpower and of getting the best coverage in a particular area.</P>
    <P>I have also heard of situations in which the Garda cars are not turned in until they have clocked up 120,000 miles. A Garda car which has clocked up 100,000 miles will not make much of an effort to check traffic or people who commit speeding offences or people who have committed a more serious crime and are intent on getting away in a modern car. If we do not change our Garda cars more often, we cannot hope to have a chance of catching the more efficient modern criminal.</P>
    <P>As the Minister is aware people tend to commit crimes nowadays by impersonating the force and we had a very spectacular one in our area in East Cork recently when a creamery lorry was stopped by supposed members of the Garda and the creamery lorry happened to be carrying a large sum of money, the takings from various farmers. The man in the lorry got out and was promptly hit over the head by the &ldquo;superintendent of the Garda&rdquo; and bundled behind a ditch, and somebody made off with the loot.</P>
    <P>In a political situation impersonation could cause all kinds of untold repercussions. It is a problem which should be brought before the Minister and the Department should bear this in mind when thinking about the tactics of the modern criminal. This backs up the case made by Senator Keery for a really expert research group inside the Garda administration to be one step ahead of the criminal in his use of technical innovations and scientific methods.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="493" /> In my experience some more imagination could be used in the decoration and fitting out of the stations in which the gardaí have to live and work and interview the public. It is common to have tintawn carpets on concrete floors, which is not a very comfortable existence. It is also common to have bare boards in the offices in which the gardaí have to interview members of the public, and this does not create a good image either. No station which I was in during recent weeks shows a sign of any taste in colour schemes, redecoration or choice of furniture. While one does not expect the interior of a station in East Cork to look like the American Embassy fitted out with plastic G.Is in the corner, a bit of taste exercised by the Board or Works or whoever redecorates and fits out the Garda stations could do a great deal for the psychological attitude not only of the members of the force but of the people who go in to check on their gun licences or interview the station superintendent in the normal course of events. I would urge that a more imaginative attitude be adopted towards doing the smaller things, because often these smaller things can make a terrific difference.</P>
    <P>I have covered most of the points that I wished to make. Basically we will have to increase the strength of our force in the urban areas where the crime is at its highest and decrease the strength in rural areas. To make up for the decrease in rural areas we must increase our mobility and we do this by improving the standard of the cars and radios, getting good cars and getting the people together in the main centres, working from the centre outwards and generally giving a good coverage.</P>
    <P>The problems in urban areas need much study. The sociological studies suggested by Senator Keery can be a great help and they can help us to understand what makes a criminal in a new housing area like Ballyfermot or what motivates someone towards crime in an older and more run-down area in the centre of the city. This will help the Garda in their detection and <Col N="494" /> should generally protect the citizens who are permanently at risk. With these suggestions I welcome this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to express my welcome and appreciation of this very useful Bill. While we can criticise it and say it is long overdue the timing is right to re-equip, re-organise and strengthen the Garda force. I do not believe it is necessary because of current affairs. We had a deplorable situation throughout the country and I disagreed with the policy of closing down stations at a time when centralisation was taking place. The Garda force are desperately overstretched. They have to control an ever-increasing toll of vandalism throughout the country.</P>
      <P>I regret I cannot agree with Senator West in saying that we should cut down on the Garda force in the rural areas and strengthen them in urban or city areas. While I appreciate that there is very extensive and highly valued property in the city, at the same time with a superintendent, sergeants and gardaí the whole area can be covered inside 15 minutes. If I may refer to my own country in Donegal we had, prior to the current events, a situation in which was nearly impossible for the members of the Garda force involved to work. We had an area from Donegal town, Ballybofey&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes. I thank the Senator. We had an area from Ballybofey, Castlefin, Convoy, Raphoe, Lifford, St. Johnstown, Carrigan to Bridge End, a distance of 60 miles, to cover and those stations closed at 6 o'clock. They had one central station and there was a notice on the station door to ring Letterkenny in the event of the gardaí being needed. This is an impossible task for the gardaí. You could drive from Buncrana right through Donegal and be undetected. I hope the new approach to the strengthening of the Garda force will alleviate the position and that we will never have a return to that situation.</P>

    <P>I also support the proposals to modernise the equipment to be used by the gardaí. Emphasis should be laid <Col N="495" /> on the type of radio equipment the gardaí will use. One of the popular things to do now is buy a transistor and get it tuned into the gardaí. The Minister and his Department should look into this aspect of the gardaí's equipment. I should like to see the Garda manpower strengthened. They should be very well equipped and paid as much as the State can afford, to make it an attractive job and encourage men to join. I hope the Minister will continue to increase the strength of the gardaí to look after the country, to prevent rather than cure. There are areas in which vandalism is practically out of control. I welcome the Bill and support it fully. I hope we will have a further improvement as the State funds can afford it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>Most of what I wished to say has been said and I have no wish to repeat it. First of all, I should like to join the other Senators in welcoming the Bill. The Minister has shown an awareness of the need to improve the force, improve the numbers first of all and the facilities they have, to bring it up to the required standards compatible with a modern police force of this day and age. To be fair to the Minister, he has inherited a legacy left by his predecessors. If there was dissatisfaction and a near revolt in the Garda Síochána some months ago it was due to the fact that some of the Minister's predecessors were unaware of the changing times and the changing needs of the Garda force. I should like to join other Senators tonight in paying him a tribute because he has taken a step in the right direction. I, too, should like to voice the view that the Minister should consider at the earliest practicable date increasing the number beyond the 400 plus 600, that is, 1,000 extra men which he visualises in the coming months. However, he may have practical difficulties in that regard. Facilities may not be there to train the men. Obviously it is no good suggesting increasing the force by another 1,000 men unless we have the necessary facilities. Perhaps the Minister would give some indication of what facilities are available, what number of men can be trained at present, what it would <Col N="496" /> require to provide extra facilities and how soon these facilities can be provided.</P>
      <P>The basic requirements for a first-class Garda force is, first, a high standard of morale. That is something that was very much under pressure in the past year or so. The Minister has taken a step in the right direction in improving the morale of the force. Secondly&mdash; something that is often forgotten&mdash;is the co-operation of the public. It is sad to read, as we do from time to time, of cases where one garda or two gardaí are endeavouring to apprehend some men for trying to break into a premises, or being mixed up in some criminal offence, while the crowd stand by doing nothing or else interfere with the gardaí in the course of their duty. If we, the people, wish to have an effective Garda force we have to play our part in making it possible for the gardaí to be effective. No two, three, four or half a dozen gardaí can hope to carry out their duties under difficult circumstances unless they have at least the moral support of whatever people may be in the vicinity. They certainly cannot do their duty if they have the active opposition of even a section of a large crowd. They must also have the support of the judiciary in dealing fairly but firmly with criminals, particularly criminals well known to them and to the public. Lastly, something which has been touched on here but is worth repeating, the Garda force must be free from political influence or political pressures of any description. They must not alone be free from it but be seen to be free from it. Like the Army the Garda force should be an attractive and rewarding career for a young man in the 18 to 27 age group. He should feel he is going into a force which offers him a future, gives him not alone reasonable material rewards but also a feeling that he is doing something for his country, that he is an important unit in our society, and that in time he will get reasonable opportunities for advancement. He must obviously have good conditions materially, a modern, well-equipped barracks with the latest facilities for the detection and suppression of crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="497" /> Again, I should like to draw the Minister's attention&mdash;it has been done on a number of occasions both in the Dáil and in the Limerick City Council &mdash;to the deplorable condition of the main barracks in Limerick city, William Street barracks. I know the Minister has acquired a new and very suitable site in Limerick city and I hope that he will not allow the present year to pass without the commencement of the building of the new barracks. The present 200-year-old rabbit warren has long outlived its usefulness, and if the Minister wants to preserve a contented Garda force in Limerick it is vital that he goes ahead without further delay with the building of a modern barracks in his native city. There is a crying need in the north side of the city of Limerick for a new Garda barracks. Again the Minister has promised to provide this facility but to date there is no sign of such a barracks.</P>
    <P>The criminal of today, as other Senators have observed, is a very sophisticated individual. In many instances he is a daring, ruthless professional, who knows what he wants and where to get it quickly and quietly. If the Garda force has to deal with such individuals they must, obviously, be adequate in strength and fully equipped for what can be a very dangerous task. I do not pretend to be an expert on the organisation of the Garda force but it strikes me that the duties, as another Senator mentioned, that devolve on a garda are in fact para-military duties. We have to decide if we want the Garda to carry out such duties. If they are to carry them out they should be properly equipped, in numbers and in modern facilities, to carry them out. If they are not to carry out those duties the Army will have to do them. We cannot leave the Garda force in the position of being called out in an emergency to deal with a riot or near riot and afterwards criticise them because they are unable to cope with the situation because of a lack of numbers or a lack of proper equipment. It is most important that the Minister and his advisers should decide as soon as possible what kind <Col N="498" /> of force is required and organise it accordingly. References have been made to the duties of Garda in the cities and rural areas.</P>

      <P>I shall not be more than a few minutes. It is quite true that we have nowadays the political or pseudo-political criminals, the individuals who take advantage of a period of political tension or emotional feeling to rob and plunder and even endanger the lives of citizens who stand in their way. We are all conversant with instances that have taken place recently, such as robbing of banks, breaking into properties, endangering places of employment, attacks on unarmed security forces. They are the type of activities I am alluding to. If the Garda have to undertake those duties in difficult conditions, in periods of high tension in the country, they will have to be properly equipped to do so. Again it raises the question of what type of force we want. If they are to undertake dangerous and difficult duties they will have to be provided with the proper equipment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder if the present centralisation of the force is the best possible way. I notice that the organisation provides for one commissioner, two deputy commissioners and two assistant commissioners. I wonder if the organisation should not be on a more regional basis with a deputy commissioner or an assistant commissioner in charge of a wide area, something on the style of army organisation in which you have the Southern Command, Western Command and so on. That may not be practical in regard to a civil force such as the Garda but we are living in very unusual times. I cannot see the times <Col N="499" /> changing in the foreseeable future. Now that we have a young and active Minister for Justice I believe we should prepare ourselves for the continuance of present conditions for some time to come. We should not expect too much from our Garda force without giving them the opportunity of dealing with those situations.</P>
    <P>I was very pleased to read in the Dáil Official Report that the Minister is encouraging the restoration of the Garda Band. He mentioned that he hopes to have it reconstituted in time for the celebrations to mark the 50th anniversary of the founding of the force. It would be a very suitable way of marking the 50th anniversary and I hope the Minister will be successful in his efforts.</P>
    <P>I should also like to pay tribute to the Garda boxing team which brought honour to the force in the past. I am sure other Senators will remember the Garda boxing team, a number of whom won international honours for this country. It is a pity that they have been disbanded. I think athletics, rowing, boxing and football, should be part and parcel of a force that offers to a young man a worthwhile career. I hope the Minister will take this matter into consideration also. Material rewards are obviously important but there are other intangible things that go with it, such as pride in membership of the Garda force and the opportunities to excel and take part in athletics. All those matters go hand in hand in having a contented force. Above all else, I think a garda would like to feel that he has the goodwill and support of the public he serves and has served so well over the past half century.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. O'Malley) Desmond J. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank Senators on all sides for the welcome they have given to the Bill. I appreciate the suggestions they have put forward for the improvement of the force which will be borne in mind and fully examined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A point that was made by many Senators related to the closing of rural Garda stations. Because of the number of Senators who mentioned the <Col N="500" /> point I should like to refer to it first. There seems to be an impression still abroad that Garda stations are in the process of being closed, that closures have recently taken place and that more closures are imminent. This is not so. Since May, 1970, the only Garda stations which have been closed are those for which arrangements to close were made in advance of May, 1970, and could not be changed when I became Minister. Since then none have been closed and I have no proposals at present to close further stations.</P>
    <P>I can see the value of a system of centralisation on the lines recommended by Senator West. He recommended the closing of rural stations and the concentration of gardaí in central areas. In a country such as this that policy can be brought so far and I think we have brought it far enough by now. That has been my view over the past 18 months or so. Except in a few isolated cases I do not think it would be wise to close any more stations and I have no present proposals in that respect. I want to make that very clear, because many people seem to be under the misapprehension that stations have closed or are about to close. That is not so. The facts are, as I have given them to the House, that only about two stations throughout the country have been closed since May, 1970.</P>
    <P>With regard to the implementation of the recommendations in the Conroy Report, I should like to make it very clear that there are only five of the 52 recommendations which have not yet been dealt with. Senators have made the suggestion that a great deal remains to be done in that regard. That is not so. I shall not go into the full details of how many of them have been fully implemented, and so on. In the Dáil Official Report, at column 1338, of volume 258, on the Second Stage of this Bill in the Dáil, it sets out everything in detail, and for that reason I shall not repeat it now.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Higgins made a point about a large number of gardaí resigning voluntarily at the present time, and that this indicates a poor morale. I want to give the figures to the House <Col N="501" /> to indicate that the very contrary is the case. In the year 1969, which would have been the pre-Conroy year&mdash;it was the year in which the Conroy Commission was sitting&mdash;there were 82 voluntary resignations of all ranks from the force. In 1971, the figure was 33&mdash;a reduction of well over 50 per cent. The fact that only 33 men voluntarily resigned out of a force of 6,560 is an indication of how attractive, in fact, conditions in the force are, and is at variance with any suggestion that there is an undue proportion of resignations. I would safely say that 33 out of 6,600 must be considerably less than 1 per cent, and must probably be the smallest of any State service, or of any similar organisation of that size. The proportion of civil servants or of soldiers who resign voluntarily would be far above that. In addition to the small number of people who are now resigning voluntarily, we have been strongly pressed in the last year by people who resigned voluntarily over the past two, three or four years to take them back. It is one of my unpleasant problems to have to resist that. It has never been the Commissioner's policy to take them back and I do not wish to interfere with it. I mention this simply as an indication of the anxiety of those who did resign over the past few years to be taken back at the moment.</P>
    <P>I am glad to be able to tell the House that the current recruiting drive seems, so far as one can judge&mdash;it is not yet completed; Friday next is the closing date&mdash;to be remarkably successful. Reports from various parts of the country are that there is a big number of applicants. It appears that we shall be able to fill all our vacancies.</P>
    <P>A number of Senators have suggested that, even though 1,000 is a big number, we really need more. I am not certain that I could accept that at all, particularly when we have not seen how the 1,000 are going to work out. Senators who made that suggestion perhaps do not consider all the possible implications. One of them is &mdash;I think it was touched on by Senator Russell&mdash;that when you are recruiting men to a permanent force, men who <Col N="502" /> will be 30, 40 or 45 years in the force, it is very bad to take in an enormous number one particular year, because there is a limit to the talent that is around in 1972. The 1973 class, as it were, and the 1971 group should get a crack at the whip too.</P>
    <P>There will be a limited number of very good people this year. If you overextend yourself completely, you will get many people who might not be of the calibre that we really want. That is one of the reasons why I extended the age limit a bit on both ends, in order to try and widen the field of selection, so that we can take the best that can be found. There is also the factor that with Templemore carrying 1,000 extra now, between last year and this year, it is at its absolute maximum. This is stretching it to the limit and that is all that can be taken.</P>
    <P>Senator Belton inquired how, if we are taking 1,000, only 800 jobs are advertised. The reply to that is that we have already got in 200 of them&mdash; 200 came in last year and an extra 800 this year. In addition to that, we will be recruiting an extra 140 or 150 to cover natural wastage, such as retirement, resignations, deaths and so on. This means that in the financial year 1972-1973 about 940 or 950 recruits will have to be found, which puts our resources to the complete limit. Even if it did not, it is the optimum number that we should seek to bring in in any one year because our quality of intake will suffer if we go beyond that.</P>
    <P>Senator Keery and other Senators made reference to the place of the policeman in the community, and it is a very valid point. I have often felt that, for one reason or another, the policeman is not as cherished in our community as he might be. Unfortunately, it has been a trait in the Irish character not to give the assistance to one's own police force that should be expected from a good citizen.</P>
    <P>The police forces of other countries tend to get assistance more readily than happens here. We have seen unpleasant aspects of this in recent years &mdash;some of which, I think, Senator Russell referred to&mdash;where gardaí are grappling with an offender whom they <Col N="503" /> have apprehended in the course of some crime, and not alone do they not get assistance from members of the public, but I regret very much to say that often they are impeded by members of the public who seek to assist the criminal. This kind of thing very often ends up in injury to the garda involved. This is deplorable and it is a tendency we should try to do everything we can to stamp out at the earliest possible moment. In order to establish and strengthen the position of the policeman in the community, particularly in regard to getting into contact with young people and possible potential offenders, what I hope to see, now that we will be recruiting extra men, is some sort of extension of our present juvenile liaison scheme&mdash;it is rather limited at the moment because of numbers&mdash;in conjunction with the Department's welfare service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an excellent scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is. An extension of it which might be good was suggested in the Dáil by Deputy Moore and by Deputy Dr. O'Connell: that is, attaching a garda full-time to a community centre in a large urban area, if we could do this. This would assist greatly in improving the relationship between ordinary members of the public and possible potential offenders and the Garda.</P>
      <P>At the moment, unfortunately, there is a certain element in the community who tend to look on the Garda only as people they come up against when they are in some trouble. They look on the Garda, therefore, in a negative rather than in a positive way. The contribution which the Garda Síochána, as well as any police force, can make to a community is a very positive one. It is not just physical prevention all the time. If we have enough men now to start working on these lines it can change, not overnight but over a reasonable period, much of what is wrong in the fundamental attitude of some people to the police in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might mention, in conjunction <Col N="504" /> with that point, that I am conscious of the necessity to try to project the image of the police here as well as possible. With that in mind I have appointed recently a PRO for the Garda who has just commenced his duties. I hope to extend that aspect of it to enable the Garda to communicate better, as it were, with the community and thereby obtain the assistance from and support of the community which they need so badly.</P>
    <P>One of the consequences of the implementation of the recommendations of the Conroy Report has given rise to some difficulties, as Senator West mentioned, that is, the question of overtime. It was recommended by Conroy but the implementation was not considered by that commission except in a very general way. Unfortunately, they did not&mdash;I suppose one could not reasonably have expected them to&mdash;consider the detailed working out of how it was to be implemented. It is understandable, because of pressures at the time, that it was implemented very quickly. It has had many teething troubles and has taken from 18 months to two years to get it sorted out. The precise form in which Conroy recommended it was not necessarily the best. There are discussions going on at the moment about amending the system. It caused trouble in the first 12 months or so while getting used to it and there were complaints about delay in payment and so on. At present there are no delays in the Department in payment and there have been no complaints in this respect over the past few months.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Higgins referred to the unfortunate affair of the British Embassy and made the point that there were insufficient gardaí there at the time. I dealt in depth with that incident at column 1013 of volume 258 of the Dáil debate on Northern Ireland on 4th February. I will not go into it in any great detail now but I should like to say that I discussed that matter in great detail with the Commissioner before, during and after the incident. He was satisfied that even if he had several hundred more men&mdash;he had many hundreds there but they were not all visible to the public; the back <Col N="505" /> of the embassy had to be guarded from large crowds as well as the front, a point which is not known to many members of the public&mdash;he doubts if in the circumstances they could have met with any greater success.</P>
    <P>He had several hundred more available to him at the time but in the exercise of his professional judgment he did not bring them in because one of the most fatal errors you could make would be to commit all your resources to the one spot when they might be needed elsewhere. In this matter I hope he will not take it amiss if I say to Senator O'Higgins and the people who make suggestions about matters such as this that both he and I are amateurs. I have found from experience that it is right not to seek to interfere with the professional judgment of the man whose profession it is to assess these matters. If I had not been involved, I might look at a television set and say &ldquo;It is a pity the Garda did not do this or that&rdquo;. The Garda are really the best judges of that themselves.</P>

      <P>I do not want to sound critical of Senator O'Higgins. In that sense I am as much an amateur about it as he is. I might avail myself of this opportunity in this House to repeat what I said in the other House with regard to the conduct of the gardaí on that occasion. It was splendid and showed the highest degree of courage in the face of a very difficult situation. One of the aspects of it that impressed me was their refusal to wear protective garments or to use implements of a certain type which they felt might aggravate the situation or cause greater damage in the long run. They <Col N="506" /> did that at personal risk to themselves. The unfortunate fact is that 34 of them were injured to one degree or another, fortunately, none of them seriously but several of them quite painfully injured and detained in hospital.</P>
      <P>It is interesting to note that when later that night, in order to clear a much smaller crowd that had gathered in another part of Merrion Square and had thrown petrol bombs at various buildings, including the National Maternity Hospital in Holles Street which was struck by a petrol bomb thrown deliberately by this particular mob, the gardaí drew their batons and charged that mob. One newspaper, the following morning carried a fairly detailed description of what was described as Garda brutality. Apparently a couple of thugs had received cut heads as a result of the baton charge. The fact that 34 members of the Garda were taken to hospital as a result of the events of that day left the same newspaper unmoved which is a bad reflection on our society.</P>
      <P>I think I have covered most of the points which have been raised. I do not wish, because of the lateness of the hour, to detain the House any longer. I thank Senators for their reception of the Bill and ask them to give it a Second Reading.</P>
