    <Title>Industrial Development Bill, 1972: Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lalor) Patrick J. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lalor)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill aims to increase the finances available to the Industrial <Col N="1056" /> Development Authority for capital purposes and it also proposes to extend certain rates remission concessions to areas which may be temporarily designated from time to time.</P>
      <P>To enable the Industrial Development Authority to discharge its capital obligations and liabilities, there is provision under the Industrial Development Act, 1969, and previous legislation, for the making of grants to the authority up to an aggregate limit of £100 million out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas. Under the same legislation, there is a limit of £100 million on the total amount of grants which can be made by the authority for industrial enterprises.</P>
      <P>Perhaps I might give a brief indication of our industrial progress in recent years. During the period from 1960 up to 31st March of this year, 668 projects were established in this country. Of these, 212 projects are Irish-owned and 456 are sponsored by overseas firms. The 668 projects represent a total investment of £221 million of which £53 million is in Irish based projects and £168 million in foreign based projects. These projects provided employment for more than 57,000 people.</P>
      <P>Of the overseas-sponsored projects established in the sixties about 40 per cent were British, 25 per cent American, 20 per cent German and 5 per cent Dutch. Others came from Italy, Canada, Denmark, Belgium, France, Austria, South Africa, Switzerland, Sweden and Finland. Almost all the new enterprises set up by external industrialists are export-oriented. They have not only provided a large proportion of the capital for expanding the industrial sector but have introduced new products, up-to-date technologies and modern managerial and marketing know-how.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Industrial Development Authority are concerned not alone with the creation of new industry but also with the provision of support for existing industry. Investment in re-equipment and modernisation by existing industry has been and will continue to be supported by re-equipment grants. In addition other measures to assist the strengthening and growth of existing <Col N="1057" /> industry under future economic conditions are being taken, such as</P>
    <P>the encouragement of research and development aimed at developing new products and processes;</P>
    <P>the provision of joint-venture opportunities for overseas investors;</P>
    <P>the licensing of new products and processes from abroad for home and overseas markets.</P>
    <P>The Industrial Development Act, 1969, assigned to the authority the additional objective of regional industrial development. The authority have established an office in each of the planning regions&mdash;except, of course, the Mid-West where the Shannon Free Airport Development Company Limited act as the agent of the authority. These regional offices, in addition to their development role, are part of the IDA's aftercare service&mdash;to help manufacturers overcome any difficulties they may encounter in the early years of operation.</P>
    <P>As has already been publicly announced in a recent preliminary statement, the authority have prepared detailed regional plans for the eight planning regions other than the Mid-West. The plans, which cover the five years from 1973 to 1977, envisage the creation of 55,000 new jobs in industry in that period. Account being taken of an estimated 17,000 redundancies during the same period, the target for the net increase in industrial employment is, therefore, 38,000 jobs.</P>
    <P>What I have said gives an outline of the scope of the important and wide-ranging activities of the Industrial Development Authority. With the increasing pace of industrial development during the 1960s and particularly in the last few years, the position has now been reached where less than £1 million remains unspent out of the £100 million provided under the 1969 and previous Acts. On the basis of approved projects for which grants have not yet been paid or where unpaid balances are outstanding, the authority's current commitments amount to £56 million. These projects cover a wide range of products including machinery, precision <Col N="1058" /> engineering, electronics and electrical equipment, textiles, leather goods, food processing, plastics, chemicals, and so on. Clearly, the authority will have to be provided with further funds if they are to continue to discharge their functions and, having regard to the rate of industrial promotion as demonstrated by the figures which I have quoted, it is proposed to increase to £200 million the aggregate amount of grants which may be made to the authority and be made by them. This figure should, I estimate, last for a period of about three years.</P>
    <P>The second aim of the Bill is to remove an anomaly which exists in relation to the application of rates relief to areas defined as designated areas under section 6 (1) of the Industrial Development Act, 1969. The three categories specified in section 6 (1) are:</P>
    <P>(a) the congested areas as defined in section 3 of the Undeveloped Areas Act, 1952;</P>
    <P>(b) an area which before the commencement of this section was declared by an order under section 3 of the Undeveloped Areas Act, 1952, to be an area to which that Act applied;</P>
    <P>(c) any area which the Minister from time to time, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, declares by order to be a designated area.</P>
    <P>Premises provided for an industrial undertaking in the first two categories I have mentioned are eligible under section 9 of the Undeveloped Areas Act, 1952, as amended by section 14 of the Undeveloped Areas (Amendment) Act, 1957, for relief from two-thirds of the rates applicable for a period not exceeding ten years. However, premises provided for an industrial undertaking in the third category are not so eligible and, as there is no reason why such premises should be at a disadvantage compared with those in the other two categories, the Bill aims to put all designated areas on an equal footing in this respect.</P>
    <P>I accordingly recommend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Col N="1059" />
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister can be assured of as warm a welcome for the Bill in this House as it received in the other House. I should like to make some comments, not with a view to changing any of the terms in the Bill or of offering any opposition to any of its clauses but in order that the House might have the opportunity to discuss, in the wider context, the general question of industrial development particularly in the regional context.</P>
      <P>The Minister's introductory speech was, possibly of necessity, quite a short one as he was dealing merely with two provisions in the Bill, both of a quite simple nature although somewhat divorced in the size of their monetary implications. It is quite obvious from his brief reference to the activities of the Industrial Development Authority over the ten years since 1960 that it has done a wonderful job of work. I think it only right that I should avail of this opportunity to pay a generous tribute to the several members of the board of the Industrial Development Authority for their success over the years.</P>
      <P>It is interesting to note that over the last 20 years, indeed one might say since the foundation of the policy of encouragement to industrial enterprises by the Undeveloped Areas Act, 1952 an enormous sum, in excess of £130 million, has been committed for industrial development throughout the country under various headings, industrial grants, encouragement of one type or another to the non-designated areas in the way of adaptation grants to small industries and so on. It is also interesting to note that up to the end of last year something approximating to only half that sum had been paid out. It is quite understandable, therefore, that the Minister should have to come to the Houses of the Oireachtas to seek sums for further development and indeed to honour the commitments made by the IDA.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister mentioned in his introductory speech that the sum now being voted should cover the IDA's requirements over the next three years. I wonder is he correct in that statement? If more than half of the additional <Col N="1060" /> sum of £56 million has to be utilised to honour existing commitments it means that there will remain a balance of £44 million for further industrial development. Having regard to the increasing pace of industrial development particularly in recent years and the rising cost of industrial development, I would be inclined to question if, indeed, the Minister is seeking sufficient funds from the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>I am aware that that is a matter that can be rectified by the Minister returning to us for further funds in the near future but I am a great believer in seeking adequate funds. In this regard the Minister might have sought greater funds having regard to the recently published plans of the Industrial Development Authority covering the years 1973 to 1977. We are not very far away from 1973 and I think the Minister should have related his request for further financial assistance to the five-year plan set out in this preliminary report of the IDA. However, the Minister may feel that he can always return to us if he wants more money and be sure of a warm welcome. That is perfectly true, assuming that the money will be available.</P>
    <P>I regret that the Minister did not give us some more information on a subject that is germane to this discussion today, that is the general question of regional industrial development. Perhaps the Minister's idea was to give us an opportunity, if we so desired, to speak on this much wider and very much more complicated subject about which numerous reports have appeared over the last ten or 12 years. For that reason I am a little disappointed that the Minister did not touch on the subject and give us some further information about the type of industry that will be set up in the growth areas such as Cork, Shannon, Ennis, Limerick, and the type of industries that the IDA hope to establish in the smaller country towns and villages.</P>
    <P>The recent report of the IDA, although it is described as a preliminary report, with a further report to follow shortly we assume, seems to depart quite dramatically from the whole concept of growth areas or poles <Col N="1061" /> of development as strongly recommended by successive reports over the past decade. In this regard I think that the Minister's Department, in the reports that have emanated from it, have strongly favoured the location of industry, particularly heavy industry, in a limited number of development or growth areas. Again I hoped that the Minister might have given us some idea of the changed thinking in his Department about the location of industry, in other words the more recent view taken by them that industrial development is better sited generally throughout the country rather than in a limited number of growth centres.</P>
    <P>From the point of view of popular support all of us in public life would agree that if successful industry can be established throughout the country in small urban or rural areas it would be far better from the point of view of social progress, but I should like to know what has prompted the Minister's Department, and certainly the IDA, to alter their views with regard to the location of industry. I believe every one of us, particularly those who come from areas outside the capital city, would welcome the widest possible diversification of industry but we would be unrealistic if we did not appreciate that not all types of industries can be located in country towns and villages however great the desire to do so. Perhaps the Minister, in his reply, would give the House some idea of the thinking behind this programme of diversification of industry.</P>
    <P>The Minister gave us some indication in his speech of the number of jobs created by the Industrial Development Authority over the last ten years and the figures he gave are certainly very impressive. I wonder if we can count on the same rate of job creation in the years ahead having regard to the enormous increase in the cost per job illustrated in the IDA report which has occurred particularly in recent years. In other words, how many extra jobs does the Minister consider will be created by this £100 million in the light of present-day circumstances? I think this is a very important point having regard to the redundancies which have occurred <Col N="1062" /> and which will continue to occur for some years to come under conditions of free trade, technological advances and changes in consumer tastes.</P>
    <P>Perhaps he would also let us know what further capital investments are likely to be required in the years ahead to make us competitive in the free trade conditions we will encounter from next January onwards. Even allowing for the fact that there is a five-year transitional period, we will be meeting greater competition from big industries outside the country. What are the capital commitments likely to be, apart altogether from the question of the amount of money required for grants&mdash;adaptation grants and other types of grants&mdash;paid by the Industrial Development Authority? I do not think we can deal with this in just one tight section and say, for instance: &ldquo;We will give the IDA £100 million and they will provide a net 38,000 additional jobs.&rdquo; That is telling only a very small portion of the story. A lot of other expenditure will be required for the necessary infrastructures for houses, for development of ports, for the development of transport, or for roads. All these will come into the picture; and when we are having regard to our likely capital commitments in the years ahead I feel they are relevant to the general question of industrial development under free trade conditions.</P>
    <P>Having regard again to the question of the change in emphasis from industries in a limited number of areas to a wider diversification, perhaps the Minister might also say if this is being influenced to any degree by our decision to join the EEC. With the wider diversification of industry will we be in a better position to compete in the export market and to compete against people exporting into our own market? If so, perhaps the Minister will spell it out in his reply.</P>
    <P>With regard to growth centres, it is interesting to note that in 1962 a report emanated from the Minister's own Department. In it was posed the question that I have just asked: &ldquo;Should grants policy encourage a wide dispersal of industry throughout the country or a concentration of industrial development <Col N="1063" /> in a number of centres selected as suitable for such development?&rdquo; This report came down very emphatically in favour of the location of industry in a limited number of growth centres. It said:</P>
    <P>The direction of industrial grants policy towards a wide dispersal of industry would not be economically justifiable in the circumstances facing us under free trade, because essential technical services would not be available in small towns. A limited range of available educational facilities would only be available. The labour force in part may have to be drawn from outside sources. Local infrastructure would have to be expanded. Transport costs could be higher. Higher carrying of stock would be necessary.</P>
    <P>In free trade conditions most firms are likely to prosper in areas where there are concentrations of industry where</P>
    <P>(a) basic services&mdash;gas, electricity, water, health, housing and educational facilities at all levels may be provided at lower economic costs.</P>
    <P>(b) Transport costs of materials and finished products can be extended, developed and improved with ease and economy.</P>
    <P>(c) Essential technical services will probably be provided by specialist firms and organisations or through joint action.</P>
    <P>(d) The location of a number of industries in the same area helps to establish an industrial tradition and create a body of skilled labour which, in turn, tends to attract further industrial development.</P>
    <P>(e) Firms in different lines of activity can cater for each other's needs and promote efficiency of all of them.</P>
    <P>The pattern of development in major industrial countries favours concentration in a number of selected centres. The impetus towards growth originated in a few &ldquo;poles of development&rdquo;. Growth forces <Col N="1064" /> radiated from these centres and encouraged growth in surrounding areas.</P>
    <P>In 1964, the Report of the Committee on Development Centres and Industrial Estates came to the following conclusion. It reads:</P>
    <P>Development centres would be effective in the promotion of industrial development and attraction of new industries would encourage the growth of existing firms.</P>
    <P>They recommended not more than six centres of development.</P>
    <P>Apparently, this was the thinking up to quite recently. Now we are going to depart from that in favour of a wider diversification of industry. This is a very welcome change but one which the Minister and his advisers ought to substantiate by facts and figures, possibly taken from other countries, having regard to the fact that we will be in an intensely competitive situation from 1973 onwards. Undoubtedly, if we are to make effective efforts to solve our emigration problems and migration problems from the west to the east, we shall have to locate big industries in growth centres.</P>
    <P>It is unrealistic to believe that the large type of industry that can compete in free trade conditions can be located in small areas. It cannot be, and it is obvious that, whether we like it or not, we shall have to regard certain areas as growth centres and as the home of the type of industry which could be both capital intensive and labour intensive. It is obvious that the whole country, outside of Dublin, could be regarded as an area for development.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister will agree with me that one obvious growth centre for development is in the Shannon-Ennis-Limerick complex. If we are to make any inroads into the tendency to migrate towards Dublin and the east, it is imperative that at least one major growth centre must be developed in the west or south-west. The obvious centre is the Limerick-Shannon-Ennis area. I should like to know what proportion of the extra £100 million would be coming <Col N="1065" /> to that important and critical area. It is critical not only for the people who live there&mdash;Limerick, Clare and North Tipperary&mdash;but also critical for the country, as a whole, if we are to redress the imbalance which has been going on now for a big number of years.</P>
    <P>Perhaps it is not possible for the Minister to indicate in round figures what proportion of these funds would be available for the south-west, but it is a very important and live issue there and the people would be greatly encouraged by any words from the Minister in regard to the Government plans for developing that Limerick-Shannon-Ennis area as a growth centre for major industrial development.</P>
    <P>When I speak of major industrial development I speak in context of ore smelters, oil refineries, petro-chemical complexes, and all types of major industrial undertakings that require deep water, and safe and level locations for industries. All these requirements exist in the Shannon estuary which, up to now, has remained completely undeveloped and, to a large extent, completely ignored by successive Governments, notwithstanding the fact that we hear from time to time of grandiose plans from other ports for spending millions of pounds to improve their own amenities. I do not blame them for that but, having regard to the existing natural amenities in the Shannon estuary, I should have thought that one of the priorities on the Government's list of developments would be the exploitation of the natural resources of the Shannon estuary at very minimal costs.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the preliminary statement of the IDA which appeared recently. This visualises the net creation of 38,000 additional jobs. I questioned if this could be done with the money now being made available. From 1961 to 1966 the total number of net extra jobs in the manufacturing industry was 18,941, and from 1966 to 1971 23,623 net jobs were created in industry. That is a total, over the ten years, of 42,564, an average of about 4,000 net extra jobs in manufacturing industry per year. It is now proposed under the IDA's five-year <Col N="1066" /> plan&mdash;1973 to 1977&mdash;to increase that to something like 7,500 jobs per year. This is a very substantial increase of some 75 per cent. Can this be done having regard to the fact that we are now well into 1972 and the five-year plan begins in 1973?</P>
    <P>It is interesting to look at the percentage of jobs, taken by the different areas or regions. In 1961 to 1966 and from 1966 to 1971 Donegal represented 3.1 per cent for the first five years and 5 per cent for the second five years. In the north-west it was 1 per cent for the first five years and 2.6 per cent for the second five years. In the west it was 4.1 per cent and 6.8 per cent respectively. In the midlands the figures were 0.4 per cent and 4.8 per cent respectively. In the south-west the figures were 16.8 per cent and 17.1 per cent respectively. The south-east figures were 9.8 per cent and 8.6 per cent. In the north-east the figures were 8.4 per cent and 11.2 per cent, and in the east, which includes Dublin, the figures were 34.2 per cent and 33.6 per cent. For the mid-west, including the area under the direction of the Shannon Free Airport Development Company, the figures were 22.2 per cent between 1961 and 1966 and 10.3 per cent between 1966 and 1971. I do not claim these figures give all the answers, but it is an indication to show that, in spite of the enormous sums spent over the past 20 years since the Undeveloped Areas Act was enacted in 1952, the majority of industrial development and industrial jobs still go to the east coast, with Dublin as the big winner. The only exception to the picture is the mid-western area, including Shannon Airport.</P>
    <P>If we are serious about redressing this imbalance between the east and west and south-west coasts, something more positive than plans, good intentions and large sums of money will be required. It is in this context that I question seriously the Government's intentions in regard to overall regional development. So far, apart from an indication of what the Government intend doing, no overall plan has appeared. There is no master plan which can be integrated into the <Col N="1067" /> evolving plans of the European Economic Community.</P>
    <P>If we are not off the mark now, while the idea of regional development is much in the minds of those connected with the EEC, we may be too late in the queue. The Government should be up and doing and bringing forward these plans for regional development. We have nine regional development areas and regional development organisations which have operated on a voluntary basis up to now, with great success so far as the mid-western regional development organisation is concerned. In other areas, there has been little or no success.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons for many thousands of people supporting our accession to the EEC was that in its evolving regional policy, which is not spelt out in legal terms yet, a great hope was held out for the development of the western and south-western areas. If we do not take advantage of that in good time, there is a grave danger we will be left where we have been for generations&mdash;on the low-back car, financially and economically.</P>
    <P>I regret we cannot carry on this discussion in the context of the Government's plans for regional development. I understand they will be made known shortly, but it is a pity that we do not know what these plans are now. I hope the Minister will give us some concrete information as to when these plans will be made known, what form they will take, and what form the overall national regional development plan will take in regard to the existing regional development organisations. Are they to be politely thanked when the plans are made known and, as has happened on numerous occasions, are those who have given their time and labour voluntarily and enthusiastically, to be thanked and then bureaucracy allowed to take over from there on?</P>
    <P>We have limited financial resources and we must ensure that we have the enthusiastic support of all the people, not just the people at the top in the Dáil and Seanad and in Government offices. We can only have that if there is close association and consultation <Col N="1068" /> with the people, particularly those who live in the remote rural areas. There must be consultation with regional development organisations; they must be brought into partnership in the Government plans, and they, in turn, must consult with the local communities. I am a great believer in local enthusiasm as an unpaid driving force. We must ensure that everybody knows what plans the Government have regarding regional policy. We must ensure that these plans are accepted enthusiastically. This is vitally necessary if we are to make a success of our regional development.</P>
    <P>I referred already to the question of new jobs and regional targets. I should like to draw the Minister's attention to the record over the past five years when 23,000 net new jobs were created. The trend is discouraging, not due to any fault of the IDA, but possibly for reasons over which they or the Government have no control. I refer again to some figures which should be illuminating. In 1967 the figure was 2,000 net new jobs in industry and manufacture. In 1968 the figure was 5,000. It went up to 9,000 in 1969. This was an encouraging trend. In 1970 it dropped to 5,000 and in 1971 it dropped to 2,000. I do not recall the forecast for the current year. Can the Minister assure us that in 1973 the target of 7,500 net new industrial jobs will be achieved in the face of these figures and in view of the downward trend over the past three years?</P>
    <P>The IDA preliminary statement notes that from 1973 onwards the south-east, north-east and the east are going to get 16,900 net new jobs and the mid-west 3,800. In the case of the mid-west, the current population of 269,000 is estimated to increase to 291,000 by 1977. That is an increase of 22,000 extra people, but the extra job provision is only 3,800. I do not know what the relevance is between these two figures. There must be a connection, and perhaps the Minister would explain it in his reply. It seems to me that the estimated creation of 3,800 net new jobs in the mid-west is not sufficient to cater for a population which is estimated to increase by 22,000 in the same period.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1069" /> I would like to avail of this opportunity to pay a generous tribute to the remarkable work of the Shannon Free Airport Development Company since its establishment. They are now using their experience and expertise to develop industries in the mid-western region. The Shannon Free Airport Development Company's success has been largely due to the independence which they have enjoyed and to the receipt of adequate funds. Will these conditions of affairs continue when the Government bring out their new regional plans? As a person who lives in that area I hope that the Minister and the Government will ensure that SFADCO will continue to enjoy that independence. Their independence and the fact that they have had access to adequate funds over the years should be an example as to how the other regions might develop. No doubt the Minister is aware that they have made a recent projection for the next five years of the sort of jobs they intend to create and the industries they intend to establish at a total cost of £16 million. Will that money be available for SFADCO to carry on their work?</P>
    <P>Another factor which I hope the Government have in mind is that the opening up of trade with Europe will remove the geographical disadvantages under which the south-west and west suffered for generations in Anglo-Irish trade conditions. I do not know whether this factor has been sufficiently taken into consideration by the Government in their plans for development, but it is obvious to anybody looking at the map that the south-west and western ports were at a disadvantage trading with English ports. That disadvantage will now disappear to a large extent in free trade conditions. We should now be talking about making capital available to assist the ports in the south-west and west and in developing the Shannon estuary as a base for heavy industry.</P>
    <P>A further development which we are awaiting, possibly with some trepidation, is the plan of the Minister for Local Government for the reorganisation of local government. Obviously, the organisation of the regional development <Col N="1070" /> organisations&mdash;county councils and city councils&mdash;will largely depend on the ideas the Minister has concerning them. These plans should have been announced in advance of this discussion on the IDA and their financial requirements. Anything to do with the regions or local authorities should be part and parcel of an overall Government plan.</P>
    <P>We are at a disadvantage in this House, as the Deputies were in the Dáil, in not being in a position to discuss generally the organisation of local bodies and how they would function in the context of EEC conditions. I want to suggest to the Minister again, having regard to a point which I possibly overemphasised, but one which I feel strongly about, the appointment of a Minister for Regional Development. There are other Ministries of far less importance than a Ministry of Regional Development. The Government should give serious consideration to the setting up of such a Ministry.</P>
    <P>In our efforts to encourage the location of industry in the south and west in undeveloped areas, perhaps too much emphasis has been put on direct subsidies to industrialists. Sometimes I wonder if the idea we have in mind of encouraging people to live and work in the south-west of Ireland would not have been better encouraged by differential taxation. Instead of the benefit going entirely to the company or the firm concerned, why not give the people living in the south and south-west, in the undeveloped areas or designated areas, some special personal tax relief. If a gesture like this were made by the Government it might have far greater impact on the individual than confining assistance only to corporations or individuals setting up industry.</P>
    <P>So far I have not seen any indication of cross-Border economic co-operation, development or integration in the Government plans. It is not too far fetched to see now that we are going to have to co-operate with our fellow-citizens in the North in developing areas like the north-west. Donegal, Leitrim and Sligo cannot be developed in a vacuum. Any development must <Col N="1071" /> envisage the development of the entire area west of the Bann and west of the Shannon. Now is the time for the Government to think and talk along these lines and to produce realistic plans envisaging cross-Border co-operation and further integration in the development of these areas. Practical gestures like this often do much more to bring about a feeling of goodwill and co-operation between North and South than many of the long-winded public speeches we hear from time to time both inside and outside the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>I should like to reiterate what I said at the start and to give this Bill a generous welcome. It is a step in the right direction. I should like to emphasise that taking this Bill on its own outside the context of a national regional development plan is just dealing with one very small facet of a very important subject. I hope the Minister will impress on the Taoiseach and his colleagues in the Government the urgent necessity of producing a national regional development plan which we can take advantage of. We will be joining the EEC in a matter of months and we should ensure that we get the necessary technical know-how in good time and not be left at the end of the queue.</P>

      <P>In common with everyone else, I should like to welcome this Bill. It is very satisfying to see that the Industrial Development Authority have spent most of their money. Usually when Government Departments or semi-State bodies are spending money we are not too pleased. In this case it is a good sign of the economy of the country that the money allocated to the authority is not sufficient and they are looking for more.</P>
      <P>The figures of jobs quoted by the Minister are impressive. Many new jobs are becoming available. We hope there will be a lot more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to take up a point made by Senator Russell, in relation to the number of new jobs created. He said that in 1969 the figure had gone down to 9,000 a year and suddenly it started to fall back. I wonder <Col N="1072" /> did he take into account the fact that external and internal causes in another part of our country may have contributed very largely to this. The fact that we were about to enter the EEC stopped a number of new industrialists from coming in here until they saw if, in fact, we were going to commit ourselves to entering the EEC. I have no doubt that now, when we are thoroughly committed to entry to the European Economic Community, there will be a great upsurge in the number of new jobs.</P>
    <P>In regard to the money being spent by the Industrial Development Authority, I wonder if it would not be better to give the new industries long-term loans at very low interest rather than subsidies. Grants are not always the answer to every problem. When it comes to getting grants from the Industrial Development Authority it may happen for some reason that there is a lapse of time between the promise of the grant and the actual receipt of it. In the meantime, the industrialist who is counting on the grant as part of his assets is left without the money and he has to get a bridging loan at a high rate of interest. He would be better to get a loan quickly at a low rate of interest. This is a personal opinion, but I have seen it borne out in practice more than once. On the other hand, a number of the smaller industries could not have got off the ground without an injection of capital. However, I am still doubtful of the long-term benefits.</P>
    <P>Senator Russell mentioned a differential tax rate for people in underdeveloped areas. This would hardly come under this Bill, because here we are dealing with finance for the IDA. Industrialists working in the west and north-west of Ireland suffer very great handicaps. Some financial assistance, other than the grants, should be considered by the Industrial Development Authority. The transport of goods, and even the cost of phone calls to Dublin, can add considerably to their expenses.</P>
    <P>Senator Russell also referred to the number of jobs in Dublin as compared with the other regions. Some industrialists cannot be induced to set up in the underdeveloped areas. They prefer <Col N="1073" /> to stay in Dublin where all the necessary services are available. Senator Russell complained about the treatment of Limerick. I should like to say that people in the midlands cast envious eyes towards the development taking place in Limerick and at the Shannon free airport. We have been campaigning for years to get an authority similar to the Shannon Free Airport Development Authority. I have spoken in this House on this very subject on a former occasion. They have the type of development that every region should have. They have a budget and financial independence and they are able to get on with their work quickly.</P>
    <P>I fear that the Small Industry Section of the Industrial Development Authority is getting bogged down in bureaucracy. When the IDA was set up it was run by civil servants. Later, people from outside the civil service were recruited and it was hoped that things would move much faster. I fear they are now settling down into a bureaucracy of their own. From my own observations, I feel they are getting too cautious with many of their projects. I am aware that they have to account to the Comptroller and Auditor General and they find it difficult to take a chance on a project. I have advocated here more than once to the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Industry and Commerce that a sum should be set aside each year which, even if it did not bring in the fruits expected from it, would not cause the Auditor General to complain too much. It is necessary sometimes to take a chance on projects. A quick injection of a few thousand pounds into a business can often make it viable, whereas when a long delay occurs either a very definite proposal has to be brought in or by that time it is no longer viable and the industry may have to close down.</P>
    <P>I have a great admiration for the people in the Industrial Development Authority. I have often been one of their strongest critics in public, in private and to the authority themselves. Under the regional development plan there are certain regions for big growth and others for smaller <Col N="1074" /> growth. I am interested in the advance factories being built at the moment by the Industrial Development Authority. I should like to know if it is the intention of the authority to direct industries into these factories. Are they being erected so that when an industrialist comes into the area a ready-made factory will be available to him? I have received conflicting answers on this one and I would like to know about it.</P>
    <P>I know that in our own town of Roscommon we are having an advance factory built and the people are very pleased about this. I am wondering what the position is: is it that the factory is there and industry will be directed to it or that when an industrialist comes along he will be told there are one, two or three locations and he can pick any one he likes.</P>
    <P>According to a Press report which I read recently, a lady industrialist in the west of Ireland could not get any help because she was not a foreigner. This is grossly untrue and it is wrong to put it in the Press because native industrialists are afforded every help and accommodation by the Industrial Development Authority and perhaps Irish industrialists get more help than the foreigner. I would like to place that on the record of the House because I do not think it is fair to the authority that such allegations should be made. Again, I welcome the Bill and I hope the Minister will be back to us next year looking for another £200 million.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlexisFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Alexis FitzGerald Mr. Alexis FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Alexis FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support this Bill's few general propositions. I was in favour originally of the establishment of the authority and anything I know about its performance, both by direct experience and study of its publications, suggests that it has thoroughly well justified itself. The idea of this type of positive industrial encouragement is a good one. However, sufficient time has now elapsed for us to try to take a view of the whole idea behind this grant-aided industrial development in order to make some assessment of the benefits which the country is gaining from <Col N="1075" /> the costs which the country has incurred.</P>
      <P>There has not been adequate information published to enable us to make that assessment. It may be that that information is not even available, but a decisive change has taken place in the climate for industrial development here with our people's decision to join the European Economic Community. Now that we have for offer what we had not for offer before, a secured large market, I think we will get a new type of rating by the industrialists of the world. I certainly think the note ought not to be struck without reservation that we are glad to hear that the Industrial Development Authority has spent £100 million or £99 million. We should also strike the note that we hope the rate of expenditure for the future will have regard to the real costs involved in that expenditure for our people and without consideration at the appropriate time&mdash;that is as from now&mdash;as to whether we cannot in any given case or in all cases from now on strike for the people better bargains with regard to the grants which are being made available.</P>
      <P>I am generally on the other side of that argument, but in this case I know the side I want to argue. The tax incentive, coupled with the market holding which we have now got, together with a variety of other factors&mdash;language facility and our proven industrial ability&mdash;make the grants now less important and, indeed, less interesting to the people for whom we have been using them hitherto as baits to come here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been in a difficult league. This is one of the reasons why we have been unable to get industries into undeveloped areas. We were jolly glad to get them into the country at all against international competition. Now increasing weight should be attached to these other factors. Serious consideration should be given in every case as to whether or not importance is really being attached to the grant by the people who are receiving it, whether there is not an element of a throw-away in it. Perhaps the use of <Col N="1076" /> the word &ldquo;grant&rdquo; itself may be unfortunate. The terms on which money is made available ought to be considered. I should like to see the authority develop more expertise on the financial side rather than on the industrial side in the future.</P>
    <P>To take a simple example, the grant is made available now in circumstances which entitle the community to get the authority to get it back if certains things, generally of an adverse nature, happen. Then the money is repayable. If any of you look at audited accounts you will find that, with regard to these grants, there is a note attached by the accountant that in certain circumstances they are repayable. Under most agreements, circumstances may still exist in which the grants may still be repayable. This lies as a contingent liability across the path of a company.</P>
    <P>We ought to consider whether or not there should not be circumstances in which the money could be repayable if something good happens and whether one should not attach to this some negative pledge element, so that the authority making available the money has at least to have its consent obtained before security is given by the borrower which will rank in priority to the public money which is made available to the company in question.</P>
    <P>Before 1963, by virtue of the Finance Act of 1924, all the moneys coming out of the Central Fund would have been given a priority over all other debts anyhow. At the moment, if these grants do become repayable in adverse circumstances, they rank equally with all other creditors and subsequent to the prior creditors that are there, by virtue of the bankruptcy law, the general law of insolvency and of course subsequent to all securities given. The authority, which hitherto has been properly concerned with trying to make available as much positive encouragement as possible, ought now to be thinking much more in terms of how much of this can we hold on to? In what form can we get it back? How can we package it, so that it will be palatable to them, acceptable by them and which will bring a return, even if it is a long-term return to the <Col N="1077" /> community, even if it is a non-interest bearing loan repayable in certain circumstances, perhaps in a suitable case with an equity conversion?</P>
    <P>I had a look at the figures the Minister has given us in his Second Reading speech. He says that during the period of ten years there were 57,000 people given employment by the authority by virtue of the projects which I gather were established with assistance of this authority. If my calculations and these figures are correct, each of these jobs has cost us £1,740 to establish. If I am correct in the assessment of the number of jobs which it will give, 55,000 over a five-year period, taking a three-year expenditure of £100 million, the cost per job will rise to £3,300.</P>
    <P>We ought to consider if we are receiving all the benefits due to us from money being made available at this cost. This is not the cost of the total investment. I am merely calculating the grant cost of establishing the employment per person. There is an additional investment cost which is not, as I see it, in these figures.</P>
    <P>The Minister said the total investment is £221 million. I cannot be correct in relating this figure to the £100 million which has almost been spent because I think that £100 million relates to a period which goes back to the initial establishment of the authority, which would have been about 1949-50. Therefore the full £100 million could not be taken. I do not know whether the £221 million includes the grant portion of the investment or whether the £221 million is the investment of funds other than the grants. Whatever way you look at it, it represents a very substantial proportion of the total cost of these projects. If it is £100 million over £221 million, it is 45 per cent of the total, which cannot be correct; if it is £100 million over £331 million, it is 31 per cent, which again cannot be incorrect. However, these figures give at least broad approximations of the sort of proportions involved. If we have done this we should be aware of the fact.</P>
    <P>There is the alternative which should be seriously considered. This is the capitalist alternative, the fixed economy method. We must see if we are reaping <Col N="1078" /> all the benefits for the people who have invested their money. I am sure it is everybody's desire that this should be the objective. It is a question of judgement whether or not one can obtain any more benefits by virtue of these agreements. For example, have we any social policy included in these grants? We have not had hitherto, as far as I know. Is there any reason why we should not include a social policy; why the grant authority ought not to concern itself to see that there are proper pension schemes in existence for these projects? If there are not, over and above, better provisions by way of redundancy, comparable, for example, of the same rank as similar redundancy schemes in certain of the continental countries with which we are now entering the Community?</P>
    <P>I do not know whether we have concerned ourselves with the structures of corporations receiving this money. I know that up to this the difficulty of the authority has been to get the people in and then having to say: &ldquo;Here is your money. On these terms you have it,&rdquo; and take no further interest, in the sense of placing no further obligation on the people receiving the money, such as referring matters to the authority. This method ought to be reconsidered, as to whether in appropriate cases the authority might not reserve the right&mdash;at least when the company gets to a certain point&mdash;to be represented on the board; whether it should not have a policy of seeing that works councils were consulted with regard to decisions. These are broad matters on which differing views are held, but they should be receiving consideration by the authority in this new climate.</P>
    <P>I know also that the authority has been scrupulously reluctant to seek information from the beneficiaries on their performance. I wonder if that policy should not be changed, because we cannot really make an assessment of the true value of the policy which is being followed unless we are able to assess fully all the benefits which are being received.</P>
    <P>With regard to the point I mentioned about negative pledges, for example, there is nothing to prevent the <Col N="1079" /> investors of the initial sum&mdash;which might in regard to the growth of inflation become a modest figure in relation to the total investment&mdash;getting for themselves, in regard to subsequent capital, preference over other creditors, including the authority, in respect of its grant.</P>
    <P>I should like to think that the authority would open a new chapter with regard to this kind of matter. One of the reasons why we have a right to think that we would have projects located here&mdash;which would not go to continental countries&mdash;is that the degree of tolerance of pollution here is probably greater for the foreseeable future than would be allowed in certain European countries. Certain industries would therefore consider establishing themselves here. We ought to have a socially conscious policy&mdash;pursued by the authority which is in the position to see that this policy is followed because it is providing the money&mdash; of ensuring that all the most modern procedures are adopted in connection with pollution, for example, in regard to amenities and the whole environmental effect of the industry. The time when you can make people agree to your proposals is when you are giving the money.</P>
    <P>It may be that in negotiations, if you particularly desire a certain project, you may not get them to wear the particular proposals. All these matters will be for negotiation. The authority, which has been thinking along particular lines up to this, and undertandably so, is in a new situation since the referendum. In that new situation there ought to be thinking now in terms of: &ldquo;How can we maximise the benefits?&rdquo; A sum of £100 million is a lot of Irish money and we are proposing to spend another £100 million of it in the next three years. Before we spend any more of it we ought to see how we can get the maximum Irish benefit from it&mdash;not merely in terms of the socially desirable objective of increasing employment but in all kinds of other ways. Can we use these grant industries as pioneers for good behaviour in the whole industrial sector, measuring that performance on all possible levels?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to speak briefly in welcoming this Bill with the other Senators. Its necessity is clear. I should like to compliment the Industrial Development Authority on its efforts to date. I am sure, as is the case with many other corporations, that the functioning of such an organisation depends largely on the managers: they were chosen wisely and they have done an excellent job.</P>
      <P>I am glad that Senator Alexis FitzGerald has outlined the position in which we find ourselves at present as being completely different from that prior to the referendum. We would be wise to consider the change which the referendum result will bring about when we enter the European Economic Community. This country will prove particularly attractive to industrialists in Europe, and, as Senator FitzGerald has said, we just do not want to hand out the money without preconditions. There are clauses, as has been pointed out, under which the money can be recovered in times of the failure of industries or for other reasons, but I think the point Senator FitzGerald made about attaching a social policy to the issuing of grants is an important one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the near future we will have to come to grips with the problem of pollution and, as Senator FitzGerald has said, when dealing with new industries the time to look into the problem of pollution is when the money is being handed over to those industries. It is interesting to note, as recorded in today's newspapers, that, in the voting in the Californian primaries, along with the political motions went a very tough condition for controlling pollution in one of the most seriously affected parts of the world even though industry in California made a tremendous effort to have this condition defeated by pointing out that there would be a loss of jobs if pollution control measures were implemented. We need to be absolutely clear that a pollution problem already exists in parts of this country. As we become more industrialised&mdash;and that is one of the aims of the IDA&mdash;this problem will increase in magnitude. We must not sit back and allow a chance such as this to pass by without referring to this problem. <Col N="1081" /> I hope the Minister and his Department will look at this problem very closely and do everything they can to solve it before it arises in so far as the establishment of new industries is concerned.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the figures set out in the first page of the Minister's statement with regard to the comparison between the Irish-owned and foreign-owned firms with which the IDA had dealings. There is a proportion of two-to-one in the number of foreign-owned firms and Irish-owned firms and, so far as investment is concerned, there is a proportion of three-to-one in favour of foreign-based projects. It is sad that more effort has not been made by the Irish people themselves to avail of the opportunities which the IDA offer. I hope that this proportion will be carefully watched by the Minister as well as by the IDA. In the EEC this country will become particularly attractive to overseas industrialists particularly in view of our proximity to the heavily-industrialised countries of western Europe with whom we will be working in partnership. It may happen that we will have to exercise some degree of control in the future. Such control may not be necessary straight away but I believe there will be a movement by industries based in the other EEC countries to establish industries here, especially when we appear to them to have achieved some sort of political stability. I hope the Industrial Development Authority will make a greater effort to entice Irish firms, Irish people and Irish expertise to avail of the grants they provide.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to deal, in his reply, with the question of possible co-operation with Northern Ireland. The Northern Ireland Government have made a strenuous effort to increase the number of their industries by attracting foreign-based firms. Has the Industrial Development Authority contact with its opposite number in the North? I am sure that such a contact would be of benefit to both parts of the country.</P>
    <P>Another question concerns the farmers who, I am glad to note, have <Col N="1082" /> already begun to receive benefits from our association with the EEC through increased cattle prices. The industries that will do particularly well in EEC conditions are those with an agricultural base. Many of our industries at present are agriculturally based. The brewing industry and the distilling industry are two examples of agriculturally-based industries. Perhaps the Minister could give us some idea of how many of the industries he referred to in his address are agriculturally based and what proportion of the money given to the IDA has been paid out to industries which have an agricultural base?</P>
    <P>I should like to refer briefly to one other industry which has created problems for this country. It has received a lot of publicity recently and I should like to ask the Minister about it. I should like to know if the Industrial Development Authority have been involved, and to what extent, with the mining industry and the industries connected with our mineral resources. There is a need for real care in developments involving overseas industry, because one wants to ensure that the benefits of such a development will accrue to the people of this country who, after all, are providing the grants in the first place. The Irish nation has only begun to realise the mineral wealth which exists in the country. I was under the impression some years ago that Ireland was very short of mineral wealth. Now we know that the opposite is true. We have examples of foreign-based industries developing our mineral resources, but most of the accruing wealth, as far as one can see, has left this country.</P>
    <P>This is a situation we should attempt to rectify and to do so speedily. I have not much sympathy with the big oil or petroleum companies when Iraq nationalises. I think it is the right thing to do. It may cause some problems for BP, Shell or other oil companies, but it is right that Iraq should get the benefits of the oil that comes from its soil. I am quite certain that Iraq and other less developed countries have been exploited up to the hilt by these big companies and <Col N="1083" /> would continue to be so unless they took drastic action. As far as our mineral industry is concerned, we should be prepared to take any drastic action necessary to ensure in regard to the wealth which belongs to this country that, while it may be developed by foreign expertise, it basically accrues to this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanKeegan" hpid="Mr. Keegan Mr. Keegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity of saying a few words on this Bill. The mere fact that the Bill has come before us is a clear indication of how important the IDA have become to the economy of this country. The fact that the Minister has found it necessary to come back to the Dáil and Seanad to seek additional capital for the IDA is an indication of the importance of the role which the IDA have played since their establishment.</P>
      <P>Although I welcome the Bill, I should like to make a few comments on the methods by which the IDA set about supporting certain industries. While every effort must be made to induce foreign industrialists to come here to establish worthwhile industries, greater efforts should be made to support long-established Irish industry which has proved its worth throughout the years by its production and by its efficiency. Many people believe this has been overlooked by members of the IDA. However, I am satisfied that in recent times there has been a great deal of new thinking by officers of the IDA&mdash;they are beginning to see the value of small Irish-based industry and the efforts made towards establishing industries and creating new jobs. The establishment of regional industrial areas has been worthwhile and has been responsible for the growth of industrial employment throughout rural Ireland. That is a trend that we all welcome very sincerely and which we hope will continue. It must continue if the various industrial regions are to survive and thus create many new jobs in rural areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as the greater Dublin area is concerned there is no need to worry. Industries appear to flourish there, because of its close proximity to Dublin port. Any further expansion in industry in Dublin will only add to the present <Col N="1084" /> chaotic traffic situation in the city, in addition to creating further threats of pollution. Many industrialists will move to rural areas if they are given encouragement and the necessary incentives.</P>
    <P>I should like to see greater efforts made by the IDA to establish industries in the midlands. I reside in the midlands and that is the most neglected region in the country as far as the creation of jobs is concerned. However, recently the IDA have embarked on a policy of constructing advance factories and this is a move in the right direction. It indicates clearly that the policy of the IDA is broadly based and that they have arrived at the conclusion that industries established in rural areas are very well worthwhile. There was a time when they would consider only major industries. For example, in County Westmeath an industry was established in a farmyard about eight years ago. Today that industry employs 160 people and there are plans for further expansion. It was established without any support from the IDA in the early stages and has now become a valuable industry in so far as our export markets are concerned. The products are exported entirely to Britain. If the foreign industrialist who established that industry had not come here with his valuable techniques and skills, County Westmeath would not have benefited from that industry. It clearly indicates the importance of the small industry and the importance of small beginnings.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the IDA, through their local county development officers, are working towards the encouragement of small industries in rural areas. If we are to achieve our targets and if we are to maintain and stabilise the population within the growth centres, we must give every assistance to the small industrialist.</P>
    <P>Greater effort must be made and greater encouragement must be given to industries based on agriculture. I have already mentioned that agriculture has already begun to reap the benefits of our entry into the EEC, but the IDA will have to work in closer co-operation with the various agricultural communities <Col N="1085" /> and establish more industry based on agriculture and on raw materials which are already available in this country. A case in point is the meat processing industry. We are able to produce beef and it is no drain whatever on the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>I would therefore appeal for all-out support for industries based on that type of agriculture, in addition to the industries which can manufacture equipment and machinery required by the farming community. Almost 85 per cent of agricultural and farm equipment is imported at present. Greater efforts could be made towards manufacturing this equipment in this country. Manufacturing this equipment here would be a step in the right direction because it is something which is needed to enable the farming community to increase their efficiency and production in an effort to export more. Exports are what we want. The Irish people gave the Government the go-ahead to go into the EEC to reap all the benefits that will be available to us when we go in. As we know, agriculture stands to gain most and therefore any industry based on agriculture will be encouraged in every way.</P>
    <P>I join with the other Senators in welcoming this Bill. I hope that the targets which are set out in the Bill are not only achieved but are exceeded.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AndyOBrien" hpid="Mr. A. O'Brien Mr. A. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>In common with those who have spoken, I join in the welcome extended generally to the Bill, and also in the tribute extended to the IDA for the part they have played in having industry established in the country and thus helping to offset the unemployment arising from less opportunity in agriculture. I hope that this Bill will afford the IDA an opportunity to extend their activities to attract more worthwhile industry to the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am disappointed that the Minister did not give any indication in his speech of the IDA's plans in the immediate future for those areas where, against the national trend, there is a continuing decline in population. I am referring to Counties Cavan, Monaghan, Longford, Westmeath, Mayo, and Donegal. These counties continually <Col N="1086" /> show decreases in population. I am convinced, and I am sure the Minister and members of the IDA are also, that concentrated effort is needed in that region of the country to arrest this decline in population.</P>
    <P>It was pointed out in the Buchanan Report that these areas have a high population under 15 years of age and over 65 and that the age group in between&mdash;the productive age group&mdash;are leaving the areas. Some of them are going to Dublin and some to the industrial cities of England. That pattern applied to the country as a whole for years. In some areas it is being arrested, somewhat slowly, apart from the areas I have referred to. It would be a good thing if the IDA were to concentrate on that in the years immediately ahead. That was the general idea in the mind of the Minister who introduced the Bill to establish the IDA. He did a good day's work for the country and the IDA have succeeded in fulfilling the hope he expressed when that Bill was being introduced.</P>
    <P>Although the decline of population remains unarrested in the areas I have referred to, there is too great a concentration of population in Dublin. We are all aware that Dublin offers advantages to industrialists but we are coming to the day when the population of Dublin will be about 30 per cent of the population of the whole country. It is my opinion, and I am sure it is the opinion of most Senators, that there is much too great a concentration of population in one city. It gives rise to all sorts of problems, some of which were referred to in the preceding speech.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the problems that confront the IDA in attracting industry to what can be described as a more remote area. The same problem confronts the British people in their efforts to attract industry to Scotland and the North of England and there is a concentration of population in Britain around London and the home counties which is parallel to the concentration of population here in Dublin and along the east coast. There are difficulties confronting people who try to check that or to stem it but I am hopeful <Col N="1087" /> that by sustained effort that tendency could be arrested and that we will have a more even distribution of opportunity in all parts of the country.</P>
    <P>I am often at a loss to understand why in this small country we refer to &ldquo;remote places&rdquo;. Some of the places in this country which are described as being remote and are being described as having little opportunity for industrial development because of transport costs and so on are less than an hour's distance by road from a seaport. It is a pity that this talk of remoteness and transport difficulties is exaggerated. There are places in this country 60 miles away from a seaport which are often described as being &ldquo;remote&rdquo;. With the development of better roads it is possible that a laden lorry from one of those ports to a factory 60 or 70 miles away from the sea, because of lesser density of traffic, can make much better time than a lorry from Dublin to a factory 15 miles away. The Department of Local Government policy of building suitable roads for the transport of traffic from those ports is welcome. It will play its part in the development of industry in the areas that have not been well catered for in the past.</P>
    <P>We regard ourselves as being one of the most patriotic races on earth, but that patriotism generally confines itself to being involved in something of a different nature and we forget that patriotism could be extended to include buying our own produce. Whether we like to admit it or not, far too many people in this country remain convinced that an Irish-made article must be inferior to an imported article. It is as necessary to educate the people to have a different approach to buying Irish-made produce as it is to induce the IDA to bring more industries into the country. Our patriotism should extend to making our contribution to providing a living for more Irishmen in their own country. Few young people in the country today are sufficiently convinced that there is a future for them in Irish industry.</P>
    <P>On Thursday of this week more than 20,000 students will sit for their leaving certificate examination. I am convinced <Col N="1088" /> that the vast majority of these students are interested in getting degrees or entering the Civil Service or a bank or some such occupation. A relatively small percentage are trained to think in terms of developing technical skill.</P>
    <P>Our grants scheme as operated at present is an inducement to head toward the universities rather than towards schools of technology. We have not yet reached the stage where we believe a highly skilled technician is just as useful a citizen and entitled to as high a place in society as a professional man. Until we make more headway and get rid of this approach we will not attract the best brains into schools of technology.</P>
    <P>It is important for the IDA to try to change the outlook of the people towards Irish industry and to try to get them to have greater confidence in our products and to insist on having Irish produce displayed in the shops. I have always been impressed by the example of a number of Germans who came here to work on a building project some years ago. They let it be known in the local shops that they expected to obtain German beer, razor blades, <i>et cetera</i> and in a short time these articles were made available to them. We do not have the same approach and our people who have, of necessity, worked abroad for years have shown little interest in asking for Irish produce in foreign cities.</P>
    <P>I hope, as we become more conscious of the part we can play in helping to provide employment for our own people at home, and as our workers attain a greater degree of expertise we will change our outlook in this regard.</P>
    <P>As has been stated by other speakers, it is necessary for industry to use agricultural produce as a raw material. This is elementary and it is not necessary for me to emphasise it. The members of the IDA are as conscious of that as anyone.</P>
    <P>In some circumstances there may be less of a future for us in industry where the big conveyor belt of mass production is the system. We should aim at producing goods where great technical skill is needed. In that way the schools of technology will play <Col N="1089" /> their part and I hope there is close liaison between the officers of the IDA and the principals of those schools. The principal of a school of technology should understand what is the policy of the IDA regarding that particular area&mdash;which industries are likely to be introduced into that area and the industries that have prospects of surviving. This will result in the talent of the pupils of the school or institute being directed, so far as possible, towards training in the technical skill or expertise which is likely to be needed in that area in three or four years time.</P>
    <P>The Irish people are intelligent and to use a common phrase they are &ldquo;hardy enough&rdquo; provided they get the expert tuition and guidance to develop the talents that are most likely to be called upon at school-leaving time.</P>
    <P>The areas which have been neglected in industrial development in the past should receive extra attention in the future. I express the hope that Government schemes will play their part in not inducing all the best brains in the country into the universities or the Civil Service but towards the schools of technology. If the IDA are to attain anything like the achievement expected, they must have the technical skills and the expertise to turn out articles of top-class quality.</P>
    <P>Taking Switzerland as an example, we remember that early in the industrial age, because they were far away from world ports, the Swiss decided that transport of vast amounts of heavy raw material into their country would result in goods being produced at prohibitive prices. They therefore directed their attention towards developing their great skills towards producing articles such as watches, clocks, barometers, and so on, which demanded a great deal of skill but relatively small amounts of raw materials. That is the kind of approach we should make towards the areas which are for one reason or another, not always with great justification, being described as remote.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and congratulate the officers of the IDA for their work. I wish them continued success and express the hope that their work in developing industry, taken in conjunction <Col N="1090" /> with a greater development in agriculture, will result in industry and agriculture playing their part in the development of a more prosperous nation. That prosperity must not be concentrated on one sector or coastline but with an even distribution of opportunity for all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelGallanagh" hpid="Mr. Gallanagh Mr. Gallanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I have just a few points to make on this Bill. I welcome it in regard to a neglected area in so far as I consider West Wicklow should have been a designated area long ago. West Wicklow has been one of the most neglected areas in this country. Under the small industries programme great development has occurred there but this was due to the energies of the local development associations. There must be a great lack of energy in local development associations in other parts of the country because the same effort is not being made. I should like to congratulate the local committees on their energy. Despite the fact that we were neglected and omitted from the designated areas for so many years we were still able to make considerable progress.</P>
      <P>I should like to refer now to section 5 of the Bill, which gives the Commissioners of Valuation the right to break up a property and put separate valuations on it where a factory may occupy part of it. I should like the Minister to ensure that when the Commissioners of Valuation are apportioning a valuation of £50 they do not end up with a total of £80. It happens that when you look to have a valuation re-apportioned you often end up with a total valuation far in excess of the original. For this reason many people are reluctant to have a valuation re-apportioned. I think these points are valid.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>One thing which occurred to me when Senator West was speaking, and which has been borne out in my own area, is the nationalisation of mines. This has been a hobby horse for the last year because of the very big strike found near Navan in County Meath. The House should know that when this area was being surveyed the people found nothing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1091" /> One of our Government bodies, when analysing water in the area, discovered minerals in the water and suggested they make a further survey of the area. If a Minister came before the Houses of the Oireachtas every year seeking a couple of million pounds for surveying I could see people saying at every church gate at every election &ldquo;Another £2 million down the spout drilling holes just to get water and nothing more&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Expertise and initiative are required to succeed. I cannot imagine a Government nationalising the mineral rights, making the surveys and borings necessary. There are a lot more failures in drilling than successes. The Government are not in a position to go into that business. There is a certain amount of jealousy because the people have found a good strike but they have spent a large amount of money in the area. The Government, while giving facilities to assist them, should ensure that our royalties would be jacked up considerably. The State would have a fair return from the mineral rights. This is the other side of the story to what Senator West has been saying on nationalisation.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Brien mentioned that Dublin was growing too fast, that it had now 30 per cent of the population of the country as a whole as a result of some of our policies. In other small countries, such as Denmark and Holland, their capital cities are roughly 25 or 30 per cent of the national population. We are not out of step with other countries. I share his view that Dublin should be much smaller and the population spread over the country.</P>
    <P>I should like to compliment Senator O'Brien on his suggestion that we should buy Irish. If we could get our people to buy Irish our industries would do very well. It is not something we could have a national policy on because if we did so other countries would object. He mentioned that people going abroad do not see our Irish products on sale. This is one year when our people could stay at home and help our hotel industry. This would also have the effect that they would not see so many foreign products and expect them to be on sale here.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1092" /> I agree with Senator O'Brien that more people need to attend the schools of technology. He made the point that some of our policies were directed towards the leaving certificate and university education. The technical field is just as important. A good job could be done by teachers and career guidance people to inform parents and children that a decision must be taken at 16 years of age whether a boy should go for an apprenticeship or continue his studies for his leaving certificate, which is only a stepping stone to the university. If a child has not got very high marks in his intermediate certificate and has a leaning towards technical work he should go to a school of technology. It may be the result of the policy of free secondary education coming in so quickly. Previously parents have said : &ldquo;If only I had the money to send Johnny to school to continue his studies to leaving certificate and then on to university.&rdquo; Now, as a result of our Government policy, they have got the opportunity. With the amount of schools and career guidance people in most areas now the trend will be for people to go to technical schools where there is a big future.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill. The Minister has given us good information, particularly in the third paragraph. I suppose the Opposition want to keep it under cover. They do not want to let us know about this. There have been 668 projects started since 1960 providing 57,000 jobs. That is some achievement over a period of ten years. The IDA have provided grants, incentives, the necessary encouragement and advice.</P>

      <P>The Minister has outlined what has happened. The Opposition will often say that Irish people cannot get those grants. They certainly can and as many Irish people get the grants as foreigners. More power to the foreigner if he gets a grant. It is quite easy to produce the article. There is a different story in selling it. That was one of the main reasons for the arguments put forward at the referendum. If we did not go into the EEC we would have the products, but we could not sell them. The people of Ireland realised that. I would certainly welcome any foreign industrialist coming in, setting up a factory and giving employment.</P>
      <P>The IDA are to be complimented. This money gives them the go ahead. They intend providing 55,000 new jobs in the next five years. They realise there will be a loss of 17,000 jobs because of changes, but the target of 55,000 was well calculated and one which will be achieved in the next five years. The provision of extra employment is appreciated by us all. Employment is an important aspect. With Dublin not getting the grants to the same extent, or practically none at all, those 57,000 jobs will be provided in the country. Most towns under a development officer are working on the basis that they have sites for development.</P>
      <P>There is a site in nearly every town and village. If the local authority do not own it, at least they have an agreement with people who will sell them the site at a reasonable price. It is the type of work which does not get the headlines because when an industrialist comes he wants to see a site, he does not want to hit the headlines. Very often towns do not even know that they have two or three industrialists every week to see sites, because industrialists, like everybody else, like to shop around and see which is the best place to go.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the food processing industry. That is one which is going through a bit of trouble at present. The work period is from July, when the fruit comes in, right on to October or November. You only get the produce once a year and you have to keep your stocks right for a whole <Col N="1094" /> year, so that you will be able to be in a position to sell to your customer. It presents a capital problem for any factory in the food processing business. I am thinking of fruit and vegetables. If the IDA or some Government-sponsored body could provide some facilities, it would help our food processing plants who have to carry very high stocks for such long periods. At the moment they must try to anticipate the market for a whole 12 months ahead. In the dairying industry, for instance, a creamery supplies the produce within a period of seven to 14 days and they are paid for it. It would be very easy for the food processing industries if something like that could happen. I do not know if it is possible. It is just an idea. It is a big headache to those firms to have their stocks for the whole time. If the IDA do as much good for the country with this money as they have done with the last £100,000,000 I would say &ldquo;more power to them&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lalor)</NameTxt>
      <P>One could anticipate that a Bill of this nature was bound to be welcomed in the Seanad, but what particularly struck me was the general overall commendation which the Industrial Development Authority received from all sides of the House. I should say, as the Minister responsible for the operations of the Industrial Development Authority, that it is natural that anything said about the authority or the personnel is something that particularly interests me. It was of considerable satisfaction to hear the Senator's commendation of the authority and these remarks were fully merited. Senator Russell, on behalf of his party, said the IDA had done a wonderful job. Later on he congratulated the people in the SFADCO group. This generous tribute should be fully recorded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the debate progressed there were criticisms of, not so much the operation of the IDA, but the manner in which, in some instances, they approached problems. I was, however, pleased that Senator Farrell took the opportunity in this debate to refute the allegation, very often unjustifiably levelled at the Industrial Development <Col N="1095" /> Authority, that any foreign industrialist or <i>entrepreneur</i> will receive far better treatment than an Irish potential industrialist. Since I became Minister for Industry and Commerce I have paid particular attention to this point because, as a rural representative, it was an allegation which I heard too often. The Industrial Development Authority are more anxious to assist a potential Irish industrialist than anyone else.</P>
    <P>Senator Gallanagh spoke on a subject which is very often the hobbyhorse of the public representative, no matter what area he represents, and that is the problem of trying to get a specific area, within a county or a district, designated as an undeveloped area. Senator Gallanagh took the opportunity of complaining, on the one hand, and answering his complaint, on the other. He felt for a long time that West Wicklow had been neglected because it had not been designated an undeveloped area.</P>
    <P>The Senator went on to say that, due to the tremendous activity of the West Wicklow Development Association, they had resolved the problem and succeeded in introducing quite an amount of industry into that area. I had the pleasure last year of opening a West Wicklow industrial exhibition in Baltinglass, in conjunction with the ESB. I was amazed at the volume of small industrial development which had taken place in the West Wicklow region. This proved that an active development association, using the facilities which are available through the Industrial Development Authority, can generate quite an amount of industrial development.</P>
    <P>I join with Senator Gallanagh in complimenting the West Wicklow group and the many other local committees which are continuously striving to attract industry into their own areas. The inauguration of the regional development offices has helped to further stimulate and develop local interest. With the emergence of the regional industrial plans during the course of the next few months, following on the preliminary survey, which each Member of this House has access to, the Industrial Development Authority will <Col N="1096" /> have no trouble in achieving the targets which have been set out in their preliminary statement and the targets indicated in the White Paper issued prior to the referendum for entry into the EEC.</P>
    <P>Senator Russell wondered if I was looking for sufficient money when I asked the House to agree to the provision of an additional £100 million for the IDA. With the programme which the IDA had before it, he felt the amount being provided for might be inadequate. In replying to Senator Russell I should like to associate my remarks with those of Senator Alexis FitzGerald on this particular point, in so far as he suggested that the Industrial Development Authority should now be looking at grant allocations and querying the necessity for the provision of, perhaps, sizeable grants as against the various other attractions such as the accessibility to the other nine EEC countries and the provision of the tax free incentives.</P>
    <P>The provision in the Estimates this year for the Industrial Development Authority is £30 million, taking a round figure; taking the normal run of increase, one would assume that the £100 million being provided will cover a period of three years. This is the basis on which I made my introductory statement. On the other hand, the Industrial Development Authority expect more overseas industries to be set up here. That is why the Minister for Foreign Affairs laid such emphasis in the negotiations for entry into the EEC to hold on to the attraction of the tax free holiday incentive as far as this country is concerned. It was felt that because this was such an important factor it should be specifically negotiated for during the course of the negotiations.</P>
    <P>We must also bear in mind the fact that we are committed to the spending of £56 million arising from the commitments already in hand. We can logically assume that that amount of money will not necessarily have to be paid out within the next 12 months as some of the projects take some time to finalise. Of the £30 million which may be allocated by the Industrial Development Authority during the <Col N="1097" /> present financial year it is quite likely that only a very small proportion may be required to be paid out before 6th April, 1973. I would assume that out of the £30 million provided in the Estimates this year for the IDA probably £23 million or £24 million is committed to be paid out to new industrial development, in re-equipment grants and in small industrial grants. The need to pay small industrial grants develops within a much shorter period than in the bigger new industries.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that one could come to this House and look for an additional £200 million instead of £100 million, but I think it would be wrong for me, as Minister for Industry and Commerce, to come in here seeking an additional £200 million to cover the full span of the 1973-1977 projected plan of the Industrial Development Authority because I believe it to be of advantage to the Oireachtas to have the opportunity, midway through the operation of the IDA regional industrial development plan, of reviewing the progress or lack of progress in achieving the target. This is why I prefer, in looking for moneys for the IDA or Córas Tráchtála, to seek smaller sums for shorter terms. I believe the House should have the opportunity of commenting on the progress or of criticising the lack of progress of the organisation at the end of that period. It is a good thing to keep those organisations on their toes. We can do so by ensuring that a report has to be made on their behalf by the Minister to the Oireachtas whenever further financial assistance is sought by them.</P>
    <P>Senator Russell said, in relation to my introductory remarks, that he was disappointed that I had not more to say about regional development. I had this same criticism in the Dáil and I mentioned the fact that the preliminary report by the IDA will be followed in July by the comprehensive regional plans. This document will provide the overall information regarding regional plans for the future. Senator Russell also inquired about what type of industries the IDA considered to have the best future. I have already indicated those industries in the Dáil. Future <Col N="1098" /> industrial promotion by the IDA will be aimed at endeavouring to attract certain types of industries across a wide range, but with specific reference to the food industry, engineering and metal goods, instrumentation, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, leisure goods and certain textile goods. That is where the IDA see the greatest opportunities in the immediate future.</P>
    <P>Arising from Senator Russell's criticism of the spreading out of the proposed development, I wish to say quite clearly that 50 per cent of the overall industrial development envisaged in the IDA plans will be in the major centres, which was an area of development seen by the Government ten years ago. I want to say quite categorically, in relation to this criticism of Government change, that the Government clearly indicated their views over two years ago when they issued a statement on 19th May, 1969, through the Government Information Bureau, which said that arising from the regional studies of Ireland which had taken place and which had been reported on previously, the Government wished to provide more favourable conditions for new and expanding industry and to attract additional industry. It went on to say that it was also an objective to check the tendency towards unbalanced regional development by creating conditions in which a more dispersed geographical distribution of activities would be achieved.</P>
    <P>As far back as May, 1969, the Government spelt out that change. That announcement then went on to deal with the creation of the nine new industrial planning regions. It indicated that there were eight new regions as well as the Shannon region, now known as the mid-western region. It indicated that the object of that exercise was to study the situation in each region in order to evolve an industrial regional development plan. This was visualised to be associated with the necessity for having a regional industrial development plan in relation to our entry into the EEC.</P>
    <P>Senator Russell spoke about the fact that there are no regional development plans on the eve of our entry into the EEC. This is a wrong <Col N="1099" /> assumption. We have plans and they will be circulated and given wide publicity during the course of the next six weeks. They are plans that have been looked into in great detail and they have been worked out in conjunction with the local authorities. Another point raised by Senator Russell was that he felt that the local regional development committees may be done away with when the plans are published.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>No, what I asked was whether co-operation with the regional development committees would continue once the overall plan was published.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes. There is no question but that co-operation with the regions will be continued. Arising from the Government statement of 4th May, when the overall announcement was being made regarding the review of regional policy, it was explained in the last paragraph of that statement from the Government Information Bureau that the Government considered that the regional development organisations established were performing a useful role which should be developed further and that they should accordingly continue to receive assistance and support. This does not imply any departure from the intention of preserving the county as the basic local government unit. Further consideration will be given to the possibility of increasing harmonisation of regional systems which have grown up for different purposes. That categorical statement from the Government answers the Senator's point on that issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Senator need not have any worries at all about the relationship between the Industrial Development Authority and SFADCO. There is no doubt that SFADCO will get enough money to carry on. I was rather surprised to hear the Senator talk about <Col N="1100" /> the feeling that the Shannon-Ennis-Limerick area was in any way neglected.</P>
    <P>Senator Farrell expressed the views of a number of people interested in industry when she said that most of the people in other regions continually ask to know how could they get an operation going such as exists in the mid-west region. This is fair comment.</P>
    <P>Senator Russell also stressed the necessity for a Minister for Regional Development. The Government are satisfied that existing arrangements for dealing with the matter are adequate and have no plans to set up a new ministry for the regional development of industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I was quite interested in the contribution made by Senator Mrs. Farrell and in her suggestion for long-term, low interest loans rather than grants. This smacks of the normal run of agricultural requests for cheap money rather than grants. I have been checking the terms of the legislation under which the IDA are operating. The situation is that the IDA are empowered to subsidise interest rates on loans and not specifically to give loans. It is a way of conserving money and ties in with what Senator Alexis FitzGerald said in this regard about making money go further. The Senator did qualify her contribution about preferential income tax treatment for industrial development in the west of Ireland as being possibly one of the measures that could not come within the ambit of this Bill. She is right in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1101" /> I propose to discuss with the members of the board of the IDA the question of long-term, low interest rate loans rather than grants. They might prove a sufficient or a necessary incentive. Certainly, from the point of view of developing small industries, it merits consideration. I shall be discussing this question in conjunction with the possibility raised by Senator Alexis FitzGerald, of being able to have grants allocated and to have a certain tie-in arrangement. The Senator drew attention to the fact that the IDA are now inserting a protective element into their grants arrangement, so that their investment even if the project fails is protected. The Senator mentioned the possibility of building in another sort of safeguard, so that if the project is extremely successful the grant could be paid back. This ties in, to a certain extent, with a type of long-term, low interest loan. I have made note of both suggestions with a view to discussing the matter further with the IDA.</P>
    <P>I am afraid I must disagree with Senator Farrell in suggesting the setting up of a sort of &ldquo;poker fund&rdquo;. She did not mention &ldquo;poker fund&rdquo; but spoke of a certain little sum of money that might be left aside, to which the Comptroller and Auditor General might turn a blind eye, and which could be used by the IDA for the promotion of what she meant might be &ldquo;chancy&rdquo; industries. I could not possibly accept this, no matter how meritorious the suggestion might be. Senator Farrell might be happy enough if 50 per cent of the projects that would be mooted under this heading proved satisfactory. However, I am afraid that it would be far too dangerous a precedent to allow money to be gambled in this way.</P>
    <P>There is a sizeable number of inquiries coming in and it is not as necessary for the Industrial Development Authority to take chances now as it was previously. As Minister, I find that the 1 per cent or 2 per cent failures that the IDA might have in connection with their promotions are always exaggerated and blown up to appear to be about six or seven times greater than they actually are. Therefore, <Col N="1102" /> I do not think that I should encourage the setting up of a fund for gambling, as it were, on industrial development.</P>
    <P>Senator Farrell also asked a question about advance factories. Will the IDA try to direct industries into those factories? The answer is &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; positively. The object of setting up those factories in various areas was, first of all, to try to attract industry. I am afraid I would be finding serious fault with the Industrial Development Authority if they looked upon that as the creation of empty shells. It is up to the local organisation to see what can be done to attract an industry there. Any local industrial development association can help towards attracting an industry into those advance factories, but the advance factory is there as an attraction or an inducement to an industrialist to come. Certainly, the purpose behind the advance factories is to try and get industries into them as soon as possible. Having spent capital on the provision of those advance factories, we do not want to have them lying idle. I do not know how anybody could be guilty of saying to Senator Farrell that the advance factory is like a beehive waiting for the swarm to come.</P>
    <P>Senator Alexis FitzGerald was conscious of the fact that grants need not be as attractive as they were previously. The experience of the IDA is that they seldom allocate to an industrialist the maximum grant which is allowed under the Act. As I stated in my opening speech, the vast majority of the industries which have been provided over the past ten years are export-orientated. The IDA are endeavouring to stretch the £99 million which they have already paid to the maximum effect. They have found in recent times that it is not necessary to allocate the maximum amount of grant which is statutorily allowed in order to attract those industries. From the IDA's point of view the object is to try to get the industry going as cheaply as possible.</P>
    <P>In reply to Senator West, I would like to say that the IDA are aware of the necessity to ensure that the industrialist <Col N="1103" /> is conscious of the dangers of pollution. Any proposal which may generate a pollution problem is checked out with the planning section of the Department of Local Government. There is liaison between the IDA and the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards in relation to the effects of pollution.</P>
    <P>Senators drew attention to the three to one foreign/local investment ratio, and the two to one foreign-backed/ Irish-backed projects ratio. I join with Senator Crinion here in saying that the object of the exercise is to generate employment in the manufacture of items which are export-orientated.</P>
    <P>One of the attractions of the EEC is that we can provide sites for potential foreign industrialists to come in here and create much needed employment here. At the same time every effort should be made to try to encourage the Irish <i>entrepreneur</i> to spend more money and to continue to develop. We are conscious of the fact that, if we were to rely totally on the Irish <i>entrepreneur</i>, we would not be able to achieve the job target the IDA hope to achieve or to generate sufficient new jobs to get over the problem Senator O'Brien referred to&mdash;trying to ensure that we do away with involuntary emigration.</P>

      <P>I wonder would the Minister make it clear to Senator West and his long-haired friends that IDA grants are not payable to mining companies?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am getting at that. Senator Crinion spoke on that also. That quotation came from the Senator himself. The position is that mining companies have never been given a grant by the IDA. At the present time mining does not come under the manufacturing heading. So much has been said about mining in recent times that to complicate this provision here by bringing mining into it is unwarranted. The IDA have allocated no money to the mining industry as such and I do not think that we have any complications from that point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator West drew a comparison between a situation in the Far East <Col N="1104" /> and here. He talked about justification in the Far East arising from a history of exploitation. Irrespective of what has been said by so many people in connection with mining here, one thing that has not been established is that we &mdash;the people of this country&mdash;have been exploited. I have endeavoured on a number of occasions in the Dáil, in reply to parliamentary questions, to get across a point which obviously Senator Crinion fully comprehends in in relation to further mining development here that no lease has been given and negotiations with regard to royalties are in-built in the negotiations of the lease. As far as the people of the country are concerned their interests are being looked after in this regard. There is no question of anybody having sold out anything to anybody.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a completely different matter. I will be dealing with that on another occasion. It does not come under this legislation. Arising from Senator Russell's contribution about the mid-west and Shannon area, it was interesting that Senator Keegan and Senator Farrell should specifically spell out the fact that they are from the midland area and the midland area had been neglected.</P>
      <P>Senator Farrell mentioned this. She stated &ldquo;I am not talking about the real west, but about the midland area&rdquo;. My reply to that is making the fullest use of the facilities of the IDA does prove fruitful. People now realise at local level that if they tackle the job of endeavouring to attract an industry and stop shouting &ldquo;When are the Government going to supply it to us&rdquo;, this will prove fruitful. Local authorities and the various county development teams are working with their local regional officers in line with the overall preliminary statement and in line with the plan which the IDA have outlined. All this will prove fruitful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think I have covered the various questions raised. I have no ready answer to Senator Crinion's worry relating <Col N="1105" /> to the problem of carrying food stocks in the food processing industry. It does not come under a grant heading. It is really a question of capitalisation and of being able to carry stock from one season to another as apart from a different type of manufacturing process where the raw material is not coming in regularly. I am thinking now of the fruit and vegetable industry. I have noted this and will look into it.</P>
    <P>The discussion on the Second Reading has been very helpful and constructive. Arising out of the overwhelming acceptance by the people of the recommendation made to them to join the EEC, I am happy to be in a position to report to the House that since the 11th May, there have been 600 inquiries received by the IDA from their offices abroad. That is a significant figure.</P>
    <P>Immediately after the referendum, in which the people voted to join the EEC, the IDA advertised the attractions of our country in a number of foreign newspapers. One must assume that not all of the 600 inquiries will come to fruition, but it is significant that since then, 600 genuine inquiries have been reported to IDA House from their officers overseas. This is an indication of the interest being taken and perhaps it will not be three years before the Minister for Industry and Commerce finds it necessary to come back to this House for more money.</P>

    <Title>Restrictive Practices Bill, 1971: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lalor) Patrick J. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lalor)</NameTxt>
      <P>For centuries past, actions in restraint of trade have been contrary to the principles of common law, and from time to time this position has been reinforced by specialised legislation of very limited application. Comprehensive modern legislation to promote free and fair competition can be said to have begun in this country with the enactment of the Restrictive Trade Practices Act, 1953, which set up the Fair Trade Commission with power to inquire into the conditions which obtain in regard to the supply and distribution of any kind of goods. This Act was amended in 1959 to extend somewhat its scope to permit of more specific inquiries than were possible under the Principal Act, and to provide for special reviews of orders made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce and confirmed by the Oireachtas. The legislation has been very effective in achieving the purposes for which it was designed but after 19 years of operation I feel that it can be improved and extended to make it more effective in present-day conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill before the House, which consolidates the Acts of 1953 and 1959 to which I have referred, contains two major new provisions. Services, including professional services, are brought within its scope, and secondly, the investigatory work hitherto performed by the Fair Trade Commission will be carried out by a new officer described as the Examiner of Restrictive Practices. The feeling has been growing among those who are concerned with <Col N="1107" /> the efficiency of our economic operations that the promotion of competition should extend beyond the distribution of goods and that it was important that the provision of services should reflect the benefits of competition in the prices charged to consumers who may be industrial or commercial enterprises or the man in the street.</P>
    <P>A specific recommendation to this effect was, in particular, made by the National Industrial Economic Council in 1967. The transfer of investigatory functions to the examiner will leave the commission free to concentrate on the task of conducting public inquiries and furnishing their reports to the Minister for Industry and Commerce. This will result in inquiries being completed more speedily than at present, a factor that will become increasingly important now that the scope of the legislation is being widened. The division of functions between the commission and the examiner is also designed to remove any feeling that the commission, because it has both investigatory and adjudicatory functions under the present legislation, may not approach inquiries in a completely detached and impartial manner.</P>
    <P>The Restrictive Trade Practices Acts, 1953 and 1959, provided for the setting up of the Fair Trade Commission, which is continued in being by section 2 of the Bill, under a new name&mdash;the Restrictive Practices Commission. The First Schedule applies to the commission and embodies the provisions of the First Schedule to the 1953 Act, except that it omits those conferring powers of investigation which are conferred on the Examiner of Restrictive Practices instead. The Second Schedule relates to the terms and conditions of the office of examiner. The Third Schedule is an adaptation of the Second Schedule to the 1953 Act to take account of the increased area of operations brought about by the inclusion of services and section 3 provides that the commission and the examiner shall have regard to the restrictive and unfair practices listed therein. During the Committee Stage in the Dáil some Deputies appeared to be under a misapprehension about the significance of <Col N="1108" /> the Third Schedule. As I indicated at the time, and would again like to emphasise, the schedule does not contain a list of restrictive and unfair practices prohibited by law. The schedule, in fact, has no legal force of itself but merely provides useful guidelines for the examiner and the commission in the performance of their duties.</P>
    <P>The commission, at present, operate towards the elimination of restrictive practices in two ways. They may publish fair trading rules which, in their opinion, represent fair trading conditions in the supply and distribution of any kind of goods. Section 4 of the Bill continues this power suitably adapted to apply to the provision of services as well as the distribution of goods. Fair trading rules have no legal force and it is not intended to give them any in the Bill. They do, however, establish codes of conduct which, if adopted by the interests concerned, could obviate the need for a public inquiry and I think it is desirable that the commission should continue to have the power to make these rules. The commission may also, at present, hold a public inquiry into the supply and distribution of any kind of goods, in the course of which they may investigate services only to the extent they are rendered in the course of carrying on any trade or business under investigation. Sections 5 and 6 of the Bill continue this power of public inquiry but an important change is that the commission may not hold an inquiry on their own initiative, but must do so on the recommendation of the examiner. The scope of the legislation is also widened to include all services other than banking, electricity supply, transport, and services provided by local authorities. It was argued in the Dáil that the bodies thus excluded were principally State or semi-State bodies, and that they should be subject to supervision and control as well as private bodies. I agree fully with this sentiment, but would like to point out that their exclusion from this Bill does not mean their exemption from control. The excluded services are controlled by legislation designed to meet their special characteristics and are <Col N="1109" /> the specific responsibility of other Ministers; and if practices in the provision of any of these services were considered to be contrary to the common good it would be a matter for the Minister concerned to take appropriate action.</P>
    <P>Section 7 provides for the making of reports by the commission, and section 8 provides that on the basis of these reports the Minister may make orders which will not have legal effect until confirmed by Acts of the Oireachtas. Similar provisions are in the existing legislation, but I feel that the wording in the Bill will make for greater clarification of the intention behind the legislation by explicitly including unfair practices and unfair methods of competition amongst the matters on which the commission are required to report and concerning which the Minister may make provisions in orders. The existing legislation put the emphasis on the prevention or restriction of competition as matters on which the commission should report and these remain in the Bill as essential factors. I feel that in these days of intense competition from powerful financial interests when small independent traders are struggling for survival there should be no doubt that the legislation gives power to outlaw any practice or method of competition which is unfair or against the common good as well as those which are restrictive. I am sure that Senators will agree with me that the amendment of these central provisions of the legislation in this respect is essential in modern conditions.</P>
    <P>Sections 13 to 17 provide for the appointment and functions of the examiner of restrictive practices. It is envisaged that he will investigate the supply and distribution of goods and the provision of services and furnish the commission with reports of his inquiries, and he may recommend the commission to hold a public inquiry under section 5, in which case the commission is obliged to make copies of his report available to interested parties. The examiner may also give evidence at an inquiry and may call and examine witnesses. As I emphasised in the Dáil I am very conscious of the need to make a careful selection for the post of examiner, and I shall <Col N="1110" /> take particular care to make a suitable choice. With the entry of the commission into new fields of activity, I shall, in any case where the subject matter of an inquiry seems to call for specialised qualifications, be prepared to add to its membership one or more suitably qualified members for the purposes of the particular inquiry.</P>
    <P>Restrictions of competition and abuses of power by powerful firms in any country may be expected to affect business in other countries to an increasing extent as trade barriers are lowered, and I feel that the commission and the examiner should be empowered by law to take action. Section 14 empowers the examiner to investigate any restriction of competition or any unfair practice or unfair method of competition or any abuse of a dominant position by firms outside the State. Senators will appreciate that the exercise of his powers in the conduct of such an investigation must be confined to the area under the jurisdiction of the State, but it may be anticipated that a considerable amount of information will be obtainable from outside the State without the aid of any special powers. The Restrictive Practices Commission is obliged by section 11 to examine every report by the examiner of such an investigation and to give observations on it to the Minister, and may make recommendations as to what action should be taken. In addition, the commission is obliged by section 12 to study developments in other countries with particular reference to the operation of international firms. I think that it is necessary to confer statutory functions on the commission and the examiner in regard to these matters because of the existence today of international co-operation in the elimination of harmful restrictive practices. I believe that such co-operation will increase as we establish closer relationships with other countries in the interests of the economic well-being of our people, and the possession of statutory functions will endow the commission and the examiner with a status which they would not otherwise have in their dealings with people abroad.</P>
    <P>The commission is also required by <Col N="1111" /> section 12 to study and analyse the effect on the public interest of methods of competition, types of restrictive practices, monopolies, mergers, takeovers, multi-national companies and market structures, and the operation of relevant legislation. I would like to point out that these functions of the commission do not involve the use of any powers of investigation, but their reports would be based on the knowledge and experience which they will gather in the course of their other activities, supplemented by the study of published material and their contacts with corresponding bodies in other countries and with international organisations.</P>
    <P>I think at this stage it would be appropriate for me to comment on the implications of our membership of the European Economic Community in the context of restrictive practices legislation and, indeed, this aspect was raised when the Bill was before the Dáil. The position is that membership of the Community will not affect the powers provided in this Bill, and on our entry to the EEC the investigation and control of practices which distort or unfairly restrict competition in this country will remain within our jurisdiction. However, practices in this country which affect competition in other member States will fall within the jurisdiction of the European Commission and there will be an obligation on the examiner and the Restrictive Practices Commission to render any assistance required by the European Commission in the investigation of such practices. There will be a similar obligation on the other member states in regard to practices in their countries which affect competition here. Following approval by the Oireachtas of this country's accession to the European Communities it will be necessary to bring in legislation to enable us to honour the obligations of membership.</P>
    <P>It is hardly necessary for me to remind Senators that promotion of free and fair competition, which may be said to have been pioneered in the United States during the latter half of the 19th century, has spread throughout the world and is now regarded as an essential economic objective in individual <Col N="1112" /> countries and in the European Economic Community of which we will shortly become a member. We cannot afford to lag behind other countries in adapting and extending our legislation so that the instruments which we are using for this purpose are suitable. I feel that the Bill which is now before you is worthy of support for the two reasons which I have already mentioned, namely, that it provides for more efficient investigation and control of restrictive and unfair practices and that it will extend the legislation over a wider field of economic activity.</P>
    <P>The preparation of this Bill was already advanced when I was gratified to see that the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development had recommended to member countries that they examine their restrictive practices legislation in order to make it more effective and to extend it over as wide an area of economic activity as possible. This recommendation was one of a number made by OECD for the purpose of slowing down the rate of inflation and I mention it so that Senators will appreciate more fully that this Bill is indeed timely. I would also like to put before you my view that effective legislation of the kind which we are now considering will be all the more important for our country when we enter the European Economic Community. The door will be wide open to competition from nine other countries and we must be able to ensure, not only that obstacles to the increasing efficiency of undertakings in this country are removed, but also that the competition from abroad is fair.</P>
    <P>I feel that I can recommend this Bill to Seanad Éireann without reservation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill. The Minister has just given a very exhaustive and helpful explanation. As he stated, it is now 20 years since legislation covering the unfair practices of traders was instigated under the Restrictive Trade Practices Act, 1953, and it is obvious that, in the altered circumstances, and with the changes in the years ahead, the Minister is acting quite wisely and properly to <Col N="1113" /> have our legislation up-dated for the benefit of the community.</P>
      <P>This, I can say without exaggeration, is a very important piece of legislation, probably one of the most important to come before the Seanad, certainly in this session. We rightly have opted on the whole for private enterprise as a system best designed to suit our particular purposes and to give the community generally the best and most efficient reward for goods and services.</P>
      <P>Private enterprise, like any other system, is open to abuse. It is, therefore, necessary that the State as the protector of the public bring in the necessary legal and administrative controls to prevent its operation contrary to the common good. The private enterprise system should stimulate competition with the reward, profit&mdash;sometimes an unpopular word&mdash;going to the company or individual who provides the best quality goods or services at the lowest possible price compatible with free and fair trading conditions.</P>
      <P>If we accept generally the system of free enterprise, we have a double duty: first, to permit the manufacturer or trader or supplier of a service to operate in fair conditions free from the threat of joint national or international cartels, or combines which, under the guise of <i>pro bono publico</i> in the form of cut prices or services, force the small men out of business and thereby effectively eliminate the nuisance of local competition. Joint corporations do not work for nothing. Competition once out of the way will inevitably lead to higher prices and poorer and impersonal service. For this reason, I am very pleased to note that the Minister has emphasised the fact that not only is the Bill intended to counteract any unfair practices on manufacturers, traders or individuals, but he is also very concerned to note that within the manufacturing and distributing process there should be no unfair practices which would in the long term impinge against the best interests of the consumer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not seek the reason for the change in the title of the commission in regard to the Minister's concern for the right of traders, especially small traders and manufacturers, to survive and flourish in a free enterprise <Col N="1114" /> society. The old name, the &ldquo;Fair Trade Commission&rdquo;, suggested that it was prepared to act in the interest of the entire community which included the trader, particularly the small one as well as the consumer. The changed title, the &ldquo;Restrictive Trade Commission&rdquo;, would appear to be detrimental to the manufacturer rather than beneficial. I should be glad if the Minister when he is replying would give the reasons why the change in title was suggested.</P>
    <P>To me, fair trade means fair trade for everybody concerned in a particular service. This includes not only the consumer who is finally concerned in purchasing the goods but there is, in between, the whole distributive system between the manufacturer, the wholesaler, the retail trader and ultimately the consumer. All these people are entitled to equal consideration, having regard to the fact that if the small trader is put out of business by the giant corporation, the consumer will inevitably suffer. I would have thought that the description of the commission would have been a more accurate one in its present form of the &ldquo;Fair Trade Commission&rdquo;. It is more applicable to the community as a whole than the suggested change of title, the &ldquo;Restrictive Practices Commission&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister's reason for changing the title of the commission may be because in the new Bill it is proposed to include professional services. I do not see the reason for the change and would prefer the old title. A more accurate description of the commission might be to add the words &ldquo;and services&rdquo;, &ldquo;Fair Trade and Services Commission&rdquo; instead of the new title suggested. The old title gives a more general description to what the Minister obviously intends the commission to do under the terms of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Another vitally important point is the protection of the public against the abuses which can arise under the private enterprise system. When companies or individuals, seeking more for less, interfere with the normal competitive links between manufacturer and consumer or in the supply or cost of services to the public, obviously <Col N="1115" /> in the complex and changing circumstances of the second half of the 20th century, existing legislation&mdash;some going back nearly 20 years&mdash;needs to be up-dated to provide for current and likely future changes in the light of national and international trade. The Minister has emphasised this in his Second Reading speech.</P>
    <P>The appointment of a new officer to be titled &ldquo;Examiner of Restrictive Practices,&rdquo; I would fully support. It is a step in the right direction. The power outlined in the Bill appears to be adequate for the purpose. However, having regard to the substantial duties which he will have, provision should be made for the appointment for either an assistant examiner or sub-examiner, possibly on a regional basis. This would obviously speed up the process of dealing with complaints by the commission. We have had a number of examples in recent years in which delays in dealing with legitimate demands for price increases have caused grave disruption in certain industries. The flourmilling industry is an obvious example, where delays of up to one year very nearly caused a serious close-down of the industry and consequent unemployment.</P>
    <P>Some provision should be written into the Bill, if not already in it, whereby the examiner, before referring the complaint to the commission for an inquiry, should satisfy himself, in consultation with the interests concerned, that an inquiry is justified. It is quite possible that the examiner, acting on a complaint from some individual or body, may decide that, on the evidence submitted to him, a public inquiry is justified; whereas if he was to consult with the interests concerned he might get a different viewpoint of the circumstances of the case. I make this point to ensure that not only will justice be done by the commission but that it will appear to be done by the public at large.</P>
    <P>The Minister also mentioned in his speech that, following an investigation, the commission may decide to publish fair trading rules, &ldquo;which will have no legal force&rdquo;. I do not see the reasoning behind this phrase. It would tighten up the legislation and the purpose <Col N="1116" /> of the Bill considerably if these fair trading rules had the force of law; not only would they rectify an existing complaint of unfair trading, distribution or unprofessional charges but they would also have the effect of discouraging such a practice, possibly in some other sector of the economy. As a preventative, apart from anything else, it would be helpful and add teeth to the Bill if the fair trading rules had the force of law.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned, and everybody here would agree with his point of view, that the appointment of the examiner will require very careful consideration. Obviously it is not a job for the boys. I do not know what qualifications the Minister has in mind for the examiner and I would be interested to hear if he has formulated any views in this regard but obviously he will be a man of ability, integrity and complete independence; whose views will be accepted by the public, in the knowledge that he is acting completely free of any outside interference, with the desire of assisting the public and preventing any form of abuse under the private enterprise system. This position calls for a man of considerable talents and independence of mind. I wish the Minister every success in his choice for the right man because he obviously must be a very important individual.</P>
    <P>Again I should like to repeat that the task for one examiner is far too great. Possibly under the terms of the Bill it is visualised that more than one individual would be appointed acting in the name of the examiner. I would like to suggest that in our changing economy, where everything is being speeded up and where decisions are wanted immediately, the examiner would require assistance in the form of sub-examiners, regional examiners or some other people of that calibre.</P>
    <P>It is only right to point out that the great majority of manufacturers, traders and professional men are honest, hardworking people. Circumstances and standards have changed and not always for the better. The temptation to make a soft buck is certainly greater than it was years ago but it should be remembered that this <Col N="1117" /> attitude of mind is not confined solely to the trading and professional classes. Business today is difficult and not always rewarding. Our duty as legislators is to help and encourage the good enterprising trader because in so doing we are indirectly helping the public to enjoy good value and good services. If this Bill achieves that it will justify its introduction. In general, I approve of the Bill. There may be some amendments I should like to see to it but they would be amendments put forward to strengthen the Bill and not to weaken it.</P>
    <P>In general, the public are well served by the trading and professional communities. There are niggers in every woodpile but they are not confined to the trading and professional classes. We are living in difficult, complex and changing times and it is proper that our Government, and we as legislators, should be alive to these changes. It would be completely wrong if for the sake of vote catching or popularity we did something in the name of the public that caused injury to any branch of the trading or professional sections of our community. I am quite certain that is not the Minister's intention and for that reason I should like to support the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I will say only a few words on this Bill. I do not dissent in any way from the general trend of Senator Russell's remarks and welcome for the Bill but I should like some clarification on, and I should like Members to give some thought to, the possible implications of section 15 and the Second Schedule with regard to the powers of the examiner. I am thinking in particular of the position of professional people whose entire work is of a completely confidential nature. So far as my profession of solicitor is concerned, it is probably not necessary to point out that the work a solicitor undertakes is absolutely confidential as between the solicitor and his client. So far as the medical profession is concerned there is also the question of complete confidence as between the medical man and his patient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under section 15 of the Bill the examiner is entitled to authorise any <Col N="1118" /> person in writing, who then becomes an authorised officer, to require information about any particular field in which the examiner is conducting an investigation. Not only is he entitled to require that information be given but he is entitled to inspect books and records. Not merely is he entitled to inspect books and records but he is entitled to take copies or extracts of any such books, documents or records. This is the matter that troubles me somewhat on the question of the confidential relationship which exists so far as my profession is concerned&mdash;and I feel the medical profession would feel the same way&mdash;and which the members would insist absolutely on maintaining. Solicitors in many matters can give proper service to their clients only provided it is known, recognised and accepted by everyone that their relations with clients, their instructions from clients, their advice to the clients, their discussion with clients, are to be regarded as absolutely confidential. The same could be said of the other branch of the legal profession as well as the medical profession.</P>
    <P>There is a safeguard of sorts written into section 15, but I do not think it meets the difficulty, to the extent that a person who is served with a notice by the examiner may apply to the High Court to get a declaration to the effect that the investigation should not be carried out by the examiner. I do not want to achieve a situation, either as regards my own profession or any other profession, where an investigation will not be carried out but I want to have something written into the Bill which will ensure that only information which is absolutely necessary to the examiner in relation to the investigation he is carrying out need be made available.</P>
    <P>That may be implicit in subsection (1) of section 15 but I have to bear in mind that it is not the examiner himself who will be the type of person that the Minister has foreshadowed but it will be some unknown person who will be authorised in writing by the examiner to make the inquiries on the spot. I believe it should be written into this Bill that (1), only information which is essential to the examiner in <Col N="1119" /> the conduct of his investigation can be required and (2), that any information which is given will, all along the line, be treated as absolutely confidential.</P>
    <P>One of the rules in the Second Schedule has a bearing on this in so far as the examiner's investigations are concerned but I do not think it goes far enough. In No. 8 of the Second Schedule it is provided:</P>
    <P>that no person shall disclose information available to him through being present at an investigation held by the examiner under section 14.</P>
    <P>Then it states that that general rule does not apply to a communication made by the examiner, or an authorised officer, in the execution of his duty.</P>
    <P>The point I want to make to the Minister is that that prohibition should apply to the examiner and to an authorised officer except, so to speak, that it is going a step higher up the channel. It is leaving it too wide if an authorised officer is himself likely to be in a position to interpret what does or does not lie within the execution of his duties. I do not know to what extent this particular problem has been considered by the Minister or his Department, or to what extent it may have been discussed in the Dáil because I did not read the Dáil debate on this particular Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister will appreciate that it is the kind of matter likely to cause concern both to the legal profession and to the medical profession. I say that not in any spirit of hostility towards the Bill. I say it not with any idea of trying to get imported into the Bill any provision whatever which might make the Bill more difficult to operate or in any way clog the smooth carrying out of an investigation by the examiner. However, I think it is a point of view that is legitimate, particularly with regard to professional men whose profession is founded to a great extent on the question of confidence. It is of the utmost importance to them that it should be made quite clear in the terms of the Bill that there will not be any question of extracts from confidential files or confidential information on files <Col N="1120" /> being copied. This information may concern particular clients, and might not be or could be relevant to an investigation.</P>

      <P>I wish to ask the Minister a few questions on the matter of safeguarding the public. For example, is this Bill intended to protect the ordinary purchaser of a house? He may see written: &ldquo;For sale, so much net&rdquo;, and the unfortunate man may later find out that he has lost his Government grant because it says on the board: &ldquo;Net price&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;Gross price&rdquo;. This is an unfair practice and I wonder if this sort of thing is covered in the Bill? Is that considered to be a restrictive practice and something to be dealt with?</P>
      <P>For example, there are shops that sell goods such as fur coats without labelling them as &ldquo;rabbit coneys&rdquo;. There is nothing on it to say that it is a &ldquo;coney&rdquo;: the public are led to believe that it is a fur coat. The same can be said of frocks and other garments that do not state the content of wool in the material. Are these restrictive practices under this Bill? There are shoe manufacturers who sell on the main street under trade names. They put the name of a large store on the shoes at night and deliver them early in the morning as the same shoe at a cheaper price, because of the large amount being bought. Is this a restrictive practice?</P>
      <P>In some bundles of peat briquettes there may be two fewer in each than those sold in another shop. Some butter manufacturers make up 14 oz. packets and print &ldquo;14 oz.&rdquo; on the packets, but the housewife may not notice this and is often led to believe that each packet contains 1 lb. Are these restrictive practices for the purposes of this Bill? These are the sort of practices about which I am concerned. I know it may be said that these are not covered in the Bill and that they may be appropriate to the Trades Description Act.</P>

      <P>There is one comment I wish to make on the Bill. In the Minister's introductory speech he said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1121" /> The Commission are also required by section 12 to study and analyse the effect on the public interest of methods of competition, types of restrictive practices, monopolies, mergers, take-overs, multi-national companies and market structures, and the operation of relevant legislation.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask what will happen when they have examined these types of take-over? Recently in this country we had a series of mergers and take-overs in the drapery and grocery trades. The type of take-over has caused great concern to the members of the grocery trade. When the commission examine this and find that it is not conducive to good trading can the Minister then take legislative action to undo this type of monopoly situation? Is it too late, or is there legislation that can prevent this?</P>
    <P>Can the Minister examine it and say: &ldquo;You may not do this&rdquo;? It can be done in other countries where this type of take-over is examined and is found to be contrary to the public good. I know that this is causing great concern among traders generally. I should like to know when the commission have examined it what can they do about it? It states here that they have no power in law to do anything but merely to examine it. Will they just say: &ldquo;It is not good&rdquo;, and do nothing further.</P>

      <P>This Bill has been generally welcomed. Indeed, Senator Russell summed it up by saying that if he had any criticism of the Bill it was because it was not exhaustive enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to restrictive practices, I have gone as far as I can in the Bill. I propose to give the new Restrictive Practices Commission as much power as possible. Senator O'Higgins drew attention to the fact that it is quite possible, studying section 15, that the authorised officer on behalf of the examiner might appear to have too much power. It is again satisfying from my point of view that this Bill has been so widely welcomed by the House in such a widespread manner. It is quite an extensive and <Col N="1122" /> exhaustive Bill. One of the main purposes of the Bill is that it gives the power of the old Fair Trade Commission to the new Restrictive Practices Commission to investigate fair services with fair trading, and also the separation of the powers of the commission from the powers of the examiner.</P>
    <P>At this stage this legislation is much needed. Senator Russell drew attention to the title of the new commission and questioned whether I was going too far in the general changing of the title of the old commission. He suggested it might have been called the Fair Trade and Practices Commission. I would not quibble with him on that. It is a matter of opinion. When introducing this legislation, I endeavoured to spell out that although I did not attribute the reason for the change of title to the change of the functions of the commission, the fact remains that the commission would be taking on the power of investigating services including professional services with the old idea of investigating fair trade. In that regard I can appreciate the Senator feeling that in the proposed commission's title is the implication that when the commission start investigating some sector of trade or service which has been condemned in so far as it is accused of being restrictive in some shape or form, they will be hampered before the inquiry gets off the ground.</P>
    <P>As I indicated in my opening speech in connection with similar provisions in the existing legislation, I felt that the wording of the present Bill will make for greater clarification of the intention behind the legislation by explicitly including unfair practices and unfair methods of competition among the matters on which the commission will be required to report. The existing legislation put the emphasis on the prevention or restriction of competition as matters on which the commmission should report. This Bill extends it to outlaw any practice or method of competition which is unfair or against the common good as well as those which are restrictive. Anybody could find fault with the naming of the commission. It is fairly descriptive and from that point of view fairly justified.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1123" /> The Senator also talked about consultation. He said that the Bill should provide that before recommending that the commission should hold an inquiry the examiner should consult with the interested party. It is envisaged that the examiner will keep in touch with those with whom he is dealing and that he will normally make this his practice, in order to prevail on people to drop any unfair or restrictive practice which they are carrying on. I visualise that it is only when he is satisfied that he cannot prevail on the perpetrators of the restrictive practice to change their ways that he will pass the problem on to the Restrictive Practices Commission to deal with it. The dangers of his recommending inquiries unnecessarily to the commission are small. It would not be necessary or appropriate to impose a statutory obligation on him as an inquiry could be undermined by those opposed to it alleging that they had not been adequately consulted.</P>
    <P>The type of person that I visualise will be appointed as examiner would be a rational being who would not go to the trouble of taking an unjustifiable case to the commission where the commission would ultimately find against him or find that the complaint he had brought to the commission to investigate would not be justified. The history of the operation of the Fair Trade Commission is one of general acclaim, but from time to time there have been criticisms of their recommendations and findings. It would be a foolish examiner, and certainly not the type of examiner I would be hoping to appoint arising from this Bill, who would endeavour to take something before the Restrictive Practices Commission that would be unjustified.</P>
    <P>Senator Russell asked why should the fair trading rules not have the force of law. This is a justifiable comment. Fair trading rules are suggested as being a guideline. The commission can and have in the past suggested fair trading rules for sectors of trade as a general guideline for them. There never has been a statutory obligation to abide by them, but if any trader or sector of <Col N="1124" /> trade, or now service, does not abide by the overall rules, then the rules will act as a guideline for the examiner, in the context of the new legislation, to enable him to take somebody who does not abide by those rules before the commission with a view to asking the commission to make recommendations to the Minister. The fair trading rules could not have the force of law because an inquiry would have to be held and conducted by the Restrictive Practices Commission and the commission then would have to make recommendations to me as Minister. I would then have to make an order arising from those recommendations and that order would have to be confirmed by an Act of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>In relation to the subject matter of any investigation which the present Fair Trade Commission carry out, one could say that the regulations made arising out of the order, which in turn arises out of the recommendation made through the Minister by the Fair Trade Commission, become the fair trading rules in that instance. Fair trading rules, as such, cannot be given the force of law for that same reason. This procedure whereby the recommendations have to come through the Minister is part of the procedure which is necessary for constitutional reasons to protect the rights of the persons who would be affected by such legislation. This is the reason why the trading rules, as such, have not the force of law at present and I am not proposing to take power in this Bill to change that.</P>
    <P>Senator Russell visualised a situation whereby the examiner would need an assistant. There is no reason why the examiner should not have to deal with the correspondence and to deal with the subject matter or complaints. As Senator O'Higgins mentioned, he will need authorised officers, under section 15, to carry out investigations and inspections of records.</P>
    <P>The examiner will have to make serious decisions and it would not be proper that they should be made by other officially appointed personnel. It is difficult to obtain the ideal type of man and I am taking power under the Bill in the event of the examiner becoming ill or incapacitated, of having <Col N="1125" /> the power to appoint an examiner in his place temporarily. It is not visualised at present to have more than one examiner.</P>
    <P>Regarding Senator O'Higgins's comments on section 15, I should like to state that this kind of power has been held by the Fair Trade Commission up to now in relation to fair trading and in 19 years of operating the same provision in relation to the commission no difficulty of that sort has arisen. I anticipate that Senator O'Higgins will say: &ldquo;This is a different type of situation. There is the question of confidentiality of papers.&rdquo; Anybody whose books or records are examined in the context of fair trading would not be concerned with anybody else whereas inspecting documents in an employer's office or inspecting documents in a doctor's office could affect an innocent third party.</P>
    <P>It is a remote possibility that an authorised officer would want to see confidential information relating to a client of a solicitor or doctor. If this happened, the solicitor or doctor could refuse and appeal to the court under subsection (2), which is not in the existing legislation. This was specifically included in this legislation here to anticipate something more serious.</P>
    <P>Built into section 15 are such phrases as &ldquo;for the purpose of obtaining any information necessary for the exercise by the examiner of any of his functions under this Act, an authorised officer may...&rdquo; In paragraph (b) the emphasis is to give an authorised officer &ldquo;such information as he may reasonably require in regard to any entries in such books&rdquo;. In (e) we have the same thing &ldquo;which an officer may reasonably require&rdquo;. Section 15 (5) spells out that: &ldquo;...the authorisation of an authorised officer shall indicate the matters in respect of which he may act under this section.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>All that is there with the express purpose of preventing the type of situation which Senator O'Higgins fears. I would be fearful of that type of situation and I would hope that the examiner would be mindful of this too. There should be clear-cut distinction in the authorisation which would be given to the authorised officer by the <Col N="1126" /> examiner, spelling out exactly what function he has in relation to the examination of entries in books, documents and records.</P>
    <P>The type of restrictive practice which might be investigated in this context should not involve the possibility of the authorised officer needing to see individual patients' or clients' files or documents. This is one of the problems concerning legislation of this nature. It is easy to imagine some fiendish authorised officer seeking to assume more power than was originally given him, but one would have to realise the type of situation even before the affected party would have resort to section 15 (2), that is, going to the courts.</P>
    <P>One would visualise the type of situation whereby he would pick up his phone and ring for the examiner and say: &ldquo;You have an officer here who is going beyond his powers and I ask you to call him off my back.&rdquo; That type of operation would be effective before the need to use section 15 (2) arises. The qualification about what he may reasonably require restricts the authorised officer in this regard. His authorisation would need to indicate the matters in respect of which he would act under this particular section. That is also a safeguard.</P>
    <P>Senator Gallanagh made a number of points. He wondered what would be regarded as a restrictive practice. The type of abuse mentioned by the Senator would be dealt with under consumer protection legislation, not under this Bill. Some of the abuses mentioned are currently being dealt with in an order relating to prepacked goods, a draft of which was published last month. The order will be made shortly. The Senator gave an example of a packet of butter marked 14 ounces where the consumer thinks he is buying a pound of butter. The person selling the butter is selling it quite legitimately but he is leaving it to the imagination of the consumer to assume that he is getting more than he actually does. I am preparing this order to try to ensure that we will have regular amounts and that the contents of a package are shown quite <Col N="1127" /> clearly on the outside. I hope to make an arrangement whereby there will be only a half pound or a pound with no intermediate stations which have the effect of deceiving the consumer.</P>
    <P>Senator Farrell raised a point as to what happens following an investigation under section 12. She inquired if I can act on reports under this section. Specific powers are provided for the investigator under section 5 and also under legislation, which I propose to introduce, to provide for investigation of and prohibition of mergers and take-overs. The Senator inquired if I can deal with mergers or take-overs where it is reported to me that they are not in the national interest. No, not at present. I have announced publicly that legislation is in an advanced state of preparation to give me that power. I hope the power conferred on me under that legislation will be such that I will be able to deal with mergers, take-overs or the creation of monopolies which have occurred already. I have asked the Parlimentary draftsman to endeavour to speed up the provision of this piece of legislation which is very much needed.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, let me say quite clearly that one of the difficulties in this regard is that there are a number of mergers which are necessary and need to be encouraged. For example, co-operative merging in the creamery industry is very necessary. Any mergers which interfere with the operation of fair trading and the overall benefit of the State are the type of mergers I am anxious to get at. I have endeavoured to deal with the points raised. I appreciate the manner in which the House has welcomed this Bill. In introducing this Bill in the Dáil I said that it was the most important piece of legislation that I had, as Minister for Industry and Commerce, had introduced. It is extremely valuable and should go a long way to protecting the public interest.</P>

      <P>I hope I did not misunderstand the Minister, but in the course of his opening statement he made the case that the fact of the existence of a listing of unfair practices in the Third Schedule did not in fact mean that these were practices which were being declared as being unlawful. I am summarising what the Minister said. I can see the force of that argument, but it seems a little difficult to distinguish between practices which are not unlawful but which at the same time by an Act of Parliament are being declared as unfair practices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The list contained in the Third Schedule are practices which, by and large, people would regard as being unfair practices. I am a little bit bothered about paragraph (f) as to <Col N="1129" /> whether or not a strike which might take place regarding some service being supplied might not, on an application to a court of some sort, be automatically regarded as unlawful in the sense that it was listed here as unfair.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (f) of the Third Schedule says &ldquo;without just cause prohibit or restrict the supply of goods or the provision of services ...&rdquo; I am visualising a case where there is possibly a wild-cat strike, which results in the restriction of the supply or provision of services. I am wondering if, automatically, it would be regarded as unlawful by reason of the fact that it is listed as being an unfair practice.</P>

      <P>No, but they have to deal with it. Their time is taken up dealing with these refusals by the examiner. I would be very slow to inhibit the rights of any individual to appeal to a higher body, but I thought the main purpose of the Bill was to give the examiner full powers and a statutory position to inquire into the needs of sections of trade, industry or professional services which require examination. It is a very responsible task.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To some degree, it is degrading the examiner to say that any individual, <Col N="1133" /> irrespective of how frivolous his complaint is or how irresponsible he is, can take up the time of the commission if he gets a refusal from the examiner. Are we going too far in our desire to see that the rights of the individual are protected? I would assume that the examiner would not refuse any individual or body without very good reason. This suggests that the examiner might not be doing his job properly. This is the point I wish to make.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">

      <P>I take a rather different view from Senator Russell on this point. I think it is as well to have vested in the commission the ultimate power of decision in a case of this type. Under the section as it stands, it is not in any way obligatory on a person with a grievance to go to the Minister. I agree that the likelihood is that a person, if he was refused by the examiner, would quite conceivably go to his local Deputy or Senator and have representations made to the Minister to see if he would ask the commission to hold an inquiry. So far as the Bill goes, what is envisaged is a request to the examiner to have an inquiry held on a refusal by the examiner. We do not know who the examiner will be or who may be appointed in the future. We may find that a situation will exist at some stage where an examiner takes a very much harder line than the first or second examiner appointed. It may be that grievances would arise out of a refusal of an examiner to hold an inquiry. It is well that the ultimate discretion should be left to the commission as to whether or not, on their consideration of the representations made by a party who has been refused, and in all the circumstances, an inquiry should be held or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate Senator Russell's point that, if there was a flood of refusals by the examiner and a flood of appeals following those refusals, there might be some administrative difficulty on the part of the commission in dealing with them. What will happen is that a stereotype letter will be prepared well in advance, leaving a space for the reason of the refusal to be filled in, and all that will be necessary is <Col N="1134" /> for some official of the commission to say that the reasons there is a refusal are 1, 2 or 3, insert them in the blank space and send the letter to Mr. X.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator O'Higgins has spelt out what will justifiably happen in relation to the frivolous crackpot's application. On the other hand, we must make provision for the borderline case and for the situation in which somebody makes a complaint to the examiner and asks him to submit this to the Restrictive Practices Commission for examination. From the point of view of the complainant seeking the inquiry, he feels he has an extremely strong case justifiably, but the examiner in the context of his overall experience has certain distinct points of view on this matter. The examiner can say: &ldquo;I do not think I can request the commission to hold an inquiry. This is not important enough.&rdquo; By this stage the examiner might have become rather bureaucratic.</P>
      <P>We should have a situation whereby the Restrictive Practices Commission have, arising from a submission made to them by the affected party, the power to say: &ldquo;We will look at this.&rdquo; On balance it is something to be recommended even though it opens the door to a number of unjustifiable applications from individuals or groups for an inquiry. This is why the section specifically states &ldquo;may&rdquo;; it leaves the discretion to them. The rest of the section states that the commission &ldquo;shall&rdquo; hold an inquiry. If the examiner requests the commission to hold an inquiry the commission must hold that inquiry. If the examiner transfers a request from me, as Minister, it &ldquo;shall&rdquo; hold an inquiry. The important thing here is that the door be left open, not for a floodgate, but for the justifiable application from an affected party seeking an inquiry.</P>
      <P>While I sympathise with the Senator and respect his view on this matter, it is to be recommended that this accessibility to the commission of an individual for the purpose of obtaining the commission's judgment as to whether he should hold an inquiry should be retained.</P>

      <P>I do not wish to labour the point but I think the Minister is taking away from the examiner some of the powers specifically given to him under this new Bill where he decided to take from the commission the decision to seek an investigation or inquiry. The Minister has decided: &ldquo;We will take that part away from the commission. The commission's sole job is to institute an inquiry after they get a request from the examiner, but the examiner will be the man who decides this.&rdquo; Now we have decided that the examiner is not to be sole man who decides it.</P>
      <P>Let us take a borderline case. The examiner decides a borderline case against the applicant. The applicant then has the right to appeal to the commission. This is degrading the examiner's position to some degree. I would prefer if the individual had the right to appeal to the Minister concerned as a final resort and the Minister could then instruct the examiner to institute an inquiry as, in fact, he is empowered to do under the first few lines of this subsection. The chain of command shall be preserved and the rights of the examiner should not be diminished in any way. I do not think any individual should be able to go over the examiner's head to the commission. The examiner should be the sole person, unless otherwise instructed by the Minister, to decide whether or not an inquiry should be instituted. I would give the right to the individual to appeal to the Minister concerned if he is dissatisfied with the examiner's ruling. That, in fact, could be the position if a very small change in the wording were undertaken. We are lessening the powers and the importance of the examiner by giving this right to an individual.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a point I want to make on subsection (5). What I have in mind here is relevant also to section 6 and section 18. It is probably more relevant to those sections, but in order to raise the point at the first appropriate opportunity I shall raise it on subsection (5). Subsection (5) of section 5 provides for the holding of an inquiry in public in particular instances and states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1136" /> ...private sittings may be necessary solely to establish matters of fact the public disclosure of which might materially injure the legitimate business interests of any person.</P>
    <P>The same phrase &ldquo;the legitimate business interests of any person&rdquo; is used in section 6 (4) and again in section 18. I think it is necessary that there should be such a provision here but I expressed concern on the Second Stage regarding the position of cients of solicitors or patients of doctors. While the provisions in section 5 (5), section 6 and section 18 seem to be perfectly adequate and make a reasonable effort to prevent injury to the business interests of a person whose profession or trade is being investigated, it does not seem that these provisions extend the cloak of confidentiality to the clients or the patients of members of the legal or medical professions.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to consider&mdash;I do not think it would weaken the Bill in any way&mdash;in all such cases the deletion of the word &ldquo;business&rdquo; and refer instead to the &ldquo;legitimate interests&rdquo; of any person. By doing so the scope of these sections would cover not only the person involved, who may be a solicitor or a doctor, but would also extend to cover the clients or patients of the solicitor or the doctor. It does not appear to me that the word &ldquo;business&rdquo; is necessary in this context. It limits the application of the sections I have mentioned while I believe the intention of the Bill is to safeguard the legitimate interests of those people not merely the business interests. In the case of clients of solicitors, information regarding a client garnered by the authorised officer of the examiner might find its way into a report or might be given in evidence in an inquiry, because it has not got the protection which is afforded to the solicitor himself in the example I am giving.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to look into this matter. My point would be ness&rdquo; and by doing so I do not think the Minister's intention under the Bill would be interfered with in any way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>That sounds quite covered by deleting the word &ldquo;business&rdquo;. <Col N="1137" /> We have the situation here where quite an amount of the phraseology is tied in with the original legislation. This subsection corresponds with section 7 (6) of the 1953 Act which enabled the commission, when conducting an inquiry, to hold private sittings to avoid the disclosure of confidential information which might materially injure the legitimate business interests of any person.</P>
      <P>In relation to this subsection, the power under the old Bill has been criticised on the grounds that the evidence given at private sittings may not be confined to matters of fact, which is what is aimed at here. It may not be confined to matters of fact, which to the persons giving evidence but may also include expression of points of view. Such evidence is not open to challenge by other parties to the inquiry.</P>
      <P>Subsection (5) of section 5 re-enacts subsection 7 (6) of the 1953 Act, but provides that private sittings may be called merely for the purpose of establishing matters of fact of a confidential nature. In fact, the confidential nature is emphasised to prevent the legitimate interest and it covers legitimate business interests. There is the other aspect of it in the service end.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not saying that I am converted to Senator Russell's point of view on this, but what struck me is that I explained in my introductory speech that one of the advantages of creating this post of examiner as a filtering ground, or whatever one might like to call it, between the general public and the Fair Trade Commission was that the new commission would not appear to have had any definite opinion before they would hold an inquiry. Acceptance of the application of somebody seeking an inquiry over the head of the examiner, or despite the fact that the examiner has refused to recommend it, brings about the type of situation that the commission are appearing as technically in favour of the person who has gone over the examiner's head. The Senator made this point and it is a reasonably legitimate one which I should like to assess fully. When I am looking at <Col N="1138" /> one aspect of this section, there is no reason why I should not look at the other one as well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnNash" hpid="Mr. Nash Mr. Nash">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nash</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Minister looks at it, I sincerely hope that he will not accept the change proposed by Senator Russell. The very same situation arises in other instances, even in our courts. When a man is convicted of a crime, he has the right of applying to a judge for leave to appeal, which may be refused. He then has to go to the Court of Criminal Appeal for leave to appeal. The Court of Criminal Appeal actually hears the case then, and nobody could suggest that they are presupposing.</P>
      <P>My view is that Senator Russell's contention is rather illiberal and that it will lead to what could be looked upon at least as the very worst type of bureaucracy, where you are depending on one man from whom you have no right of appeal. In this case, as the Bill stands, you apply to the examiner for a right, saying that you want an inquiry. A group, be it a profession or any other people, may feel that they would like, if necessary, a public hearing, if they can stand over whatever increase they are seeking. For some reason, the examiner refuses. They then have a right of appealing to the Minister. The Minister may or may not refuse. The examiner may say: &ldquo;O.K., you may appeal or you may have your hearing before the commission.&rdquo; In most of these cases the Minister does not like to appear: he is always faced with the objection that this is political and he does not like to use discretion except to the minimum extent. Therefore, there is the right of going to the commission and saying: &ldquo;We came before the examiner. He refused us permission to come to you and to have a full-scale inquiry into this. We feel we have good grounds and we are asking you for permission to appeal.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In most cases there should be a right of appeal. The whole thing is held in public and nobody is going to make a claim that they cannot support in public. If everybody is allowed the right of appeal, everything will be cluttered up. There must be some common sense in it. Therefore, they <Col N="1139" /> go to the examiner. If he is being autocratic, or bureaucratic, they go to the Minister. The Minister says: &ldquo;I do not like interfering in these things. I prefer to leave it between those people who are responsible. I do not want somebody to say to me that it is political.&rdquo; Then one has the right to go to the commission and say: &ldquo;We want to appeal. If you are not overcrowded, we would like you to hear our case.&rdquo; There is no such thing as prejudgment. The more rights of appeal that people have in those cases the better, so long as we do not clutter up the whole machinery. I sincerely hope that the Minister will not give way to that illiberal suggestion.</P>
    <P>I would be wholeheartedly in favour of the point raised by Senator O'Higgins. Formerly, the Acts dealt with businesses only. Therefore, they were concerned only with business interests. This deals with professional matters. It would make some people very doubtful of going ahead. If the ordinary person, not the professional, felt that his private affairs could become the subject matter of a public hearing he would be slow to give evidence at all, and his evidence might be absolutely essential for the purpose of ensuring that justice is done between the profession and the public. I should like to support Senator O'Higgins's amendment. I should like to oppose very strongly the suggested amendments of Senator Russell.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say a word of reply to Senator Nash.</P>
      <P>The Minister very righly made the proper assessment, arising out of some comments of mine, in his speech on the Second Reading. Perhaps I should read it again: Senator Nash may not have been in the House at the time. It reads:</P>
      <P>The division of functions between the commission and the examiner is also designed to remove any feeling that the commission, because it has both investigatory and adjudicatory functions under the present legislation, may not approach inquiries in a completely detached and impartial manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1140" /> I made the point, I think very validly&mdash;I do not mind being accused of making it illiberally, if it is a valid point&mdash;that giving the right to an individual who secured a refusal from the examiner on a borderline case to appeal to the commission was, in fact, cutting across the very purpose of the division of functions which the Minister outlined in his speech and which was quite correct. However, I did emphasise&mdash;and perhaps Senator Nash did not hear me&mdash;that any individual should have the right of appeal. I would hate to think that a Minister was made of such poor stuff that he would turn down an appeal on the grounds that he might be accused of political interference. My experience of Ministers of all political persuasions is that they are not made of that kind of timbre generally. There are possibly some exceptions. If a Minister was to adopt that attitude, to my mind he would be abrogating his duties and responsibilities as a Minister. The Minister's desk is where the buck should stop and, if he is not prepared to accept that responsibility because of some invalid criticism, then he should not be in the job.</P>
    <P>Any individual who is aggrieved by the decision of the examiner should have the right to appeal to the Minister who would then direct the examiner to call the commission to inquire into the complaint. That is preserving the proper chain of procedure. It is preserving the division of functions between the examiner and the commission which the Minister rightly wants to create, and it is putting the Minister where he should be put as the judge of last report. That is quite proper; there is nothing illiberal about it. It is a sensible suggestion and completely in line with what the Minister wants to achieve. I hope he will give the matter favourable consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnNash" hpid="Mr. Nash Mr. Nash">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nash</NameTxt>
      <P>The same point arises where the liberty of the individual is at stake, that is, in courts of criminal appeal cases. An accused is arraigned before a judge and jury and if he is found guilty at the close he can apply to the judge before whom the case is heard for liberty to appeal. He sets out <Col N="1141" /> his grounds. The experience of most criminal lawyers is that in two cases out of three the judge will refuse because it is tantamount to saying that he has not heard the case properly or has not summed up the case properly to the jury. The accused then has a right of appealing to the Court of Criminal Appeal for the right to appeal. In at least 70 per cent of the cases where the judge has refused, the Court of Criminal Appeal will grant him the right. That does not mean that they are prejudging the case.</P>
      <P>For many reasons I would be totally opposed to having the buck stop ultimately on the Minister's desk. It is giving control to the Civil Service over all professions and over all businesses &mdash;because the Minister's ultimate resource is the Civil Service&mdash;and I think that would be very bad. The examiner is supposed to perform a semi-judicial function. He is supposed to be completely impartial, but to rely on the judgment of one man is not good enough. It at least gives the suspicion of bureaucracy. The commission is supposed to be completely impartial. I would hate certain professions, including the legal profession, to be under the control of any Government Department, because frequently the rights of the citizen and the rights of the Executive are not the same thing and if you want to muzzle the citizen you can frequently do it. That is what happens in all communistic countries: they muzzle the profession who will defend the citizen against the Executive. Therefore I do not think the case should stay there but that it should be decided by the commission whom I would look upon as an impartial body.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely, in the final analysis, the Minister is the higher court. In any event under the Bill the Minister can do that, so he is not getting any extra powers. I am not <Col N="1142" /> asking that there be any changes in the Minister's rights. He may request the examiner to do it. It does not say why the Minister decides to request the examiner; it says the Minister may request the examiner. In the Bill it says&mdash;</P>
      <P>... at the request of the Minister transmitted by the Examiner.</P>
      <P>The Minister already has that right. All I am suggesting is that it would be for the benefit of the working of the Bill if the request came to the Minister via the examiner to the commission. The commission, in the final analysis, would decide the case, but the Minister would only decide whether the complaint was frivolous or worthy of being heard. We must accept the fact that a Minister is advised by his officials, just the same as anybody else is advised, and not just one man. We place a fair share of trust in Ministers in the performance of their functions and we should preserve that trust in the Minister. I would prefer to leave it to the Minister's good sense to decide what is best to be done. I should like to refer to subsections (2), (3) and (4) of section 5. Subsection (2) reads&mdash;</P>
      <P>Subject to subsections (3) and (4), an inquiry may be held by one or more members of the Commission delegated by the Commission for the purpose.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that one person in fact would be deciding or could decide an issue referred to it by the examiner. Subsection (3) says&mdash;</P>
      <P>Any inquiry shall not, without the consent of the Minister, be held by a temporary member acting alone.</P>
      <P>If the Minister gives his sanction a temporary member could then decide a question referred to him by the examiner. Subsection (4) says&mdash;</P>
      <P>not more than one temporary member may act for the purpose of a particular inquiry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would prefer that a minimum of two out of five commissioners would adjudicate on a question referred to them by the examiner of which possibly only one would be a temporary member. The possibility of one person&mdash;<Col N="1143" /> and that could be a temporary member with the consent of the Minister&mdash; adjudicating on a request from the examiner does not strike me as being the best arrangement. I would like to have at least two commissioners out of five acting on a case referred to them by the examiner. There may be practical reasons why this cannot be done. They might have five commissioners all sitting at different times in different areas and possibly that is why the wording is such in the Bill. I would like to see more than one commissioner and possibly a temporary one deciding on the holding of an inquiry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me say, first of all, that I am satisfied with Senator Russell's impressions of the integrity of the Minister, with which I agree totally. As I have already indicated, there are a couple of points that have been made that I propose looking into before Report Stage. I said that Senator Russell had not converted me to his way of thinking but I felt that the situation merited looking into. On the other hand, Senator Nash in the course of his contribution confirmed the justification of the reasons for the inclusion of this arrangement whereby an affected party can make an approach directly to the commission.</P>
      <P>There is general agreement that I should look at subsection (5) and the other subsections to which Senator O'Higgins referred in relation to legitimate interests as distinct from legitimate business interests. Subsections (2), (3) and (4) of section 5 are repetitions of the 1953 Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not saying that that justifies them, but the purpose of subsection (2) is to make it possible to conduct a number of inquiries simultaneously, thus enabling the commission to discharge their duties more expeditiously. This subsection enables an inquiry to be held &ldquo;by one or more of the members of the Commission delegated by the Commission for the purpose&rdquo;. This has been the practice even when the commission was made up of three and it has worked extremely well. Subsection (3) spells out that a temporary or inexperienced member <Col N="1144" /> of the commission acting alone is not adequate to deal with an inquiry.</P>
    <P>Subsection (4) states:</P>
    <P>Not more than one temporary member may act for the purpose of a particular inquiry.</P>
    <P>This means that if a three-man commission is set up to deal with a specific inquiry, that should be made up of two permanent members plus one temporary member. The reasons for making provision for the temporary members in this context are reasonably obvious in so far as one may be dealing, as the commission has done up to this, with specific trades, but now covering the service field, the field of inquiry is probably doubled.</P>
    <P>In the various professions there is the danger of somebody sitting on a board of inquiry as a member of the commission of, perhaps three, who would not have sufficient knowledge of a particular subject. Therefore, there is the requirement for the provision of temporary members. This has always been there.</P>
    <P>Those are special provisions written into this section to ensure that a specific commission sitting to hold an inquiry on any aspect of trading or service will be qualified so to do. I do not see any reason to change those subsections which were built into the 1953 Act and have stood the Fair Trade Commission in very good stead.</P>

      <P>I can understand that. One out of three strikes me as a better ratio than one out of five. I can see practical difficulties. If you have a number of sittings of the commission, you are limited by the numbers of your commission. You cannot have more than five sittings with five commissioners unless you have temporary commissioners agreed to by the Minister. This brings the Minister into the picture again and rightly so. Wherever possible at least two should adjudicate on a question referred to them by the examiner, who is only one individual.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1145" /> The examiner decides that an inquiry should be held into a malpractice covering the distribution of goods or the supply of services. He refers it to another individual who has to hold the inquiry. I would prefer if there were two commissioners, one of them possibly temporary, carrying out the inquiry. In saying that, I appreciate the Minister's point that there might be practical difficulties if there are a number of sittings of the commission around the country. Obviously, you will run out of commissioners and have to appoint temporary commissioners, but at least two out of five members should hold an inquiry if that is practicable.</P>

    <Title>Restrictive Trade Practices (Confirmation of Orders) Bill, 1972: Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lalor) Patrick J. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lalor)</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a Bill to confirm an order which I have made under the Restrictive Trade Practices Act, 1953, on the recommendation of the Fair Trade Commission, relating to the supply and distribution of electrical appliances and equipment and also to confirm a related amending order.</P>
      <P>The commission's recommendation followed a public inquiry initiated by them into complaints from distributors that they were experiencing difficulty in procuring supplies of electrical goods.</P>
      <P>The commission's report of the inquiry shows that there are over 70 Irish manufacturers of electrical appliances and equipment. A high proportion of their output is sold on the home market, the requirements of which are also met to a substantial degree by imports. Irish manufacturers sell to wholesalers or direct to retailers and contractors, and imported appliances and equipment are distributed in the same way by manufacturers' representatives or agents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some manufacturers' representatives carry on a wholesale business; some wholesalers also have a retail business while many electrical contractors engage in the retailing of appliances and equipment. There are six associations representing the interests of manufacturers, manufacturers' representatives, wholesalers, retailers and contractors. Over 100 witnesses representing trade associations, manufacturers' representatives, <Col N="1151" /> wholesalers, retailers, contractors, the Electricity Supply Board and the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards were examined in the course of the inquiry.</P>
    <P>The commission found that certain practices in the trade were not compatible with the public interest, and recommended that an order be made to prohibit them. These practices include coercion of a supplier by an association to withhold supplies or discriminate against any person; preparation or publication of lists of approved traders for the purpose of limiting entry to the trade or boycotting a supplier; resale price maintenance; collective fixing of prices by suppliers and withholding of goods by a supplier because of prices charged. The commission also recommended that the order should require a supplier to have written terms and conditions of sale and apply these terms and conditions to the acceptance of orders for goods.</P>
    <P>I accepted the recommendations of the commission and I made the Restrictive Trade Practices (Electrical Appliances and Equipment) Order, 1971, to give effect to the recommendations and also to provide in the light of the report that a supplier's terms and conditions should be framed in an equitable way, should not be unduly onerous, and should be applied in a manner which would not involve unfair discrimination. Subsequently I found it necessary to make the Restrictive Trade Practices (Electrical Appliances and Equipment) (Amendment) Order, 1971, which provides for a minor drafting amendment of the original order.</P>
    <P>Following the making of the original order and publication of the commissioner's report, representations were made to me by the Electrical Industries Federation of Ireland. While not objecting to the terms of the order, the federation maintained that the evidence cited in the report related to practices which no longer existed at the time of the inquiry.</P>
    <P>While I accept that many of the practices concerned had been abandoned, I wish to point out that the commission have acknowledged this <Col N="1152" /> where appropriate in their report and it is also true that some individual firms continue to be influenced in their distribution arrangements by policies which have been abandoned by trade associations. Furthermore, the commission's report does not confine itself to practices of associations but also embraces the activities of individual suppliers. I am glad to have the federation's assurance that restrictive practices have been abandoned but I feel, nevertheless, that some safeguards are necessary to prevent restrictive practices which are outside the control of the federation or which might reappear at some time in the future. The orders to which this Bill relates provides these safeguards.</P>
    <P>I hope that Senators will not infer from all this that the federation are restrictive in their outlook. This would be far from the truth and, in fact, they have put forward constructive proposals relating to safety standards and the training of personnel in the electrical trade which my Department is examining in consultation with the other Departments concerned. While on the subject of safety standards I would like to mention that since the publication of the report of the Fair Trade Commission the Electro-Technical Council of Ireland has been set up under the aegis of the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards. Its object is to bring about improvements in efficiency and safety. It includes representatives of the ESB, of Government Departments and of various branches of the trade.</P>
    <P>The Restrictive Trade Practices Act, 1953, provides that orders of this kind shall not have effect unless they are confirmed by Act of the Oireachtas. The Bill now before the Seanad is the confirming Bill which is necessary to give the force of law to the orders concerned. With Bills of this kind, the orders which it is proposed to confirm may not be amended by the Oireachtas but must be accepted or rejected as they stand. The matters with which the orders deal have been the subject of a detailed public inquiry by the Fair Trade Commission, and their report sets out the arguments in favour of adopting the provisions embodied in the orders. The Bill has already been <Col N="1153" /> welcomed in the Dáil and I can recommend it to the Seanad without reservation. Its enactment will provide necessary safeguards against any future attempts at restricting normal competitive conditions in the electrical trade with consequent benefits to the trade and the public.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeERussell" hpid="Mr. Russell Mr. Russell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Russell</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister stated, this Bill confirms the order made by him as far back as 26th April, 1971, following recommendations of the Fair Trade Commission after an inquiry taken on their own initiative into the supply and distribution of electrical appliances and equipment, as a result of complaints from distributors. This order was subsequently amended to provide for a minor drafting change.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill. I regret its necessity, as I regret the necessity for the inquiry instigated by the Fair Trade Commission. In normal circumstances competition in a free enterprise situation should ensure reasonable prices to the purchaser of electrical goods and efficient after-sale services. Unfortunately, such was apparently not the case in the electrical goods industry at some period prior to the Fair Trade inquiry.</P>
      <P>One of the inhibiting factors in the electrical goods trade may be possibly the complex distribution arrangements and the multiplicity of organisations, six in all, catering for 70 manufacturers, manufacturers' representatives, wholesalers and contractors. These arrangements may have had some bearing on the incidents of unsatisfactory practices in the trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad that the Minister has agreed that the Electrical Industries Federation of Ireland have adopted a sensible and responsible attitude in regard to the Fair Trade Commission's inquiry. They have confirmed that some of the practices which were the cause of complaint prior to their investigation did not exist at the time of the investigation and that, in general, the manufacture and distribution of electrical goods is carried on by reputable organisations with reputable members. Of course, you will have the odd maverick where the individual <Col N="1154" /> refuses to conform to the ordinary rules of society.</P>
    <P>Even though the practices complained of at the time of the inquiry have now ceased to his satisfaction, the Minister is quite right in coming to the House with this Bill to confirm the order made more than 12 months ago, if only to dissuade any other individual or company from indulging in unfair or restrictive practices. For that reason the House will pass the Bill.</P>
    <P>I noted in the course of the debate in the Dáil that the Minister confirmed that until the Bill confirmed the order no action taken against the offending trader or traders could have the force of law. I should like to know if any action was taken and if it failed on these grounds during the past 12 months.</P>
    <P>A valid point also made during the discussion in the Dáil is that some restriction on the distribution of electrical goods, particularly items such as refrigerators, washing machines, cleaners and so on, may be necessary to ensure that proper safety standards are maintained and efficient after-sales services are available. It is not unusual for manufacturers to insist that their products be distributed through premises which conform to certain conditions. These regulations are not laid down with the intention of interfering with or restricting the sale of such goods to the consumer but rather to ensure that they are distributed through a premises having the necessary facilities and equipment for their distribution. This factor should be taken into consideration.</P>
    <P>It is desirable that reputable traders who are prepared to put capital into their organisation should be encouraged to do so. Where manufacturers require these conditions, in the interests of the public they should be encouraged to have these conditions implemented.</P>
    <P>A Bill such as this, following the order made by the Minister, should certainly have the effect of dissuading traders or distributors in other trades from proceeding with restrictive practices. Where they are indulging in such practices, they should put their house in order to ensure that free enterprise <Col N="1155" /> means what it ought to mean, that is, free and fair competition where the efficient and enterprising trader progresses to his own and the community's benefit. I welcome the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Professor Kelly Professor Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Professor Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>Before section 1 to insert a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;( ) No person shall export any explosive from the State into Northern Ireland, or conspire at or procure the bringing of any explosive into Northern Ireland by whatever route or means or from whatever source, unless such export, or such bringing of explosive into Northern Ireland shall, in respect of every individual consignment, have been in accordance with a licence granted by the Minister.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The House will remember that on the last occasion when this Bill was being discussed I pointed out that a very similar topic had been discussed by us when the Firearms Bill of last year was going through. On that occasion the Minister for Justice refused to entertain the idea that we ought to make it an offence for anybody in his jurisdiction.</P>
      <P>to conspire or arrange for the exportation of a dangerous or deadly thing from this State into the North of Ireland or to conspire or arrange for or procure the exportation of a deadly thing from abroad into the North of Ireland even though it might not pass through our own territory over the border which Partition has erected.</P>
      <P>That point of view did not commend itself to the Minister for Justice then. So far as I can gather from the Minister for Labour, on the Second Stage of this Bill it does not commend itself to him either.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is why I felt I had to put down this amendment. I do not believe it ought to be lawful for somebody in this jurisdiction to connive at the import of a dangerous thing into the North of Ireland in the conditions which the North of Ireland has had to face over the last two or three years. When we have a Bill before us called the <Col N="1157" /> Dangerous Substances Bill it is our duty to ensure that no criticism can be levelled at us along the lines of saying that we have not done our duty in making sure that life and limb in the North of Ireland are as dear to us as life and limb in the Republic of Ireland.</P>
    <P>That is why I drafted the proposed amendment and why I have submitted it to the House. Since I put this amendment down, I have been in contact with the people who manufacture explosives legitimately in this jurisdiction and I understand from them that every export of explosives which they make to the North of Ireland is done under licence from the British Home Office. Until Stormont was prorogued it would have been open to the Stormont Home Office to induce the British Home Office to suspend a licence. In other words, it is and was&mdash;I have to say this in fairness to the firm concerned and in fairness to the interests concerned&mdash;within the power of the Northern Ireland and British authorities to prevent, by means of withdrawing or refusing a licence, the importation of legitimately manufactured explosives into Northern Ireland from the Republic. To that extent I must concede that my amendment is drafted in a way in which, had I had that knowledge previously, I would not have drafted it.</P>
    <P>If the export of explosives to the North of Ireland is governed by a licence which can be withdrawn at any time by the authorities which whether we like it or not, are in control <i>de facto</i> of the situation north of our Border, it would be superfluous for us to ask the Minister for Labour or any other Minister to license individual consignments of explosives over the Border. Instead of withdrawing this amendment I will leave it in on the basis that there is still an outstanding problem which the existence of a Northern Ireland licence or a British licence does not cover, namely, the possibility that a citizen of this State, a person resident within our jurisdiction, might try to arrange the importation of explosives into the North of Ireland by some other route&mdash;it could be, perhaps, direct by helicopter or by fishing smack.</P>
    <P>My concern was to make sure that so far as my party are concerned, and <Col N="1158" /> I hope so far as this House is concerned, we would not let a Bill entitled the Dangerous Substances Bill go through without making sure that so far as was within our power our sundered brethren in the North of Ireland would realise that we took seriously the threat to the peace and safety of life and limb for all sides of the population, and for all classes and creeds we so often profess to be concerned about&mdash;even if the Minister was to make that point&mdash;in view of the knowledge which I have gained since I put the amendment down that the export from here to the North of Ireland of explosives is already sufficiently protected or controlled by the issue of licences from the authorities who are in control up there, nonetheless I think it ought to be wrongful and unlawful for anybody in this jurisdiction, or anybody who claims the shelter and protection of the laws of this State, to take it on himself to contrive the importation of deadly things into the North of Ireland by whichever route it may be, even if it is by helicopter, aircraft, baloon, fishing smack or any other means. I believe that ought to be an offence.</P>
    <P>Even though it might quite easily be the case that we could have such a section on our Statute Book for 20 years and never successfully prosecute anybody for it, it would, in my view, show our anxiety to convince the people in the North of Ireland who differ from us in so many ways, ethnically and politically, that we regard the word &ldquo;Ireland&rdquo; as meaning something more than Twenty-six Counties and that we regard the word &ldquo;Irish&rdquo; as meaning something more than applying to Twenty-six Counties. That to me would be important. Even if we were merely to go through the motions of passing a section which I freely admit might not catch many offenders, I believe this House would be doing Ireland a favour by accepting my amendment.</P>
    <P>I do not think any harm could be done by leaving it as it stands. Certainly, I believe that an impression will be made where it most needs to be made, among the Unionist population, among the people who are Irish according to our political cathecism but who <Col N="1159" /> have not been brought up in the same tradition as most of us have been and who have a different interpretation of the word &ldquo;Ireland&rdquo; than we have. We need to make an impression on them because we have been neglecting them for so long, and we might make that impression on them if we were to make sure so far as this Bill could do it that nothing deadly will go into their Six Counties. I do not care how legitimate or illegitimate their Border may seem to anyone in this House, nothing should be allowed to go into the Six Counties which could blow people apart, innocent as well as guilty, if we have the power to stop it.</P>
    <P>That is the point that concerns me. Although I entirely understand the contention of the Minister for Labour that his job is basically to do a patching-up job on a code that might be broadly described as the Factory Acts code, I ask him, particularly as a man who in his capacity as a politician and as a human being, not as a Minister, comes from near the North of Ireland whether he would not be doing everybody in this Republic a service if he tried to adapt his Bill in such a way that this could be shown to the people in the North of Ireland as a signal that we wanted to do what we could to protect them.</P>
    <P>I believe that by making it an offence to import explosives into the North of Ireland without a licence or to conspire or to procure the bringing of explosives into the North of Ireland, even if by another route other than the Border, he would be doing a good day's work. If the Minister were to acquiesce in this amendment or, perhaps, if he was to undertake to propose himself at the next Stage an amendment along similar lines, he would be doing all of us&mdash;I am trying to speak across party frontiers now&mdash;North and South, a great service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support this amendment. I am not sure that Senator Kelly is correct in his view that this amendment is rendered less necessary by reason of the fact that an import licence is necessary to import explosives into the <Col N="1160" /> North. That does not very materially affect the net point which Senator Kelly is making in favour of this amendment and that is the necessity for this Parliament, in this part of Ireland, to do something as effectively as we can to prevent the export to Northern Ireland of explosive substances.</P>
      <P>Senator Kelly has very clearly and very ably put forward a number of reasons which would, I think, appeal not only to Members of this House but to the vast bulk of the people outside as to why an amendment on these lines should be put into the Bill. His arguments would be reinforced merely by reading Part II of the Bill. This Bill deals in a number of ways with explosive substances. Section 10 reads:</P>
      <P>No person shall import any explosive except in accordance with a licence granted by the Minister.</P>
      <P>In section 11, no person shall keep any explosive, except in accordance with conditions which are set out in the section. Subsection (3) of section 11 reads:</P>
      <P>No person shall have any explosive in his possession unless it has been lawfully acquired in accordance with this Act...</P>
      <P>and so on. In section 12, &ldquo;No person shall sell or purchase any explosive&rdquo;; in section 15, &ldquo;No person shall manufacture any explosive&rdquo;, again with the exceptions that are set out here. The one thing we stop short of saying is that no person shall export explosives, except under the kind of control that Senator Kelly has suggested in his amendment. If it were no more than a gesture to put in a section which would prohibit the export of explosives, except under control, then in relation to Northern Ireland it would be well worth while making that gesture, and I think it could be very much more than a gesture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the moment&mdash;the Minister will correct me if I am wrong&mdash;if this Bill becomes law, you cannot import, keep, have in your possession, sell, purchase or manufacture explosives, except under the controls that are set out in Part II of the Bill. The one thing you can do is export them, because there <Col N="1161" /> is no prohibition on exporting explosives. That appears to be an extraordinary flaw in the Bill, an extraordinary gap, an extraordinary loophole, to leave in this legislation when attention has been called to it. I could understand the argument that this is a kind of domestic tidying up operation in relation to safety procedures and so on. We are dealing with all sorts of things: importing, keeping, having in one's possession, purchasing, selling and manufacturing explosives. Why stop short of the one thing that can be really important in the present situation, that is, control on exporting?</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyWest" hpid="Dr. West Dr. West">
      <NameTxt>Dr. West</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support the reasons given by Senator Kelly and Senator O'Higgins. It might be argued that one could not export explosive substances without having contravened some of the other regulations under the Bill. There are two things to be said. Firstly, as Senator Kelly and Senator O'Higgins have pointed out, it is important to make it absolutely clear to the people in Northern Ireland what our position is in relation to the current situation in the North, what we think about people who operate, illegally, on either side of the Border, what we think of violence and what we think of the situation in which tons of explosive have exploded in Northern Ireland, killing hundreds of people and damaging millions of pounds of property. It is worth including amendments like this, if we make our position crystal clear, if it helps us to do this to the Unionist population.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second point is that in relation to having in one's possession explosives, and therefore breaking the law&mdash;and you cannot export without already having explosives in your possession&mdash; I can envisage situations arising when a substance can be regarded as an explosive at one time or as an ordinary substance used for weed-killer or fertilisation in agriculture at another. Therefore, there can be situations in which an explosive substance is just being used for ordinary domestic regular purposes, and then, if it is mixed with another substance, it becomes explosive. One could have weed-killer in one's possession and by carefully mixing it with another substance <Col N="1162" /> it could become explosive and could be exported. One could then get round the law by doing the mixing just as one goes across the Border. I think if Senator Kelly's amendment were accepted these possibilities would be ruled out and we would be making absolutely clear to the Northern people our position on the whole of the explosives business.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCrinion" hpid="Mr. Crinion Mr. Crinion">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel I must speak on this amendment, as there is an explosives factory in my area. If anyone had been through this factory, as I have, and observed the conditions and safety regulations that are being kept at present, I do not think this amendment would have been put down. If you cannot find the products to make an explosive, how can you sell it? If you cannot buy the products, unless under licence, how can you sell the explosives afterwards? My experience of the factory has been that under the regulations in existence the explosives have to be moved from four different huts before the final product emerges. There are only four people allowed in each hut in order to enforce the regulations. The State has taken extra precautions in that the Garda force at Enfield station, which at one time was three of four gardaí, has now been increased to 16, with two sergeants. This is because of the presence of the explosives factory at Cloona, Enfield.</P>
      <P>When one realises the safeguards taken, particularly when an amount of the product is going to Northern Ireland, no irregularity could occur. If you have a licence, and can buy the products for explosives only under licence, I consider that this amendment is not necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Professor Kelly Professor Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Professor Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make it entirely clear, because Senator Crinion has raised this point, that in justice to the firm he mentions, I know perfectly well that this firm operate in a way which is utterly above suspicion of any kind. I do not want to be represented, or leave myself in a position where I could be represented, as suggesting that this firm were in any way doing anything which was not legitimate. I unreservedly accept that this <Col N="1163" /> firm are carrying on a legitimate business and that their dealings in the Republic and the North are in accordance with the law. I hope Senator Crinion will not misunderstand what I am trying to do. I am trying to ensure that, so far as this State is concerned, the exportation across the Border or the connivance by people within our jurisdiction at the importation by any other means to the North of a thing that can blow the people there to bits, is unlawful and a criminal offence. That is all I am concerned with.</P>
      <P>I have a feeling, which the Minister for Labour foreshadowed in his reply to the Second Stage, that he will say that this is a matter for the Minister for Justice. I must repeat what I said then, even though the Minister has not had a chance to speak yet. It is not right for Departments to be working in isolation from each other. We ought to have one law about explosives, and I do not care which Minister brings it in. The Minister for Labour is not in a strong position when he brings in a Dangerous Substances Bill here, which deals with the very thing we are talking about which blows people to pieces, and says, &ldquo;I cannot deal with that particular aspect you are talking about because the criminal end of this matter is for my colleague the Minister for Justice.&rdquo; I realise I have gone beyond what Senator Crinion said in introducing this particular dimension.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. J. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to quarrel with the motives which prompted the putting down of this amendment. As Senator Kelly anticipated, I must give the reply which I gave when winding up the Second Stage. This Bill is primarily and solely concerned with the health, welfare and safety of workers in the handling, production, storage, labelling and conveyance of explosives, petroleum and other dangerous substances. So many new substances have come on the market, which have outdated the legislation we have dealing with them, that it was necessary to make new legislation, to repeal some of the old legislation, to consolidate and bring up to date the regulations <Col N="1164" /> dealing with them. It has nothing to do with the criminal use of explosives. Even as a gesture to the people in the North, I do not want to change the theme of the Bill by adopting this amendment.</P>
      <P>The importation of explosives into the North is controlled by their own legislation. They have their own means of dealing with it in any way they wish. We control the importation of explosives in this state and we can take powers to alter or amend the means by which they are handled or brought in. This Bill, for the purpose of safety controls in handling explosives, provides for certain precautionery measures. The controls which we exercise in this Bill are necessary if we are to know the whereabouts of dangerous explosives, who has them and the means by which they are used. When one looks into the measures which are taken here to provide for control one might think that we were aiming at the criminal side. How can one adopt other means for safety if they cannot control the actual explosives, petroleums and substances referred to?</P>
      <P>We are not repealing the Explosives Substances Act, 1883, which is still in operation and which deals with the criminal use of explosives. As a member of the Government I accept my responsibility and agree that this Bill is inadequate to do some of the things it would be necessary to do. The Minister for Justice, who is primarily concerned with the legislation dealing with the criminal use of explosives, will introduce the necessary amending measures to bring that legislation up to date as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is my task to look after the welfare, safety and health of the workers in so far as they are affected by dangerous substances. It would be wrong to have any duplication or overlapping of control; indeed one of the things that this Bill sets out to do is to concentrate all the necessary safety measures in one Minister. Up to now these have been the responsibility of other Ministers and even of local authorities. This Bill will remedy that and it makes resonably good provision. I am not quarrelling with the case made by the Senators in <Col N="1165" /> advocating that this would be a suitable gesture, but it is not appropriate to this Bill. For that reason I would ask Senator Kelly to withdraw this amendment. He will have an opportunity of dealing with this in the near future on another Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Professor Kelly Professor Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Professor Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister has spoken politely and reasonably about my amendment. I will withdraw it for one reason, and that is because I do not want the impression to be created that there is any difference between the two sides of the House in regard to our anxiety that blood should not be spilled in the North. Because the Minister asked me to withdraw it so reasonably and politely I feel I cannot say no to him.</P>
      <P>Before I do so I must say that the Minister is a member of a Government with collective responsibility. I have had many differences with his Government, which is ostensibly committed &mdash;in case that is misinterpreted, let me say I believe that so far as the ruling segment is concerned&mdash;to producing peace in the North; but when I see the reactions and comments from the Northern Unionist population and their representatives on what goes on in the Republic I have to ask myself if we are doing enough to dispel their suspicions. If in the context of a Dangerous Substances Bill a Minister says &ldquo;I understand that this is well meant but it is not my job&rdquo;, if I were a Northern Unionist I would say that this Minister belongs to a Government which is not taking seriously what we think ought to be taken seriously. I would say this Minister and his Government, although they have frankly admitted the principle of collective responsibility under which they operate, are not making an effort to do their best to prevent us from being blown to pieces by people who not only have no mandate to do so but never have looked or never would look for a mandate.</P>
      <P>I must ask the Minister to go back to the Government of which he is a member and say to them that it is not enough to be running our Government and our Parliament in this day and age as though it were 1964 or 1944.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1166" /> This is a situation on which the Government must keep their eye as to what is occupying not just the headlines but the consciousness of everybody, namely, what is going on here, when is the bloodshed going to stop, what can we do to help? Where does the responsibility lie in this regard?</P>
    <P>I hope I have not been too partisan in this House lately, but my party have a good record in this regard. We have never equivocated about this. The amendment I am suggesting now is in line with our thinking all along: that we must not neglect any opportunity whatever of showing the people in the North of Ireland of all classes and creeds that we are concerned. I dislike all this talk about Protestants and Catholics, minority and majority. We talk about them as &ldquo;our people&rdquo; and they are described in our Constitution implicitly in such a way as to entitle me to speak about them like that.</P>
    <P>We talk about them as though they were sitting here with us. If that is the case we owe them a duty, not just the Nationalists. We owe exactly the same duty to those who do not think in the Nationalist tradition. We are not doing the job we are here to do. I am speaking not just on behalf of Fine Gael; I am speaking for Fianna Fáil as well, I believe, and also for those who vote for Fianna Fáil and those who vote for Fine Gael when I say we are not doing this job if we treat the ordinary processes of government in 1972 as though the year were 1964. It is a different year and there are different problems. The ordinary processes cannot continue with honour to us unless they are conducted in such a way as to recognise that the problems are different. If I were a Northern Unionist and saw a Dangerous Substances Bill going through this House with no extra provision for the prevention of deadly things being sent to the North of Ireland in so far as I could stop them from being sent, I would say: &ldquo;This is only more evidence, if I needed it, which I do not, that the Government in Dublin do not give a damn what happens to us.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Although I differ with the Government <Col N="1167" /> I believe they are concerned and would wish to stop bloodshed. If I were a Northern Unionist and were only going on what I saw in black and white, I would find this difficult to believe, because as Senator O'Higgins states everything about dangerous substances here is controlled, with the single exception of the export or the bringing of dangerous things into the North of Ireland, either over our own Border or by some other route. I understand the departmental divisions which impose on the Minister here tonight the necessity of stating he has got to keep to his own part of the field. If this were not 1972 I would not be on my feet at such a late hour trying to persuade him otherwise; but we have terrible problems and we will not solve them unless we disarm the suspicion and hatred which our neglect has done a great deal to fuel.</P>
    <P>I am willing to withdraw the amendment because the Minister has been polite and reasonable. I should like to urge on him as a human being, as a Deputy for County Donegal, as a member of the Government, that it is not enough to continue ordinary governmental processes in the way they have been continued up to now. We must show we really care about these people North of the border of all classes and creeds. We must not be selective and anything we can do to disarm suspicion ought to be done.</P>
    <P>I do not mean to rebuke Deputy Brennan as I know he is doing his best according to the lines which his Department consider appropriate. I withdraw the amendment, not under protest, but accompanied by a sincere plea to the Minister to represent to his colleagues in the Government that this is no time to stick to conventional departmental systems.</P>

      <P>This section states that no person shall sell or purchase any <Col N="1168" /> explosives without certain precautions. I should like to know whether the Minister considered the possibility of explosives changing hands without sale or purchase, by gift or otherwise. I should like to see added to that &ldquo;shall sell, purchase, deliver or accept delivery of&rdquo;. In section 17 it states that if explosives are to be delivered, they must be packaged in a certain way. There is no protection in regard to the mode of delivery once they are packaged. They can be delivered in a conveyance which is unsafe. The whole process of delivery may be a menace, not only to the workers delivering but to the general public. Because explosives can be given or received other than by sale or purchase, I should like to see &ldquo;delivery or accept delivery of&rdquo; inserted, if the Minister sees fit to do so. The person who would be delivering or accepting delivery would have to be a person licensed and, therefore, the person actually making the delivery would have to be licensed and approved by a superintendent of the Garda and his method of delivery would have to be licensed and approved.</P>

This is merely to ensure that people who habitually deal with purchasing and selling explosives are duly licensed. For the purpose of our being able to know when to enforce a regulation, illegal possession of explosives is covered in the Bill to some extent, but mainly this is a criminal matter.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2.</P>
      <P>In subsection (1), line 31, to add at the end:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1169" />&ldquo; ; or on conviction on indictment to a fine not exceeding one thousand pounds or imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years, or to both such fine and such imprisonment.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The point of this amendment is to try to establish so far as the Oireachtas can do it that the offence of making an explosive without a licence is a very serious one. As I have said on the Committee Stage, obviously somebody who does it for a relatively innocent reason&mdash;for example a child experimenting making bangs although it is highly dangerous, would not be regarded as criminal or somebody who manufactures explosives without going to the trouble of getting a licence ought not naturally to be dealt with with the full rigour of the law. But somebody who manufacture an explosive in other circumstances is in a different category. I did call the attention of the House on the previous occasion when this Bill was under discussion two weeke ago to the relative leniency of the maximum penalties which section 52 provided for all the cases in which things declared unlawful in other sections of the Bill were to be penalised.</P>
    <P>There are many of these and I am not pretending that amendments which I have put down would be appropriate to all of them. The one which I have particularly in mind is the manufacture of explosives, which is forbidden by section 15, or the importing of explosives, which is forbidden by section 10. I cannot imagine anyone importing or manufacturing explosives in the conditions which we have to face today with an innocent or relatively trivial motive. If there is such a person, a child or somebody who wants to save himself a few pounds by avoiding the necessity of going to the Minister for a licence, I would leave in the provision which the Minister has got in this Bill, namely, giving the District Court discretion to fine him a few pounds or, perhaps, let him off with a caution.</P>
    <P>In a different kind of case the manufacture or import of explosives is a very serious offence. I dislike being pushed into a position of a public <Col N="1170" /> prosecutor or somebody who is looking for harsh penalties. If I may introduce a note of party politics into this, I fear that Fine Gael have been pushed into this position over the last year or so, in contexts like this, by the inertia of the Government. It is wrong to treat a potentially very serious and dangerous offence on the same footing as one would treat the manufacture of poteen&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>It might be explosive, too.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Professor Kelly Professor Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Professor Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>It is explosive in a different sense. It is wrong to treat it in a trivial way. Although the average member of the public might think that six months in prison or a fine such as section 52 provides is severe enough, related to other parts of the law it is a relatively lenient penalty. It is a conventional ceiling of the penalty which the District Court can impose.</P>
      <P>My belief is that somebody who manufactures or imports explosives without a licence for a sinister reason ought not to be dealt with in that casual way. It is not out of an anxiety to be harsh on harmless people that I have introduced these amendments. It is because I believe that the offences envisaged by sections 15 and 18 are potentially very dangerous and serious ones. I have suggested these additions to section 52, namely, that on indictment if the Attorney General uses his discretion in order to direct the trial of an alleged offender by jury it should be within the discretion of the court to impose a much tougher sentence&mdash; up to two years imprisonment or up to £1,000 fine or, in the case of a repeated offence, up to £100 a day. That is what I have in mind. It is not the harmless offences, for example, the clandestine manufacture of gunpowder, which I indulged in myself as a child, that I have in mind. What I do have in mind is people who manufacture explosives in large quantities for more sinister reasons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No doubt the Minister has been advised to say that this is adequately covered already by the Act of 1883 dealing with explosive substances. It is true that Act does punish the making of explosive with intent to cause <Col N="1171" /> injury. It also makes it an offence and punishable to make explosives under suspicious circumstances. I admit that in ordinary conditions the provisions of the Act of 1883, which are still in force here, would be sufficient. We have not got ordinary conditions here today. We have very special conditions. I am no admirer of the Minister for Justice. I have had differences with him in the past and I suppose I will have them again. But he said, very reasonably, that we are dealing with people who are advised as to their legal position in a much more sophisticated way than their forerunners were 30 years ago. The Act of 1883 does not go far enough to deal with the kind of people who might manufacture or import explosives here.</P>
    <P>I agree that in section 4 the Act of 1883, by throwing the onus of proof on to a potential defendant, goes a long way. I concede that. But when I find we are being asked to pass a Dangerous Substances Bill which purports to prohibit the manufacture of explosives and attaches what is a relatively trivial penalty to it then I have to ask myself are we really facing up to the situation. Would it not be more sensible to say anyone who takes it on himself to make something which can destroy other person's lives or limbs is committing a potentially very dangerous and serious offence? If it is a child making a bit of gunpowder for a bang or firecracker or a quarrier who only wants to avoid the necessity of going to the Minister for a licence, let us let him off with a fool's pardon or a small fine.</P>
    <P>The law would be improved if we attached a fairly serious penalty to the manufacture of explosives <i>per se.</i> Leave out the danger to life and limb or the auspicious circumstances, because these are things which would in the normal course of events be part of the State's case. If the State is unable to prove anything, the defendant gets off. In the normal conditions I would not press for a more severe criminal law or a more severe law of evidence in order to produce a larger number of court convictions. That is the wrong way to approach criminal law. But we <Col N="1172" /> are not in ordinary conditions these days. We are in unusual conditions. We are in a sense in a state of siege. We are spared the worst of it in Dublin. That is the reason I strongly urged the last amendment, which I withdrew in view of the Minister's appeal.</P>
    <P>It would not disgrace the Minister or his Department if we were to concede that the offence which he is constituting in this Bill might of its nature be a very serious and dangerous offence. It would be by no means disgraceful to the Minister, or the Government, if he were to admit the possibility that an offence like that could be so serious that the Attorney General would say that it must go to a jury and the person, if found guilty, must suffer a very serious penalty and not merely be submitted to a district justice whereby an absolutely trifling penalty of a couple of pounds fine can be imposed.</P>
    <P>The Minister knows perfectly well what I have in mind. It would be fitting and honourable to this Government if they were to strengthen the law in this regard. This is not alone a matter for us, but also for other Irish people. It would be worthwhile if we were to strengthen the law in this regard by treating the unlawful, unlicensed manufacture or importation of explosives as potentially very serious and dangerous offences.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I must use the same argument against the proposed amendment as I did against the other one. Indictable offences would mainly relate to the criminal use of explosives and would not come under the enforcement of the provisions of this Bill. In such a case we would hand the offenders over to the Garda or the Department of Justice. We deal with them now under the 1883 Explosive Substances Act and the penalties under that Act go as high as 20 years penal servitude. This is much harsher than the Senator has proposed here. What we have in mind in this legislation are the normal circumstances dealing with the commercial use of explosives.</P>

    <P>The Senator insinuated that one could not foresee people manufacturing <Col N="1173" /> explosives for anything other than criminal use. That is not our experience. In normal times an agricultural worker or farmer who wants to blow out the stump of a tree, instead of going to the trouble of purchasing gelignite, can combine a couple of substances which he may already have on the farm.</P>

      <P>I thought the Senator insinuated it. This is the type of thing we would have in mind. The criminal use would not be dealt with under this Bill. It would be dealt with much more harshly under different legislation, for the time being the 1883 Act. The cobbler must stick to his last here, so I must keep this Bill for what it was originally introduced to do. I think the Senator has demonstrated his sincerity in regard to this.</P>

      <P>May I pursue the figure of speech the Minister just used about the cobbler sticking to his last? My impression is that the affairs of this State are being run in such a way that the Minister does the heels and Deputy O'Malley does the soles of the shoes. That is not satisfactory.</P>

      <P>I do not think the Minister properly understood what I was trying to say. He misunderstood the central point of it. Of course, I recognise that there are people whom he intends to catch by the offences which he is creating by this Bill. Some of these people do not understand the phrase &ldquo;criminal&rdquo;. But the Minister keeps on saying that the criminal side would be dealt with by the Minister for Justice. He is creating offences by this Bill. This Bill is bristling with offences to which a penalty is attached and he admitted two weeks ago that it is impossible to draw a line to distinguish them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say &ldquo;impossible&rdquo;. The lines would be very close.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Professor Kelly Professor Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Professor Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The lines would be very close. But the Minister has said that anybody manufacturing or <Col N="1174" /> importing explosives for criminal use &mdash;what I take him to mean by that is to injure other people or property&mdash; is deal with by a different code of legislation, namely, the 1883 Act. I should like to say to the Minister that the milder section in the 1883 Act, is section 4 (1) which says:</P>
      <P>Any person who makes or knowingly has in his possession or under his control any explosive substance under such circumstances as to give rise to a reasonable suspicion, that he is not making it or does not have it in his possession or under his control for a lawful object shall unless he can show that he made it or had it in his possession or under his control for a lawful object be guilty of felony...</P>
      <P>There is a whole lot of law in the few words I have read out. It is possible for a defendent who is guilty of manufacturing explosives for a deadly object to get out by persuading a district justice that there is not enough evidence and that a reasonable suspicion might exist in regard to his intent.</P>
      <P>In ordinary conditions, I believe that that is exactly how the law should work. A person should be able to say &ldquo;there is not enough evidence to meet the requirements of the section&rdquo;. But we are not dealing with ordinary conditions. I agree with the Minister when he says that some people who manufacture explosives do so innocently. I have learned that from an outside source since the Minister and I last saw each other. I accept that unreservedly. Somebody like that is adequately dealt with by the section already in the Minister's Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am referring to someone who is not innocent, who equally cannot be caught under section 3 or section 4 of the 1883 Act but who could be caught under this Bill if the Minister would consent to amend it along these lines. I do not want to make an issue of it, although I know there are people in the Minister's party who are by no means as rock-solid on decency and humanity as most of my party are. I recognise that the dominant element in the Minister's party does wish <Col N="1175" /> for decency and humanity to reign in the Republic and in the North of Ireland. That is why the Minister is putting a pistol to my head asking me to withdraw amendments. I do not want to show a cleavage between the two sides of any House in this regard. I do not want to give the Government a &ldquo;black eye&rdquo;. I know it is late at night and no one is listening anyway. I am reluctant to do it. That is the only reason I am prepared to withdraw these amendments. I honestly believe that there is substance in them and sense behind them.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to go back to the Government and say that this is no time for Departments to be going along on their own as if nothing were happening in the outside world. It is time for a Government&mdash;any Government&mdash;even a Government with which I have as many faults to find with as this Government, to understand that they are facing a crisis which involves people to whom they have never given a thought before and to consider that every single thing they do and word <Col N="1176" /> they utter will have repercussions for them. That is the reason which formed all three amendments put down by me tonight. I withdraw these amendments only because I do not wish it to appear to the outside world that the vast majority of the Irish people, represented by the people who vote for us and even for the Minister's party, are in any way at loggerheads on what to me seem absolutely fundamental issues of humanity and decency.</P>
