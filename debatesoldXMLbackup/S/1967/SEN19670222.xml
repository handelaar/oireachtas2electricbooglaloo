      <P>On the Order of Business, on 1st February the Acting Leader of the House indicated to us that he understood the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries would attend the House in order to take the motions concerning agriculture on the Order Paper during February.  As the month of February is now almost spent, I should like to ask if this undertaking is to be met.</P>

      <P>Still on the Order of Business, on 8th February the Acting Leader of the House, Senator E. Ryan, stated here in reply to a query as to when motions dealing with the refusal of the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries to meet a responsible deputation of the farming community would be taken that they would be taken within a fortnight.  Today that fortnight is up and I should like to know from the Leader of the House if he proposes later in the day to allow time to initiate a discussion on that topic.</P>

      <P>In reply to Senator Ó Maoláin&mdash;he was not here that day &mdash;on 8th February Senator E. Ryan, as reported at column 936 of the Official Report, stated:</P>
      <P>I have not found out whether he will be definitely available this day fortnight, but it will be either this day fortnight or, possibly, next week; or if not, within the next three weeks, whichever of those three Wednesdays or Thursdays is suitable for the Minister.</P>

      <P>On three occasions the Senator said it would be possible to fix a time to take the motions. Senator Murphy took him up on the matter and Senator E. Ryan said that though he could not guarantee anything, it was possible the time would be arranged within a fortnight.  The Senator said&mdash;and this is the point I wish to make clear&mdash;that it would be either a fortnight from that day or possibly the following week.</P>

    <Title>Industrial Training Bill, 1965: Report and Final Stages.</Title>
    <P>
      <Col N="1279" /> Government amendment No. 1:</P>
    <P>In page 8, after line 56, to insert the following new section:</P>
    <P>17.  An Chomhairle may, with the consent of the Minister, given with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance, borrow temporarily by arrangement with bankers such sums as it may require for the purpose of providing for current expenditure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Minister for Labour (Dr. Hillery) Patrick J. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Dr. Hillery)</NameTxt>
      <P>During the Committee Stage of the Bill Senator Dooge raised the question of whether An Chomhairle should be given specific power to borrow moneys. On further consideration, I feel it would be desirable to empower An Chomhairle specifically to borrow money by getting a temporary overdraft on current expenditure.  This amendment provides for that.  There would not be any point in making provision for borrowing money for capital purposes. The only real source of income for An Chomhairle will be the annual grant under section 16 of this Bill, and it is doubtful whether it would be appropriate for An Chomhairle to borrow money long-term in those circumstances. Any funds required by An Chomhairle for capital purposes, or for the equipping of the centres, can be provided from the grant-in-aid under section 16.</P>

      <P>Government amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 8, after line 56, to insert the following new section:</P>

      <P>This amendment is designed to meet the point made by Senator Dooge on Committee Stage of the Bill.  Its purposes are to permit An Chomhairle Oiliúna to accept gifts. It is similar to section 55 of the Apprenticeship Act, 1959.</P>

      <P>Doubts were expressed by Senator Dooge on Committee Stage about the effect of paragraphs (b), (c) and (d) of subsection (2) of section 18. In particular the Senator feared that these provisions might preclude An Chomhairle from making a grant for the training of additional workers in an industrial undertaking where a grant had been paid for a similar training scheme for other workers in the undertaking. He also feared that An Chomhairle might be prevented from making a training grant to more than one firm.  It was not intended that such limitation should be imposed on An Chomhairle and this amendment is designed to prevent abuse.</P>

      <P>Before the Bill is passed I should like to mention that there were two other points raised on Committee Stage which the Minister undertook to look into.  Since there are no amendments, I take it the Minister is satisfied that the other points made are fully covered and that amendments should not be made.  I should like to ask the Minister whether he has any comment on these two points.  One was in regard to the question of making explicit and statutory the right of appeal to a court of law from the levy introduced in the Bill.  My second point was in relation to the use in one section of the term &ldquo;effluxion&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>There is another point which I put to the Minister for further clarification.  It relates to an amendment which I endeavoured to have put on Committee Stage.  It relates to the rules that An Chomhairle can make in relation to the suitability of a candidate for apprenticeship. I should like clear assurance that I have understood the Minister correctly as saying that nobody will be excluded from apprenticeship under these rules by reason of the fact that his father, or his uncle, was not in the trade.  I understood the Minister to say that what might happen afterwards due to trade union action was not within the jurisdiction of An Chomhairle.  Am I correct in thinking that nobody will be excluded from <Col N="1282" /> trainee status by reason of the fact that he has not got a relation in the trade?</P>

An Chomhairle would be acting outside their powers in making such a rule.  There is no fear they will make such a rule.  I undertook that if they did I would come back to amend the law.  An Chomhairle would be acting <i>ultra vires.</i></P>

      <P>I have had advice in relation to the appeal from the tribunal to the courts and I am satisfied that section 20 does not interfere in any way with a person's right of appeal in common law to the High Court against a decision of the tribunal.  This has been examined by the Committee and they did not make recommendations. An amendment along the lines of that in the Northern Ireland Act is not necessary.  I have not any strong feelings about putting it in, but I feel it is not necessary.  &ldquo;Effluxion of time&rdquo;, I gather, is a well-known legal term and is used in other legislation and is a specific term to cover a determined period of time.  &ldquo;Passage of time&rdquo; does not carry the same meaning.  We cannot find anything that carries exactly the same meaning as the expression &ldquo;effluxion of time&rdquo;.  I do not think the other meaning will be put into it in this section.</P>

      <P>I just want to say a few formal words about this measure.  I am grateful for the manner in which both Houses have received this consolidation measure. Anyone who has taken even a cursory glance at the Bill will realise that it is a most complex piece of legislation. The task of the Joint Committee of both Houses set up to consolidate this law was no easy one.  The fact that they dealt with it so efficiently is in itself a tribute to the energy and devotion of the Joint Committee.  This is a consolidating Bill which does not and cannot reform the existing law.  That law may not be perfect, but nevertheless the fact is that this is the first time in the history of the State that we have all the Statutes relating to income tax in one measure.  This will make it easier for all concerned, whether they are at the receiving or the paying end.  This is a considerable achievement and one which will give satisfaction to all those who assisted in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should particularly like to pay tribute to the Chairman of the Joint Committee, Deputy Sweetman, for the work which he did as Chairman, and indeed to each of the individual members of the committee, to all the members of the staffs, the staffs of both Houses of the Oireachtas, the staff of the Revenue Commissioners, and the staff of the Draftsman's Office.  They <Col N="1284" /> are deserving of the highest commendation for the excellent work they did on this measure.</P>

      <P>I should like to join with the Minister in thanking this Committee for preserving us in this House and in the other House from the task of having to go through the 400-odd pages of the Bill.  It is most useful to have this legislation under one cover, so to speak.  We are grateful for the work which the Committee did. I hope there is no significance in the fact that the page dealing with the balancing allowances I was issued with is upside down, and that this does not indicate the topsy-turvy nature of the law.</P>
      <P>The fact that this legislation has been brought together in this way and consolidated should make it easier I would hope for the Minister to reform our income tax law.  Some plans have been announced in this regard and it is time that our income tax laws were reviewed in a number of respects.  Ours is a very old-fashioned system.  The arrangement under which corporation taxation and personal taxation are theoretically one system is a very old-fashioned and out-of-date system dating back to the time when there was no such thing as a joint stock company. I think we need to reconsider this as has been done elsewhere.  I would hope that when the Minister is considering an amendment of this law he will make a better preparation than was made in Britain in this connection where the splitting of the two forms of income tax and the introduction of the new corporation tax was accompanied by confusion because there was inadequate preparation.  We can benefit by learning from their mistakes and if we have adequate preparation we will be able to effect the change more smoothly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the impending introduction of the decimal currency system&mdash;in respect of which I hope the Minister will not fall into the error which Britain has been misled into when announcing the adoption of an unsatisfactory decimal system&mdash;this introduction of the decimal system would be an appropriate occasion to <Col N="1285" /> reconsider the whole system and to introduce a progressive element into our income tax code.  At present it is most complex, cumbersome and out of date.  The confusion about the personal allowances is dangerous because it misleads people into thinking that the allowances are meant to represent the amount of money which they need to live on before tax is taken from them. This leads to considerable confusion and it has in fact led the Labour Party to propose larger personal allowances, which does not seem to be in accord with the alleged philosophy of that Party.  The complex system of personal allowances, earned income allowances and surtax can be replaced by a progressive system when we come to adopt the decimal coinage system.  We can look forward to trying to turn this into a tax code which will relate to the latter of the twentieth century instead of to the first part of the nineteenth century where its origins lie, and the character of which it bears at present.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I welcome the Bill. I suppose it is appropriate that I should contribute at short length, most disproportionate to the size of the Bill about which I am speaking.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Minister for External Affairs (Mr. Aiken) Frank Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (Mr. Aiken)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill covers two separate though related subject matters: firstly, the immunities and privileges of diplomatic and consular personnel and, secondly, the immunities and privileges of international organisations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under Article 29 of our Constitution, Ireland accepts the generally recognised principles of international law as our rule of conduct in our relations with other States.  We must therefore apply here the same rules of diplomatic law and procedure as are applied in other States.  The Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations and the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, to which this Bill <Col N="1286" /> seeks to give the force of law, were drafted in 1961 and 1963 at conferences in Vienna attended by about 90 nations, including Ireland.  These two Conventions reflect the general agreement reached in Vienna as to the appropriate immunities and privileges which are essential for the effective functioning of diplomatic missions and consular offices.  Similarly, the member Governments of the United Nations and other international organisations covered by the Bill had agreed some years before upon an appropriate range of immunities and privileges for the organisations concerned.</P>
    <P>The purpose of granting immunities to diplomats and consuls is to ensure that they are independent in the performance of their functions.  The full range of immunities may sometimes be indispensable to diplomats to enable them to exercise their duties in the State in which they are accredited. The immunities which we make available to foreign diplomats and consuls in Ireland are the same as our own diplomats and consuls receive in other countries when representing Ireland abroad.</P>
    <P>The preambles to both the Vienna Conventions refer to the fact that&mdash; and I quote from the Diplomatic Convention preamble:&mdash;</P>
    <P>The purpose of such privileges and immunities is not to benefit individuals but to ensure the efficient performance of the functions of diplomatic missions as representing states.</P>
    <P>The texts of the Vienna Conventions are set out in the First and Second Schedules of the Bill.  These Conventions are already and seem likely to remain for a long time to come the world code in diplomatic and consular relations.  There is great convenience in having available such complete statements or codes of international law with regard to both diplomatic and consular relations.  Hitherto, we have had to deal with these questions in the light of international practice as it appeared to us at any particular time.  Now, however, when the full text of these agreements are placed on the Irish statute book, all <Col N="1287" /> concerned will know precisely what is the legal position on any particular matter in this field in which they may be interested.</P>
    <P>These Conventions resulted from the conferences which met pursuant to a resolution of the General Assembly of the United Nations and form part of the general movement in recent years towards the progressive codification of international law.  The Conventions largely confirm the practice in Ireland in regard to immunities, <i>et cetera</i>.  Section 48 of the Bill sets out the long accepted principle of reciprocity by providing that in the event of another Government not granting immunities to our representatives, the Irish Government may withdraw the immunities here of the representatives of the State concerned.</P>
    <P>Apart from the Diplomatic and Consular Conventions, most of the text of this Bill is concerned with international organisations.  The need for the application of many of these provisions in Ireland does not often arise.  Consequently, the same formula is not used in regard to the application of these Conventions in Ireland as has been used with regard to the Vienna Conventions each of which is given the force of law in the State.  The General Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations and the Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the Specialised Agencies of the United Nations were adopted by the United Nations General Assembly as long ago as 1946 and 1947 respectively.  Up to the present, it has usually been possible for us to give effect to any of their provisions which have become applicable from time to time by administrative measures without the necessity of legislation.  We must, however, be in a position, when the need arises, to make available to international organisations operating in Ireland and to their officials and experts, the necessary immunities.  In fact, the Charter of the United Nations provides in Article 104:</P>
    <P>The Organisation shall enjoy in the territory of each of its Members such legal capacity as may be necessary <Col N="1288" /> for the exercise of its functions and the fulfilment of its purposes.</P>
    <P>and in Article 105:</P>
    <P>1.  The Organisation shall enjoy in the territory of each of its members such privileges and immunities as are necessary for the fulfilment of its purposes.</P>
    <P>2.  Representatives of the Members of the United Nations and Officials of the Organisation shall similarly enjoy such privileges and immunities as are necessary for the independent exercise of their functions in connection with the Organisation.</P>
    <P>In Part III of the Bill we deal not only with the General Convention of the United Nations but also with the position of judges and persons connected with the International Court of Justice.  This gives effect to a resolution of the General Assembly of the United Nations adopted on the 11th December, 1946, and covering the immunities which are contained in sections 10 to 15 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>In Part IV of the Bill provision is made for the privileges and immunities of the international organisations set out in section 16.  We are members of all the organisations indicated.  These organisations would require that their officials coming to Ireland on duty should have the protection which is afforded by these international agreements and which assure those officials their independence in the exercise of their functions.</P>
    <P>Part V of the Bill relates generally to the Council of Europe.  This covers not only the Council itself but also Government representatives, members of the Consultative Assembly, officials of the Council attending meetings of the Council, the judges of the European Court of Human Rights and members of the European Commission of Human Rights.</P>
    <P>Parts VI and VII of the Bill are concerned with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the European Monetary Agreement, the Customs Co-operation Council, the International Wheat Council and the International Sugar Council.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1289" /> Part VIII allows in sections 39 to 43 that the Government may in the future by order, and without the need for new legislation in each particular case, provide for the immunities which by international agreement we may wish to make available to an international organisation, a community or body, or an international judicial body or semi-judicial body, or an arbitration or conciliation board.</P>
    <P>It is also proposed in sections 44 and 45 to make it possible to grant immunities to appropriate persons attending important international conferences in Ireland.  This is a provision which many other countries have in their law and, in certain circumstances, it might be necessary that the Government should be in a position to make available these immunities for the representatives of other Governments coming to Ireland so that they would feel completely free and independent in the performance of their functions.</P>
    <P>I hope that Senators will agree that this Bill is desirable in that it gives effect generally to our international obligations and places on our statute book provisions which are already incorporated, or are in course of being incorporated, in the laws of most other countries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>We have, of course, no difficulty about welcoming this Bill in principle.  Indeed, it came as a surprise to me when I received the Bill to realise that from the nature of the Bill and the limited range of repeals we do not appear to have had any legislative provision covering diplomatic immunities hitherto. Indeed, I am still in some doubt about this.  I had thought that diplomatic immunities had a legislative basis in this country, perhaps inherited from the period of British rule and that this Bill, therefore, might be amending something which already existed but as the repeals at the back apart from three which relate to specific international organisations are confined to the Income Tax Act of 1918 and to two of our other Finance Acts it would appear on the face of it that this is the first legal provision to be made in this country by way of <Col N="1290" /> legislation for diplomatic immunities other than those relating to taxation.</P>
      <P>I should like the Minister to clarify this for me because it does appear, from this Bill and from what we have understood always to be international practice accepted here, that diplomats enjoy a wide range of diplomatic immunities in this country, for example, from prosecution in relation to criminal offences.  I wonder how they can enjoy such immunities if there is not any legislative provision entitling them to such in existence at the moment and for the last forty to fifty years.  If there is such legislative provision how is it we are not repealing it, bearing in mind that this appears to be a comprehensive Bill covering the whole range of immunities and not for simply adding some new immunities?  This leaves me puzzled.  I listened to what the Minister said at the outset but he did not seem to make this quite clear.  There seemed to be an implication that this was something new and that it had been dealt with hitherto by administrative methods but I am puzzled as to how that could be when it involves a dispensation of persons within the State from, for example, criminal jurisdiction.  Perhaps when replying the Minister might clarify that particular point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One is also struck by the time it has taken to implement some of the provisions.  It is true that the diplomatic conventions which are being enacted by this Bill directly are all of relatively recent origin, being only three or five years old.  I suppose that is a reasonable time-lag having regard to the basis on which things of this kind reach the Statute Book, but the provisions relating to the United Nations go back to 1946 and in one case to 1949.  It seems odd that we have taken so long to ratify what was decided at the United Nations over 20 years ago, in one respect, particularly in view of the fact that we have been involved as active members of the UN for over ten years and, indeed, that the Minister himself has been particularly interested in its work and has made such a special contribution to its work.  One wonders how it has <Col N="1291" /> taken so long to implement those provisions in relation to the UN and, indeed, how we have got along so far without implementing them.  I suppose the answer is that while we are represented at the UN they are not represented here, and the provisions that are now being introduced are probably not of much practical importance at the present time in the absence of any international organisation of the UN located in this country, and that it is simply a question of implementing these provisions as part of the immunities of these two diplomatic conventions, taking the opportunity of these conventions to cover the UN case as well, not because it is of great practical importance, but just to complete the picture.  However, it does seem rather a long time to wait to implement these agreements in the UN which preceded our membership but in respect of which we have presumably had obligation since we joined it.</P>
    <P>The Bill is, of course, desirable in principle.  Many of us feel at times that some of the diplomatic immunities go beyond what might be necessary in a particular instance.  We may feel at times that they are abused slightly but this is a case in which we must err on the side of permitting even the abuse at times of those immunities so that the intercourse between our State and other States can be carried on in accordance with international practice, assuring the complete freedom that diplomats ought to have representing their countries' interests in other parts of the world.</P>
    <P>Provision appears to be made in the relevant convention for the continuation by States which have this practice of the arrangement under which the Papal Nuncio is automatically the doyen of the diplomatic corps in the country in question, regardless of the seniority of other representatives.  I take it I am right in thinking it is, in fact, the practice we adopt under the Congress of Vienna arrangements of 1815 which we have inherited and that although it is not the practice in Britain that we propose to continue to do so and to carry on with the tradition <Col N="1292" /> established at the time of the Congress in Vienna, which was not, of course, adopted by Britain and is not universal today.  One is struck, in reading through the Bill and the Schedules to it, by the very wide range of international organisations with which the Bill has to deal. Quite apart from the United Nations and 13 specialised agencies of the United Nations, we have the Council of Europe and two bodies associated with it&mdash;the Commission of Human Rights and the European Court on Human Rights, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, with which we are actively involved, and then some other bodies&mdash; the International Wheat and Sugar Councils, the International Courts of Justice&mdash;and, in some odd way, the European Monetary Agreement.  I cannot see how it comes in but it is mentioned here.</P>
    <P>I notice also there is provision for diplomatic immunity for people attending international governmental conferences. This is of importance, particularly as this country is one which ought to be seeking and obtaining the location here of international conferences of this kind.  We have been highly successful in attracting to Ireland non-Government conferences and, in this area, Bord Fáilte have done excellent work.  We are geographically well located between Europe and the United States&mdash;in a reasonably busy part of the world, on a main route, as you might say&mdash;to attract conferences of this kind.  This is something which would be to our benefit from the point of view of prestige and even, indeed, the financial return from such meetings. One would hope we would attract such international government conferences in the future, more than in the past and it is right that we should make provision for immunities in these cases.</P>
    <P>I am not entirely happy with the arrangements existing in some countries in this respect.  I seem to recall some recent incident in Poland when an official of UNESCO, I think, was not treated as enjoying diplomatic immunity.  I also recall a case graphically described to me by an Irishman attending a meeting at the International <Col N="1293" /> Labour Office in Venezuela, when a Dutchman at the meeting was kidnapped by the Venezuelan Government in the hotel and taken out of the country by plane within the hour, after being rushed through the streets by fast cars, and switched from car to car at various points in the most dramatic manner.  He had offended by having criticised the labour laws of Venezuela which were apparently at that period under the dictatorship rather restrictive.</P>
    <P>That kind of performance is one which should not be tolerated.  I think we should take a strong line, if any event of that kind occurs.  We should guarantee diplomatic immunity to those people because it is proper that we ourselves should guarantee diplomatic immunities to people.  If, indeed, some visitor to this country of another Government did on some occasion criticise some aspect of our law&mdash; although it is not very likely as our laws are liberal and democratic &mdash; even if we did not like it, we should lump it and ensure he enjoys the respect and diplomatic immunity he should have as a representative of a foreign Government attending such a meeting.</P>
    <P>I am not entirely clear &mdash; and I do not think the Bill and its Schedules make it clear &mdash; what level of officials in these various organisations, in fact, enjoy diplomatic immunity.  The relevant Schedule dealing with the specialised agencies of the United Nations states that each specialised agency will specify the categories of officials to which the provisions of this Article and of Article 8 shall apply, and shall communicate them to the Governments of all States parties to this Convention, in respect of that agency and to the Secretary General of the United Nations.  There is a provision, then, for a slightly different procedure in relation to the question of military service; the exemption of officials from military service in their own country, which has to have the approval of the Government concerned. Otherwise it appears those agencies are in a position to nominate officials for diplomatic immunity regardless of rank.</P>
    <P>It is my impression that in practice those agencies confine diplomatic immunity <Col N="1294" /> to senior officials above a certain grade.  This, I think, is proper because the agencies in the countries in which they operate employ large numbers of resident staff who are engaged in routine work and the extension of diplomatic immunity to all of them can reach some heights of absurdity. It is proper that they should be careful in the practice they adopt in nominating for diplomatic immunity officials of their organisations.  Perhaps the Minister could tell us something about the actual practice here so that we may be assured that this is something which applies above a level of seniority and responsibility, where it is appropriate, and does not go the whole way down, for example, to the typists in the typing pool.</P>
    <P>More generally, it is perhaps appropriate on a Bill of this kind&mdash; which deals with diplomatic relations and immunities &mdash; to say that our own diplomatic representation abroad is a matter which we are properly concerned about and to ensure it is adequate at all times.  There has recently been a Dáil debate in which remarks were made that should not have been made.  I would not want to make any criticism of our existing staff in this respect, except to ask the Minister whether he is satisfied &mdash; bearing in mind the very large range of international organisations with which we are associated &mdash; that his staff is adequate for this purpose.  I have the impression at times &mdash; I know there are other people who take opposite views&mdash; that his Department operate on something of a shoestring and that the number of staff available for the enormously wide range of the work involved must make it very difficult for people to specialise adequately in the work connected with particular organisations.</P>
    <P>It is important that we be adequately informed about the activities of all those organisations and that we should have an adequate link, through the Minister's Department, between the Government and Civil Service in this country and the organisations concerned.  I think I said something akin to this in a debate on another matter seven months ago, but I should like to raise the matter again, particularly <Col N="1295" /> when one sees how wide are the responsibilities of the Department. There are many people who have delusions that our diplomats simply spend their time in foreign capitals attending cocktail parties.  The fact is that the volume and range of work involved in the diplomatic service are a very heavy burden, indeed, on a very small group of people.  I would fear that the present staffing might not be adequate and that, as I think I mentioned in the other debate, this might lead to an excessive reliance on the specialised Government Departments associated with the particular work of the agency being the people entirely responsible, with the Department of External Affairs not playing the full role it should play in the work of those agencies, but simply being something of a postbox between the relevant Government Departments and the agency concerned.  I would be keen that the Department should play their fullest possible role here and that they should have within their ranks a sufficient range of expertees to cope with the many extremely complex problems involved in the work of these agencies with all of which, as the Minister has said, we are directly associated and involved.</P>
    <P>I feel also that our present arrangements as regards diplomatic representation abroad could perhaps be widened. It is true that criticism has been made from time to time in relation to one or two cases where our missions are located in areas in which we have limited connections.  But I would think and hope that the present range of our diplomatic contacts, despite criticisms made, could be widened so that we may be adequately represented and may have representation in this country from countries with which we have close interests.</P>

      <P>I see.  I was just about to try to make what I was saying relevant to the debate by pointing out that this Bill is concerned with <Col N="1296" /> granting diplomatic immunities to foreign missions in this country; that I do not think we have enough contact with sufficient countries and that I do not think the missions in Ireland represent the full range &mdash; and enjoy the immunity that this Bill sets out to give them &mdash; of countries with which we have interests and business to transact.  I am thinking particularly of some of the countries of Eastern Europe with which we ought to be in closer contact than we are in view of their important diplomatic role in the world today.  But beyond that I shall not go, in view of what you said, and I conclude by welcoming the Bill again and asking the Minister if he would give us a little more information on the one or two points I raised.</P>

      <P>Senator Garret FitzGerald asks how it is that we have delayed so long in bringing in this particular Bill, under what authority had we granted immunities and what immunities had, in fact, been granted up to now.  In fact this Bill &mdash; and some of those Conventions, the Vienna Convention &mdash; is simply putting into writing what has been the accepted practice for many hundreds of years.  Here, as our Constitution provides, we are bound by international law.  If we had breached those immunities or denied the immunities and privileges to some diplomats here we might very well have been held by our courts to be contravening the Constitution.  I do not know.  However, I am glad to say we need not worry too much about this question because it has never been raised and I do not believe that anybody taking a case to any court in the future will find that in the past we have breached those privileges and immunities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These diplomatic privileges and immunities are, of course, very far-reaching but it has been recognised if States are to do their utmost to live at peace and settle their differences they have to have people whom they can send to other capitals and they should go with such security that they will not be whisked away as a certain gentleman was in a Latin American country. <Col N="1297" /> Some of our diplomats who were in Europe between 1939 and 1945 were protected in the good work they did for our own citizens by it having been generally recognised that diplomats had immunities and privileges that are spelled out in the recent Vienna Convention. The Vienna Convention was negotiated in 1961 only and the consular convention was as recent as 1963.</P>
    <P>As the Senator said the representative of the Holy Father has had precedence here and continues to hold it.  The European monetary agreement is associated with the OECD and a section of this Bill gives immunity to any funds it may hold here.  The European Monetary Agreement is an heir to or successor of the old European Payments Union.</P>
    <P>We have had in recent years a growing number of international conventions here of various kinds.  I am glad to say that no question ever arose as to whether they had immunity or not.  Everything passed off very well but it was understood between ourselves and the organisers of those conferences that we would act towards those representatives here as if they were fully accredited diplomats to this country.  The Senator asked what was the level of officials of specialised agencies who will get immunities or privileges?  It is generally recognised, in regard to diplomats who are being exchanged between countries, that it is a question of negotiation and agreement.  There are certain privileges granted.  Full diplomatic immunity is restricted to the ambassador and some of the top-ranking officials.  Privileges and immunity are reduced as the rank of the officials concerned goes down.  In regard to specialised agencies of the United Nations the officials of the United Nations will be treated in somewhat the equivalent fashion in which we treat diplomats from a single State.</P>
    <P>Senator FitzGerald finished up on a note which all Ministers in charge of Departments like to hear, that is, that we have not enough staff.  Every Government Department would pretty <Col N="1298" /> well agree with anybody who says that they required more staff.  However, we have to cut our coat according to our cloth.  We have all those organisations to service and if the list of committees was set out as well as the parent organisations it would make a very long list indeed.  It is necessary, therefore, that where a home Department are affected by the activities of particular organisations or if a home Department are particularly interested in the matters being discussed at a conference, the home Department concerned should provide some of the staff to go to the conference.  In all cases of international conferences we try to provide that a representative of the Department of External Affairs will be present.  At most of the important conferences that have any political implication we try to arrange that the Irish delegation is led by an ambassador or a senior official of the Department of External Affairs.</P>

      <P>Tá súil agam go nglacfaidh na Seanadóirí leis an mBille gearr seo. Tairgíonn sé dhá rud.  Sa gcéad dul síos níl foráil dleathach ann faoi láthair chun seanóirí a thoghadh do Bhárdas Cathrach Baile Átha Cliath toisc gur rinne an tAcht Toghcháin, 1963, alt 36 den Acht Rialtais Áitiúil (Baile Átha Cliath), 1930, d'athghairm.  Tabharfaidh an Bille seo an comhacht arís chun na ceapacháin sin a dhéanamh. Tá baint ag an dara foráil le deighilt na cathrach ina toghlimistéir.  De réir alt 3 (5) den Acht Rialtais Áitiúil <Col N="1299" /> (Baile Átha Cliath), 1945, tá sé de dhualgas ar an Aire luacháil agus daonradh a chur san áireamh agus é ag socró uimhir na gcomhaltaí a thoghfar i dtoghlimistéar ar bith.  Táim ag iarraidh ar an Seanad an foráil sin a chur ar ceal.</P>
      <P>This short Bill proposes two amendments of section 3 of the Local Government (Dublin) Act, 1945.  The first will enable an order under the 1945 Act dividing Dublin County Borough into electoral areas to specify the number of aldermen to be elected for each area. Section 36 of the Local Government (Dublin) Act, 1930, had provided that the first councillor elected for each area should be an alderman.  It thus provided both for the number of aldermen and for the means of selecting them.  That section was included with a large number of other enactments relating to local elections which were repealed by the Electoral Act, 1963.</P>
      <P>The manner of selecting aldermen for all boroughs and county boroughs has been laid down by article 77 of the Local Elections Regulations, 1965, but, so far as Dublin County Borough is concerned, there is now no legal provision regulating the number to be elected.  The first amendment proposed will remedy this deficiency and will bring the position in Dublin into line with that obtaining in other county boroughs.</P>
      <P>The second amendment proposed by the Bill is the deletion of section 3 (5) of the 1945 Act.  This subsection reads as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(5)  In assigning by an order under this section the numbers of members to be elected for the electoral areas specified in the order, the Minister shall have regard to the populations and rateable valuations of such areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The requirement under the sub-section to take valuations into account means that the average electorate per seat must vary from area to area, depending, in effect, on the relative wealth of the different areas.  I am confident that if subsection (5) is <Col N="1300" /> deleted it should be possible to devise a scheme for the division of the county borough under which there would be little variation from area to area in the average electorate per seat.</P>
    <P>The repeal of the subsection will bring the position in Dublin city into line with that obtaining in respect of other local authority areas generally; no particular factors will be specified as governing the division of the county borough into electoral areas thus, in effect, imposing on the Minister the duty of devising the fairest scheme that is practicable.  Under section 3 (8) of the 1945 Act, any order so made must be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and power is given to each House to annul the order by resolution.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would ask the Seanad to deal expeditiously with the Bill.  It is desirable that it should be enacted without delay because the register of electors for Dublin city now being prepared, and due to come into force next April, must take account of the electoral areas as determined by order of the Minister under the Local Government (Dublin) Acts.  If a revised division in accordance with the present Bill is to be effective at the local elections next June, the dividing order will have to be made at a very early date.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to speak briefly on one point which the Minister has made.  The Minister gives a reason for the second amendment proposed in the Bill.  The reason is the desirability of removing rateable valuations as a basis for determining the electoral areas for local authority purposes. This is something with which all of us agree.  These areas should be determined on the electorate population basis.  I do not understand why the Minister's amendment is worded in such a wide way.  He has deleted the requirement in regard to rateable valuations which we would expect. What he is doing is providing that there will be no requirements of any kind as to how these areas are to be divided.  He is not simply doing what he claims to be doing &mdash; eliminating the rateable valuation requirement &mdash; he is simultaneously eliminating the requirement <Col N="1301" /> to have regard to the population of the areas.</P>
      <P>It would be a simple matter for the Minister to draft an amendment which would delete the words &ldquo;and rateable valuations&rdquo;, which, as he has said, is the only purpose of the amendment.  I would ask the Minister to delete the words &ldquo;and rateable valuations&rdquo; so that the Bill will have the effect he states he wants it to have, and so as to make it a legislative requirement that these divisions will be carried out.</P>
      <P>It is wrong that the Minister should not do that.  I would point out that the Dáil fixes the rules for dividing constituencies, which is governed by Article 16 of the Constitution, and which is upheld by the courts of this country against the wishes of the Government and, indeed, not alone the Government, but against the wishes of many Members of the other House.  That democratic principle has been upheld in the courts because it is in the Constitution. There is no such protection as regards local elections.  As far as I know, there is no provision in the Constitution to ensure that representation shall be related to population.  It is because there is no such provision that we put greater value on the subsection which the Minister proposes to delete and which ensures that the Minister shall have regard to the population of such areas.  I see no reason to eliminate that.</P>
      <P>Nothing has happened over the past number of years &mdash; I will not say how many, not wishing to make invidious distinctions &mdash; over a long period of time, to suggest that it is wise to give any Government power to discriminate in the matter of electoral divisions. During the controversy in 1961, the Government, supported, indeed, by members of other Parties, sought to circumvent the Constitution and undermine it by having unequal representation in Dáil constituencies with the stated and publicly defended object of gerrymandering in favour of some parts of the country as against others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They were prevented from carrying out that anti-democratic move by the High Court which, when Senator John O'Donovan, as he then was, took action at risk and cost to himself, upheld <Col N="1302" /> the Constitution and prevented members of various Parties in the Dáil from trying to undermine it with this undemocratic system of unequal representation for different areas.  We know, therefore, of what we ourselves as politicians can be capable.  I am making no reflection on any particular Government or Party.  This was the action of the members of more than one Party.  We know to what we as politicians can be tempted in the matter of making electoral arrangements.</P>
    <P>Knowing what was attempted and prevented only by the High Court, I do not think it is desirable to eliminate the one legislative safeguard we have against this type of action by this Government or this Minister, or by any Government or any Minister. Therefore, I ask the Minister to agree to modify the words here to give him the power which he seeks, and which we want to give him: the power to determine the provision of these electoral areas on a population basis without having regard to rateable valuations. We do not propose to give this Government or any Government power to determine these areas with no regard to population when there is no Constitutional safeguard to ensure that in the absence of a legislative safeguard the democratic principle will be preserved.</P>
    <P>The Minister should have no objection to this change.  It is quite in line with his own thinking.  I do not think he wishes to suggest that he has any form of gerrymandering in mind. Therefore, I expect him to accept an amendment readily or to initiate an amendment on Committee Stage.  I have an amendment ready for this purpose, and I hope I will have his support and assistance so that the people of Dublin may be safeguarded against any action any Government might take along the lines attempted in 1961, when members of different Parties sought to have unequal representation for reasons of the convenience of particular members of particular political Parties.  I, therefore, ask the Minister to support the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Sheehy Skeffington</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not quite convinced that we are in order in discussing this Bill at all because we took a solemn vote on the order of business we would follow today.  We decided to take business in the following order: Nos. 1, 2, 4, 5 and 3.  We have, in fact, taken Nos. 1, 2 and 4 and we are now taking No. 3 before No. 5.  This leads me to hope that we may yet find ourselves discussing today the motion on the farmers and on agriculture.  I do not think we have had an announcement that we have decided to change the order of business. I am not sure how it was changed, and I am not really convinced that having solemnly voted that we wanted to get through the order of business in one way we are in order in reversing it now.</P>
      <P>However, assuming for a moment that we are in order, I have only one thing to say.  I had underlined precisely the point Senator FitzGerald has made. It seems very strange to me that in the Explanatory Memorandum the point is made that under the present Law&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>In assigning the number of members to be elected for the areas the Minister is required to have regard to the populations and rateable valuations of the areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It goes on to indicate that this is the reason here for paragraph (b) of section 1, that is, the proposed deletion of sub-section (5) of the 1945 Local Government Act.  Yet, as Senator FitzGerald has pointed out, this deletion deletes not merely the requirement, <Col N="1304" /> which is a bad requirement, that regard should be had to the rateable valuations of each area, but also the requirement, which is a good requirement, that regard should be had to the populations of the areas.</P>
    <P>I share the disquiet of Senator FitzGerald as to what purpose will be served by wiping out the necessity to have regard to the population of the area simply because the requirement to have regard to the valuation is unfair.  We all remember when on a previous occasion it was deemed necessary to remove some of the voting strength which tended to vote for Doctor Noel Browne in Ringsend, how a range of mountains seemed to rise between Ringsend and the rest of Dublin.  We should not like to feel that in a Corporation election there would be anything like an earthquake or something of a volcanic nature taking place to prove that the Minister in separating what were politically inconvenient portions of the population from particular areas was guided by geographical or topographical considerations, when in point of fact the electorate might say he was guided by Party political considerations.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Minister really intends to ask for this full power.  It is indicated by his memorandum that he does not, and yet the Bill would give him power to make decisions without any reference to the size of population in each area.  I think Senator FitzGerald is right to draw attention to this and I would certainly support an amendment by him, or any amendment put forward to that effect, in order to grant the Minister the right to drop the requirement about valuations, but not to give him the right to drop the requirement about population when he is redrafting the areas.  I repeat my question whether discussion of this Bill &mdash; No. 3 on the Order Paper &mdash; is in order now, and if so how?</P>

      <P>May I explain to the Senator that through an oversight I omitted to inform the House that the Minister for Justice, who was to take the item following the previous one, disposed of by the Seanad, was not available and rather than have us <Col N="1305" /> sitting idly for the next hour or so, when time is precious, we asked the Minister for Local Government to come along and take this measure.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill, in a way, is dynamite because though brief it gives such wide power to the Minister.  For that reason we must get several things clarified for us.  It is designed to amend a situation arising from the 1963 Act in relation to the title of alderman in Dublin.  The Minister said he does not approve of the title.  That is a matter of opinion.  Many people are fond of Dublin history and like the old traditions to be respected and retained.  Even if they are empty symbols they are part of history.</P>
      <P>The Minister seeks unqualified approval from the House of this very large amendment which he proposes and which will give him remarkable powers.  Let us examine exactly the powers the Minister will have if the Bill is passed.  We must admit straight away that it is necessary to alter the present arrangement in Dublin because of the movement of population and the consequent inequalities in relation to population in so far as one area compares with another.  This Bill will give the Minister power to redraw area boundaries in connection with Dublin city for Dublin Corporation election purposes next June.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are in favour of having alterations made fairly.  The Minister said he intends to have them done fairly, first considering the population &mdash; in other words, having an average number of people represented in the corporation by each councillor or alderman as the case may be.  It seems to me that the Minister, if he gets this Bill, will have power to alter the number of areas.  There are nine areas in the city at present, and this Bill will give him power to increase the number. During the debate the Minister <Col N="1306" /> said he would not approve of 15 areas for Dublin Corporation purposes and this showed the way the Minister is thinking.  He is thinking, possibly, of maintaining nine areas but he has not told us that and we are debating the Bill without a statement before us to that effect.  He has not drawn boundaries or given us even a provisional boundary scheme for the areas he has in mind.  He is asking us to give him blindly power to draw boundaries and decide the number of areas which will comprise Dublin Corporation jurisdiction in the future.</P>
    <P>The Bill will also give him power to decide the number of representatives in each area.  The point then arises as to whether it will be five people in each area or will the entire number exceed the 45 persons now in the Corporation?  That point has not been clarified either.  Before asking us to consider and accept the Bill, the Minister should have outlined his proposal.  Certainly, we cannot be expected to accept the Bill without assurances and without clarification in respect of the points I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>I examined the Minister's reply in the Dáil and all those matters were omitted.  It was a rather brief debate in the other House, the implications of the Bill apparently not being appreciated.  The Minister has more or less put it to us that the Bill is urgently required in order to have the situation rectified before the corporation elections and in good time for the preparation of the register.  That is fair enough but when he asked us for urgent acceptance of the proposed changes he should have given us an outline of his proposals.  Instead, he proposes if and when he gets this Bill &mdash;and I do not think he will&mdash;to prepare a scheme for the Dublin Corporation elections apparently without consulting the members of the Corporation or the city manager, and to plant that order on the table of the House there to remain for seven days during which it can be rescinded by a majority of the House.</P>
    <P>Of course, the Minister is as well aware as we are that his Party have a majority and that even if we object to <Col N="1307" /> what he plants on the table of the House no voting in the House will change his decision.  Therefore, it is unsatisfactory at this stage to have to say to the Minister: &ldquo;We will wait to see what you place on the table of the House before letting you know whether we like it.&rdquo;  It will be too late then. We must be given assurances now: We must know now what the Minister is asking us to give him in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that general amending legislation is now being drafted.  I suggest it is desirable that this general amending measure should be brought before the House on the principle of one man one vote.  We have departed from the situation in which voting power was determined to some extent by valuation.  For instance, under the 1930 Local Government Act commercial interests in the city had a right to five out of 35 seats in the corporation. Valuations, therefore, had representation. The burgesses of Dublin would not have been burgesses if they had not been valuation holders in olden times.  Now we have moved to the situation in which it will be one man one vote though this may seem unfair to some heavy ratepayers such as business houses, limited companies, large commercial interests who pay colossal rates and have not got even one representative of that huge valuation and the rates that valuation entails.</P>
    <P>The one man one vote system is democratic and is regarded in this country as the fairest system of election and now we have come to the point at which population will decide representation in the corporation but we still do not know the number of areas there will be, the boundary line or the number of seats in each area. All that should have been specified before the Minister put before us a Bill which will empower him to lay an order on the table of the House.</P>
    <P>I suppose it is fair to say the Minister will not be unmindful of Party advantages if he is to have areas with a different number of seats making up a total of 45 or perhaps more, whichever is decided.  He mentioned general amending legislation to cover all the <Col N="1308" /> problems that will arise with the passing of time because of extension of the borough boundary and movement of population.  In the meantime, however this Bill is required, as I said at the outset, to amend an omission from the 1963 Act.</P>
    <P>I feel the Minister, when he was making his statement, should have put those points before us instead of our asking him questions at this stage. Apparently Dublin Corporation have not been consulted and have not been warned about the proposed alterations and it would be only on getting this Bill through that the Minister would prepare the areas and notify the corporation regarding his scheme.  He is the person entitled to determine these things.  He is entitled to decide the areas and the representation.</P>
    <P>Dublin Corporation have not got the power to make these decisions.  At the same time, in fairness to the councillors and the citizens of Dublin the corporation should be consulted and their advice sought in relation to the proposed alterations.  Nobody will dispute the fact that alterations are necessary. It has been pointed out that in one area in Dublin city there are only 15,000 electors and they are represented by five councillors and in another there are 56,000 people also represented by five members on Dublin Corporation.  It is obvious that a very small number of people are over-represented owing to the distribution of the population within the city boundaries.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that regular periodic revision of electoral areas is necessary to ensure equal representation for the citizens.  It is a very long time since an adjustment was made before. Apparently the Minister will have the power to do this in this Bill.  In fact, he has so much power in this Bill that it will hardly be necessary for amending legislation at a later stage unless he omits some matters which may take longer to prepare and which would involve special legislation.  Certainly, he will have power in this Bill to do a lot which a general amending Bill could do at a later stage.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister wants this Bill <Col N="1309" /> urgently but in its present form it will give him powers which are far too wide considering that he has not specified what exactly he proposes to do in relation to the subdivision of the city into electoral areas.  It is about 20 years or more since the Dublin Corporation boundary areas were determined.  When the Minister is replying I hope he will give us some idea regarding the representation which he recommends now for the citizens of Dublin on Dublin Corporation having regard to the number and complexity of public services which they administer.</P>
    <P>When the Dublin Constituency representation was being considered in 1959 and debated here I feel that the problems which are obvious now should then have been obvious.  The Minister said they could not have been as obvious as they are now and I agree with him but the trend was there.  The population of Dublin is increasing at the rate of nearly 200 people per week, certainly 175 people per week, which is a very rapid increase.  It is an increase of approximately 25 people per day in the city.  This is a problem which we must deal with so far as representation on the corporation is concerned and the administration of the various services. The corporation is the local body which administers the services of all the Government Departments.  No doubt these services could never be administered were it not for the unselfish voluntary work done by the members of these bodies.</P>
    <P>Another thing which will confront the Minister is that the number of votes needed in a Dublin Corporation area to elect a councillor may be five times as many as the number required to elect a councillor in some of our other cities, Galway, Cork, Waterford and Kilkenny.  If a councillor is representing, say, 35,000 people here in Dublin city compared with a couple of thousand in one of the other cities it can be seen that it is almost physically impossible for him to attend to all the work involved and associated with the public service administered by the corporation.</P>
    <P>At the moment the citizens of Dublin are represented by 45 members.  If we <Col N="1310" /> increase the number to perhaps 75, at least the burden on the shoulders of the councillors and aldermen will be lightened somewhat.</P>
    <P>When the Minister, who will be deciding the date of the local elections, came to the Seanad today telling us that he wanted this Bill through as quickly as possible as it was urgently necessary to have it in order that the preparation of registers and arrangements for the elections could proceed, the least he might have done was to state the date of the elections.  It is not impossible for the Minister to state the date of the elections.  I know the Fianna Fáil Party shied away from the elections last year and the year before but they will have them next June we believe.  If they are going to have them next June, why not state the date on which it is proposed to have them and let the various local authorities get on with their printing work, the preparation of registers and all the work associated with local elections?  The sooner the election date is made known the better.  When the Minister says he wants a Bill urgently, the least we might expect from him is an indication as to the date on which it is proposed to have the elections.  This Bill relates only to Dublin, because there was no provision made in the 1963 Act for the recognition of alderman in Dublin city.  That was an extraordinary omission.  Again, the Minister did not make any reference as to how it came about that the provision for alderman in Dublin city was omitted.</P>
    <P>We have to be very careful on this question of gerrymandering because it is obvious there are various issues, burning questions, at present which would tempt the Minister to become involved in the kind of gerrymandering we had before.  For instance, we have the agitation by the rentpayers in Dublin city.  They are marching through the streets, holding meetings and seeking to have deputations received. The question of determining the rents of the houses is a very live issue.  It is possible that the Minister will shy away from a decision in relation to the rents.  It is the Minister who decides he will shy away from that <Col N="1311" /> decision until after the corporation elections.  Of course, another way to weaken the tenants, to weaken the agitation and the representation, would be to draw the boundary lines conveniently in various areas.  That would have the effect of weakening the representation the rentpayers would have otherwise.  This would also apply to ratepayers associations.  There are ratepayers associations in and around Dublin.  In fact they are represented on Dublin Corporation.  Again, the drawing of boundary lines could ensure that the ratepayers of Dublin city would not have direct representatives elected.  I have made these points to illustrate the power the Minister is seeking now &mdash;to draw those lines, make these boundaries, and he would not be human if he did not take into consideration the advantages for his own Party in drawing those lines.</P>
    <P>People have said that the title of alderman is out of date and ineffective as far as Dublin city is concerned.  An alderman in Dublin city is a person who secures election to one of the first five seats in each of the nine areas, whereas aldermen in Belfast and in English cities are the senior members of the corporations and county councils &mdash; seniority is the element, compared with election to one of the first five seats here.  A person here could contest a corporation election for the first time and, if he secured election to one of the first five seats, would be an alderman.  That situation does not exist in cities outside Dublin, where seniority on the council is the deciding factor.  Even so, I think a departure from the old description would be a pity because Dublin city has a great history and a long tradition.  If you are to start abolishing Lords Mayor and aldermen, why not throw Cromwell's chain into the Liffey?  That chain was presented to Dublin city by Cromwell.  It is treasured and we are proud of the long link in history down through the years.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I mention that merely <Col N="1312" /> in its relation to the matter of alderman.  That issue is one of the main items of debate on this Bill.  It is really in that connection that the Minister was compelled to come into the House to ask for an alteration.  If he did not ask for this alteration in relation to aldermen and to having them recognised, there would be so many implications that the legal situation for Dublin Corporation would be quite impossible next June.  I mentioned those other matters because they are all associated with the kind of empty pomp connected with ceremony, symbols, customs and traditions but those things are linked with history and people who have a sense of history and tradition wish to see them preserved.</P>
      <P>One thing I could not understand in the Minister's speech was his reference to the number of aldermen in each area.  At the moment, of course, there is one alderman only in each area of Dublin Corporation.  Possibly the Minister intends to specify that there should be one alderman only in each area of the city.  But, when I read his speech, I was surprised.  He referred to the number of aldermen in each area.  I was wondering whether he meant he would have more than one in each area in accordance with the powers in this Bill.  It is only right to say, for public knowledge, that a person who is described as an alderman does exactly the same work as every other councillor in the corporation; nothing more and nothing less.  They have the same functions and the only reason they are described as aldermen by tradition in Dublin is that they are the persons who are elected to the first seat in each area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the change in the areas and the number of seats the questions is whether they will all be five-seat areas or three-seat areas?  I know that as we will have election by the system of proportional representation there must be not fewer than three persons representative of each area. If the Minister makes all those changes, will he have all the areas with the same number of seats, and, if not, can he give us some idea of what he has in mind regarding the representation? <Col N="1313" /> For instance, he may say that a five-seat area is too big now, with five councillors representing an average of 35,000 electors in Dublin city; in other words, the proportion of 35,000 electors to five councillors is very big when it comes to one person working round the area.  Possibly the Minister has in mind a reduction in the representation to three seats per area in Dublin Corporation, which would lighten the burden on the individuals.  It would be a smaller area, a smaller constituency with a smaller population.  That is just another point I want cleared up now by the Minister.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister will regard north and south of the river Liffey as one way of starting his boundary lines. For convenience sake the kind of road patterns, street patterns and river boundary should be a guide because it would be very inconvenient if Dublin Corporation were split in half by the river Liffey.  There is one area in the corporation just south of the Liffey which also includes portion of the north side of the Liffey.  The people north of the Liffey feel they are not represented by reason of the fact that all the councillors of the area live on the south side of the river.  Of course, those people are wrong but it is fair enough to take into account the street patterns, the road patterns and the river boundaries.  We would not expect that the same number of citizens should be north and south of the Liffey.  We should have regard to the citizens north and south of the Liffey according to the population.</P>
    <P>It is only right to mention that the public in general have no idea of the amount of unpaid work done by members of the corporation and county councillors.  They devote a great deal of their time to their work as public representatives and help in various aspects of the services provided by the public authorities.  They also engage in charitable work.</P>
    <P>A great deal of charitable work is done by councillors around the city.  In fact, councillors normally work morning, noon and night because wherever they go they are confronted with problems. They shoulder the burdens of <Col N="1314" /> the problems handed over to them by the citizens.</P>
    <P>We all know what a hard life any Lord Mayor in Dublin has at the present time.  I mention this because people do not realise that councillors have to bear considerable expenses in connection with their work as public representatives.  People think they get some benefit or advantage out of being representatives on the councils and corporations.  The only benefit or advantage they get is the status and prestige of being privileged to be a representative of the city and in a position to work for them in a voluntary manner.  For that reason, in the amending Bill, which the Minister mentioned, I hope he will take into consideration the out of pocket expenses which councillors have, whether by way of postage, telephone expenses or travelling expenses.</P>

I had fourteen years of it and I will, again, please God.  We desire a very clear statement from the Minister. It is essential that we get another look at this Bill in relation to what his reply is now and what he tells us in relation to the powers he is asking us to give him.  Naturally, he cannot expect us to give him unqualified power. It would be unfair to the Minister to give him that power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is only fair that we should ask the Minister to specify what power he is going to take in the event of his getting this Bill.  We all agree that in relation to the change in Dublin city and the distribution of population alterations are necessary to ensure that the principle of one man one vote and equal representation and fair representation will apply.  That could be done in a very simple manner by the Minister but this Bill gives him far greater power than that.  It may be necessary for us to put down some <Col N="1315" /> amendments to this Bill.  That will depend on the kind of detail we get from the Minister in his reply.</P>

      <P>The Seanad, of course, are entitled to adopt whatever attitude they like in regard to this Bill but I should like just, once again, to explain to Senators why it is that I am seeking all the Stages of this Bill today.  A dividing order cannot be made until this Bill becomes law.  Most people who have taken any part in elections will appreciate that it is at least almost essential that the register of electors should be prepared on the basis of the division.  The register must be finished by April 1st and this means that printing should, in fact, be in progress now. It generally starts about the middle of February.  If the Bill is held up and, obviously at this stage even a week may be vital, it may be impossible to redivide the city in time for the next local elections.  We will then have to continue with the position as it stands at the moment in which in one area 15,444 electors elect five councillors while in another area it takes 56,963 to elect five councillors.  It is desirable to get away from that situation for the local elections, the date of which people who are interested in this matter are aware has been announced in reply to a Parliamentary Question in the Dáil.</P>

      <P>What I said was in or about the 28th June.  The date I have in mind is the 28th June unless there is any particular reason why they should not be held on that particular day of the week.  It is a Wednesday and that is generally accepted as the most suitable day for them.  If there is to be any movement it would only be to the Tuesday but Wednesday, 28th June, is the date I have in mind.  Senators, of course, can make whatever insinuations of a vicious intention on my part they like but there is evidence available of the type of approach that is to be expected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1316" /> This question naturally arose in the Dáil also.  In the Dáil debate of 15th February, 1967 in Volume No. 8, page 1367 of the Official Report Deputy Ryan said:</P>
    <P>I would have preferred to have the Committee Stage on another day in order to put down an amendment which would have imposed on the Minister the statutory obligation of preserving equality, but, in view of the Minister's undertaking, to bring about equality, so far as practicable, we are prepared to accept that he will do so and we can only await the result of his efforts.</P>
    <P>What I am proposing to do here is merely to put Dublin County Borough on the same basis as already exists, and has existed since 1941, for every other county borough, borough, urban district and every county area.  This power has existed since 1941 and there has been no suggestion that the power has been used for gerrymandering.  It is only lately that other county boroughs and boroughs have been divided into electoral areas but the divisions that have been made recently are on this basis.  Examples are there for Senators to see how the divisions have been made.  For instance, Cork city has been divided into six different areas and the population per member in those areas varies from 3,524 to 3,672.  I do not think it would be reasonable to expect any more accurate division than that.  Similarly, in the three areas in Dún Laoghaire borough the number of electors per member varies from 2,094 to 2,203.</P>
    <P>I have stated that the whole purpose of the Bill is to allow me to do the same with regard to Dublin city.  Under the law as it stands I am required to take valuation into account and I want to get away from that.  The requirement to have regard to population could, in fact, result in distortion in the different areas.  The effect of the presence of large institutions, for instance, in a particular area could have a distorting effect.  Grangegorman Mental Hospital has a population of about 2,000, most of whom are not qualified to vote and a division on the <Col N="1317" /> basis of population would obviously make a big difference in the actual number of voters per seat in that area as against other areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposal is to delete only &ldquo;and rateable valuation.&rdquo; That would require me to continue to have regard to the population in such areas.  Population is the requirement in the Constitution with regard to Dáil constituencies, not electors.  That provision has been defended here by Senator Garret FitzGerald.  Similarly, in the new housing areas there is a bigger proportion of young children than in older areas and this requirement would force me to take this into consideration also.  A requirement to divide on the basis of population figures could, in fact, have the effect of having a greater proportion of electors per councillor in some areas than in others.</P>

      <P>In addition to that, population can only be based, of course, on the most recent census returns available.  This would mean that the 1967 local elections would have to be fought on the basis of the 1961 census returns.  The breakdown of the 1966 returns will not be available until April next.  The putting of Dublin on the same basis as other places enables me to do a more accurate job and to arrive at a position that should be more satisfactory to everybody.  Senator Rooney maintained that in bringing this Bill before the Seanad I should also bring along an outline of the proposed revision.  Any <Col N="1318" /> revision that would be made now would have to be done in accordance with the existing statutory requirement and the proposed revision is not, in fact, available.

      <P>I do not know what Senator Rooney was advocating in regard to the number of seats per area, whether he wants them to remain as nine five-seat areas or whether he wants the Liffey to be treated as a boundary, in which case we could not have nine five-seat areas.  Again, he seemed to argue that a five-seat area was too much for any councillor to be expected to look after in view of the fact, to which he referred, that their services are completely unremunerated and that <Col N="1319" /> even their out-of-pocket expenses are not recouped.</P>

      <P>At another point I thought he was arguing in favour of a continuation of the present nine five-seaters. Again, I thought he was arguing in favour of having the Liffey as a boundary.  If we take the Liffey as a boundary and decide that no electoral area will cross the Liffey the allocation of seats in accordance with the numbers of electors would require 22 seats north of the Liffey and 23 seats south of the Liffey.  That would obviously necessitate a change from nine five-seat areas.  Apart from the fact that I, like Senator Rooney, would regard it as undesirable to have any electoral area crossing the Liffey I have no rigid views on this matter.  I think it is certainly desirable that the Liffey boundary should be respected.  It is possible that a High Court judge might not see any need for that, but most people in touch with the realities of politics would agree that it is undesirable to cross these boundaries.</P>

I am asking the Seanad to deal with this Bill in the same way as the Dáil in order to allow this injustice of 15,444 electors electing five councillors in one area and 56,963 electors electing five councillors in another area to be remedied in time for the elections due to take place on 28th June of this year.

If I am to do that and, at the same time, not cross the Liffey in any electoral area, such division would require 22 seats on the north side and 23 seats on the south side.  Obviously, you could not have nine five-seat areas.  On the south side the greatest number of five-seat areas you could have would be four and on the north side the greatest number of five-seat areas you could have would be three.

I do not think we are now in a position to give all Stages of the Bill in the circumstances of the Minister's reply which was totally unsatisfactory.  The Minister more or less announced the date of the elections.

The revision of electoral areas in the country as a whole would be a major task and possibly might not be justified except when there would be major changes in the population structure.

Dublin has been broken up into such a number of areas that it bears no comparison with other areas in the country from the point of view of electoral law.  I have circulated an amendment which the Minister may accept as giving him the facility he says he will be satisfied with.  I am prepared to modify that, the general effect being that we substitute the word &ldquo;electorates&rdquo; for the words &ldquo;populations and rateable valuations&rdquo;.  The Minister has given no reason for not accepting the suggested amendment which gives him all the powers he has told us he will be satisfied with.</P>

      <P>Acceptance of an <Col N="1323" /> amendment now, for one thing, would postpone this Bill coming into operation probably just sufficiently long to make it impossible to operate in the coming local elections.  It would have to go back to the Dáil.  This is really an unreal and artificial objection. There is not anybody here who does not know that the intention is to divide Dublin city in the same way as other county boroughs have been recently divided and in the same equitable way as divisions have been made in all other local authority areas.  The only effect of this situation will be to postpone the enactment of the Bill, probably making it impossible to do this in time for the local government elections in June.</P>

      <P>On the contrary, far from holding it up the proposal is to get an amendment through now rather than have the Bill held up for further consideration.  The Minister could get the Bill to the Dáil tomorrow and there would be no delay.  The amendment would give the Minister all the power he has told us he is looking for.  We do not wish to hold the Bill up.  I suggest that we defer consideration of the question until after the tea interval during which the Minister could give some consideration to my proposed amendment.  The Minister says everybody will be happy with the distribution he has in mind.  An alternative is that the Minister would agree to consider this amendment during the tea interval.  Then everybody would be happy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. K. Boland Mr. K. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. K. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I made my position clear.  All I am doing is something which I think should be done, proposing to apply the same conditions to Dublin city as apply to every other local authority in the country and as have applied since 1941 without serious accusation or any accusation at all that I know of having been made of any attempt to gerrymander.</P>
      <P>Senator Garret FitzGerald seeks to read into this some sinister attempt on my part to do what it would not be possible to do in Dublin city.  The only possible explanation for the attitude that I can see is that it is desired to circumscribe the Legislature here and have this matter dealt with from outside this House in the manner in which Dáil constituencies were dealt with in the instance to which Senator FitzGerald referred in such glowing terms.  I do not know that the people in the areas in counties that were mutilated who were taken out of their natural areas in which they had always voted and put in with other constituencies would look upon that decision in quite the same light that Senator FitzGerald looks upon it.</P>
      <P>The Oireachtas have given this power to the Minister for Local Government with the provision that any order made has to be laid on the tables of the Houses of the Oireachtas. They have given that since 1941 in respect of every other electoral area.  I think it is reasonable to ask that Dublin city should be treated in the same way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the suggestion that the bringing in of this Bill has been deliberately delayed I do not think that can be sustained.  In the first instance it is obviously desirable that these revisions should be made in the light of the most up-to-date knowledge of the number of electors in different areas of the city.  Originally, this Bill was part of a proposed general amending Bill which is in the course of preparation.  When I became Minister for Local Government, I found that it would not be possible to have that Bill prepared and introduced in time to have this change made for the local <Col N="1326" /> elections and I decided that, in the interests of equality of representation, it was desirable to take these sections out of the general amending Bill.  That was put in hand immediately on my becoming Minister for Local Government. It was introduced on the first day after the adjournment and it has been pressed forward as quickly as possible.  I am asking the Seanad to deal with this Bill in the same way as the Dáil have dealt with it.  The Dáil has accepted my undertaking to redivide Dublin city on the basis of one man one vote as equitably as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Garret FitzGerald Mr. Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garret FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's reply can only be described as a circumlocutory negative.  I do not think we have any alternative but to adopt the procedure we indicated before.  We have given the Minister every chance to reconsider the decision.  I have merely said that the evidence from the 1961 affair showed that in all Parties there were strong inclinations to depart from the basic democratic principle but I do not wish to reflect on the motivation of one Party or another.  I have no desire to circumscribe the Oireachtas which the Minister has just mentioned in this matter.  It is the Minister, by rushing the Bill through, who is seeking to do so.  The Minister's reference to the mutilation of counties suggests that his attitude of mind is still that which prevailed at the time of the 1961 affair and it is this attitude of mind which worries me somewhat in this particular case.  The reason given for the postponement of the Bill&mdash;that time only is required in order to divide up the areas&mdash;is completely irrelevant.</P>
      <P>Everything the Minister has said in the last few minutes gives grounds for caution and I do not think we could agree to the Committee Stage being taken at this point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>

      <P>I should just like to say that I too would favour the postponement of the Committee <Col N="1327" /> Stage for at least a week in order that the Seanad may think this over, in view of the unsatisfactory nature of the Minister's arguments in dealing with this point.  I think Senator FitzGerald has conceded really everything that could justifiably be conceded on the amendment.</P>
      <P>The explanatory memorandum issued by the Minister says in paragraph 2:</P>
      <P>In assigning the number of members to be elected for the areas the Minister is required to have regard to the populations and rateable valuation of the areas.</P>
      <P>In paragraph 4 of the same memorandum the only objection made is to the requirement to have regard to rateable valuation.  No case at all is made in the memorandum about the awkwardness of having to have regard to the population.  What the Minister says in effect is that: &ldquo;In fact I would never engage in a gerrymandering process but I require the power to do so&rdquo;. I feel that even though we might have complete confidence in the Minister, how do we know that Senator FitzGerald might not be the Minister next time, and the Minister himself might bitterly regret having given this power to Senator FitzGerald?</P>

The register must be printed by 1st April; it will become law on 14th April. Surely, if Fine Gael want to work on an up-to-date register and know their areas; their arguments a couple of weeks ago were ridiculous when they wanted to bring forward the local authority elections to May, when it was said by the people here that they would be held in June.  They objected and wanted them earlier.  The register must be ready and there is only the month of March in which to do so. Why all this argument for nothing?

      <P>At the outset since the Government amendments are fairly extensive, perhaps the House will allow me to make a brief reference to the amendments as a whole.  The reason for the number of amendments and their detail is that since the Second Reading debate I have had the benefit of the views of the Auctioneers and Estate Agents Association whose assistance I have already publicly acknowledged, and also the views of the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors <Col N="1331" /> who sent me detailed and very helpful comments.</P>
      <P>On the first amendment before the House the changes are for the most part matters of detail.  We are now in effect in the new section defining matters which were undefined in the Bill as it stood.  The definition of &ldquo;bank&rdquo; is now included so that there may be no argument as to what in fact a &ldquo;bank&rdquo; means in the context of the Bill.  In effect, the new section is an elaboration of what was there, and the definition of terms which were there.</P>

    <P>(9) (a) If it appears to the Minister for Justice that the provisions of this section are inadequate to prevent the negligent or fraudulent handling of money for a client or are otherwise insufficient to protect the interests of clients and that other provisions (either in substitution for or in addition to the existing provisions or any of them) governing the payment of money into and the withdrawal of money from client accounts would be in the public interest, he may make regulations incorporating such other provisions.</P>
    <P>(b)  Regulations under paragraph (a) may provide that, in circumstances specified in the regulations, being circumstances in which an auctioneer or house agent is required by or under this section to pay money into a client account, the auctioneer or house agent shall either&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  pay the money into an interest bearing client account and pay the interest to the client or other person to whom the money belongs, or</P>

      <P>It goes a long way towards it.  One of the reasons why we included subsection (9) (b) was to meet Senator O'Quigley's suggestion in his amendment.  We could not go the whole way to meet him because if we did it would mean hardship for auctioneers. They would have to over-itemise and keep numerous small accounts in respect of which the interest would amount only to some shillings.  Our amendment goes some of the way in the direction suggested by Senator O'Quigley.  Possibly in some cases significant sums may be involved but in most cases the amounts would be very small.</P>

      <P Just="Center">NEW SECTIONS.</P>
      <P>Government amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>Before section 7 to insert the following new section:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(1) (a) Where an auctioneer or <Col N="1338" /> house agent is adjudicated a bankrupt or where, being an arranging debtor, he vests his estate in the Official Assignee for realisation and distribution amongst his creditors, then, notwithstanding anything contained in section 6 or in any other enactment, there shall vest in the Official Assignee the sum to the credit of every client account kept by that auctioneer or house agent;</P>
    <P>(b)  Where an auctioneer or house agent files a petition for arrangement but does not vest his estate in the Official Assignee, the creditors who are clients, or a section thereof (being at least three-fifths in number and value of those who, as clients, have proved debts to the amount of £20) may apply to a judge of the High Court for the time being exercising jurisdiction in bankruptcy matters for an order vesting in the Official Assignee the sum to the credit of every client account kept by the auctioneer or house agent, and the judge may, if he thinks it proper to do so and the Official Assignee consents, make such an order, which shall have effect accordingly.</P>
    <P>(2)  Upon a vesting under subsection (1) (whether by virtue of paragraph (a) thereof or of an order under paragraph (b) thereof) in the Official Assignee&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the rights of creditors against the deposit maintained in the High Court shall vest in him and no order shall thereafter be made under section 15 of the Principal Act in relation to the deposit;</P>
    <P>(b)  he shall notify the Accountant of the vesting;</P>
    <P>(c)  notwithstanding that an order in respect of any such client account may have been made under section 10, a banking company shall be entitled to pay over to him the sum to the credit of that account and shall pay over <Col N="1339" /> that sum to him upon demand by him;</P>
    <P>(d)  he shall proceed to administer the client account or accounts for the benefit of the clients according to the law of bankruptcy.</P>
    <P>(3)  All enactments, rules of law, orders, regulations and other instruments governing the administration of a bankrupt's estate shall, in so far as they are capable of being applied, apply to an administration under subsection (2) in like manner as they apply in the case of an administration in bankruptcy.</P>
    <P>(4)  The administration under subsection (2) of a client account by the Official Assignee shall for all purposes be deemed to be business assigned to the Office of the Official Assignee in Bankruptcy and transacted therein.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>At the present moment, if an auctioneer were to go bankrupt, all his property, including, in the normal course, money he had received for clients, would vest in the Official Assignee in Bankruptcy.  That is the ordinary bankruptcy law.  However, because we are now providing that clients' money is to be kept in a separate account designated as a client account, the legal position would be that the funds in such an account would be trust funds, and as trust funds do not vest in the Official Assignee, the funds in a client account would not vest in him.</P>
      <P>However, under existing law the Official Assignee could take over control of the funds if the Court were to appoint him trustee in place of the auctioneer.  In that event, he would be acting only as a trustee and, strictly speaking, not in his official capacity as Official Assignee.  This is an arrangement that has worked reasonably well in relation to solicitors and it was the arrangement that was envisaged in the Bill as introduced.  A specific reference is made to it in section 7 (4) of the Bill as introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the publication of the Bill, <Col N="1340" /> I received some objections from auctioneers to that arrangement and it was suggested to me that the Official Assignee should not be appointed at all in these cases.  This surprised me at first, since it is clearly in the interests of all the creditors, whether they be creditors in relation to an auctioneering transaction or otherwise, that the one person should be empowered to investigate all the bankrupt's affairs.  It transpired, however, that the objection was not an objection of principle and that what was at issue was that it was felt that the fees payable to the Official Assignee in such cases were or might be too high.  Taking the present Fees Order as it would apply in these cases if we made no change, I felt I had to concede that, in certain cases, the fees could bear rather heavily on clients. Accordingly, I undertook to review them and I am doing so at the moment. On that basis the initial objection of the auctioneers to the appointment of the Official Assignee in these cases has been withdrawn.</P>
    <P>For my part, my examination of the matter convinced me more than ever that it is not only desirable but essential for the proper safeguarding of the legitimate interests of all those who are creditors that the client accounts, as well as the ordinary estate of the auctioneer, should be under the control of the Official Assignee.  This being so, the logical way of dealing with it is to vest the accounts in him, just as the ordinary estate vests in him in a bankruptcy case, and to provide that he should have exactly the same duties and powers as in an ordinary bankruptcy so that he may be in a position to discharge his obligations properly.</P>
    <P>The amendment provides accordingly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>

      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
      <P>Government amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>Before section 7 to insert the following new section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1)  Where&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  an auctioneer or house agent is adjudicated a bankcrupt, files a petition for arrangement, executes a deed of arrangement (within the meaning of section 4 of the Deeds of Arrangement Act, 1887) or dies insolvent, or</P>
      <P>(b)  a company licensed as an auctioneer or house agent is insolvent and being wound up,</P>
      <P>the Official Assignee (in a case where section &mdash;**applies), the liquidator (in the case of an insolvent company) or any interested person (in any other case) may apply to the High Court by motion for an order under subsection (2).</P>
      <P>(2) (a) The High Court, on application made to it under subsection (1), may make an order directing that&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  the costs, fees and expenses incurred by or payable to the Official Assignee in connection with the client account or (as may be appropriate) such costs and expenses in connection with the client account of the liquidator or other interested person as the court may allow, and</P>
      <P>(ii)  the amount of any deficiency in a client account,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>shall, to such extent as the money available allows, be paid or made good by the Accountant either <Col N="1342" /> out of the deposit maintained in the High Court under the Principal Act, or, in a case where the deposit consists of a guarantee bond, from money made available by the assurance company concerned on foot of the bond; and, for the purpose of enabling the Accountant to comply with such direction, the order or a further order may direct, in a case where the deposit consists of securities, the sale by the Accountant of such securities (or of as much thereof as may be necessary) and, in a case where the deposit consists of a guarantee bond and notice of the application has been served on the assurance company concerned, the payment by the assurance company of the amount of the bond (or of as much thereof as may be necessary): provided, however, that such order shall have effect subject to the provisions of any order previously made in relation to the deposit under section 15 (1) or section (15) (2) of the Principal Act unless the High Court directs otherwise.</P>
    <P>(b) Where there is a deficiency in more than one client account, the amount available from the deposit towards making good the deficiencies may be paid over under paragraph (a) without appointment between the client accounts.</P>
    <P>(c)  The High Court, when making an order under this subsection directing the sale of securities, may in the same order direct the sale of all such securities maintained as a deposit in the High Court by the auctioneer or house agent and the transfer to the Official Assignee, for the benefit of the ordinary creditors, of any surplus that may remain after the payment of any costs, fees and expenses and the making good of any deficiency in a client account.</P>
    <P>(d)  The provisions of section 15 (3) of the Principal Act shall apply to an order under this subsection.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1343" /> (3)  Where&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) (i) an auctioneer or house agent is adjudicated a bankrupt, files a petition for arrangement, executes a deed of arrangement (within the meaning of section 4 of the Deeds or Arrangement Act, 1887) or dies insolvent, or</P>
    <P>(ii)  a company licensed as an auctioneer or house agent is insolvent and being wound up, and</P>
    <P>(b)  there is, notwithstanding the addition of the sum paid over under subsection (2), a deficiency in the client account or accounts,</P>
    <P>then, notwithstanding any rule of law to the contrary, the sum to the credit of the said client account or, where the auctioneer or house agent has kept two or more client accounts, the total of the sums to the credit of those accounts, shall (after the addition thereto of the sum paid over under subsection (2)) be divisible proportionately amongst the clients of the auctioneer or house agent according to the respective sums received by the auctioneer or house agent in the course of his business on behalf of his clients and remaining due by him to them.</P>
    <P>(4)  A person, other than the Official Assignee, who is entitled and proposes to apply to the High Court under subsection (1) may before such application and by motion ex parte apply to the Court for an order prohibiting the payment of any money out of the deposit or, in a case where the deposit consists of a guarantee bond, from money made available by the assurance company concerned on foot of the bond, pending the hearing of the application under subsection (1), and the Court may, if it thinks fit, order accordingly.</P>
    <P>(5)  For the purpose of this section a person who has paid money to an auctioneer or house agent by way of deposit in the circumstances specified in section 5 (10) (b) shall, where the client has not acquired a right to the money, be deemed to be a client on <Col N="1344" /> whose behalf the auctioneer or house agent has received the money.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>This amendment is, in part, consequential on the preceding one but it also sets out, in some more detail than is provided in the existing section 7, the procedure to be adopted in order to get money from the deposit in the event of bankruptcy. It also makes it quite clear&mdash;this is probably the existing law but it is no harm to spell it out&mdash;that in a case where the deposit is more than sufficient to cover the deficiency in a client account, the costs connected with the application will be a charge against the deposit and not deducted from what is due to clients.  Otherwise, we would have the situation that, even though the deposit is there to protect clients against loss, we could have money uncalled on in the deposit while the clients were being paid less than what was due to them.</P>

      <P>The section as it stands requires that an accountant's certificate when presented to the court must not be more than three months out of date.  I had representations that a three-month interval would be too short.  In criticising the period the objectors stressed that while appreciating that an out of date certificate loses much of its value, some reasonable period must be specified.  A period of six months was suggested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What we are seeking to achieve in <Col N="1345" /> the amendment is that there will be reasonable time but not too much. The Bill as introduced had a period of three months with the proviso that it could be extended by Ministerial Order.  I felt we should give the three month period a trial but the representations made to me led me to the conclusion that such a period would be inadequate.  I, therefore, recommend a period of six months.</P>

      <P>The main point in this amendment is the proposal that the Minister may by regulation prescribe the nature and extent of the examination to be made by an accountant.</P>
      <P>Originally, I felt that the question of the nature and extent of the accountant's examination could be left to be decided in accordance with recognised practices amongst accountants. Obviously an accountant cannot check everything.  Equally obviously, a reputable accountant will carry out a certain minimum of test-checks, spot-checks or whatever one wishes to call them.</P>
      <P>On further consideration, however, I came to the conclusion that that was not really sufficient in the present context. We are dealing here, not with the usual, conventional type of accountant's certificate, but with a very special type of certificate required to be presented to a Court for a particular statutory purpose.  I think it is a distinct possibility that difficulties of interpretation might arise: occasionally, perhaps, we might have accountants doing only a very casual kind of check but, what I would think may be a more practical problem, we might have some accountants feeling that, for a statutory certificate of this kind, something close to a complete check of every transaction might be needed.</P>

      <P>Subsection (5) reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this section &ldquo;accountant&rdquo; means a person (not being the applicant <Col N="1348" /> or a partner or employee of the applicant) possessing such qualifications (which may be described by reference to membership of a professional organisation) as may be prescribed, for the purposes of this section, by order of the Minister.</P>
    <P>We feel that this is perhaps a duplication of the service.  I feel it would be unfair of the House if it were now to include this particular subsection which would, in fact, mean that a chartered accountant would have to get a special certificate of competency from the Minister for Justice to examine the books of auctioneers and if he were to work for the ordinary companies he would have to have a certificate of competency from the Minister for Industry and Commerce under section 162 of the Companies Act, 1963.  This is something that is completely unnecessary and as the Minister in the last amendment got power to prescribe exactly the type of certificate he wants we should, I feel, delete this subsection.  At least, I would ask the Minister to look at it before Report Stage to ensure that the accountants will not be burdened with having to go to a different Department to take on every second job.  I feel that section 162 of the Companies Act, 1963 should meet the Minister's case in this regard.  I would ask the Minister to look at this more closely before Report Stage and see if subsection (5) could be deleted.</P>

      <P Just="Center">SECTION 12.</P>
      <P>Government amendment No. 15:</P>
      <P>Before section 12, to insert the following new section:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;This Act, other than sections 1 to 4, section 10, this section and section 12, shall not apply or have effect in relation to the auctioning in a public market of vegetables, potatoes, fruit, flowers, poultry, eggs <Col N="1349" /> or other primary products (not including horses, cattle, sheep or pigs) of agriculture or horticulture.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment arises from representations made to me on behalf of the auctioneers in the Dublin Corporation Fruit and Vegetable Market.</P>
      <P>Their problem is, first of all, that, at a busy time, any one of them may have perhaps 50 or more clients supplying produce for sale on a particular day and, at the same time, the produce is likely to be sold to several times that number of customers. Accordingly, there can be a very big number of relatively small transactions. However, an even more serious problem for those concerned is that only a small proportion of the produce on any particular day may be auctioned, the rest being disposed of in private sales on a commission basis. Any given supplier may have perhaps 10 per cent of his produce auctioned and the rest sold privately by the auctioneer; conversely, any given customer, if as is usual he is a shopkeeper buying for re-sale, is liable to buy some produce at the auction and to buy more later, privately, from the auctioneer.  Neither the producer nor the auctioneer nor the customer is concerned with whether business was transacted in the auction or privately: the producer is concerned with what he gets for his consignment and the purchaser&mdash;the shopkeeper&mdash;pays for the day's purchases in a single payment. It has been urged on me, and I may say that I accept it, that it would be practically impossible and that it is quite unnecessary in this kind of market to segregate auction transactions from others and to subject the auction part of the business to the requirement of keeping special client accounts.  Accordingly I recommend this amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment is quite reasonable and, indeed, it represents the very practical attitude of the Minister right through this Bill. The co-operation he has given and received especially in relation to the <Col N="1350" /> people directly concerned, the auctioneers, is certainly to be commended and I think the legislation will be all the better for that.  This particular section is a very wise one because the difficulty in the Bill if it were left in would be that it would be impossible to keep accounts especially in the Dublin markets.  However, I should like to ask the Minister if he thinks that two months is adequate for the auctioneers to get their books and the new system that some of them must embark on in line and if he is satisfied that this is a fair time limit.</P>

      <P>I gave certain guarantees to Senator McDonald in regard to looking into matters between now and Report Stage but I had been thinking in the context of Report Stage being the last chance in the Seanad.  I shall have ample time to look into those matters during the various stages of debate in the Dáil, which puts a different perspective on the whole thing.  I will certainly look at the matters Senator McDonald has dealt with between now and Committee Stage in the Dáil and have further discussions with the professional bodies concerned and I can bring in any appropriate amendments <Col N="1351" /> at Committee Stage in the Dáil so perhaps the House might allow me Report Stage now.</P>
